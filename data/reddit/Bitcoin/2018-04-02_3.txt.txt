0	1522672270	15	This is good for bitcoin
0	1522669328	21	Good news. Nothing has changed fundamentals wise, we just got too big too fast. We will be back!
1	1522677969	6	Even better, the world is legalizing bitcoin. For many years there were fears of banning
0	1522676199	4	This may be the best time to invest in crypto due to the low prices
1	1522681202	1	Except no one has any idea what low prices are. 
2	1522687049	1	Lower than they were in December.
3	1522687277	1	And insanely higher than they were for 80% of their existence. When your value is tied to a technology, "low" prices are anyone's guess. 
4	1522687380	1	If it hit 15-19K before there's a chance it will again - at least by the next halving, providing Bitcoin is healthy. 
5	1522687858	1	> If it hit 15-19K before there's a chance it will again This statement means literally nothing. It was also once worth .001.
6	1522687964	1	And yours is sophistry. Look at a nine year chart, that will give my argument context.
7	1522689271	1	If your argument is "past performance predicts future gains" then I don't know what to tell you. 
8	1522689786	1	I didn't predict anything. I said there was a good chance. >I don't know what to tell you.You can give me a better argument than it will go to .001. There's 0 chance of that happening. There are die hard Bitcoiners who will never sell even if it just becomes useless.
9	1522690038	1	> You can give me a better argument than it will go to .001. I never said that unless you don't understand how comparisons work.> There's 0 chance of that happening. Oh boy.> There are die hard Bitcoiners who will never sell even if it just becomes useless.Oh my sweet jesus. Have a nice day.
1	1522683341	1	Some say that the markets may soon have a near-death experience due to all the stuff going on. Mt.Gox's case, hedge funds, crazy buyers... At any moment, these guys may feel insecure and flood the markets. But I personally believe that this will be a "near-death" experience, meaning, prices will go down, but the cryptos themselves, will not die
0	1522676808	3	In 1929 Groucho Marx asked his broker how it could be that the stock market was going up all the time and why it should be so. He was told that the buyers market was global now. Adoption rates of speculative stock offerings did not translate to a booming economy, it came to crash it. It took lots or intervention and regulation to ever allow stocks to function safely in the consumer economy. This is still the wild West days of crypto commodities anyway you look at it. 
0	1522678077	1	Japan and SK always ahead of rest of the world in terms of adopting new tech. though its good news. 
0	1522687028	1	Vendor adoption is not really important for Bitcoin.
0	1522689916	1	>number one 1 retailer Bic cameraEr.... No
0	1522691169	1	I would love to be able to read this site but it always pops up an ad in the middle that I can't find any way to close.
0	1522691730	1	>The company is taking payments in the digital currency through a partnership with domestic bitcoin exchange bitFlyer, which it uses to convert bitcoin into yen upon acceptance.I guess all the people mad at BitPay still haven't learned their lesson about what accepting bitcoin actually means.
0	1522685513	1	wtf do you mean "price slump".BTC is still up seven-fold in a year and this is somehow a price slump?
1	1522686533	1	I think it's pretty obvious that he is referring to the 70% correction we've had in the past 4 months.
2	1522689306	1	I always found it odd that people choose to reference the peak, most unstable price point in the entire history to describe a "correction".
3	1522690030	1	"A correction is a reverse movement, usually negative, of at least 10% in a stock, bond, commodity or index to adjust for an overvaluation."Quite literally the definition of a correction.
4	1522690175	1	I'm bullish on Bitcoin, but the lack of common sense in these boards is frustrating.
1	1522690875	1	So if it btc went to $50 it still wouldn't be a price slump because it started at half a penny? 
2	1522691625	1	Actually BTC started at 0, so any price above 0 is infinitely larger than 0.0 x 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 = 0So no matter what bitcoins value is, so long as it is above 0 you are up 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000x from the start.This is what makes bitcoin so revolutionary. even if it drops 99.999999% it is still worth billions of times more than it was 10 years ago.
