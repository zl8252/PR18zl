0	1522658866	3	The naturally fragmented nature of Bitcoin exchanges create a lot of bot-trading opportunities for people with big sums of money. One with a deep pocket can sway order books quite easily due to the fragmented liquidity, there are a lot of saw-tooth patterns which do not look organic to me. (These happen regardless of bear or bull markets)
