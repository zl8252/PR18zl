1	1522664877	31	How can they talk? WhatsApp and facebook didnâ€™t work. 
2	1522668933	13	I thought we deleted those last week?
3	1522690747	1	ya ya, but then mom snapchatted to ask us why we wouldn't talk to her anymore.
3	1522676677	0	WhatsApp has encryption.  Can't lump with deleting Facebook.  
4	1522679269	1	I think it was more about not giving facebook/whatsapp revenue
1	1522666585	3	can you believe that? There is a much better life without wifi
2	1522666713	2	Ridiculous! Mamma warned about the nutters on reddit... via messenger. 
1	1522666588	6	I'm pretty old school. Don't use FB, Snap, Telegram, etc. Just the occasional txt message is about adventurous as I get. My point is, is that i'm finding it increasingly hard to find anyone who is capable of normal conversations. You know the face to face type. 
2	1522676586	4	> "normal conversations"Sorry to let you know at this stage of life, but that's a moving target.  Your choices are to keep up or go Amish.
3	1522677542	0	I'll probably go Amish then. Not really watched TV for a few years, can't stand modern messaging apps.I take you point about normal being subjective I just find it hard to make a connection with people who can't hold a face to face conversation.
2	1522679858	1	Get on a cruise. People were so outgoing and nice. It's the shy ones that let loose and really came out of their skin. Even saw a few fedoras and cargo shorts. By the end of the week, even the few neckbeards I saw made a mob of friends.
3	1522687747	1	I've met some very interesting folks on cruises as well. The most memorable was an elderly retired couple, who were clearly very wealthy, who basically \*lived\* on cruise ships. They spent their days cruising around the Carribbean chatting with honeymooners, buying them drinks and recounting anecdotes of their lives together. Not a bad way to spend your twilight years :)
4	1522691663	1	Thanks, now I finally know what I'm gonna do when I get old
1	1522679726	1	Talked to all the people! Made new friends and had a lot of laughs. It wasn't what I expected at all. Very friendly and not trashy at all.
1	1522691281	1	Dangerous things can erupt from such an interaction, like friendship. I hope he was careful. 
1	1522673533	0	How shitty can be a cruise without wifi
2	1522681858	1	They all have wifi but it's slow as balls and costs a ton. Fortunately I can bill my customers for it because they're the ones forcing me to remain available. Also all the cruise ships I've been on use outdated captive portals, so it's pretty trivial to get around that and use it for free via DNS tunneling or ARP spoofing or whatever.
0	1522647241	13	Congrats but yeah, it's a bear market so be strong and HODL because it could drop some more...r/21MClub
0	1522646214	3	Congrats bro :)
0	1522653883	3	I love the feeling when my low orders being filled. 
0	1522666565	3	I think we will revisit 6k and maybe a bit lower but 7k is a good price
0	1522646160	4	Congratulations mate ! Welcome to the 1BTC club 
0	1522666011	2	"I accidentally the whole Bitcoin"
0	1522644296	4	>I hope it doesn't drop any more.Hope doesn't belong in investing as that's what it sounds like your reasoning for buying a bitcoin was. Look at the chart and ask yourself if you are buying more right now, or if you think it's likely to leg down again. If it's the latter sell it, if it's the former hold or buy some more. But don't just "hope" it does something in your favor. That's what caused people to get burned hoping it'd "just go back up to 18k."
1	1522669340	2	It will drop more and gain as well 
1	1522683333	1	So your whole argument is donâ€™t just hope, look at a chart and think? Doesnâ€™t sound a whole lot different than hoping?  Both are speculation. 
1	1522678878	1	Indeed
0	1522651037	2	Congrats man, iâ€™m happy for you. From a trading standpoint, Iâ€™m waiting for $5.8k before Iâ€™m touching this dumpster fire again
1	1522678271	1	Lol dumpster fire? Are you talking about the alts? Bruh, just 6 months ago I was in shock at what price it was. Shit, even last may I told my buddy he was bat shit crazy for saying it will be above $4k by the end of 2017. Lol clamn down.

0	1522661964	1	Oasis of the seas by chance?
0	1522676112	1	Thank you for your service.
0	1522678140	1	I hope it does drop more. I want more. Sure it will hurt, but I'm already dead set on not selling. So for me, getting down to the $2k range would be just A ok with with me. Even a 2 years of not much action would be great as well. Hell, I might even be able to join the 21 club. 
0	1522683832	1	How are you liking the 1% fee from gemini? 
0	1522684397	1	Congrats! Continue to be offline, makes it easier to hold! 
0	1522685166	1	I was on a cruise back in 2014 the week that Russia invaded Crimea. We were at sea for two days and then when we arrived at St. Thomas we got wifi and realized the world map changed. We were like "WE'RE GONE FOR THREE FREAKING DAYS AND THE RUSSIANS ARE WAGING WAR?". That was otherwise a fun week. 
0	1522691308	1	Congrats!  You'll definitely remember this when Bitcoin prices soar!
0	1522691354	1	Walmart sells hand bandages for $5.99
0	1522653363	-4	Fairytales 2.0Who ever thought that a byproduct of bitcoin will be an endless stream or fantasy stories. Ideas on how you can keep this BS story going:If Bitcoin drops to 5k tomorrow, you can post:"I loved the cruise so much that I am going again and I got out of that 7k coin at $6995 right before I boarded the ship".If Bitcoin goes to 10k tomorrow"I was so excited that my order was filled at 7k that as soon as I got home I got another 50 bitcoins at $6800".I figured you must be so tired from that cruise and you have so much catching up to do, that I would help with the next chapters in the story book. Hopefully someone appreciates my work and they hire and pay me in bitcoin.Edit:I just got an offer to write fairy tales, the guy wants to pay me in bitcoin but using the conversion of 4 years ago! Just checked my account, he sent me 1500 bitcoins! Please send me a link to that cruise, I can finally afford it and will even drive to the ship in my lambo.
1	1522677188	4	Of all these flavors u choose to be saltyðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜›
1	1522679529	1	This one is true though. But I do recommend going on a cruise and being disconnected for a week. People were so friendly and made a lot of new friends and let loose. Does wonders for the soul. Give it a go!
2	1522680063	1	sounds fucking terrible
1	1522653572	5	I already sold my bitcoins and paid for the college and bought a car and a house
2	1522678337	1	Sorry for your furture loss. I will suffer for another 5 - 10 years for something greater. 
0	1522648146	-15	Congrats You overpaid for BTC But if your happy then.....
1	1522649583	14	you're
2	1522657664	1	I'm
1	1522678438	1	Clearly OP is here to obtain as much BTC as he can. He set a goal, he achived it. But here you are being an asshole about it. My only goal with my money is to obtain as much Bitcoin as I can, reasonably. It sounds like OP is doing the same thing. Congrats OP, don't listen to these idiots like this. 
2	1522679635	1	Nope. Just wanted to share my story as it's the first time I was mostly offline for a week. I feel cleansed and besides the order going through, I didn't miss anything important on any social media or such. Get on a boat, get the drink package and socialize. People were very nice and had a blast!
