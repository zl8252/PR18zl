0	1522720605	51	it was $100k, then $50k, now $25k?
1	1522720818	17	I think he has made 2018 and 2019 predictions at this point. I think his 2018 has been 25-40k by year end.
2	1522747163	3	he also predicted around 35k in july.
3	1522750792	4	It can be 35k in july, 80k in september and 120k at the end of a year, it could slowly bleed to 1k until end of a year. Both scenarios shoudnt surprise anyone...
3	1522749423	1	when/where? From what I heard, he predicts to get to previous ATH (20k) by july and then at some point move up during the rest of 2018.Of course, imho, this is just a random prediction it could go to 50$ or to 50.000$
1	1522741095	3	Check and track out Tom Less predictions here: http://bitcoin-price-prediction-tracker.info/tom-lee/
1	1522724313	1	It was 7k just 6 months ago, and today, it's still 7k. In 6 months, it will be 7.5k
2	1522726952	3	I will bet you a large amount of money that it will not be $7.5K in six months.I don't have a prediction where it will be. All I know is that it is highly unlikely to be at any specific given number (that goes for $25K too). I think it would be even more improbable for it to stabilize.
3	1522739227	4	>All I know is that it is highly unlikely to be at any specific given numberHoly shit are you a genius?
4	1522739916	9	No, but since there are scores of people willing to upvote a "year-end target of $25K" then I get points for at least not being retarded. 
3	1522727330	1	I'll bet you .01 that it's within 50 % of 7178 by 10/2/2018
0	1522724417	53	When will you all learn, predictions mean absolutely nothing. These posts are all the same shit with different numbers lmfao
1	1522731933	8	Then so do your dismissals.
2	1522755497	11	Fair enough, it’s just kind of pointless to have about 17 posts a day about price predictions for 2018 that have basically no merit behind them and it’s just someone spouting numbers. 
1	1522730821	4	This 
1	1522765064	1	Are you predicting that these predictions will mean nothing? 
2	1522768824	1	Of course not, that would be stupid of me considering there’s been a prediction of every price point. Someone will be right. All I’m saying is there is no point posting these articles claiming any price. 
1	1522770049	1	Very.. very very very incorrect.  It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.. 
0	1522721492	8	> In a note written by Lee on 28 April...sharp stuff.
0	1522739400	4	25k ? I was promised 100k 
0	1522723469	14	I’m going to be realistic and say $2500 by July
1	1522725470	5	You dropped a zero
2	1522726399	48	$02500
1	1522773894	1	Good luck.
0	1522721926	17	Here's my prediction. $4400 within a couple of weeks to a month.
1	1522723854	2	That would be sweet!!!
2	1522728613	3	I’ll buy
3	1522777940	1	No that's exactly when you DON'T BUY!If everyone stops buying the price will drop even more so you can hoard even more!
1	1522729732	1	Not going to happy. Asian markets are starting to buy pretty heavy and only increasing. US banks and investment groups are working on investment options and we'll start to probably see those coming into play by the end of the year. Buy em' while they're cheap. 
1	1522773952	1	Your prediction seems so reasonable it's probably not what's going to happen. 
0	1522726037	3	It all depends when will BTC go back to the near ATH vicinity. It took slightly more than a month to easily triple from 6k on November last year, if BTC can largely recover by late 2018, I wouldn't be surprised that it shoots above 50K by end of this year.I think 2018 is gonna suck though. Hate to say it :'( 
0	1522726121	5	Tom Lee's prediction is off by 100K
1	1522737254	5	Mcafee's dick dining prediction/wager is the only one that matters.
1	1522731451	0	I dont think itll finish the year that high.  I think itll hit that high, but not finish that high.  
0	1522730137	6	Hmmm... which would I believe, some bloke on reddit, or a guy that is managing partner of Fundstrat and has been ranked as one of the top institutional investors (aka whales) since 1998. 
0	1522719257	15	Hodl strong brothers. Don't let the fake news swindle you out of your precious bitcoins 
1	1522719898	6	Yes, but also don't invest more than you're willing to lose
2	1522720420	13	I'm willing to die on this ship. For 99.9% of us crypto is the only way out of wage slavery 
3	1522722676	22	this isn't a get rich quick scheme to not have to work...
4	1522723979	24	bitconnnnneeeeeeeeccccctttttt
5	1522740148	2	you handle says it all buddy
4	1522726623	7	For a lot of people, it is. For some it's a lottery ticket. For others its a revolution.I'll say this much about it--it's one weird-ass thing.
3	1522746894	2	Bitcoin isn’t a get rich quick scheme, bitcoin is needed to be traded, a form of payment more than an asset to hold on to. 
3	1522721586	3	It's correct term is Crypt Currency 
3	1522724552	0	lol, reminds me of [beanies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgDsyj5eLmo)
4	1522724801	8	I'm willing to die on this ship. For 99.9% of us beanie babies is the only way out of wage slavery.
4	1522726818	2	Weirdly enough, [there's still a market](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313.TR12.TRC2.A0.H0.Xbeanie+babies.TRS0&_nkw=beanie+babies&_sacat=0). Not what it once was, but there are a few selling for thousands of dollars on there.
4	1522725034	0	Anyone else cringe to this comment? Comparing an immutable, PoW decentralized, global, capped store of wealth to beanie babies. Top kek
5	1522730770	3	Those who don't understand Bitcoin can't really see the difference.  Educate them.
3	1522760971	1	This is what delusion looks like. 
4	1522763495	0	Yawwnnnn
3	1522725648	0	I prefer going down to vegas and putting everything on 13 black. 
1	1522720837	0	Fake news ... this is trumps favourite defence
2	1522721201	4	Do you have a point? Corporate media does not serve the public; I would have thought most Americans would have learned after all the illegal wars 
3	1522721573	0	Your claim is fake news. U see how this works?Its easy to dismiss as fake news...cnn etc
0	1522724273	2	Did he see that 6 months ago, it was exactly the same spot as today? So, 6 months from now it's going to go up to $25k? That's great odds! 
0	1522733388	2	This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://bitcoinnews.com/tom-lee-says-hodl-bitcoin-year-end-target-stays-25000/) reduced by 73%. (I'm a bot)*****> Bitcoin proponent and former chief equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Tom Lee, has recently encouraged Bitcoin traders to hold their coins despite its loss of 40% value so far this year.> Considering the majority of Bitcoin market gains are condensed into a small number of days each year, Lee recommends that holding is the most potentially profitable option.> The predictions from Fundstrat may well encourage many to HODL, the now infamous typo of a frantic trader&#039;s appeal to hold on to Bitcoin, that has become the mantra of Bitcoin enthusiasts.*****[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/89a6v4/tom_lee_says_hodl_bitcoin_as_yearend_target_stays/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ "Version 2.00, ~304635 tl;drs so far.") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr "PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.") | *Top* *keywords*: **Bitcoin**^#1 **Lee**^#2 **hold**^#3 **market**^#4 **year**^#5
0	1522736658	2	$100k $5k $600k Who the fuck knows, nobody. It's totally random.
1	1522774021	1	It won't be in the hundreds of thousands. It's not that random.
0	1522738167	2	oh, ok then.
0	1522759222	2	nothing surprises. price from 7k to 20k in a month. anything happen is possible.
0	1522763377	2	25k easy
0	1522722031	5	60k low, low, low target. After 20k, bull kicks in and ignites fomo. I expect an 85k pedestrian price.
1	1522722498	1	In two years or so
2	1522725125	1	We want million dollar bitcoins by then! 
3	1522734669	2	But I wanna see McAfee eat his dick on national television :(
4	1522764486	1	Lol that's just marketing garbage 
0	1522718900	4	We can only hope.
0	1522720301	3	buy stock in Lambos as well then
0	1522721780	3	Tom appears to be basing future gains on past performance.
1	1522724660	6	Whereas he should be basing future gains on future gains..
1	1522729707	3	U do realize that discounting history, ull be in in random walk theory land, and at its purest form, u can basically invest in anything at anytime cos the price is always efficient which means u can't predict in any way... Btw, I'm just stating that, if u believe in that, that's up too... bottom line, were all running on assumptions and belief in the markets.  
2	1522732526	2	Well, you can discount history, and you can discount *some* history. You'll of course get greatly varying results.So, do you include all history, or some history? Is some history more pertinent than other history? Can you even leave out some history *within* a range? Of course you could *weight* those factors, perhaps even as a variable over time. What factors decide whether to do that, or not? They could be factors like a hack, sentimental factors like an arbitrary number being reached, technical advances, legal precedents, wars, competition... and on and on and on. A bottomless list of variables all affecting each other and affected by another endless list of variables.Without doing any of that you're just drawing a straight fucking line through the middle.
3	1522733595	2	And that's the reason why I always say that were all running on assumptions and beliefs here on the markets...
2	1522732969	1	I believe in that theory! Investing is so easy as the only thing I need to do is diversify.
0	1522746683	1	I love the typo in the article along with a price prediction without any sort of reasoning to back it up at all. Seems legit.
0	1522752970	1	Does he like his dick grilled or boiled?
0	1522758838	1	Only the time shows. Now is better to trade with currencies like stellar eos or credits from my point of view.
0	1522763812	1	It’s all a dream 
0	1522766372	1	blogspam 
0	1522770693	1	is it too late, now?
0	1522779150	1	Just a question, did any of these master predictors predict the massive price spike several months ago?
0	1522724867	0	It's a joke, it's absolutely impossible!
1	1522731532	2	lol.  Of all the things that are impossible, bitcoin getting 25% above its peak in 8 months is not one of them.  
1	1522730968	1	Why is $25K impossible?
0	1522725547	0	Is he psychic or is he relying on self-fulfilling prophecy? 
1	1522729889	1	Btw, if ur referring as TA as self fulfilling... then all you need to do is look at a couple of TA users and all of them have different ways of looking at the market.. so if everyone has different views, how can it be self fulfilling?
2	1522736251	2	Thousands of bots creating an exponentially expanding TA hive mind doesn't seem far fetched. It's likely that this is already happening. 
3	1522736662	1	Thousands of TA bots doesn't count unless all of them buy or sell at the same time... if they do so, the action can also be seen on the charts, which opens up for a counterplay... so no...
4	1522751468	2	Eventually, the bots will battle.  Plays will be counterplayed and those will be played and on and on...  One day the plays and counterplays will reach a stalemate and bitcoin will flatline, never wavering.  It's a bot controlled lottery and everyone's playing to win.  Holders cross their fingers while hoping the bot's numbers align and they hit the jackpot. The end.   
1	1522749594	1	I saw a great video of Tom lee explaining why. Look it up. He does have his reasons.
0	1522751271	0	Is bitcoin is really dead ? I am really too much afraid about these kind of news. because I bought 3 bitcoin when it was $16k. Please suggest and support me I am really afraid.
1	1522764529	2	forget about it for 2-3 yearsat least, and hodl. It will be at at least 32k in 3 years. It could be 500k+ in 3 years as well. Bitcoin is way past the point where it can die. It has hundreds of thousands of rabid fans. Keep your btc secure in a hardware wallet, and educate yourself about the technology. You are very lucky to own 3. Most people will never own 0.1. 
0	1522724532	-2	$15k I believe that ,25K is not very realistic
1	1522725567	4	You must be new here
1	1522730061	2	$25k is very possible. I'm not sure it will hold at $25k but I would expect run ups and crashes for the next few years.
