1	1522724799	8	Exactly, direct translation is "coin of the future"
2	1522725470	2	Cool! That’s awesome to see this in other countries. American main stream media has been doing everything it can to try and demonize crypto, especially bitcoin
3	1522734069	2	TIL California is not in the US.
4	1522734170	3	Is that where this is from? I didn’t even look. I just assumed it was a Spanish speaking country because, you know, it’s in Spanish 
5	1522748286	1	Well the name of the newspaper indicates that its targeted for a specific demographic.
6	1522756346	1	Latino does not mean Latin-American though 
1	1522755394	1	I think the name of the paper is "The Latin" I also see "Page 16-17" on there. We'll have this whole thing translated in no time!
1	1522774412	1	How did you guessed tha
0	1522721316	5	California?
1	1522732739	3	Yes more precise in the Ventura County
0	1522755108	4	A free gazette is hardly a "newspaper".
0	1522727101	1	That repost though
0	1522737176	1	Uno moneda por favor.
1	1522743196	1	Si señor ahorita se la mando
0	1522742769	1	Cool cover of the magazine - such a printed edition of the bad does not put on the cover!
0	1522753326	1	Good to see this! An awareness of crypto currencies is spreading out now that could advantage digital money !I'm glad because I'm fond of Crypto Money!
0	1522755945	1	It's a lot cheaper for illegal aliens to send money back to Mexico with Bitcoin than with Western Union.
1	1522768509	1	> It's a lot cheaper for illegal aliens to send money back to Mexico with Bitcoin than with Western Union.You may be interested to learn that the same savings apply to legal immigrants who want to send money to their families abroad. In fact, Western Union and Bitcoin have the same relative costs even for native-born citizens. This must come as a shock to you.Unless you already knew that, in which case I wonder why you felt the need to inject the subject of illegal aliens into this conversation.
2	1522771773	1	Im in Europe and it costs me around 50 eur to send money to Mexico... Bitcoin is cheaper.... 
0	1522770623	1	the title says it well.
0	1522720559	1	That’s awesome! Wait until the everyday person gets genuinely interested in crypto... that’s when the market is going to see exponential growth (not like it hasn’t yet lol)!! 
0	1522744001	0	This is exactly it. Yes, it *is* the coin of the future. A coin that stops governments taking your money without your consent. This is so obviously the progression for freedom in this World.
1	1522748424	1	I mean a sligth majority of the population is demanding more restrictions from the goverment. So its not obvious that freedom will prevail.
