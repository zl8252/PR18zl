0	1522724837	1959	I've never invested in a charity, what are the returns like? 
1	1522725254	1493	Your returns are in the form of tax deductions
2	1522725347	540	No need for that when you have an offshore Swiss account.
3	1522738661	242	Joke’s on you, Switzerland signed a treaty to release all bank information of people of my nationality to my government  🤪
4	1522740036	108	>  people of my nationalityCare to share that nationality friendo?
5	1522740502	193	Fine... but... don’t tell anyone...I’m from Greece 
6	1522740801	68	I guess that has something to do with the recession. I imagine there were more than a few wealthy Greeks moving their cash offshore to protect their assets during the crash. Can't say I wouldn't do the same thing in their position. I'd imagine that treaty has been wildly unpopular with the elite. 
7	1522743686	58	It has nothing to do with Greece's recession. It's the same with every EU country, all 28 of them since 2018, Switzerland has to automatically exchange banking data with these countries,  who do the same.
8	1522750998	9	Switzerland isn't apart of the European Union, So why would they have to abide by the EU's banking laws?
9	1522751148	25	Because all the countries around pressured them into it? 
9	1522751093	45	I'm a frenchman living in Switzerland \( but full disclosure, I'm poor :\) \). It's been all over the news for the last 2\-3 years. You can google it. The EU pressured Switzerland to release potential tax evaders' names and account information. For instance, french fiscal residents had something like a year to declare their swiss accounts. This law ended Swiss Banking Secrecy. If you want a way around it, you have to move to Switzerland.And there is NO CAPITAL GAINS TAX in Switzerland. Your crypto gains are 100&#37; your money.
9	1522765016	3	Switzerland also gets some of the benefits of the EU,  and so they follow some of the rules.
9	1522755107	6	They're still a part of the single market and has to adopt various EU laws to continue enjoying that privilege. 
9	1522762756	2	They don’t have to comply at all. It’s just that European banks won’t be allowed to transact with Swiss banks. And the Swiss banks on EU soil will have to either close, or be spun off from their parents and also be unable to transact with Swiss banks. 
9	1522751172	1	Treaties
9	1522761209	1	Switzerland is adopting most if not all EU-legislation, because they find most of it advantageous for themselves.
9	1522770268	1	Who said they did? It’s just an info sharing agreement signed with the Union in 2018
9	1522771092	1	All Switzerland is made of bunkers. They also have enough nuclear shelters for 120% of heir population. But they never thought they will be surrounded by European Union, so they just gave up.  They know they have no chance.
8	1522755790	2	Oh that’s interesting. They have been sharing Greece’s information since 2011ish. They caught some big politicians due to this change
6	1522748747	8	Doesn't matter, any country where it is preferable to fill in your swimming pool rather than pay tax has bigger issues than Swiss Bank accounts
6	1522759606	11	**HEY EVERYONE! THIS DUDE'S FROM GREECE!**
7	1522760200	3	Oh great. Just great... now look what you did. You can’t trust anyone over the Internet 
7	1522766898	1	http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/see-nobody-cares
6	1522745173	2	Lol Greece has an economy?

9	1522747681	12	Please tell me how the EU was to blame for Greece's tax system, their pension spending and reckless spending habits. 
9	1522747950	7	your username is extremely accurate The "shithole" EU and its multilateral policies benefited its member states economically through the removal of tariffs and increased free trade. It should hardly be blamed for the total irresponsibility of the greek government with credit from the EU. If you want an actual in depth answer feel free to ask, I am currently majoring in economics and international studies
6	1522742676	1	I'm safe for now.
6	1522752913	1	ha! joke's on you
6	1522758860	1	Shocker, those devious fuckers in government actually wanting to tax the very rich. Finally they get it.
4	1522758512	1	Switzerland has many double taxation and money laundering agreements with multiple countries. I think most EU counties have some sort of agreement with Switzerland and if they ask if you have money in Swiss banks they will have to supply that information.Swiss is not that good place if you want to avoid tax.
5	1522768324	1	Yup. Switzerland is  not a good tax haven anymore. Now it's Cayman Islands, Bahamas, Panama, even the [US](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-12-28/the-u-s-is-becoming-the-world-s-new-tax-haven) 
6	1522769883	1	Yes thats true. But if you are a poor chump you head for Afrcia. Mauritius has no agreements with anybody and your capital gains wont be taxed at all. No visa required for EU citizens at least. Rent a place open a bank account.Other one is Vanuatu just for something like 20 000usd you get a passport (second citizenship) and you can pay all your taxes there. Also no CGT there.
3	1522725647	19	Yea, but then you need to file an FBAR with your taxes. Kind of a pain.
4	1522738607	8	Only need to file the FBAR if you are over $10,000. Also, don't the Swiss have nameless debit cards and promote privacy?
5	1522743506	11	Lmfao why would you even have an offshore account with less than $10,000
6	1522746918	3	Be creative. 
6	1522766331	1	To impress chicks, duh.
4	1522760389	2	FBAR filing is pretty easy... probably takes 15 minutes to complete once a year.
4	1522742075	2	And a better society. 
3	1522727155	3	Don't you mean Swiss?
3	1522748734	3	When people talk about hiding money in swiss accounts it’s pretty much a guarantee they aren’t hiding money, at least not hiding it well.Nobody uses swiss banks for privacy anymore, the war on terror fucked that up
4	1522761158	2	Out of curiosity, what kind of banks are we talking about if one would want to hide their money? 
5	1522764585	3	Panama, Seychelles, Hong Kong, Singapore all fly under the radar better than Switzerland.
3	1522733253	2	You asked and you received.
3	1522754059	0	 > No need for that when you have an offshore Swiss accountif the point is to hide your wealth, bitcoin is the answer. why you need a swiss account ?
4	1522764700	2	Because Bitcoin is volatile and these people are putting away money that can't lose 30% of its value overnight
2	1522738528	25	It’s not a return, you lose $10k...There’s no benefit, it’s just reducing your salary by 10k.And of course you don’t have have to pay tax on money you don’t earn. The only benefit of a tax deduction is if it’s used for stuff you would’ve bought/invested in regardless.
3	1522745202	29	But that's not how you do it, you can't do tax fraud with cash donations.You spend $1 million building a home, then get your buddy to value the property at 5 million. Then you donate the home to the charity and put 5 million as a tax deduction. So instead of paying (50% of 5 mill) 2.5 million dollars in tax, it only costs you the 1million you used to build the house. The charity can't sell the property for 5 mill, they only get 1 mill for it. But they dont mind because it's still free money for them, so they wont run to the IRS about it.You are happy because you save 1.5 mill in tax. Your buddy is happy because he gets a fee and maybe even a percentage of the sale as the real estate agent. The charity is happy because they get 1 mill from the sale. But the government and the rest of the public aren't happy because you just cheated them out of 2.5 million that probably should have gone towards things like schools and fixing roads.
4	1522746579	15	There's also the one I would do.Instead of giving your child money, you set up a non profit, put them in charge, donate, and they get paid a salary but you get an income deduction in that amount.
5	1522754991	3	Fthat is a tremendous idea...I wish my parents were that "outside the box" raising me...
5	1522767268	1	When they get paid salary there is a tax on the labor. One can't simply pay salary without the tax burden on it.It make sense only when the taxes on salaries are less than taxes on your income you donate to the foundation.
6	1522769678	1	You don't seem to understand the tax liabilities my scheme avoids.I give 10 million dollars to my non-dependant child.  It was taxed as income when i "earned" it, It is taxed as income for them because they received it, and I even get hit with a U.S. gift tax because it exceeds my lifetime exemption of 5.49 million.Or I donate it to "The Kenkenkenken Jr. Rabies Awareness Fund". I don't pay taxes on it, my child's nonprofit can invest it, and my child draws a salary from it, paying someone else to do the bare minimum to keep KJRAF a 501(c)3.
5	1522770147	1	This is retarded. You know that right? Giving money to a child is not income to the child, but paying them comp from a non-profit is ordinary income to them. Even if the parent nets out their taxes through the contribution, the same amount of tax is paid. Also, there is no need for the charity because the parents could deduct compensation either way.
4	1522745797	2	You lost me at $1 million.
4	1522770256	1	You have to file a qualified appraisal with the deduction, which you’d never be able to obtain. Moreover the charitable donee needs to sign off on the value, which they wouldn’t. This is probably the most simplistic criminal tax fraud I’ve seen reduced to words. Good job.
3	1522740076	2	Like new sunglasses and a hat. Gotta be sun smart when you're working outside friends. 
2	1522752240	18	Not even close.A proper "charity" provides a hand up, which has benefits to society over all and ultimately leads the recipient not just to self-sufficiency but to success such that he becomes the next donor-class.House the homeless to save a buck.Los Angeles spends over $100k per homeless person each year "processing" them in and out of jail.  You could rent them an apartment for about $12k/yr.  That's real profit.
3	1522755380	9	This is a viable start to a solution, trouble is, a large portion of the working and middle class *hate* homeless. The problem is so out of control and the stigmas of mental illness and drug addiction are so that its unlikely the situation can garner sympathy for those who have written off the homeless as sub-human after watching their neighborhoods deteriorating as more transients are about.
4	1522763827	4	This is why things like assistance for the homeless, free education, and healthcare need to be better presented as the cost savings initiatives they are, rather than expensive charity.
5	1522767897	1	ok, but when do I get my free house, education, and healthcare.... literally my three biggest expenses. 
6	1522769595	1	Become homeless. Throw in some debilitating mental conditions. Then you can live in the same luxury and try to take advantage of free education. Prison cell housing, medical conditions that significantly reduced quality of life and life span. And you're missing the point that it's actually less of a tax burden to you to provide that programming. 
5	1522774267	1	Id love all my shit for free too.
4	1522766965	1	UK here.  Sometimes we offer them a house to live in, but they don't want it because it's not in their local area and away from the prime begging spots where only the 0.05% can afford to buy.
3	1522760395	5	And then shockingly, creatures who are dependent on resources to survive and will expend the minimum possible effort to acquire them, will decide that not working and getting a free place to stay (rent being one of the larger expenses a person incurs regularly) is a better deal, so your "real profit" ends up decimating productivity and economic output while almost certainly costing taxpayers *more* in the long run.No, homeless people should be helped, but that help should come with strings attached.
4	1522765381	2	That's a very pessimistic view of human nature and motivation.There are a small number of people who are happy with the minimum amount possible in life, but generally people want more than that. The most popular product is rarely the cheapest option.
5	1522766187	1	> That's a very pessimistic view of human nature and motivation.I mean, maybe, but I do think it's accurate.  We're animals, not these turbo-exceptional beings that we like to think we are.  Yes, we are the universe experiencing itself - we're also just animals who overthink and eat and poop like the rest of them, and I don't think biologists have *ever* recorded a scenario wherein animals, who come into a surplus of resources, don't then immediately consume those resources and then face famine and death.>There are a small number of people who are happy with the minimum amount possible in life, but generally people want more than that. The most popular product is rarely the cheapest option.Right, but we're not talking about "cheap," we're talking about "free," which we irrationally (or, perhaps *quite* rationally, depending on how you look at it) overvalue.  Like the example of animals over consuming available resources, I would add to that that we have very few experiences of some good or service being artificially priced at below the market rate that doesn't get over consumed.You give *x* million people an option to have free housing, and some of those people simply will avail themselves of that option.  My bet?  An increasing percentage of that population will take it, year after year after year, costing more and more.  Then you have a permanent class of people who get to live for free (supported by people who *don't* get to live for free - where is the fairness in this relationship) and who will protect that economic windfall in the voting booth (entirely rationally, at that).
6	1522768967	1	> overthink and eat and poop like the rest of themI read that "overthink and eat poop like the rest of them"
6	1522769498	1	Simple comparison, you’re in school and you studied hard for a test and got a 90%, little jimmy is dumb as fuck but the teachers feel bad and got together and decided to just give him passing grades on every test no matter what.... how hard are you going to study for the next test? Obviously some kids will want high marks and still study but I’d bet a good percentage would just think “why am I even studying??” And get that passing score for doing literally nothing. I agree with you, free handouts with no strings attached are bad for society, it isn’t “fair” and people WILL take advantage of it.  If I were going to do this rent for the homeless thing it would include bi-weekly drug tests, requirements for seeking out employment, and a 6 month to 1 year maximum stay in free housing.... oh wait now that’s way more expensive than just paying rent, better not do anything at all. And the cycle continues. However I am pretty ignorant with this stuff as my post might suggest to some people so I don’t know, that’s just my opinion on it. 
6	1522770676	1	> I mean, maybe, but I do think it's accurate. We're animals, not these turbo-exceptional beings that we like to think we are. But we generally have motivations other than just providing the most basic shelter and food for ourselves.> I don't think biologists have ever recorded a scenario wherein animals, who come into a surplus of resources, don't then immediately consume those resources and then face famine and death.Lots of animals store food.http://www.punkinafrica.co.za/2014/04/24/10-animals-storage/>  I don't think biologists have ever recorded a scenario wherein animals, who come into a surplus of resources, don't then immediately consume those resources and then face famine and death.Immediately consuming all surplus resources is obviously not what humans do. The average Chinese family saves 28% of their income, the average Indian family 32%. 500 million Indians eat a vegetarian diet. People voluntarily consume less in various ways.I think you're trying to say that the housing supply to the population overall would be in surplus, which I don't think can really be compared to the behaviour of an individual having surplus resources, a single person can't overconsume one apartment. The amount of housing would not be in surplus, it would just be matched to demand, there would be no intention to create more than necessary.> You give x million people an option to have free housing, and some of those people simply will avail themselves of that option.Yes> My bet? An increasing percentage of that population will take it, year after year after year, costing more and more.Not necessarily a bad thing, and I'm certain there would be a limit to the percentage of the population that want to live in government funded accomodation for obvious reasons - many people already own homes, government homes usually have a stigma, relatively low quality, inability to customise, limited styles, limited locations, potentially undesireable neighbours, etc...Government property is never going to satisfy all individual preferences to the same degree as private property, most people want more control over their living spaces than a basic standardised model.So it would be an increasing percentage, up to a certain maximum point, at which time you would have met demand.> Then you have a permanent class of people who get to live for free (supported by people who don't get to live for free - where is the fairness in this relationship)Everyone to some extent receives benefit from government services in some ways, it's not intended to be a reciprocal system. I paid about $38000 in income taxation last year. I walk everywhere, I don't travel by road. I'm not currently receiving government funded education. I haven't been in hospital for 30 years. My work is funding all these things, I benefit indirectly from these things, and directly from other things, I don't personally directly need to derive $38k of benefit for the relationship to be fair.And living in government provided housing wouldn't necessarily preclude you paying an adequate amount into taxation to cover the support of yourself and others.This is all different from your original proposition (was 'free housing = decreased productivity', then 'overconsumption', then 'unfairness'), which you can do, but makes the conversation unfocused.
5	1522773145	1	> That's a very pessimistic view of human nature and motivation.I think this is utterly realistic. About 25% of the people I went to school with have settled in to lives like this. Making it easier/better to live without working would only make the problem worse.Also somehow all these people tend to have bigger TVs than me :/
3	1522761741	2	This presents a tragedy of the commons / extended prisoner's dilemma - type scenario. Even if charity is good for the society overall, nothing guarantees that you (as the person donating) get to rent the apartment. The benefit might go to anybody, or diffusely to everybody. You as the player have little incentive to donate.It's like planting more apple trees to the garden where everybody (including you) gets their fruits from. When you divide the gain by the number of people benefitting, you'll find that your likely gain might not be worth the effort. Even though everybody would benefit if everybody used some of their time to plant more fruit trees. Personal gains != global gains.
3	1522755331	0	Giving them an apartment won't prevent their drug abuse and constant lawbreaking.
4	1522755955	7	All homeless people are law breaking drug addicts?
5	1522756608	-1	According to my friend who manages a homeless shelter in NYC, yes. K2 24/7, and the staff is both complicit and gets constant contact high.Police don't do shit.
6	1522757428	8	I wasn't convinced until you mentioned the impeccable source that is your friend who manages a homeless shelter in NYCNow I too think homeless people are literally cockroaches and are getting what they deserve
7	1522757762	-1	I don't care if you are convinced. What matters is that I am after hearing hundreds of stories.My source is a first hand account, yours is at best some sjw journalist.
8	1522760041	3	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2015/04/17/the-surprisingly-simple-way-utah-solved-chronic-homelessness-and-saved-millions/?utm_term=.7860039298a0
9	1522766833	1	Utah is not NYC or SF.
6	1522758561	1	Uh oh not k2! 
4	1522766177	1	That’s not the goal. Getting back our common spaces and saving $90k a year per homeless person is the goal. I DGAF if they sit in their free apartment high off their ass 24/7 as long as we spend less money on them.
5	1522766922	1	You won't be spending less money on them because they will continue to be in and out of bookings/short term jail all the time.It's a mental problem for 95% of them, not a lack of money problem.
6	1522767118	1	For drug use? Out of sight arrest is much less likely.This has been tried and the results were incredibly successful. Give em a place and subsistence allowance and it’s much cheaper than what we have now.
2	1522743639	5	It’s not a tax deduction. It’s an income deduction. When people give money to charity they are not doing it “for taxes” like I hear all the time. If you are in the top tax bracket and paying ~50% of your income to taxes, all income you make you would be losing 50% if it’s value vs keeping 100% of its value going to the party donated to.
2	1522756866	2	So a guaranteed 70% loss. Cool.
2	1522739132	2	And tax credit. But it’s not investing it’s an expense with no financial return.
2	1522762065	1	So, like an 85% loss?
2	1522762715	1	And heaven points. 
2	1522779819	1	And moral high ground. Might come in handy when you‘re battling your best friend
2	1522728538	0	So they're the same?
2	1522746727	0	you only get tax deduction/exemptions when you are a company right?
3	1522776853	1	Wrong. Individuals get deductions in the United States
1	1522728520	117	‘ it costs $7500 through the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) to prevent one malaria-related death. This figure may seem high, but based on existing evidence is actually one of the most cost-effective ways to save a life in the developing world. We can compare this to wealthy countries like the US where, depending on age, it could cost between $790,000 – $13,100,000 to save a life.’ [Raising for Effective Giving (REG)](https://reg-charity.org/effective-giving-guide/)  uses ‘effective altruism’ to calculate maximum impact of each dollar spent. very interesting organization & although i have no ties to it whatsoever i figured id add it to the conversation that everyone is having & to answer your question AND if just ONE person donates itd be worth it 
2	1522728917	103	I don't think it's worth it, $7500 for one life? Do you know what kind of gaming rig that would buy me?
3	1522730034	32	Get the whole vr setup and everything.

3	1522730708	18	>Do you know what kind of gaming rig that would buy me?Something with a whole 1050ti? Yay!
3	1522737203	4	shit would be OP as fuck for like 6 months
3	1522749882	2	$7500? That is like 3 EA games!

2	1522731842	21	I assume if you save them they then owe you a life debt and are your servant until they save your life or either of you die?  Does the $7500 include shipping?  /s
2	1522739394	5	What is REGs relation to [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org) ? Nice to see people actually being smart about helping people.
3	1522748755	3	REG is (was? Not sure they're still around) a meta-charity designed to influence high net worth individuals, particularly in the finance sector and poker players, to give to effective organizations.Givewell does basic and cost effectiveness research on a variety of interventions and charities.
2	1522751624	3	got it, putting 7500$ into Lambocoin immediately so i can save 1 million lives from the returns in 5 years.
2	1522730808	1	In reality, using mosquito netting is far more effective to prevent malaria than the so-called "vaccine" that Bill Gates wants to give.
3	1522734874	28	I guess that implies you never leave that net?
4	1522735122	6	You can bring the net along with you smh
5	1522738255	2	[Who's that nerd in the net?](https://i.imgur.com/QtyWMxQ.jpg)
4	1522738388	7	Typical Bill Gates, betting against the net again.
5	1522746219	4	RIP Bill Gates, he will never be successful.
4	1522758647	1	There’s a gaming rig inside the net. 
4	1522761909	1	The main malaria spreading mosquitos feed at night, so having a net over your bed is very effective.
3	1522739175	7	AMF is primarily about nets. Bill Gates does not only want "vaccines" his foundation promotes most of the actually effective charity programs. [Here](https://www.againstmalaria.com/WhyNets.aspx)'s is AMFs opinion on nets
2	1522731846	1	This is the one many poker players are promoting i think.
1	1522752931	22	Think a little broader. Returns aren't in dollars, they're in improvement of a social problem or humanitarian issue. It's hard to measure, but I will say this: if you make the world better for everyone, you make it better for yourself.
2	1522766518	1	Maybe the kid you help give a better life to would have robbed your shit in 10 years and you end up actually helping yourself.Or maybe it saves a kid from cancer and if you don't save the kid he dies and then his dad decides to kill themselves because everything in their life sucks, and they'd do it by jumping off a bridge and it would cause a traffic jam and you'd get stuck in a traffic jam and get annoyed. Then you get fired for being late and you lose $10,000 worth of income before you get a new job and you take a pay cut and your life sucks now. That's why you should donate to charity. 
3	1522774015	1	Not only that, but I guarantee you'll feel really good about yourself after donating to charity or volunteering. There's a definite emotional high associated with giving back.
3	1522768445	1	Maybe the kid becomes the next Hitler and kills off 500 million people. And your puppy. That’s why I don’t donate to charity. 
4	1522777262	1	That's why you gotta donate double what you were initially gonna donate. In case your first donation creates super-hitler, you need to donate again to create super-Jesus to defeat super Hitler. It's simple math guys
5	1522777891	1	Or donate nothing to cancel both out and never cause the problem from the get go? I just don’t believe in charity. I grew up in poverty. I made my way out without help. Why should I help others? If they work their way out of it it will build character and life skills. 
1	1522730072	49	Pretty good. The charity I donated to set up a clinic that detected an illness before it became terminal. So whatever a life's worth in dollars. 
2	1522735541	5	Wholesome
2	1522758936	0	This is on the right track. Different charities will have different returns. Some may be corrupt and all the $ wasted while others may save lives. In that case the return is a life.
1	1522738879	15	Better than investing in Bitcoin these days.
1	1522756526	5	If it can solve a problem like homelessness or crime in your area and raise property prices then pretty well. Isn't that why americans think they only need a tiny government with little to no welfare as they give to charities they like to change society
2	1522760526	1	As a supporter of my county's shelter, I think they do a better job than the government.
1	1522746798	6	For example you can walk down the street more safely, therefore you are avoiding being robbed or going to the hospital.The return equals to what you save, a true long period investment.
1	1522745780	3	Karmic.
1	1522746788	3	Society literally expands when resources are spread more evenly
2	1522751501	-1	But investing with the goal of maximal and safe return has to be inherently blind to the suffering of others. Once you bring suffering and altruism and "the right thing" into the equation you're no longer investing for maximal return, you're willingly participating in wealth redistribution, which I agree with, but to the OP's point, the returns on charitable giving from an investment standpoint are zero unless you're using the charity to manipulate money out of the system unethically.
1	1522740857	2	Some people may have another meal for one more day. 
1	1522741643	2	Donating is obviously just giving money away but charity can be profitable both legitimately non profit and creating tons of jobs or the criminal way by scamming people donating to a charity and stealing from those that could have used that money for it's intended use. 
1	1522743905	2	Good if you're the CEO
1	1522756379	2	Socio people like you would never like it.
1	1522756552	2	Long-term, they approach infinity. Short-term, somewhat less. 
1	1522757736	2	A better society for all, so minimal as your return is spread amongst all citizens.   
1	1522760113	2	I don't know, making people's lives better seems like a pretty fucking good return on my charity investment.
2	1522767468	1	Feels good.
1	1522737730	3	> what are the returns like?Depends how old you are. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_gift_annuity
2	1522737739	0	**Charitable gift annuity**A charitable gift annuity is a gift vehicle that falls in the category of planned giving. It involves a contract between a donor and a charity, whereby the donor transfers cash or property to the charity in exchange for a partial tax deduction and a lifetime stream of annual income from the charity. When the donor dies, the charity keeps the gift.The amount of the income stream is determined by many factors including the donor's age and the policy of the charity.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
1	1522732484	2	Invest in starting a charity, then just sell everything people donate to you. Less 10% of course.
2	1522764633	2	Don't forget to pay yourself a fat administration salary for selling stuff people give you for free. Or start a mega church.
1	1522746824	1	If you donate an asset you can influence the valuation of, then it can be quite high via the tax deduction.  Think a thinly-traded stock you can manipulate to make the price seem artificially high, or "art".
2	1522761818	1	Nixon did that with his Vice Presidential papers. Journalists finding someone it it what started the trend of presidential candidates releasing their tax returns.
1	1522748806	1	Are there charities on the blockchain? 10/10 would invest.

1	1522750139	1	Ask the politicians
1	1522752432	1	If it's tithing, the blessings are nice.
1	1522757506	1	Depends how effectively you give and what community the non-profit focuses on. Their are parks, bike trails, specific causes local churches focus on, etc... basically there's lots too invest your time and money into to see tangible results. 
1	1522758213	1	The returns are more human than any of you. 
1	1522758595	1	Ask The Robin Hood Foundation. They have metrics. But the investment is in *society*. 
1	1522759185	1	The same as in bitcoin
1	1522759888	1	About the same as imaginary coins, ultimately.
1	1522760108	1	At this point, almost as good as Bitcoin. 
1	1522760368	1	better thab alot of the people that tries to ride the wave 😂
1	1522761310	1	Ask the founder of 5 Hour Energy.
1	1522761512	1	Really slow but tangible. Programs like SNAP (food stamps) have a net positive effect on the economy. Ever dollar spent by the program generates 1.25 of economic activity in the community. 
1	1522765763	1	About the same as crypto 
1	1522765950	1	Similar to crypto actually.  
1	1522767095	1	Little bit worse than Bitcoin.
1	1522767376	1	Depends on the charity. Drunk charity auction winning bids can get you an off season stay in the Ozarks. Contribution to Trump library can get you a cabinet post. Donation to the Stormy Daniels defense fund gets you a lap dance.
1	1522771622	1	People in the world receive help.

1	1522775898	1	In terms of impact, a study by RAND concluded that for every $1 spent on education in particular, the cascading affects of having higher education was $7 saved for the district. So, seeing the returns as lower crime, less people in jail, more generally educated populous, less taxes needed to pay for the mistakes of those less educated, etc. 
1	1522740389	1	Disappointing.
1	1522740681	1	How about you invest 10% into my banking account instead

1	1522752870	0	10+% gain depending on your incom level and if it drops you to a lower tax bracket.
2	1522761896	1	That's not how tax brackets work. You only pay a levels tax rate on the money earned above the level.
1	1522730716	-1	r/wallstreetbets is full of people who "invest". So i'd ask about charity returns there.If its similar to the returns they make on that sub, i'd say its about the same as giving your money away.
2	1522733445	3	Losing all your money is still better than my r/wallstreetbet returns.
2	1522744561	1	WSB daytrades and loses money on options, this isn't investing.
0	1522728629	174	Unless its a Kiva.org donation. Those get repaid and sometimes even with interest. 
1	1522737133	45	No, there's a difference between Kiva loans and Kiva donations, you don't get the donations back except as tax deductions, like JeremyLinForever wrote about donations in general. However, Kiva loans can have a return via credit card rewards, e.g. /r/churning.

3	1522728775	75	It was clearly a joke at the stereotype of how old people like gardening.

5	1522729633	20	>Idk what it is.Sooner than later you will know.
5	1522729664	5	Doesn't know what gardening is.Found the New Zealander.
5	1522729748	-7	For exactly what the person raged about.Old folk realize that they, like all children, mucked about most their life chasing selfish highs destroying the trees for not only them but the generations ahead. So they garden, because the next wave of youngings are fucking it up. They dont like to garden, par say, but they like things that grow and that will last beyond their life, and provide happiness when they will no longer be able to. Especailly when that end is so near. 
6	1522749684	2	Per se*
6	1522750114	2	Or maybe they just like gardening.Also, its not a hobby exclusively old people enjoy.Old people aren't even that good at it, you ever see a geezer try to bend down and pick some weeds? 
3	1522729986	18	Are you okay?
3	1522737895	7	How many trees have you planted?

1	1522728134	142	Youd be upset to find out that a lot of charities actually dont do much for the future of humanity compared to how much they do for the presence of their big bank accounts And there comes the question what is the future of humanity ? ALS raised millions that helped thousands of people yet that same millions couldve helped millions of Africans from death (not just a disease , although a horrible one). We as humans are always trying to ‘save’ the world. The world’s falling apart & there will always be negative consequences to certain human/nature events that will continue on until the end of Earth. If you do donate I just hope you make sure that money is allocated correctly. May I insert a [recommendation](https://reg-charity.org) for a seriously well intentioned foundation started by poker players where the objective is to maximize lives saved vs dollar spent. Youd think all charities would optimize their allocation of funds like this but A LOT dont & even if they did in a lot of cases charities receive donations out of sympathy & although American lives w diseases are improved/cured, the impact could be much more substantial. 
2	1522735545	52	I'm just going to leave this link here, I hope it changes how you view charities and why they do this. https://youtu.be/bfAzi6D5FpM
3	1522736054	8	I was gonna share this exact thing
3	1522776566	1	The one thing I've found about niche subreddits is that while they are absolutely SMEs in their niche (r/investing for example), and their tone and confidence on the topic shows that, they let this tone and confidence ride into other subjects where they most likely are just as ignorant as the average layperson.
2	1522735852	11	This is just as applicable as most companies don't benefit humanity or will increase in value.You still have to pick them well.Effective Altrusim is a fairly lesser known way to go, though man they need some copy editing"Join over three hundert people who have decided to give at least 2%"
2	1522733987	43	I agree with you that many charities squander money or outright hoard it and that just reinforces the truth that blindly throwing money at a problem won't solve it.  On a similar vein, if one does donate to a charity then it's important to choose what you believe to be the best use of your money.  If someone simply donates blindly that indicates to me that charity to them is just a feel good gesture.That being said, I firmly believe that we have a moral obligation to share our resources with those who are in need.  The fact that there will always be negative consequences to human actions does not negate the fact that we can greatly lessen the suffering of others at a negligible cost to ourselves.  $10 a month is probably trivial to most of the people reading this but that could easily make a life and death difference to someone who can be reached by a charity organization.  Whether that directly goes towards food and shelter or helps fund efforts to combat disease, an amount of money so trivial as to not even count as a sacrifice can literally save lives.  If you can save a life at no cost to your happiness or well being then I believe you have a moral obligation to do so.Come to think of it, cryptocurrencies might be an effective way to ensure that charitable donations are actually used as they should be.  Being able to track the money through the blockchain would allow for the kind of transparency that charity organization should have.  (I know that there are charities that accept bitcoin but I haven't looked into any of them.)  The need for intermediaries could be greatly reduced, increasing the portion of donations that actually go towards the services vs the expenses of running the charity.  I think if people had greater confidence that the money they donate is used in the way that they want it to be used then many more people would donate.  Cryptocurrencies could make a huge difference in that regard and better enable human generosity.
3	1522766971	1	You'd be happy to know that UNICEF recognised this and is experimenting with some implementations of proof of impact and transparency. http://unicefstories.org/blockchain/
2	1522755614	6	Depends entirely on the non-profit.  Look for ones run entirely by volunteers, in some field you know about, and you'll be pretty confident that the donation is going to be used wisely.
2	1522745809	3	https://www.givewell.orghttps://www.effectivealtruism.org
2	1522737637	8	How many more Africans will die later because of the ones you saved now? Stopgap measures aren't helping the fucked uo Africa. Investment and running businesses at a loss would be more worthwhile.
3	1522765686	1	> How many more Africans will die later because of the ones you saved now?None I would assume? Why would saving a life cause the death of other people?
4	1522767785	1	It wouldn't as increase in quality of life leads to decrease in birth rate.
4	1522774812	1	That person can go on to reproduce and their children can die unless if the systemic issues are solved. Also the person that didn't get malaria may now die of HIV or malnourishment in Africa instead. If Africa becomes developed they will get healthcare and better quality of living and more sanitation etc., which seems like the best way to me. Todo that though you need a stable government and currency even if done philanthropically, so probably just use USD if you can but I don't think there is a stable enough government and society anywhere, you'd have to create one first or make do with something like Egypt and expand from there.
2	1522749692	4	> Youd be upset to find out that a lot of charities actually dont do much for the future of humanity compared to how much they do for the presence of their big bank accountsAre you fucking kidding me? You managed to inject "big bad banks" conspiracy hypothesis into this? What the fuck is wrong with you people, jesus-fucking-christ.
3	1522754552	7	Are you having a stroke? They didn't say anything about "big bad bank conspiracies", they said >big bank accounts. Pretty sure they meant that many charities make a huge turnover, but most of it pays for their top level employees, ads and offices etc. Only a small percentage actually goes towards aid.
4	1522762140	6	I think the what-the-fuck-is-wrong-with-you-people mentality comes from the general sentiment of 'you might as well not donate' which is lazy and selfish. The narrative should be 'do your research and give to a worthy charity' not 'don't bother'. 
3	1522754299	1	It doesn't say big bad banks it just says that they have big bank accounts
2	1522740563	1	I just wad bundles of cash up and fire them at hobos with a t-shirt cannon.
2	1522769582	1	You might feel differently about ALS if someone close to you had suffered and died from it, like in my life. There are already tons of charities for African people, I don't understand your point there.
2	1522772699	1	Charities are an industrial complex. Many of them are not in the business of eradicating problems, since they require those problems to exist for them to survive. Some do a lot of good (I regularly donate to the ACLU since the government will always try to erode the rights of its citizens). But you've got some big name players like the Red Cross that managed to build 6 houses in Haiti with $500M of donations for disaster relief. You have companies like Goodwill that pay disabled people peanuts to work there and sell stuff other people gave them for free, while keeping many actual good donated products. You also have Wounded Warrior Project, and Susan G Komen, which are basically PR marketing departments of the NFL. Everyone aware of breast cancer, why don't you spend some of your money trying to cure it, or at least make it more manageable? Nah, we will just have football players wear pink, that'll make people feel good and win over more donations.
2	1522773235	1	> for a seriously well intentioned foundation where the objective is to maximize lives saved vs dollar spent. This is literally what the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation do. As you may have overlooked though, it costs a lot to find those answers.
2	1522779973	1	80% of your charity donation is actually administrative fees, salaries, marketing and tv ads. Very little of the money you give goes to those in need. If you want to help, get active about it. Seek a transparent way to give your time or skills for free to a small local organization.
1	1522746426	10	Give 10% of your savings to charity every year and they will have money for a decade. Invest your savings in an asset that makes 10% per year and give them the profits and they will have money forever.
1	1522728783	6	I think the investments hes thinking of are the ones in which he will be able to bask in the shade of.
1	1522727712	3	I can’t give away what I owe 
1	1522728971	6	Yes, but consider the following: You could invest $100 in a charity, or you could invest $100 in an ETF watch it double six times within 18 years, and then give $6400 to charity.
2	1522735644	35	If one hesitates to give $100, they are not going to give $6k. 
3	1522738836	5	Regardless, the guy was asking about investment strategy, not donation advice. It was clearly not what he was asking about 
2	1522753417	11	average growth of sp500 is 6.6% per year. So you get around $300 after 18 years.
3	1522762642	0	I used to think that, but a selection of ETFs beat the market consistently by acting like mutual funds and switching which portion of the companies in an exchange they are invested in.
4	1522766392	1	Which ones?I'm sceptical, by definition among active managers you're always going to have a spread of outliers on both sides of the average, so you will have things that appear to be 'consistent' and a proven system, but over time you end up with a reversion to the mean. I recall there being studies which included notable funds with a long track record of success, that after many decades suddenly had a reversion to the mean.
5	1522771876	1	That could be the case, and the stock market does fluctuate so it's also possible that this is only temporary.Either way, the point still stands: investing money in stocks and donating the cap gains is better than investing in charities now
1	1522750328	4	Not all charities work for a better future for humanity. Sadly enough, charity money can destroy the local economy if applied the wrong way. 
2	1522761596	2	But some charities do really good work. Skip the bad ones, invest in the good ones. Simple enough. 
1	1522743989	1	I've been hiding seeds. Is that kinda the same?
2	1522754355	2	Okay JoJi
1	1522750423	1	Love me some greek proverbs
1	1522768484	1	It's in society's best interest NOT to give to charity. If you purchase stock from a company that money goes to a private business that uses the money to grow the economy by employing people and providing services to clients. You're giving the money to hardworking men & women who will improve upon it and provide a return.Charities and government programs (Medicaid, Social Security, education loans, etc...) give money to unproductive people who spend it on food, medicine, etc... These people don't produce much. The private sector isn't perfectly efficient at allocating capital to where it will be used most productively, but it's miles ahead of private charities and government. It feels really good to give to charity, but you have to realize that you're hurting society as a whole when you do it.Now, if my brother was in trouble and needed help I'd TOTALY give to him and help him get back on his feet. I'd just say to myself "I'm hurting society a little bit to do this, as there is a more producive us of my time & money, but I don't care because he's my brother." But to systematically allocate money to charity is a net drain on society.
1	1522772187	1	Sometimes you can invest in yourself. Sometimes you might want to invest in others. My favorite charity is The Sheltering Arms Atlanta if anybody hasnt setup a charity on http://smile.amazon.com yet. Help an underprivileged child get a good education and day care for parents who work two jobs
1	1522752877	1	Most humanitarian charities are corrupted and fake
1	1522753961	1	Which is why I don’t complain about paying taxes.
2	1522755507	1	Except that taxes don't tend to go to improving the world.  Mostly they go to corporate investors via contracts and subsidies and tax breaks.
3	1522755797	2	They go to public works projects, and social programs.  I feel like I get a good return out of it.
4	1522759350	2	90% goes to lame crap, from what I can tell.  And the rest has the most insane gatekeeping out there.  The bureaucracy to get obvious basic needs (a human right) like food, housing, education, etc. is so heartbreaking that many give up.  Non-profits end up doing the work that the government should be doing.At least in the US.

3	1522749160	-1	[deleted]
4	1522750154	12	I would argue that it is the opposite of a waste of money. He's making profit.
5	1522750228	-1	[deleted]
6	1522750803	10	He's not wasting money. He invests money in his business to earn more money. This is like saying that a car company wastes the money on steel to make cars. Why don't they just sell steel instead?
7	1522752205	1	Not even close to the same thing. Car companies aren't simply melting or destroying the steel, they are using it to create a bigger, better machine. 
8	1522752572	3	So you're saying that they're investing money in a product to make even more money? 
9	1522753368	-3	You're probably one of the idiots who lost all their money on a Bitcoin "investment" lmao
6	1522750976	3	I think you mean to say he's wasting resources/phones rather than wasting money? The reason people invest in anything is usually because they spend money in hopes of earning more back.
6	1522751538	2	Considering he makes more money off of destroying the items than he would selling them, no, it isn't a waste of money 
2	1522753695	12	The electronics he buys are a pretty good investment. It earns him money. But then again, we are on a subreddit that thinks a currency is an investment.

1	1522741965	6	You’re essentially giving your money to bitcoin investors *shudder*
2	1522743272	5	Isn't that kinda the point tho? Like Bitcoin doesn't really work as a currency unless more people use it.
1	1522776763	1	Except that it isn't. Unless your definition on investing is buying high and selling low in which case Bitcoin wouldn't be alone in that assessment. 
0	1522757091	17	people when bitcoin is soaring to $20k: "I wish I could have gotten in at lower prices!"people when bitcoin has touched the bottom at $6.5k: "I would never invest in something that risky"... repeat every 2 to 3 years

0	1522732255	96	I mean... it's not all that bad to think about other people every once in a while
1	1522739019	56	No but someone telling someone else to give their money away to charity is a bit rich. Especially when they were asking how to invest it.
2	1522750773	32	FWIW, the person asking for investment advice is the creator of such timeless classics as "What happens when you pour molten aluminum on 50 iPhones?", "Don't ever boil your iPhone in Crayons!", and "Smashing a brand new PS4 outside of GameStop".
3	1522762861	3	It's worth it in the long run since it makes money
4	1522766546	1	Destruction never creates. The town is poorer by one broken window.
2	1522761033	4	That's the joke. You'll probably make more money investing in charity than in bitcoin
3	1522765598	3	The picture of the person looks like a 12 year old kid... I highly doubt they were making a joke. Even if they were, it was poorly executed because it wasn't clear it was a joke. It seems more like some 12 year old with no concept of money just virtue signalling.
1	1522741899	3	I’m sorry, I thought this was America?!
2	1522764587	1	Forgive me, must have slipped my mind
2	1522750661	-1	I thought this was lesbianEdit:It was a bad reference
1	1522777668	1	Charity is an ineffective way to help anyone.
2	1522777781	1	That's a fair argument, I suppose. I do think some forms of charity are more effective than others though. In theory, if you just straight up gave some of your money to someone who has basically nothing, it would almost guarantee they would at least have somewhat of a better life.
3	1522778459	1	Directly helping people who have a spot of bad luck is one thing; but generically helping people who are not self sufficient seldom solves a problem and often makes it worse. Food aid is ironically one of the greatest sources of starvation. The best "charity" and the most moral way to spend your money to buy things you like, and to earn your money fairly for good work. A person who buys a yacht or luxury car feeds countless workers and encourages life sustaining industry and good habits. Paying someone for a job well done is strictly better than simply giving them money; it doesnt create dependence and it gives them the pride of earning rather than the shame of subsidy.Charity is morally inferior to simple spending.
1	1522737197	-2	Yeah. I don't get why this is being upvoted.
2	1522740778	39	When someone asks you the best way to get more money, giving it away isn't a good answer, even if it's a good thing to do.If I want a good steak don't recommend a salad.
3	1522748395	12	I think a better simile/metaphor/whatever it's called would be "If I ask where the best place to get a steak is I don't want to be told I should give the money for it to the homeless."
3	1522755397	-1	No one asked what the best way to get more money is.  The question was whether they should invest 10% of their money in Bitcoin.The answer is totally reasonable.  Invest in a better world, instead.Personally, I'm using Bitcoin to increase the monetary value of my non-profit funding.  So I'm doing both.
4	1522759684	1	That's _realllly_ stretching "invest" beyond what the guy obviously meant, though. A donation will have almost no benefit on his life relative to actually investing it.
5	1522761312	3	Depends on your goals in life.  If you want a good life, you need to invest in a healthy community, putting your resources into increasing the quality of life for you and your family and friends and neighbors and strangers, so that everyone can have a higher quality of life.It's selfish to want a healthy planet, so that you and those you care about can have a good life.  If the planet is broken and sick, as it is now, you will never be able to have a good life because there will always be problems that suck up your resources.
4	1522760284	-2	The question is "should i use my money on x to get more money?"The only appropriate answers are yes, no, and something like "if you want to get more money you should invest in y".Here he is just straight up telling him to give away his money. That is not the question and no "investing in future" is not the investing he is talking about.Its the same as saying "hey guys anyone knows a good place to stay under 800/m?And some prick answering that he should give this money to homeless.
5	1522761065	2	That literally was not the question.And the answer was a great answer.  Invest in a better world, so that you can enjoy your life more, and not have to worry so much about money.When everyone around you is sick, your life will suck.  So your goal is to help everyone around you be as healthy as possible, so that they are happy, fun, productive, and helpful to you.

0	1522733533	17	Do I get banned if I point out that at any time bitcoin could be manipulated down?
1	1522752993	5	Yup. All it takes is a few well placed news articles to get the normies to panic and boom.
1	1522766264	1	At any given moment there are thousands of people trying to manipulate Bitcoin to go down, and thousands trying to manipulate it to go up.  You can join the fight on one side or the other, but don't think that a single person can have a noticeable impact all by themselves.
1	1522738893	-1	Idk, but you most certainly look like a jackass.

3	1522764162	1	Explain me how to manipulate bitcoin's price
4	1522764935	1	If you (or a group of entities) control a large amount of the supply in a low liquidity commodity then you can control/influence the price action, especially when it's not regulated.  Do you even supply vs demand bro?
5	1522766021	1	and bitcoin has a low liquidity ?  . Dont try to act smart , becouse you are not yeah , keep comming to cryptocurrency related subreddits to post your fantasies about them being a scam.Are you mad ,bro ? 
6	1522766754	1	yes, it does have low liquidity.  Are you 12 or something?  The entire crypto market is a liquidity joke compared to others like forex/stocks.
5	1522766948	1	Of course, but the only thing you can do with a fuckton of Bitcoin is fuck yourself over by making the price take a dive, and no, there's no way to buy back in at the lower price and come out ahead, because that's not how orderbooks work.There is a strategy called "stop hunting" which lets you take advantage of overly leveraged markets by causing a dip, triggering stops, and buying up the cheap liquidated coins.  That mostly just acts as a force to drive down the population of leveraged traders though, and isn't really a great long term strategy, especially because you're providing cheap coins to the hungry masses wanting to buy, and if you fail to trigger enough stops, you're just fucked and lose it all.

1	1522759998	1	It's not zero sum because the whale wanted dollars more than you did (positive), you wanted bitcoin more than he did (positive), and you're sharing information about that trade with the market (positive). Win _win_ win.
0	1522736252	2	It's only the opposite if it decreases the value of existing investments.  I don't think charity does that.  Charity incrementally increases the value of investments.  If nothing else, it provides direct security and a sort of folk insurance policy, because people go out of their way for other people they perceive to be "nice" or "good."
