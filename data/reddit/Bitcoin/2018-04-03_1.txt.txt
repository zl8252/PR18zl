2	1522761770	11	Wright actually makes a bigger fool of himself when he tries to explain why a parameter that measures proportions can be negative. Wright probably didn't know it measures proportions and just made that shit up on the spot. 
2	1522759479	3	That's not Josephi Nakapoonos original vision, sorry Craig.
3	1522766836	1	> Josephi Nakapoonos lol that sounds like a distinctively Greek name.
2	1522769583	1	Who was  that
3	1522769691	1	Joseph Poon
1	1522766410	1	My internet arguing feels weird when I see them all going for it in person.
1	1522771523	1	That just made my day. Thank you.
1	1522764902	-16	People shouldn't get too excited, Money Skeletor Vitalik also agrees with Roger "Please clap" Ver on some contentious points.I think the best part is when ETH migrates to Proof-of-(mis)Stake, that should be goddamned hilarious. Oh, and don't forget the proposal to implement "colored coins" too.That flaming garbage-ball re-entering the atmosphere of reality will burn so bright, everyone in the northern hemisphere will see it.
2	1522767848	1	Wait what's so hard about colored coins? That's a _really_ old idea and could work on literally any cryptocurrency.
2	1522777016	1	If you think a point is wrong just because Roger Ver thinks the opposite, you should compete in mental gymnastics. 
2	1522767087	1	> That flaming garbage-ball re-entering the atmosphere of reality will burn so bright, everyone in the northern hemisphere will see it.This, at the end of your silly rant makes you seem like a fevered cultist talking about the end of times.It's hard not to laugh.Are you a CSW supporter? It certainly seems like your only purpose here is to defend his "honor"......
3	1522777532	1	I think what he is trying to say is don't start believing in Vitalik's techno babble just because he called out CSW's. Rich statefullness or whatever...
2	1522776999	1	I like the way you write things
2	1522766742	1	You're not coming across very adult by giving others silly names, instead of sticking to issues.
2	1522769339	1	ETH has some serious issues coming up and has a different philosophy.POS is going to be bloody, but lets see how the kid handles it.
3	1522774630	1	I'm curious, but how will the transition to PoS be bloody? It seems like the addition of the Iceage difficulty bomb has protected the transition from PoW to PoW/PoS and eventually to full PoS. Are you meaning that a change as drastic as PoW to PoS could never go over well? 
4	1522775837	1	>Are you meaning that a change as drastic as PoW to PoS could never go over well?yes.Im waiting for Rodger Ver Part 2 to defend miners or HODLers that lose on POS
3	1522773210	1	I remember he said some stuff about kids not long ago
0	1522762063	70	Craig Wright is a serial fabricator and liar. Here's just some of the evidence:1. He faked [blog posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80ryvc/craig_wright_2008_august_26_blog_post_i_have_a/duxwsyk/)2. He faked [PGP keys](https://medium.com/@tbrice/wrights-appeal-to-authority-paper-disproved-its-own-thesis-8f2d45e5df24)3. He faked [contracts and emails](http://blog.wizsec.jp/2018/02/kleiman-v-craig-wright-bitcoins.html)4. He faked [threats](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80o2xf/its_time_for_another_reminder_craig_wright_is_not/duxbjuw/) 5. He faked [a public key signing](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/05/craig-wright-s-proof-he-invented-bitcoin-is-basically-a-canadian-girlfriend.html)6. He has a [well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related](https://www.scribd.com/document/372445546/Bitcoin-Lawsuit) (see numbers 88 through 102)7. His own mother [admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-1655.0-1655.94)And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:1. He has provided no independently verifiable evidence2. He is not [technically competent](http://archive.is/6C3C9) in the subject matter3. His [writing style](http://seclists.org/basics/2008/Mar/42) is nothing like [Satoshi's](http://satoshinakamoto.me/)4. He [called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011](https://theconversation.com/lulzsec-anonymous-freedom-fighters-or-the-new-face-of-evil-2605#comment_6162) when Satoshi never used a space5. He [actively bought and traded coins](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hx3q9/according_to_the_mtgox_leaks_from_early_2014_our/) from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 20146. He was [paid millions](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-729.989-732.0) for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive
1	1522765244	21	> His writing styleHe makes more spelling mistakes sober than the guy who invented "hodling" drunk.
2	1522772855	1	But but but cnbc told me it meant hold on for dear life? What my world is shatteredI thought it was a OG 2013 meme when someone accidentally misspelled hold! My life is over! 
2	1522777574	1	He even spelled "Vitalik" incorrectly today on his Twitter, while trying to make a lame Beavis & Butthead themed insult.  The man is an obvious compulsive liar and a joke.
1	1522771949	1	I agree with everything you said. What I can't figure out is what the hell happened with Gavin !!! How the hell did Wright fool him ?? I have to assume it was just a simple 'slight of hand' type trick where I bet the 'new' laptop they got was not really new at all.
2	1522772353	1	It really could be several different explanations. We don't even know if we have the full, correct story of what happened. It's like trying to figure out a magic trick based on a description from an audience member. One plausible theory is that they used a modified WiFi to download a custom version of Electrum. 
2	1522779850	1	I highly doubt Gavin was being truthful when he claimed that Craig was Satoshi. I dont know why he said that but he obviousy had his reasons.
1	1522772262	1	Who ever said lying and cheating was not a valid method to get rich in this modern world?  In fact, in todays times, it seems to be the preferred method. 
1	1522773336	1	the part with his mum actually hints at a sociopathic nature
0	1522757951	36	The fact that Faketoshi Hoaxamoto is still speaking and is *accepted* by some as muh Satoshi is beyond me. That part of Bitcoin community needs to wake the fuck up.Craigomoto needs serious help btw. He seems rather troubled.
1	1522760117	10	someone should start a Thread with "Ban Craig Wright from Speaking at Conference".  And everybody on Reddit just up votes into infinity 
2	1522760641	4	Vote manipulation = not allowed.
3	1522762599	3	gotcha i guess then a Twitter poll
4	1522768444	1	underrated comment
1	1522758779	5	From what I've honestly gathered people don't actually believe he's SN, they just like repeating the lie because it gets under the skin of Bitcoin supporters who call out Bcash, Roger Ver, Craig Wright and the rest of their little crew for what they are. 
2	1522760669	3	Don't they have a better purpose in life?
3	1522767893	1	Nope
2	1522767679	1	So, childish reasons that could only be attributed to 12 year old internet trolls?Sounds about right.
1	1522766764	1	He’s truly a sociopath. 
2	1522769398	1	Maybe, yes. 
1	1522762336	2	Craig Wright is a sloppy unconvincing fraud compared to more sophisticated frauds like Vitalik
2	1522767796	1	lol, best statement in the thread. Totally nailed it. I feel so conflicted when vitalik says such Common Sense things that we can all agree with when I know his history.It's like that superintendent who was a bully as a kid but as an adult has enacted bullying programs and reduced bullying.On one hand you have to call him out for being a bully and he should have some sort of societal punishment and on the other hand he has clearly tried to make up for his ways by spreading the opposite of what he did as a youth and he should be cherished for that.I don't think it's a wash but I'm not sure which side I stand on. But I do know that I would much rather support vitalik than csw, if it came down to such a decisive choice.
3	1522769438	1	Vitalik is in charge of the biggest crypto that isnt BTC.And to be fair, BTC is far more decentralized than ETH.He has lots of responsibility and a new idea he is trying. We have BTC, we need new tech, and ETH is trying that.
1	1522770754	1	It's called worship, humans do it at a drop of a hat just look at sports, celebrities, religeon, cryptocoins...
1	1522773287	1	Bcash people/Roger are keeping him alive. CSW is as fraud as Roger Ver. That's why he is going nowhere.
0	1522752653	49	1up for Vitalik.
1	1522763742	0	Double standard. Vitalik should apply the same scrutiny to other crazy frauds promoting Bcash, starting with that guy on stage.
2	1522767888	1	It's one thing to have bad ideas, but very different to actually being a fraud and lying. 
3	1522769868	1	Agreed, and that's why I think Vitalik should be calling out other crazy Bcash frauds too. 
2	1522768050	1	Yes, first thought I had was "Ver is right on stage, what about his perpetuated fraud?"If 2% of McDonald's customers decided to launch their own franchise called McDonald's humburgers, without any support from McDonald's, *it wouldn't be McDonald's*.That's just fraud.
3	1522769062	1	Ironic choice, considering the history of McDonalds. 
4	1522770730	1	Yes, perhaps. But that's not within the context of the analogy, so let's not muddy up my point eh?
3	1522775899	1	I get your point, but if McDonalds never trademarked themselves or "open sourced" themselves, then you'd have the same situation. 
3	1522777404	1	Maybe the guy who owns Bitcoin should sue Ver.
3	1522768306	1	The difference that the name mcdonalds is owned by a person/company with rights to that name. The name Bitcoin is not owned by anyone. The people decide which bitcoin is the real one and the others fall into obscurity.If you believe that Bitcoin Core is the real bitcoin then use and promote that one, if you think that bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin then use and transact on that one. Which one becomes adopted by the masses is the "Real" bitcoin
4	1522770482	1	There is no coin called Bitcoin Core.  It is just Bitcoin.
4	1522770823	1	Yes, and the transaction count speaks and has always spoken voumes on which is the "real" Bitcoin.How long must we measure before we can all agree what the measurement says?For bcash supporters, that measurement is until the end of time.
0	1522756347	16	Vitalik is a beast.
0	1522761492	5	Stop inviting craig wright to conferences. He has been exposed multiple times
1	1522774206	1	If he pays for the show, then let him speak and be called out.
0	1522755005	5	Thug life. 
0	1522756998	5	Poon's hand gestures speak volumes
0	1522765889	1	I like this Vitalik guy.
0	1522759843	13	Roger Ver and friends straight up all frauds
0	1522754290	11	Viterin vs Cragamoto! Viterin wins - flawless victory
1	1522764282	1	PERFECT!
2	1522777095	1	I think we are making Fatality now in this thread 
3	1522777716	1	That was in my best Street Fighter voice...but, "FINISH HIM" may have been more appropriate.
0	1522755250	3	Can someone transcribe what he's saying please? English isn't my first language and I don't understand because of the low quality + his accent :/
1	1522755917	10	"Why's this fraud allowed to speak here"
1	1522755385	3	Basically, he called Craig Wright out for being a fraud.
0	1522759041	3	mic drop by Vitalik and the Poon meister.
0	1522765870	3	live tweet and good commentary as well:https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/981100213568864256
0	1522757411	5	Wow, he was *not* holding back... I love it.  Go Vitalik!
0	1522762360	3	This whole CSW affair reminds me of the book 'intellectual [impostures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashionable_Nonsense)' by Sokal and Bricmont, the story of the [Bogdanoff's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogdanov_affair) fake phd thesis and of course most recently, the physics paper written using auto-complete that was accepted as an academic paper for a scientific [conference](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/22/nonsense-paper-written-by-ios-autocomplete-accepted-for-conference). You know what they say -  **bullshit baffles brains**. 
1	1522762368	1	**Fashionable Nonsense**Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science (French: Impostures Intellectuelles), published in the UK as Intellectual Impostures, is a book by physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont. Sokal is best known for the Sokal Affair, in which he submitted a deliberately absurd article to Social Text, a critical theory journal, and was able to get it published.The book was published in French in 1997, and in English in 1998; the English editions were revised for greater relevance to debates in the English-speaking world. As part of the so-called science wars, Sokal and Bricmont criticized postmodernism in academia for what they considered misuses of scientific and mathematical concepts in postmodern writing.*****Bogdanov affair**The Bogdanov affair is an academic dispute regarding the legitimacy of a series of theoretical physics papers written by French twins Igor and Grichka Bogdanov (alternately spelt Bogdanoff). These papers were published in reputable scientific journals, and were alleged by their authors to culminate in a proposed theory for describing what occurred at the Big Bang.The controversy began in 2002 when Max Niedermaier, a physicist at the University of Tours, emailed Ted Newman, a physicist at the University of Pittsburgh, alleging that the twins—who had previously had celebrity status for a science fiction television program in France—had spoofed their PhD theses. Rumors spread on Usenet newsgroups that the work was a deliberate hoax intended to target weaknesses in the peer review system employed by the physics community to select papers for publication in academic journals.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
0	1522752360	11	It is all going so well for Bcash  :)Update: 1 BCash = ฿0.094 ..and yet the Ver orchestra continues to play on deck as the seawater rises over their spats.Hah 
1	1522761949	2	Someone is right now trying to pump it past 0.1. Let's see how much money they lose :D    *edit* spelling
1	1522755835	4	Vitalik is pro ver and bcash
2	1522757296	19	I don't think so, he just seems to straightforward and honest and sometimes his opinions don't match up with Bitcoin backers and the Bitcoin Core developers. Along those lines, he also is obviously very knowledgeable and it must be excruciating for him to have to sit through Craig Wright's blather and technobabble. Craig Wright was obviously counting on the courtesy of those who know he is full of it to not call him out, but Vitalik didn't play along. Kudos, to Vitalik.  
2	1522769181	1	https://i.redd.it/aw16l51rlnp01.png
2	1522756021	0	Yes.  There is a sense of that sometimes.  He calls out Craig Wankeroshi, but is relatively gentle on Dodger.He does make quite a cutting comment about Ver only having one person applaud though.But ETH is going down the pan something akin to BCash, so maybe they have the brotherhood that comes with being captains of sinking ships.
3	1522756156	0	Yeah shitcoiners have to stick together
4	1522756374	8	Bcash is the shitcoin.ETH has actual applications, flawed as it still may be. 
5	1522757190	5	it's only application is to create shitcoins. that is a huuuge flaw.
5	1522757362	2	Such as? Their biggest thing is an ico creator.
5	1522757382	-7	For a consumer, BCH works _exactly_ the same as BTC. Only the fees are lower, which actually means something tangible. Regular people don't care much about the tech, only useability.Vitalik said something that no one is ever mentioning: how can you move around 1000 satoshi? That's impossible with BTC. Fees would eat up everything, or you'd wait 100 years for your tx to finally get into a block.
6	1522757894	7	Impossible? Didn’t LN just make micropayments a cheap reality?
7	1522760787	1	Yeah, except micro would be something like 0.5$. What LN enables we should be calling nanopayments. Which just opens up the way for the next big evolutionary step - streaming money. Andreas Antonopoulos has some amazing things to say about how streaming money will change things. Found it fascinating to imagine the possibilities
7	1522777218	1	LN is still in beta, I haven't seen any release binaries for Windows yet. Last time I checked Bitcoin.org doesn't show any LN-capable wallet.
6	1522758343	5	>For a consumer, Doge works exactly the same as BTC.You see what I did there?
7	1522777611	1	Haha, I like it. Shorter block time is always a winner. Who'd want to wait half an hour for a few confirmations.In all seriousness, all Doge needs for a wider adoption is professional marketing team and a few good coders. They already share hashrate with LTC so the network is secure. Capping the supply would also help.
6	1522761075	4	>Vitalik said something that no one is ever mentioning: how can you move around 1000 satoshi? That's impossible with BTC.That's false for a number of reasons. You can move 1000 satoshis with Bitcoin just fine. One example of how to do so is via batching a number of conceptual transactions or payments together into a single network/Bitcoin transaction, and having that be confirmed on-chain (rather than having each individual constituent transaction submitted separately). With signature aggregation techniques like Schnorr, this gets even more powerful and has an even more profound impact on what's possible and viable.But we can do *better*. We can set up payment channels to get our fees much, much lower.With regards to the Lightning Network, which is probably the most economically viable decentralized micropayments platform yet conceived, after opening a payment channel, you are able to amortize the fees for doing so over an arbitrary-length chain of transactions, reducing the per-transaction fee to *a few satoshis* or even *less than a satoshi per payment*. The Lightning Network is operational on mainnet *today*, so these sorts of things are a reality (though the software is still being avidly tested and should only be considered in the "early beta" stage right now).What Vitalik voiced as a criticism of the Lightning Network was the following (which is also wrong):>[I don't think it's possible to spend less than ~10000 satoshis. Sure, you can use lightning channels, but entering a channel itself costs that amount, so you can't collect a payment *for the first time* if it's smaller](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/981073361714364417?s=20) The reason this is incorrect is because payment channels can be unilaterally funded. Vitalik doesn't seem aware of this fact, which means that what he said here is actually just a misunderstanding on his part.
7	1522778713	1	Batching is good, but doesn't help me if I have 1000 satoshis on a single address. Also, no exchange right now supports withdrawing less than 0.0001 BTC or so. Schnorr signatures aren't ready for mainnet yet.> The Lightning Network is operational on mainnet todayWanted to try it out, I was looking for wallets on Bitcoin.org, and couldn't find any which supported Lightning Network. Am I missing something?> payment channels can be unilaterally fundedOkay, didn't know this. Though I'm interested in trying out LN, every site I've stumbled upon offered either only the sources or testnet wallets.
6	1522764071	3	> Regular people don't care much about the tech, only useability.Regular people don't know what BCH is. 
7	1522779476	1	> Regular people don't know what BCH is. BCH is Bitcoin from 2016, the original and improved taste. It has electrolytes! :D
6	1522757903	5	You do realize that transactions with a fee of a few Satoshi are going through BTC currently? 
7	1522758936	3	Let's not exaggerate. The lowest fee (unless you mine yourself) is 1 sat/vbyte and the lowest transaction size is [110 vbytes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m8ald/how_do_i_calculate_my_fees_for_a_transaction_sent/drs3nk3/). So on chain, the lowest practical fee is 110 satoshi. But indeed you can move 1000 satoshi (about $0.07) by paying 110 satoshi fee (about $0.008). 
8	1522759149	2	Thanks for clearing up. Who the hell would want to transfer anything less than 1$ via wire tho anyway? 
8	1522765069	1	The minimum allowed payment amount is 546 satoshis for a legacy tx or 298 sat for a segwit tx. This is the point at which spending the payment would cost 1/3 of the payment amount if you pay the minrelaytxfee.The default dust threshold is 3 satoshis/byte, or 3x the default minrelaytxfee setting. From the current version of the source:    CAmount GetDustThreshold(const CTxOut& txout, const CFeeRate& dustRelayFeeIn)    {        // "Dust" is defined in terms of dustRelayFee,        // which has units satoshis-per-kilobyte.        // If you'd pay more in fees than the value of the output        // to spend something, then we consider it dust.        // A typical spendable non-segwit txout is 34 bytes big, and will        // need a CTxIn of at least 148 bytes to spend:        // so dust is a spendable txout less than        // 182*dustRelayFee/1000 (in satoshis).        // 546 satoshis at the default rate of 3000 sat/kB.        // A typical spendable segwit txout is 31 bytes big, and will        // need a CTxIn of at least 67 bytes to spend:        // so dust is a spendable txout less than        // 98*dustRelayFee/1000 (in satoshis).        // 294 satoshis at the default rate of 3000 sat/kB.    https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3de01268b7048a9c85f31dc6d21d44b727e860a5/src/policy/policy.cpp#L18Older versions of the code had a comment that stated the 3x ratio more clearly:        // "Dust" is defined in terms of CTransaction::minRelayTxFee,        // which has units satoshis-per-kilobyte.        // If you'd pay more than 1/3 in fees        // to spend something, then we consider it dust.        // A typical txout is 34 bytes big, and will        // need a CTxIn of at least 148 bytes to spend:        // so dust is a txout less than 546 satoshis         // with default minRelayTxFee.https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.10.0rc3/src/primitives/transaction.h#L137
8	1522766373	1	Did you hear about the lightning network? It is possible to make thousands of payments securely on a payment channel while only making two on-chain transactions (one to open the channel and one to close it). That makes your fee-per-payment very small.Even without Lightning I regularly pay less than 3 cents' worth of BTC per transaction and sometimes less than 1 cent's worth. 110 satoshis isn't worth very much.
7	1522777446	1	I think you need at least 1 satoshi per byte, and a tx is around 250 bytes, so minimal fee is 250 satoshi for a 1 input 1 output tx. I'm aware BTC network works with very low fees at the moment. This could change in the future, though.
6	1522759748	2	BCH fees are only .02 cents/kb less than BTC.  The “lower fees” argument is being extinguished.
7	1522777971	1	What will happen during the next bullrun, in a year or two? I don't want to have my BTC stuck for months in mempool because everyone else want to move their coins too.
6	1522763781	2	Having no network effect and liquidity, is barely at all the same.
7	1522779362	1	Network effect is hard to build, but it can be shattered overnight with a single exploit or scandal. Bitcoin has both network effect and liquidity, but instead of increasing the block size, it went on a complicated route, with many potential bug hazards and years of development ahead.Instead of staying a slow and steady caterpillar, Bitcoin decided to entrench itself in a chrysalis, hoping to emerge someday as a butterfly. BCH said, okay, this form works, let's just become a longer and thicker caterpillar.
6	1522766670	1	Doesn't matter. I could copy Facebook tomorrow with better privacy and no ads, do you think everyone will start using it cause there isn't a difference? Regular people don't care about tech, that's why they don't care about most alts or Bcash, which tout an improvement of tech over Bitcoin.
7	1522779695	1	But they know about Bitcoin, right? That's what BCH is targeting. It's like having to choose between 2 ketchup bottles, and one of them is advertising itself "no radioactive cobalt inside!" They both get the job done, so it's more a matter of marketing which will win. 
6	1522768533	1	> For a consumer, BCH works exactly the same as BTCThis is a clear false dichotomy. If you design your business only around the consumer and do not design it to reflect the cost of business then your business will fail.Resource Management actually matters when it comes to *decentralized* systems.It appears to me that you've not thought this through very much and you are just parroting what other uneducated bcash supporters have said to you.LN will enable **sub-satoshi** payments. Get out of here with your 1000 Satoshi statement, it has no meaning when you understand the capability of LN.There's a reason why all of the experts reach consensus years ago that such a path was unequitable. You want to engage in anti-intellectualism and against meritocracy then that's your bad and you'll be on the wrong side of History.

2	1522758796	-4	Vitalik is pro anything that causes disruption to Bitcoin and any other coin that compete with Ethereum. If he feels he can cause negative pressure he will say just about anything to cause an argument.

That is Nassim Talebs first ethical Rule and every single person that has ever done a convention with csw is enabling his scam by allowing him to speak.When you have [overwhelming proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89cbsc/vitalik_buterin_calls_out_craig_wright_for_what/dwq8d1m/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Bitcoin) that someone has engaged in continuous repetitive fraudulent Behavior than it is not censorship when you disallow them to speak. It's called basic fucking responsibility people.What if there was a fraudulent Insurance Company?

1	1522758146	2	Not sure they have ran out of money, but they are certainly leaking millions a day if you consider the bitmain angle. They know they can’t spend their way out of this so they have to be more clever this time around.I consider these scam artists quite clever in the narrative they have spun, but they have played their wildcards at absolutely the wrong time. If they played them as we start going back up, they can ride the BTC wave up to a ATH where as playing them over the past 6 months just means they have created a depressed period that will be difficult to buy out off. I guess it’s easy to look back at now though.I know it’s slightly off topic but it always gets me that both bitmain and bitcoin.com mining pool both also mine BTC.
2	1522765966	1	You make very good points.

1	1522758935	10	Why is VB a scammer?
2	1522759194	-1	Ethereum insiders gave themselves 12 million ETH at launch, which was never agreed to in the initial crowdsale. ETH is a huge scam piggybacking on Bitcoin invention. Ironically Ethereum’s biggest use case is to facilitate scams (ICOs).
3	1522760837	1	Interesting I didn't know that about the 12 million. Although I don't think that flat out makes him a scammer. 
4	1522762694	-4	It was 12 million ETHs given directly to them + 60 million premine with the cash given to them = 72 million premineEthereum is a premined scam.1)	Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense  to the credulous. http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/https://archive.fo/VZbPshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF42) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but "rich statefulness"4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?5) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUVlatCvp0https://medium.com/startup-grind/i-was-wrong-about-ethereum-804c9a906d36https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/Additionally, there are plenty of ICO's who have locked up Ethereum's and need to constantly sell them for fiat to pay for their burn rate going into next year which places a constant negative pressure on ETH price
5	1522767968	1	Ethereum is still solid technology in my opinion despite the arguments mainly about the startup venture process.
6	1522768136	1	Ethereum is buggy , poor scaling , pointless technology with a wide attack surface.Even if it had a clean launch the whole project would be pointless. If you don't understand why there is a very big chance you aren't a developer and have been fooled by these frauds with buzzwords.What code can't you run on your home computer or server to warrant the price of gas?
7	1522769620	1	I've had a good experience with my personal use of the network and testnet, and also like how it's sparked a large amount of organizations to take on more innovation in the Cryptocurrency space as well as research different approaches.
8	1522769701	1	why pay the gas tax when you don't need to for running code?Any competent programmer can tell you there is no censorship risk in code execution or possibility of censorship risk in code execution due to the nature of code obfuscation
7	1522775465	1	> What can you do with money that you can't on you bank account or paypal to warrant the price of bitcoin transactions?Sounds like a real nice argument, doesn't it?
8	1522775741	1	There is censorship in value transfer and storage though and bitcoins primary purpose is regulatory arbitrage and uncensorable store of wealth and transfer.

It also has a multi billion market cap.So why is Vitalik not considered a fraud, does he not consider himself a fraud? Im genuinely curious
1	1522762055	11	Craig Wright is a serial fabricator and liar. Here's just some of the evidence:1. He faked [blog posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80ryvc/craig_wright_2008_august_26_blog_post_i_have_a/duxwsyk/)2. He faked [PGP keys](https://medium.com/@tbrice/wrights-appeal-to-authority-paper-disproved-its-own-thesis-8f2d45e5df24)3. He faked [contracts and emails](http://blog.wizsec.jp/2018/02/kleiman-v-craig-wright-bitcoins.html)4. He faked [threats](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80o2xf/its_time_for_another_reminder_craig_wright_is_not/duxbjuw/) 5. He faked [a public key signing](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/05/craig-wright-s-proof-he-invented-bitcoin-is-basically-a-canadian-girlfriend.html)6. He has a [well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related](https://www.scribd.com/document/372445546/Bitcoin-Lawsuit) (see numbers 88 through 102)7. His own mother [admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-1655.0-1655.94)And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:1. He has provided no independently verifiable evidence2. He is not [technically competent](http://archive.is/6C3C9) in the subject matter3. His [writing style](http://seclists.org/basics/2008/Mar/42) is nothing like [Satoshi's](http://satoshinakamoto.me/)4. He [called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011](https://theconversation.com/lulzsec-anonymous-freedom-fighters-or-the-new-face-of-evil-2605#comment_6162) when Satoshi never used a space5. He [actively bought and traded coins](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hx3q9/according_to_the_mtgox_leaks_from_early_2014_our/) from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 20146. He was [paid millions](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-729.989-732.0) for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive
2	1522768468	1	its obvious Craig Wright is a fraud. Hes done and dusted. Why not focus on the bigger scammer Vitalik?
1	1522762747	5	What are you even getting at? Vitalik never claimed to be Satoshi, while failing at the necessary proofs and offering endless excuses and prevarications. Wright's been making a fool of himself or worse for a long time. It's astonishing there are people naive enough to give him any credence at this point.Wright is a great source for humor (watching him get the concept of velocity of money totally backwards gave me giggles), but he should probably be in jail for tax fraud, not running around making a fool of himself and anyone dumb enough to associate with him.https://fusion.kinja.com/why-craig-wright-so-desperately-wanted-to-be-bitcoin-cr-1793857666https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6y1e5t/craig_s_wright_is_not_satoshi_nakamoto_and_why/
2	1522768402	1	> Vitalik never claimed to be SatoshiBecause he is smart. That doesent mean he is not a scammer tho.
3	1522777728	1	Why would anyone claim he's a scammer? He's a very bright young man who was early into Bitcoin and saw a world of new possibilities via what became Ethereum. 
1	1522760878	3	For me its because one of them never claimed to be satoshi.
2	1522761553	0	ok but thats not the argument vitalik makes here. As far as i understand vitaliks problem is that craig uses alot of "techno babble". Pretty sure Ethereum proponents does this as well. Why? Well to pump the coin.. I dont see a difference between Craig Wright/Bitcoin Cash and Vitalik Buterein/Ethereum in this regard. Please correct me if im wrong.
3	1522761974	1	I get where you're coming from, but its all about the process of peer review. It seems to me that the peer review process for CSW is not going quite as well as the peer review process for Joseph Poon's Lightning Network. 
4	1522768629	1	Im actually curious about the review of the lightning network but thats besides the point.The question is if Vitalik really believes in the stuff he spews or not, and i dont think he does. He only does what he does if he believes it can pump the price of Ethereum. But he would never say this. Probably only the people who are closest with him understand this, and maybe they never even discussed it. There is just a common understanding of pump Ethereum or else. Thats all that matters. Anyway, whatever. Who actually cares.
5	1522770537	1	Yeah I'm not that bothered either and I'm certainly not a fan of eth. Be interesting to see how the SEC legal wrangling plays out with all those ICO's that promised so much, and delivered so little. 
3	1522764399	1	Right, Ethereum and all the "rich statefulness" bullshit is hardly above board and clearly designed to get Vitalik and his friends rich. But comparing it to Craig Wrights outright lies that have no grain of truth is like comparing Mary Kay to Berny Madoff.
4	1522768216	1	You are not making any sense. In reality what Craig Wright and Vitalik is doing is the excact same thing. Technobabble to informed people in order to pump a coin. You dont need as high an IQ and as much information to spot Craig Wrights nonesense as you do with Vitalik. But that doesent make one any less of a scammer than the other. 
5	1522768913	1	Yes, they both do technobabble, but Craig Wright goes a step farther by forging letters and contracts, and providing false proof through elaborate schemes to bamboozle members of the community.Vitalik's ideas are pumped and (I believe) not sustainable in the long run, but at least he did create something to sell. There is a difference between pumping something and selling it for more than it is worth and selling something that doesn't exist, like the patents CSW sold to nChain by claiming he was Satoshi.Vitalik is slimy and schemey like a used car salesman. CSW is a flat-out a fraudster, like the Nigerian prince I just got an email from.
