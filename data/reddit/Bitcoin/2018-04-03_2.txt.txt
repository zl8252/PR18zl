0	1522722721	75	FINALLY this space has been lacking immature 13 year olds
1	1522725897	27	Your mom has been lacking immature 13 year olds
2	1522730278	20	Not according to my Dota teammates
3	1522754650	9	NoT AccORdinG tO mY FoRTnite sQUAd
4	1522770090	1	Lol
1	1522724688	5	To be fair... most 13 year olds are not usually investors, especially in highly volatile assets. All of the immature people in this sub are probably over 18, which is so much worse.
2	1522724741	2	I invested in bitcoin when I was 12But yes I see your point 
3	1522724881	5	What got you into Bitcoin at such a young age? At the age of 12 I was mostly concerned with unlocking all of the characters in Super Smash Bros. Melee. I did not even know what stocks were.
4	1522725026	4	Simple, I wanted to buy things online and that's all people acceptedIn fact after searching the term bitcoin in my email showed me that I would message people on Ebay if they would like to buy my clash of clans accounts for bitcoin
5	1522725454	5	Actually, that totally makes sense then. My brother used to do the same with Runescape when he was a teenager. Would have probably been the same if he were a teen today.I also got into Bitcoin to buy things online come to think of it. That's how it started anyway.
6	1522725643	3	See that's how people should get into bitcoin, as a use cause. It wasn't until early 2017 did I even consider holding bitcoin as an investmentDo I sometimes look back at every multi bitcoin transaction I sent and wonder what if, sure, but I thank my lucky stars that I was involved that early
5	1522737374	1	Impossible i've done everything and nowhere bitcoin was used, except for drugs, but then again you couldnt buy bitcoins anywhere.
6	1522737522	1	Well I was buying social media followers and servers
4	1522771529	1	I assume you knew what money is tho
1	1522731321	1	Actually imagine crypto currency gains when everyone under 18 uses it because they cant get credit cards.  Kids only being able to use cash is really missing out on an opportunity.  
2	1522731880	2	In this utopian world how are these kids with no credit cards or bank accounts getting their crypto?
3	1522732643	1	Content Creation jobs, art, writing, streaming etc.
4	1522768283	1	Locally owned elbow macaroni Valentine's card delivery services.
3	1522732585	0	Lol.  It isn't very utopian.  From allowance from parents, from odd jobs, from other kids who pay them for goods or services....basically you are asking how kids get money now.  Lol.  
4	1522768392	1	Funny thing: parents tend to want to lock down their kids' spending money in the same way that banks want to lock down citizens' spending money.Parents are more likely to get their kids prepaid plastic so they can stalk their spending habits.Kids are more likely to get crypto the same way they get booze or cigarettes. Buying it with cash from the cool kid.
5	1522770083	1	They could track it on the block chain.  
2	1522754223	-2	Wew, yeah man. What an opportunity they are missing out on. Right now they are using cash, which is accepted everywhere and between all groups of their friends, when they COULD BE using crypto, which is accepted nowhere!Plus, since they dont have bank accounts, they cant cash out the crypto for something useful! WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. This was the perfect use case, I cannot believe I hadnt thought of it before.It's like you people dont even fucking think about what youre saying or how it would work. BUT A CARTOON MENTIONED SOMETHING, MUST MAKE UP A GOOD OUTLOOK.
3	1522756068	0	Yoe are so short sighted.  Kids want to make online purchases, are more tech minded and woul be quick to move away from physical cash, etc.  Also to "cash out" they'd just have to sell for cash, but there will be no reason to do that grandpa.  That'd be like printing all your emails to read later. Eventually everyone will be accepting crypto almost. 
4	1522757703	1	Online purchases, like to Steam maybe? Oh, wait... they stopped accepting Bitcoin.....Im not short sighted. This "opportunity" isnt here yet. Just because Im not exuberrant about the thought of 13 year olds having crypto, doesnt mean I dont think it can get their one day.Youre unreasonable and fanatical.
5	1522758711	0	Kids have no other options for digital purchase except crypto.  Yeah, it might take a year or two, but it will happen.
6	1522762274	1	How do you think they are making those purchases now?  Smh.This isnt a huge market, man. You're missing the forest for the trees.What you mean to say is "When Bitcoin acceptance is ubiquitous enough that even 13 year olds want to use it to make transactions, adoption will be on the rise and price should follow".You're acting like 13 year olds allownace money is going to push the price up (thats actually exactly what you said), which is absolutely ridiculous. Plus, the infrastructure isnt even in place. Get excited when lightning is released, tested, and adopted by many. Dont hold your breath dude, will take YEARS. How about you try being realistic?
7	1522770147	1	You are not realiving the amount of money kids 11-17 spend....
8	1522770355	1	Lol, you're funny, kiddo.
0	1522725772	9	The soundtrack to Craig of the Creek is done by Jeff Rosenstock who totally fucking rocks. Check him out!
1	1522726185	4	Hell yeah! Do you work in licensing too? I've never encountered someone outside the  "industry" who's a fan of cartoon composers.Of course I just work on ads, a cartoon would be a dream come true 
2	1522726431	4	This is Jeff's first foray into composing for cartoons - he's otherwise a musician who's notable for the bands he's been a part of, notably Bomb! the Music Industry, and several stellar albums released under his own name. You should look him up!
3	1522726828	3	This guy fucking knows
2	1522726806	2	My daughters and I are huge Jeff Rosenstock fans. We've been to a few of his recent shows and love his previous work with Bomb the Music Industry and Arrogant Sons of Bitches. He's a legend in the ska/punk scene!
0	1522730087	6	Get them young. 
1	1522738283	6	This is how with a single statement andreas something something changed in my eyes from snake oil salesman to crypto groomer. Too far.
0	1522726219	3	So, basically just like 99.99999% of America?
0	1522725853	3	wtf this beanie baby is legal tender round these parts
0	1522754131	1	Actually, many people were tempted to buy inexpensive bitcoins in the past, and then they sold or changed for nothing or, worse, lost. So you can only sympathize...
0	1522763780	1	They do say you gotta teach them from a young age! I saw a blog post a short while ago regarding this, so not surprising to see this reference on CN.
0	1522769940	1	im not sure if the kids take and get it.
0	1522731616	1	Cartoon network references lots of stuff about how broken the economy is. People are sick of me pointing it out but I am still very much entertained.
0	1522726913	0	TO THE MOON Y'ALL 
0	1522742323	0	If I had gotten to know the crypto when I was young!
0	1522751260	-1	Is bitcoin is really dead ? I am really too much afraid about these kind of news. because I bought 3 bitcoin when it was $16k. Please suggest and support me I am really afraid.
