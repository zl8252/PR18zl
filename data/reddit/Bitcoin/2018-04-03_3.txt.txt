1	1522767884	1	Good ol' low energy Jeb.
1	1522767669	1	One sells Guac, the other Guano.
2	1522775727	1	I can see Roger pushing his own branded bcash bowls
1	1522767245	1	I wish I had gold to give you for including the exclamation point.
1	1522771026	1	Sock Puppets will clap on command.
1	1522774926	1	Sad!

0	1522749990	45	Though the Craig Wright bits were funny (the [negative gamma](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/981081916731371520?s=20) parts [in particular](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/981082253949202432?s=20)), Vitalik apparently [doesn't understand a few things about the Lightning Network](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/981073361714364417?s=20); entering a channel can be totally free for the recipient; the sending party simply funds it. Also, it's pretty obvious that he is trying to legitimize [arguments that aren't actually legitimate](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/981091563005657089?s=20); "what makes something sound money" is being backed by a (scarce) commodity (or actually being a commodity itself) and thus not susceptible to arbitrary levels of emission/inflation by a central governing agency. Ver likes to [mock people about having "no understanding of economics"](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/roger_ver_847292) and try (pathetically hard) to [brag about his own knowledge of economics](http://web.archive.org/web/20171109152911/https://forum.bitcoin.com/economics/blockstream-supporters-mock-those-who-study-economics-t49159.html) but this is a demonstration of him showing *just how little he knows*; he doesn't even have a grasp of basic terminology! To see him say stuff like this (and see Vitalik "agree") is facepalm-inducing, to say the least.It's obvious at this point that Vitalik is intent on taking potshots at Bitcoin whenever and however he can; it makes sense why he would try to, but it really doesn't reflect well on him at all. Embarrassing, really.
1	1522757585	9	but what does anything of this have to do with clapping?
2	1522757921	7	Haha, good question. I was replying to the [long tweet-storm](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/981069924255739904) that the OP's "you can clap" tweet image was taken from.In other words: not a whole lot!
1	1522763766	4	Actually I read that as implying that money is more sound if more people are using it. As in, less susceptible to wild swings in value, which is true
2	1522765992	1	The quote is "Roger: I think transactions/usage is what *makes* something sound money" which is just false. And no, you're incorrect, money is not "more sound if more people are using it" and all that shows is that you don't know what "sound money" means.One of the *critiques* that has been historically leveled against sound money is that it is *prone* to swings in value (because its value is fundamentally market-driven rather than stabilized by some intervening or fiddling government); that's arguably the biggest rationalization for *why* modern governments pretty much all use fiat money instead of sound money. Whether this "stabilization" is truly sustainable (or even worthwhile to pursue) over the long-term is another subject entirely, my only point here is that Roger, much like you, doesn't seem to understand what the phrase "sound money" actually means in economic parlance. "Sound" isn't just a loose synonym for "good" or anything.Your "interpretation" would be like arguing to a mathematician "Pi is a *rational number* because circles are perfectly rational geometric shapes, much more 'rational' than silly things like hexagons or octagons, and pi is intimately related to circles!" The phrase "rational number" has an actual meaning in mathematics, and your "argument" in this example would just show that you're not well versed with this meaning.
3	1522767434	1	Alright fair enough, I certainly don't know what sound means in an economic context.I think we can both agree that more adoption means less swings though. If everyone used btc it would be pretty dang stable
4	1522768732	1	Usage and soundness of money are two different things.  Everyone in Venezuela used the bolivar, but that doesn't protect them from volatility or hyperinflation.  
4	1522770475	1	Yes, I agree with that. More adoption means more liquidity which means less drastic price swings.And since you're not trying to make fun of other people (on a regular basis) on the basis of them "not understanding economics" while pretending to be a super amazing incredible economist yourself, and you are willing (and gracious) enough to admit a tiny terminological oversight, my opinion of you is that *you're a cool dude who seems good-hearted, friendly, and reasonably intelligent*.My only grief is with Roger, who isn't so friendly ([or honest](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87t3ot/comment/dwh4n51)) a lot of the time.
5	1522774273	1	Aw :D you made me smile irl You're cool too <3, thanks for the info on what sound means. And wow that's a comprehensive post about Roger. Seems like a shady guy. The only celebrities I follow in the crypto space are devs who've contributed a lot though, and that keeps me pretty safe from the BS ones like this Roger guy
1	1522759399	3	Exactly. Well put.

2	1522768774	1	Hi cobranet.
2	1522762742	3	>I would have liked had he worked with BitcoinWhether or not anyone chooses to contribute to Bitcoin development is up to them. There isn't an obvious "money-grab" opportunity when it comes to just rolling up your sleeves and writing code (or offering peer review, or testing, or documentation, or any other type of technical contribution) for Bitcoin, though... so the most obvious explanation here is that Vitalik was more interested in the rewards for launching (not to mention governing) an altcoin than he was in helping with Bitcoin protocol development.He wrote some (fairly simple) Bitcoin-oriented Python tools and a minimal library, but that's all he ever tried to do in this department. His choice to do an ICO (and from then on to actively deride Bitcoin whenever he got the chance in what seems to be an underhanded effort at promoting his own platform) is lamentable, but speaks more to his quality-of-character (or lack thereof) than anything else.Also, just for the record and while we're on the subject, Satoshi pretty much said "Let's *not* try and turn Bitcoin into something generalized like Ethereum, because that [doesn't scale](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28917#msg28917), and we can always do cross-chain atomic swaps if we really need to." So the whole idea of "making Bitcoin into an Ethereum-like protocol" was shot down by Satoshi years before Vitalik even started paying attention to cryptocurrency... if he wanted to pursue building such a network, that's his right, but let's not pretend like "if we were nicer, we could have prevented Ethereum from existing" (or even like that would be a desirable outcome). Ethereum has a lot of warts that we're lucky Bitcoin does not suffer from (though it certainly has its own).>Cobra has been labeled a traitor.Cobra is a purely-pseudonymous actor in the space who inexplicably was handed (effectively) "final say" over the content of bitcoin.org, which has served as the "de facto official Bitcoin site" since the beginning of the project. At least some of his accounts were compromised a while back, and we have no way of knowing whether control was ever regained by the "original Cobra" (or even who that is, or what their qualifications are). The current controller of (at least some) of Cobra's social accounts seems to enjoy attention and stirring up drama, and many people are uncomfortable with the seeming influence that such a divisive entity might theoretically destructively wield if they were so inclined, especially because we have no proof (or even evidence) that the account(s) haven't fallen into "the wrong hands" (as they did before, and where they very conceivably could have remained). Cobra is not responsible (as far as we know) for the creation or launch of any altcoins, though, so once again, your "I wonder how many altcoins we can breed" statement doesn't really make any sense in this context, and it looks more like you're trolling than like you're trying to contribute something meaningful here.
3	1522765672	2	Vit worked on Eth because it is a much different project. This post was about a somewhat funny (and certainly demeaning) moment for Ver, YOU are the one intentionally trying to label Vitalik as a money grabber when regardless of what you think, he has done so much for crypto overall. Also, when you use these puppies right here ", you should stick to actually what people say, not what "Satoshi pretty much" know what I mean?
4	1522766109	1	Your comment is unintelligible.
5	1522767160	1	No, it's not. I understood him fine, he didn't deliver the information that clearly but his comment is not unintelligible. He simply states that 1) despite your accusations of vitalik being a money grabber, he has widely contributed to the crypto space and 2) that you shouldn't use an assumption of what satoshi said as a literal quote.
6	1522770079	1	>despite your accusations of vitalik being a money grabber he has widely contributed to the crypto space I didn't say "Vitalik is a money grabber" (though I did point out the profit opportunity that serves as the most obvious explanation for his decision to eschew contributing to Bitcoin in favor of launching and steering an altcoin) nor did I deny any contributions of his. Re-read the thread, refrain from strawmanning me, and this time try to understand the insinuations of the comment I responded to, and how these were addressed.>you shouldn't use an assumption of what satoshi said as a literal quote.Again, let's refrain from the blatant strawman arguments, please. As they say these days, this is fake news.
1	1522767640	1	If something is scarce it doesnt mean it is sound money. Something with limited availability can both rise and fall in value depending on the usage. For example, if we start developing all conductive materials out of gold, gold price will rise rapidly. So, somethig being stable in value does indeed depend on usage as well. Also, limited availability is not much different from 1% inflation and bitcoin has inflation of about 4%
1	1522770537	1	Unrelated comment geta first spot becouse people here just want to read something positive about Bitcoin, or someone defending Bitcoin.Mine question. Will it increase price of Bitcoin if you upvote such comments?

1	1522772643	1	He's a very smart and entertaining person. IMHO his only big mistake so far is accepting responsibility for every contract still on his blockchain by rejecting one of them.
0	1522744552	7	Hah. Well we all knew he's shit at public speaking (unless its a BBQ in someones backyard).I've taken to referring to him by an ironic acronym.S.L.I.C.Sadly Lacking In Charisma
1	1522747595	9	Ver? Yeah, that dude has the charisma of a porcupine with a rusty saw in it's anus singinging karaoke on amphetamines.
2	1522747850	3	I'm not saying he's slippery but his friends at school used to call him AstroGlide.
3	1522777862	1	I'm not sure if that was for the reason you're thinking...
0	1522744305	7	Can you link to the tweets, Vitalik has always been positive about Bcash. I'm wondering if he is waking up.
1	1522744552	11	oh nah it's overall pretty positive. he just posted a huge thread about the challenges crypto faces and that was one of the tweets taken out of context. you should go read the full thing, it's worth it:https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/981074795973373952
2	1522744866	2	I just did, but thanks. I'd like to see what Vitalik means by Roger being aggressive and I wonder why that surprises him? Not being critical, I'm similar, but Roger is passionate about his stance even if its misguided. 
3	1522745504	1	the thread is still going, he is still adding to it with examples of interactions.
4	1522748729	7	The only valid argument that Roger has in my opinion is that the fees MUST be low on chain. Samson says "If the restaurant is full you wait", firstly, no you don't you realize you should have booked, you leave, and never go there again without booking in advance not to waste your time again.... and secondly we are not talking about restaurants, what kind of dumb analogy is that? 
5	1522749555	1	You can compare bitcoins open decentralized ledger more to your home garden. If everyone in the world is harvesting at your garden, your garden system will eventually collapse. Roger is actually trying to convert your garden into his highly centralized farm. The best part is he is even the owner of the store where you buy the tools and seeds.The core developer actually trying to bring other people to start their own garden.Roger didn't help to make the bitcoin ecosystem stronger, he made it weaker by funding third parties that bitcoin should have made obsolete in the first place(Bitpay, Blockchain.info)...
6	1522749899	3	I can agree with your analogy, the garden is the nodes.
6	1522770628	1	Yup, good analogy with the gardens!
2	1522751600	6	That was funny, two shitcoiners circle jerking each other
3	1522778351	1	lol calling eth a shitcoin is kind of hilarious considering what it can do.

1	1522751352	4	Vitalik sees bitcoin as a threat to him being centralised emperor, he is smart enough to understand divide and conquer.    Also he doesn't like core Devs calling out his previous frauds like his quantum computing scam. 
2	1522754555	3	>he is smart enough to understand divide and conquer. I can see this would make complete sense.
1	1522776246	1	Hes just prolly not happy about all those sockpuppets.
