1	1522730973	5	At the accelerating rate the world is changing, i wouldn't bet on it.
2	1522731431	2	Only time will tell, couldn't care though... I store money on bitcoin... was just pointing out that such predictions are near-useless without a timeframe... That's like saying, the world will end..  statistically, I have a good chance of being right.. but without a timeframe, there's little u can do with such info...

1	1522759549	1	good joke
0	1522770677	1	i would die to know "when"?
0	1522771188	1	What allows these central banks to exist and function that way.... I know, capitalism. Capitlaism breeds centralized power just look at corperations, it's the very definintion of centralized power. No i'm not a socilaist or communist because all the past versions of these systems are also centralized.
1	1522772218	1	But capitalism is just individuals owning property, right? Why couldn't we do that without corporations?
2	1522774169	1	then we have to change the rules of the current economic system, is it doable? yes.
0	1522741735	-1	Really? Bitcoin cash will be pop "bubble"
1	1522772314	1	Wrong subreddit, no one here cares about Bcash.
0	1522744748	0	Someday banks will have to deal with btc.
0	1522733916	-13	Bitcoin Cash will pop "Real Bitcoin Bubble" Also Created by Central Banks 
1	1522738446	10	Ha Ha Ha Your BCH shitcoin is fucked. Good riddance again. But thanks for the free air drop. Cashed out when this piece of crap was near its never to be repeated ATH.
2	1522741765	4	You too!? I was laughing the whole time switching out free shit coins for the real deal! So glad I acted fast! :)
2	1522744655	3	At bcash's recent peak to $3000, BTC was at $18000 giving it a ratio of 6:1 (coinbase put it all the way at $8k, never forget those that bought there). Currently it is now at a ratio of 10.75:1. It's dying and you can really feel the pain seeing posts from the other sub. Still I don't doubt it will get another pump from Roger and his friends and I'll be ready to profit from their injections.
3	1522755863	1	Considering the same ratios with ETH, I think youre right.
1	1522740209	5	that you roger?
2	1522741578	1	Hahaha!
