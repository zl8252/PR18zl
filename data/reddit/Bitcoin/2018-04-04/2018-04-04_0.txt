But your statement comes off as pretty fair.Bitcoin got really popular, really fast while gox was under your control. Considering the increase in attack attempts that must have happened while you were in charge and the nature of bitcoin being what it is and how new it was then, it's not Terribly surprising how it went down. When I was your age, I don't think I could have handled it any better. It's easy to critique in hindsight from the outside like many do.Good luck going forward. Considering that you could probably single handedly crash bitcoin with what you have in your wallet... Uh... Please don't? 
1	1522837650	312	Thank you very much.I don't have control over the Bitcoins in the MtGox estate, however myself as well as many creditors are pushing for the trustee not to sell until a decision is reached for civil rehabilitation.
2	1522838450	143	Your trustee is destroying bitcoin with the sell offs. You should give customers their bitcoin back. 
3	1522838918	278	The trustee was appointed by the bankruptcy court and I have no control over this process at this point. I only wish to see bitcoins returned to all MtGox creditors as soon as possible.
4	1522839676	40	You can't control it now, but won't it be in your hands eventually? Whether through the coins going to you as shareholder, or you choosing to move towards civil rehabilitation?Are you saying that if you go the civil rehab route, there's a chance that the courts (arbitrators?) could insist that things be disbursed via fiat?Also... If the bankruptcy claims have been satisfied, the trustee shouldn't be planning on any further sales, right?
5	1522845932	57	By the time anything is "in my hands" it'd have reduced quite a lot (due to taxes, etc) and distributing it would still end in more costs/etc.If I had a say on moving things to civil rehabilitation, we would already be in civil rehabilitation (or more likely we would have never left civil rehabilitation for bankruptcy).
6	1522854916	1	Dude you just said it would make you a billion dollars at the end and now there's nothing you can do??
7	1522855526	1	The law says that after creditors are paid the remaining assets are liquidated to shareholders. He is saying he does not want this and will ask the court to move for civil rehabilitation. This means that anyone who lost BTC through MtGOX will be able to file a new claim and, after the claim period, BTC and BCH will be distributed fairly to claimants. 
7	1522856921	1	he is not the only share holder. The bitcoins will be sold off the money split. So he will have a part reduced by fees and conversion. That won't be enough to pay back everybody the amount they are owned which would be possible if the sell off doesn't happen to begin with.Yes he could pay back a part. The end result would be still unhappy bitcoin user and who still think of him as an asshole who didn't pay them back in full.
8	1522858888	1	He owns 88% of MtGox and said that the only other shareholder doesn't seem interested in his 12% of the surplus.Us creditors would be infinitely more happy with 20-25% of a bitcoin for each bitcoin we owned than with $483 per bitcoin.Being instrumental in the adoption of civil rehabilitation is his best chance at redeeming himself. I for one have forgiven his oversights and poor choices.
8	1522858560	1	> I don't want this. I don't want this billion dollars. From day one I never expected to receive anything from this bankruptcy. The fact that today this is a possibility is an aberration and I believe it is my responsibility to make sure it doesn’t happen.You can't go from saying this to this:> By the time anything is "in my hands" it'd have reduced quite a lot (due to taxes, etc) and distributing it would still end in more costs/etc.Which is it? Is he gonna have a billion dollars to pay people back or not? 
5	1522840859	14	What happens next is up to the court, Mark is a spectator like the rest of us at this stage.
4	1522852987	1	you should at least suggest to him to use Kraken and other large exchanges "dark pools" so they don't mess up the market when they decide to dump. Since this is exactly what they're designed for.[Kraken's Dark pool](https://blog.kraken.com/post/259/introducing-the-kraken-dark-pool/)
4	1522841720	11	How many creditors are there? And who are they? Do they want btc or cash?
5	1522845953	31	There are some 24750 creditors. Result of the pool for btc/cash were not published by the trustee.
6	1522847564	12	I missed the deadline to claim my losses as a creditor, and the site to submit a claim was broken for a long while; do I have any other recourse?
7	1522853273	1	Civil rehabilitation, if successful, will likely open a new filing window. I'd suggest monitoring the situation as things unfold.
7	1522852428	1	*If* and only if a CR process gets booted up, will you have a second chance...eye on the ball this time.
8	1522853187	1	I’m in the same boat !
5	1522843486	10	Nobody wants cash. That is like asking somebody whether they want 5 bucks or a winning lottery ticket bought for 5 bucks. 
6	1522845892	6	No it's more like asking somebody whether they want the cash value of the winning lottery ticket or the lottery ticket itself.
7	1522853205	1	Please don't try to correct a good analogy with a shitty one. 
3	1522851002	6	To counter that, if mtgox estate gave all their bitcoins to their rightful owners tomorrow, do you really think that people who had tens or even hundreds of BTC in 2013 and suddenly got it back wouldn't sell right away? especially because we are in a bear market. I think that would be a lot more damaging to the price if there was a sudden increase in supply like that.Also, if I'm not mistaken the trustee has been selling BTC in roughly the same amount consistently for years and nothing has changed recently. So I don't think it's really a reason for this downturn. 
3	1522848056	5	You can't 'destroy' Bitcoin by selling bitcoins...
4	1522851652	10	People dont care about bitcoin. They clearly want to get rich. You are not allowed to sell bitcoin before they do.Its like when people scream at you for dumping TSLA stock and destroying the company. Nope, Elon Musk controls the company. Im just dumping stock 
3	1522845659	2	The trustee is gifting a buying opportunity to new investors. At some point that window will close and all will benefit. Personally, I'm in no rush for that to happen. 
3	1522846081	2	Destroying bitcoin is such a ridiculous statement.  All because the price isn’t where you want it doesn’t mean the tech or principle behind bitcoin has been altered. There’s still plenty of people out there who got in well below current price. 
2	1522853112	1	I thought Roger Ver was a tone-deaf twat, but the absolute **GALL** to post this fucking thread proves beyond a doubt you've got a fucking ego a country-wide.What are you expecting?"Hey Mark, its totes cool you fucked up and screwed over a lot of people - < fist bump >"Are you fucking delusional with this "ask me anything" bullshit?Count your lucky stars that you aren't STILL in jail, you self-absorbed, colluding, criminal, inept, social pariah.Fuck off.
3	1522857154	1	uh I don't think you understand. The japanese gov has HODL'ed until now. MtGox has declraed bankruptcy to pay their creditors. The fun thing is since they HODL so long they can pay back their creditors easily and he and his shareholders still  rack in millions of profits. Which will outrage people like you to no end and they are going to demand his head. He doesn't want that so he is here to raise awareness for the issue before it happens. That's kinda fair.
0	1522840375	96	What happened to the funds in the MtGox Polish bank account (IBAN PL59109023980000000117595694)? In the last days of MtGox many people (including me) credited that account with Euros but they never made the website account balance. Unfortunately, all the claims were rejected by the bankruptcy trustee Mr. Kobayashi.
1	1522846188	62	MtGox Poland has filed for bankruptcy and I believe all funds ended being spent in bankruptcy fees, but I don't know for sure as the trustee's report doesn't list the detail there.I hear many claims were accepted after rejection being fought, and it's likely civil rehabilitation will open a new claim filing window. I'd suggest for everyone to file claims then if they have had been rejected.
0	1522838483	71	Are you the full shareholder of Mt.Gox?So what do you intend to do with the 160k BTC+BCH if you do not want them?
1	1522842696	136	MtGox has two shareholders, Tibanne (88%) and Jed McCaleb (12%). Tibanne has only one shareholder, me. Because both Tibanne and myself are bankrupt there are various layers before I have a say in anything that would happen.Ideally I'd like to redistribute the BTC/BCH to creditors if it ever happens to be given to me, but hopefully things won't get that far as a very large chunk would end being lost to taxes, that's why Civil Rehabilitation is so important.
2	1522847023	73	Oh man, I lost just north of 200 coins there.  If you were to reimburse people, at least in part, than would help a lot of people out.I hope you are able to do it...  Good luck with everything.
3	1522853338	1	Hopefully you were able to submit and get a claim accepted. Let me know if you encounter any issue or have questions on the process.
4	1522858612	1	> Hopefully you were able to submit and get a claim accepted. Having my claim accepted and subsequently told I'd receive essentially 0.03 USD for my 0.6 BTC, left me feeling like fuck everyone involved. I cannot imagine having lost as much as your other customers. 
4	1522855135	1	How do I submit a claim?  I lost about 100 coin myself. 
5	1522861140	1	You lost 100 BTC but did not care enough to file a claim? In the worst times after MtGox these were still 25k usd.
5	1522857270	1	The due date for online claims has passed. You can submit formal claims in writing to:https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/207061757
5	1522864099	1	This was long possible already. I don't get how people lose ~100 btc and not monitor every day for news about the MtGox debacle. And right now don't even google how to claim them. How would one believe you really owned that much then? The only other options are you don't care about money (which I find hard to believe because you got involved with bitcoin) or you are already very rich and now seeing this reddit post by coincidence.
4	1522860771	1	Changing your claim address is a non-trivial process.  Can you make it possible to do it online?  And is it even necessary to update your address in order to receive a payout?
3	1522849786	11	Wait...200 BTC? Jesus dude
4	1522855887	1	In terms of mtgox losses, that is pretty much normal. Remember that when mtgox was a thing, people were buying a pizza for 10000BTC to send a message to the public. 200BTC was probably chump change those days depending on when they got in.
5	1522857843	1	Mt. Gox collapsed at a time just after $1200 per BTC. Lol. But yes it existed much much before that at the time when 10,000 btc would be spent for a pizza.
3	1522849586	14	Fucking hell, $4m at an all time high. So sorry man, hope things work out for you.
4	1522853832	1	~~"Only" $6k back when it was $30/BTC though.~~Edit: I'm stupid. When MtGox collapsed it was $1000, so 200 BTC was $200k.
5	1522854400	1	That was the value during the collapse? I'd at least tell myself theres no way I'd manage to hold them that long, but I'd never stop doing the math of what I *potentially* couldve had.
6	1522854594	1	That was the peak of the 2011 bubble, so they probably paid a lot less. :-(
7	1522857765	1	This crashed at end of 2013 btw. Not 2011. Man, so many people here are new
6	1522857419	1	dude I had a mining rig set up back when you could mine with GPUs.. I "only" made 1BTC per day so I shut it off after 1 hours noise and worries about the life time of my hardware.I **have to** believe I wouldn't have held.
7	1522859096	1	Jesus fuck. When was this? And you never bought either when seeing it grow?
6	1522859542	1	No it was far higher, around $1000 before Mt Gox crashed.
7	1522859758	1	I thought so as well, just don't understand the arbitrary price then. 
3	1522852945	1	I thought my 22 was bad, but 200 is nuts!  That was almost 100k just hanging on a shoddy exchange!  
3	1522859945	1	Fuck, man. $4,000,000 at the peak. I hope you get it back! 
2	1522851201	4	Have you spoken to Jed about his intentions? Would he follow along refunding all customers?
2	1522851151	3	> MtGox has two shareholders, Tibanne (88%)The cat???
2	1522853110	1	What happens specifically to all the BCH?
0	1522839054	170	Hi Mark,First off I'm glad you survived all the personal attacks and managed to stay sane and relatively active on reddit and IRC despite all the memes and hatred.I have had a few questions on my mind for years some of which you may be able to answer here.1. Who wrote/managed the "Willy bot" & what was it's intended purpose? 2. Pior to the closing of withdraws at Mt Gox at what point were you aware that the BTC had gone missing? 3. Chain analysis seems to show that the hacker/hackers were stealing coins for years prior to the final bankruptcy. Are you aware of any reason why they simply didn't empty the wallets completely? 4. Are there other company shareholders who also have claim to this extra BTC? Do they share your opinon that it is the creditors who deserve it?Despite what people may think Mt Gox helped build and shape this community. It showed people bitcoin had real value when it was just some cool tech. We learnt from Gox and the community is stronger because of it.Thank you
1	1522845811	69	Hi,1. I'm sorry but I cannot respond to that at this point due to ongoing legal proceedings.2. At the time withdrawals in BTC were closed only transaction malleability was known, and stopping withdrawals was a way to stop this from being abused as we couldn't track transfers which IDs were changed. While over 1000 BTC were stolen that way, it wasn't expected any large amount of BTC were missing until later investigation in MtGox assets, which then prompted filing for civil rehabilitation.3. Chances are the hacker couldn't transfer more, which resulted in avoiding detection.4. The only other shareholder would be Jed McCaleb, but I do not think he wants (nor needs to) claim anything.Hopefully this case can end soon with all assets distributed to creditors.
1	1522847863	19	> WillyHe won't respond to this, but https://willyreport.wordpress.com/ pretty much gives you the smoking gun about the Willy bot.
2	1522851188	3	Tldr?
3	1522853126	1	Mark was fully aware that coins were missing. He set Willy and Markus bots in order to buy them back (with users' fiat), which led to the Gox premium and withdrawal delays. Even if that might have been well intentioned (he wanted to corner the market and extract a profit that would make the users whole) it was poorly executed and ended up making things worse and accelerating bankruptcy.
1	1522843290	6	>First off I'm glad you survived all the personal attacks and managed to stay sane and relatively active on reddit and IRC despite all the memes and hatred.Not rotting away in jail and keeping a decent estate probably helps...
1	1522843021	2	**This**I'd love to see an answer /u/MagicalTux
0	1522838524	25	Did you leak the unlock keys for the free Yubikeys, or was that someone else?
1	1522842816	20	Someone clearly did. Those unlock keys can be used to reprogram the Yubikeys for another use, but the internal secret key wasn't leaked so the yubikeys were not compromised.
2	1522843351	3	Yeah, I still have mine (mainly because I was too lazy to ever take it off my keychain), and I used the leaked keys to reprogram it (don't really care about anything that was left on Gox). It's a cool little conversation piece when I found out people are into crypto.
2	1522843734	17	It's kinda noticeable that you didn't actually answer the question here...
0	1522839284	97	I have no question. I lost an INSANE amount of BTC on Mt. Gox. I was so mad for the longest and it really wasn't justifiable.  At the end of the day shit happens, we all knew the risk and greed prevails over all. I hope you are able to forgive yourself for what happened. I hold no grudge and wish no ill upon you mate.
1	1522846407	36	I'm so sorry I wasn't able to avoid MtGox going into bankruptcy, and I hope distribution of all assets to creditors can happen as soon as possible.
2	1522858971	1	I mean, we've been waiting for years and years. They keep meeting, getting nothing done, and then agreeing to meet again in 6 months, where again they do nothing and agree to meeting again in 6 months. This has been going on for YEARS. I have lost all hope in getting ANY of my thousands of dollars back. 
1	1522860252	1	If you get even 20% back through this you will have my.gox to thank for probably making you a shit ton of money though force hodling
1	1522842136	10	You sir, are a trooper.I only lost a small amount of BTC on MT. Gox and I'm still mad.
1	1522843215	4	I wasn't in btc back then - were there no wallets etc? Or were exchanges believed to be safe?
2	1522845389	12	There were wallets before exchanges. People trusted Mt. Gox like they trust Coinbase, Gemini, Binance etc today as they make it easier for people to invest.
3	1522862174	1	Cheers guys. I had a read through the 'horror stories' thread on here from Feb 25th 2014 - horrifying stuff. The most upvoted comment was a poor chap who lost 4500. Crazy to keep nearly $2m (at the time) on an exchange. 
2	1522856423	1	Most people used dat files on external hard drives and paper and things.  There were wallets.  A lot of early miners foolishly didn't treat it as real money back then (myself included), and didn't mind storing it on "the exchange."  I only lost 22BTC, I know guys who lost 10x that much through gox and just plain negligence. 
2	1522863078	1	There were wallets and there were exchanges, but MtGox was the largest of them all.  And people's wallets on their home computers were hacked occassionally too.  At that time I was mining alt-coins and I would take the mining proceeds, convert to BTC, move to MtGox, sell, and then do an ACH to my US bank account.   I had a scheme of selling 30% and keeping 70% and I kept my BTC on my home computer - and still have most of them.  But I used MtGox to cash out.  There were other exchanges, but lots of them had been hacked - it was a weird time - and MtGox seemed as good as any other and being the largest exchange it seemed safer than most.In the end, I lost 3.1 BTC - which was what was in transit at the time.   And if that seems like an insane amount of money, my recollection at the time was that it was worth about $800 or so.  My claim was accepted, I'm on the list, I paid my $100 to join "MtGox Legal" and I hope Civil Rehabilitation happens.I thought this thread was pretty interesting though.
0	1522837327	95	Is the official story still that people were withdrawing BTC, modifying the txid via a malleability attack, claiming the withdrawal didn't occur, and your support team was issuing them their funds back?  If not, can you shed light on what you believe actually occurred?
1	1522839031	140	Transaction malleability was also used to steal Bitcoins from MtGox, but nowhere near the kind of amounts that were stolen by Alexander Vinnik and/or whoever was working with him.You can read more details [on this article by Kim Nilsson on the wizsec blog](https://blog.wizsec.jp/2017/07/breaking-open-mtgox-1.html).
2	1522841856	26	How did Vinnik steal the coins from your cold wallet?
3	1522845982	36	He didn't. The coins were stolen from MtGox deposit (hot) addresses as soon as people made deposits in some cases.
4	1522847764	23	I see. So presumably, you've identify the security hole that allowed a third party to gain unauthorized access to your system?I know it's too late to fix it, but sometimes case studies of prior breaches are the best way to prevent future ones.
5	1522853419	1	Thanks to Kim Nilsson and blockchain analysis, it was possible to identify exactly what was stolen, when, and how it was used. I've asked the trustee to access the dat of server in question for further analysis but haven't received a positive response yet.
4	1522848108	11	Is there any official post-mortem on this?  Certainly you should have had server logs and transactions to back up this claim.  Just curious.
5	1522853442	1	Thanks to Kim Nilsson and blockchain analysis, it was possible to identify exactly what was stolen, when, and how it was used. I've asked the trustee to access the dat of server in question for further analysis but haven't received a positive response yet.
3	1522845549	5	he told in a documentary, that it was stolen from hot wallet, little by little for a long time
3	1522849498	2	Mark never changed hot wallets after the first breach and the coins were slowly siphoned off over a period of a few years from the same hot wallet. Since there was no responsibility or care (auditing? simple accounting practices) put into handling other peoples money, the money being stolen many hundreds of times was never noticed. Sadly, had mark had a controller level accounting person, they likely would have noticed it within a month or two and saved everyone a lot of heart ache.
2	1522843256	15	I don't think it is wise to be naming this person as a thief when there is a pending investigation and possible criminal trial.
3	1522846052	44	I named him as being either a thief, or involved in the theft working with third parties. It is my personal opinion, based on the available evidence, that he is involved. 
4	1522847047	4	I understood what you said and I still don't think it's wise. You're involved, he's possibly involved. You publicly airing your opinion about his involvement may compromise any future proceedings. I'm surprised your legal counsel would not advise you against this.
5	1522857581	1	I'm pretty sure what he is saying is that's his current legal answer "in court" as well.
3	1522848218	4	This is common knowledge old news to anyone who follows the Gox case and that blog post is from last year. Karpeles's opinion is irrelevant to the criminal investigation. You think he hasn't been questioned already? Anyway, investigation's are based upon evidence not his opinion and the guy has been arrested already.
2	1522841302	3	Which court ruled already that you can say it was him ?
0	1522838461	61	Why did MtGox keep assuring us up to the very last few days before it closed down for good, that our bitcoins were fucking safe?
1	1522840895	25	I'm very sorry about that. As MtGox neared bankruptcy only a part of the business was involved, and parts communicating with customers (customer support was mostly handled by companies hired in India, UK, etc) were not aware of what was happening, resulting in a lot of miscommunication.Actually keeping communication flowing within a company is far from simple and I was too focused on solving the largest issues (banks, governments, etc) to have time to deal with the issues happening inside the company.
2	1522843281	17	I'm sure you were in close contact with Roger but he also mentioned it was all good in a public video but what was with that?
3	1522848958	6	As a follow-up: What was Roger (/u/memorydealers you may want to jump in and answer) shown before making that statement?
4	1522856261	1	Don't expect him to appear. He still claims to be banned from this sub despite not ever being banned.
2	1522844635	4	This makes a lot of sense.  This should be what people expect when contacting current customer service agents in all industries:  They probably don't actually have a clue what is really going on at the moment, because they are told what to say by people shaping public image of the company.
2	1522861669	1	This is such a BS answer. Your business is 100% based on retail clients. To mislead them into a false sense of security when you're in custody of their money, and to blame call centres in India is the biggest copout I've ever heard in my life. The customers are your entire business and they weren't a priority to communicate with despite all the pressure!? Fuck that.  Screw people over, sure. Don't communicate a massive problem because it would only cause more problems, sure. But don't sit here and tell people that you were busy and couldn't communicate messaging properly when you were DELIBERATELY MISLEADING PEOPLE.   That's such BS and you should take more accountability for the FRAUD that you committed. 
2	1522842025	13	Translation:  Get fucked 
3	1522843317	13	I know I would be pissed if I lost a ton of Bitcoin, but your comment is just wrong. The translation is much closer to - We didn't have a fucking clue what we were doing, and then we just threw up our hands and said fuckit. 
0	1522839829	17	What's your current opinion on Roger, Jihan and Craig?
1	1522846816	53	* Roger: I am sorry this video you made to help us ended causing so much trouble.* Jihan: Actually I'm not sure who this is.* Craig: I've heard about Craig Wright. Definitely not Satoshi as most "evidence" was a fraud.
2	1522854104	1	Take that Jihan! 
2	1522852526	1	Jihan Wu runs BITMAIN, a company that makes ASIC miners.  He stirred a up lot of drama a couple years ago when he spoke out against core's anti-hardfork strategy, and has been catching a lot of shit since then.
3	1522859568	1	> against core'sAgainst what now?
2	1522851248	2	Jihan = bitmain 
3	1522852181	1	How does he seriously not know who Jihan is? 
4	1522852396	1	ASICs didn't exist when MtGox went under :-D
5	1522861972	1	They certainly did! However, I can't remember when I first heard of Bitmain. I don't believe they were particularly prominent in 2013 (when they were founded, and before MtGox went under).
0	1522838501	19	Can you comment on what will happen to the forked coins that are in possession of the court? BTG, BCH, etc. It adds an additional ~10% of fiat to the valuation. 
1	1522842745	15	I don't know about BTG, the trustee hasn't commented about this.BCH are managed by the trustee, and some 35000 BCH were sold in the past months.
2	1522843033	14	can you ask the trustee to sell all bitcoin gold + bitcoin diamond and the other useless forks?

2	1522846253	3	How many BTC were sold in the same period?
3	1522862056	1	More or less the same amount ~ 36k BTC from Dec17 to Feb18
0	1522838325	16	How is your relationship now with former Gox employees like Ashley Barr/Adam Turner and others?
1	1522842260	25	I am currently forbidden from contacting any of them due to ongoing legal proceedings.
0	1522835136	67	How were the remaining 200k BTC found? Where have they been?
1	1522835474	96	When MtGox filed for bankruptcy we evaluated the company as being bankrupt. Between its first trade in July 2010 and the bankruptcy in February 2014, MtGox accumulated a lot of history, including various attempts at implementing secure cold wallets back in 2011.Despite being less secure that actual paper wallet, that cold wallet, a aes encrypted wallet.dat file, still contained almost 200,000 BTC. Upon discovery the BTC were moved to a safer environment and lawyers worked on how to announce this to the court. Announce was made after those BTC were moved to a new paper-based cold wallet with approval of the court.
2	1522838603	80	Other people, not at MtGox, discovered them in your back pocket, by looking at transactions, and then you go "Oh, I didn't know those were still there".Right, we should trust that you would have "found" them yourself. What we know for certain is that you claimed all the bitcoins had gone, until other people discovered you still had 200,000 BTC left.
3	1522839267	96	The announcement wasn't done before bitcoins were moved to a safe location. The bitcoins being moved prompted a lot of reactions online because of the amount.The court can verify when this happened, if you believe there was anything wrong you can file with the court.
4	1522839917	35	He just filed with the court of public opinion, m8.
5	1522853223	1	which is.........worthless.
5	1522857115	1	o0o0o0o0o *gavel slam* mirite guise?
4	1522844095	2	Big if true
3	1522841181	2	Ohh. This is something important. Any links?Although he had the intention to steal those 200K coins back then, he might not have that intention now. This is the best case argument in his favor.
3	1522839152	4	Thanks for bringing that up. It's a very important distinction to make
2	1522842431	4	How many more of these 'paper-based cold wallets' are lying around? 
2	1522857773	1	Do you know of a similar case like yours where a company files for bankruptcy and is then worth billions after the fact years later before the procedure is finished?
0	1522842454	41	1. Why did you not monitor your cold wallets and match them with balances to ensure you had not lost any bitcoin? A simple list of all bitcoin addresses with a script to calculate total bitcoin balance and SUM(amount) in db...?2. Who did you tell that mtgox was insolvent before it was announced. There were people in the know, and 10k BTC dump on bitstamp shortly before you announced it.3. The leaked [mtgox crises draft](https://www.scribd.com/doc/209050732/MtGox-Situation-Crisis-Strategy-Draft) mentions a 200k injection to get mtgox back and running again, what was that number based on?4. In the [IRC logs](https://i.imgur.com/llRJgaM.png) you're talking about the missing 95k BTC, so you knew you were insolvent in 2011. You wrote that you had several strategies and plans, what concrete did you do to try recover the missing 95k?5. Why did you spend time on bitcoin cafe, fancy door locks, and [personally creating yubikeys](https://i.imgur.com/Hu9K006.png) instead of focusing on fixing this massive debt?6. Why did you blame malleability for the loss of 800k+ bitcoin when studies show it only accounted for less than 2k btc lost?7. Why did you appear to not care at all about the loss you caused in the aftermath? Twitting about the weather and totally ignoring questions?8. Would you mind to comment on [this incident](https://youtu.be/ob9Ak1t09Ao?t=1m54s), what was going through your mind at the time? And what do you think about it today?9. How was spending a year in jail?10. Do you think you'll go to jail again?11. Did you ever discover how blog.magicaltux.net was hacked? Many would argue that it was in fact you who "hacked" it, what would you say to them?12. Why did you not let Jed contact you for emergencies? He [wanted a way to notify you](https://i.imgur.com/EnA9kcb.png) when you were sleeping for emergencies. 
1	1522848554	16	1. Multiple reasons for that, from the security concept of cold wallets to others I cannot comment on yet.2. Only a limited numbers of employees, our lawyers, the court, and the soon-to-be-trustee.3. No idea, this document wasn't made by me, but I'd guess it was an estimate on how much would be needed to keep MtGox alive.4. Missing 95k BTC doesn't equal being insolvent. That's actually a rather complex issue currently being discussed in court, so I can't enter into the details at this point.5. I've been doing a lot of things to keep the company alive. I didn't spend as much time as rumored on the café, I guess what you call "fancy door locks" is the security system used in the 2012 office and wasn't especially time consuming either, and as to creating yubikeys I had to create the process, so of course I'd spend time on this in 2011 or early 2012. Making the company work is the only way to solve the "massive debt" you mention.6. I never blamed malleability for the loss of all missing Bitcoins. 7. At the point I had requirements to be tweeting, but couldn't mention anything about the ongoing proceedings. Sorry if it appeared as I didn't care.8. Nothing much. I was trying to get in the office and I had a lot on my plate that day. I shouldn't have been that cold to Colin, but I didn't really know how to react to his confrontation.9. Poor service, bad food. Would not recommend.10. I am innocent. Proving this in front of a Japanese court is a challenge but I'm not giving up.11. Like many old websites and account it used a very old password that ended being well known of the MtGox hacking crowd.12. I was angry at Jed, mostly because his own account was hacked and resulted in the whole event, yet by contract I had to protect him.
0	1522838823	13	Do you think decentralized exchanges and atomic swaps will eliminate counterparty risk and disintermediate crypto markets?
1	1522843359	14	I made some explanation on that. Decentralized exchanges may not work well because of the synchronization required, but [non-custodian exchange would solve a lot of issues](https://blog.magicaltux.net/article/Didn%E2%80%99t-we-learn-anything).
2	1522861597	1	you still have the financial escrow as a trusted entity, and most of the work would be on the financial institution that takes on the ordeal of complying with regulation. I would say a close implementation of the crypto currency side of what you are thinking is something like bisq.io
0	1522839307	20	Hi Mark, I will be in Japan at the end of the month, would you do an interview for my podcast, What Bitcoin Did? It would be good to explore this together.Previous guests include Charlie Lee, Jameson Lopp and most recently Lyn Ulbricht, mother of Ross Ulbricht.Apologies if this isn't the best way to reach out and hijacking the AMA, I have tried Twitter.
1	1522847003	15	Sorry I'm rather overloaded in terms of message. It'd be great if you can email me at magicaltux@gmail.com
0	1522836559	53	Do you think forensic tools will ever get to the bottom of where all of the Mt. Gox coins went? Do you have any recommendations for users to keep their coins safe from hacks?
1	1522836888	122	Thanks to blockchain forensics, one person has been arrested last year in connection with the theft of Bitcoins on MtGox in Greece: Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national. At this point however not many details have emerged and likely won't until he faces trial in the US. He is currently pending extradition to both the US and Russia and filed for refugee status, which I understand means that he's still going to be in Greece for a while.As to storing coins safely, I'd say a hardware wallet, however a lot of care is required in avoiding compromised hardware. Using multiple hardware wallets from multiple vendors in a multisig configuration would probably be the safest at this point.
2	1522842629	22	The refugee trick  is very popular in Greece ... Because of all the Illegal Immigrants from Syria and "Turkey"  It take 2-5 years to get the trial... so they use it as a delay trick (he will lose) 
2	1522844365	15	> a Russian nationalBitcoin and Dota are basically the same thing then? In that Russians fucking ruin it.
1	1522844289	9	>Do you have any recommendations for users to keep their coins safe from hacks?You're seriously asking this to the guy who lost the most bitcoins in history?
2	1522849253	2	Did he *lose* them is the real question.
1	1522848105	2	Why would you want security recommendations from this guy?!?
1	1522851502	2	> Do you have any recommendations for users to keep their coins safe from hacks?Follow-up question, Mrs. Clinton, do you have any recommendations on winning elections and how to be a generally well liked person?
0	1522846479	11	Salut Mark,Thanks for doing this AMA.While I understand why people who lost money in the colapse are angry, I do want to thank you for helping grow the ecosystem in the early days.Giving back the remaining btc will earn you a lot of respect from the overall community.A few questions for you:1) Back in the days, did you at MtGox had an estimation of the volume of business brought by silk road? 2) during the silk road trial, Ross's lawyer tried to name you as the DPR. Did that affected you in anyway? Was there any legal repercussions for you? Have you ever had a chance to speak with Ross?3) what is your opinion on his case?Thanks!
1	1522853766	1	Hi,1. We didn't have an exact estimate, but following Ulbricht's arrest and shut down of silk road we noticed a drop in activity which allowed put a figure on that at around 20%~30%2. I received a lot of media attention. I am pretty sure I'm not DPR, but explaining that to people and convincing them is more tricky. There was however no legal repercussions for being named by Ross' attorny since by that time US law enforcement had enough evidence I wasn't linked.  I never talked with Ross but I did exchange a few emails with his mother.3. It's difficult to say. Evidence seems clear enough it was him, and there is of course a need to make an example of him as first ever such case, but it's sad for someone that young to have to spend life behind bars.
0	1522836107	43	Why not return the btc to the original investors instead of the usd value?Or even just half/ a fraction if you argue most of them would have sold at the time anyways?Thanks
1	1522836511	68	I'm afraid the inability to return BTC comes directly from the bankruptcy. Initially on Feb 28th 2014 MtGox filed for Civil Rehabilitation, but following various external pressure (creditors and US govt) the court moved the case to bankruptcy on April 24th 2014.Now, creditors are working toward switching back to Civil Rehabilitation. I do not know if it'll be possible, but I support wholly the attempt as it seems to be the best chance of seeing a fair distribution of all MtGox assets.
2	1522837293	35	Thank you.Lastly,  is Jed Mcaleb trustworthy?  I heard mt. gox was already in trouble/lost funds when he sold it to you? 
3	1522846322	17	I'm afraid I cannot comment on this due to ongoing legal proceedings.
4	1522856038	1	Not only that, but commenting an opinion without facts would be extremely irresponsible 
3	1522843332	3	Well according to some sources, Mt Gox had already 80k btc deficit in 2011 when the ownership changed.https://www.thedailybeast.com/who-pulled-off-the-biggest-bitcoin-heist-in-history
3	1522840596	2	I want to know this too
2	1522844041	2	That would mean what exactly? Would it be as simple as this in theory? (using arbitrary numbers, I don't feel like researching the exact numbers, and these are probably easier to use for example purposes anyway). Say you owed 400K bitcoin. You lost 100K bitcoin. So you only have 300K bitcoin to give. Instead of going into fiat and all that. You could give people 75% of their bitcoins (aka if you had 8 btc on exchange, you now get 6 back)? Would it be that easy? Honestly, that would be a super good solution, as then MtGox would basically have been a super strong forced HODL. Is it completely fair? probably not. But I don't think many would complain. You loose 25% (or whatever the exact % would be, after all costs etc) of BTC, but gain ~1000% on the asset worth. I understand your hands are tied, but would this be a possible outcome of civil rehabilitation? Or would it look like first, a part of the BTC needs to be sold to settle the people in FIAT, as that is the law, then the remaining BTC could be divided in a way as described above? 
3	1522846725	6	The law is dealing with fiat because it's just simpler, the unique angle on this case in that during the bankruptcy period the assets still held by MtGox rose by 100x times in value. This has never happened before in history and will probably never happen again, so not exactly a thing you expect to be covered by law.
1	1522836296	6	That would be great, you say you don't want the "billions" return the btc to the community then
2	1522843432	8	Will try to.
2	1522839339	8	Please read what people write. MK is not in the position to return anything. It's upon the court to decide how to move forward.
0	1522838837	54	Hi Mark, Can you help me reclaim 5btc that was sent to an old Gox address after liquidation was already announced. It was not credited as part of my claim. I believe this is owed to me in full.If there is anyone you can point me to that could help I'll be eternally grateful. Trustee phone line has been a dead end.
1	1522843380	80	Please email me with details, including the transaction ID, so I can look into it: magicaltux@gmail.com
2	1522843906	17	Email sent
3	1522847383	31	Would love to hear the follow up from this.
4	1522853475	1	Same 
4	1522857519	1	Why is everyone assuming he’s telling the truth? The sent 5 BTC guy
1	1522847740	4	Finally something useful out of this
0	1522836729	26	Hi Mark,I know you have received a lot of shit from people, but as we all can understand people have been stressed and sad due to their losses. When that’s said, the trolls and fools are the loudest online. I wish for your best and hope this goes through.Does a CR imply that mtgox has to be reopened? In short, what has to go through to make that happen? I wish for the best outcome for the creditors and I think you will get a lot of respect and appreciation if it goes through. 
1	1522837453	22	I understand everyone went through a lot at the time, and will not hold actions and/or words of the time against anyone (unless these constitute criminal conduct).In Japan, Civil Rehabilitation mostly means plans are submitted to the court, approved plans are submitted to creditors for voting and whatever plan creditors choose is implemented. The plan can be about re-opening the exchange, merger with another exchange or just straight distribution and closing the company.We aren't there yet however since the court still has to approve for MtGox to switch back from bankruptcy to Civil Rehabilitation, which will hopefully happen soon.
0	1522840403	18	Was Roger Ver reading from a script in [this video](https://youtu.be/UP1YsMlrfF0), and if so, who wrote the script?Did he receive any sort of compensation or privilege (whether financial, intangible, or in any other sense) for offering this "testimony"?
0	1522837807	8	Mark, I've been following the bankruptcy process fairly closely. It seems the CoinLab case will be the biggest barrier in receiving any payments in the near-term. Is there not an argument for the trustee to sell enough bitcoin to pay the case in full - similar to what he did when he locked in full payment a month ago - to settle the suit? While bitcoin creditors would lose out on a reasonably large chunk of what they would receive in civil rehabilitation, it would enable fiat creditors to be paid in full, soon. Also it would speed up the distribution (probably by several years) for those holding in bitcoin.  
1	1522841382	13	I've discussed with many creditors and so far I do not think any majority of creditors wants for the CoinLab case to be settled in full. While the lawsuit is still in progress and blocking the whole bankruptcy, it is clearly meritless and paying CoinLab even a cent would justify their current action which is, as I see it, taking the whole bankruptcy and its ~24750 creditors hostage until payment is made.
2	1522842285	7	Even if it means the bankruptcy will go on longer, I want CoinLab to get as little as possible. 
2	1522846295	2	How do I follow the Coinlab case? IIRC the  US case is pending the Japan case but I can't find any public information on that one.  Are there dockets I can follow along? 
0	1522849320	8	Why did Roger Ver state that Mt Gox was liquid and that he was provided proof of such when it was quite obvious that it was not. What was his motivation to do so and what was your motivation to put him up to it?
1	1522849794	3	THIS 👆👆👆
1	1522853859	1	At that time it wasn't obvious.
2	1522854948	1	**It wasn't obvious you had 650,000 bitcoins stolen? ** Somebody could take almost 3/4 of your money and you merely didn't notice when supplying evidence to people that you are in fact liquid? I'm not sure what kind of bookkeeping you were doing, but he claimed he saw the proof you were liquid, so either you supplied false proof, or he lied on your behalf. 
0	1522837070	34	I joined crypto after the mt gox issue, and ive been hearing from lots of sides about it . But I wanna ask 1 question : If you could go back in time and change 1 thing about mt gox, when would it be, and what would you do? 
1	1522837781	78	When buying MtGox I should have had people around me to advise me and help with the management starting with the MtGox transfer contract.I'm a tech guy, and bitcoin was a tech thing at the time. In April 2011 there was an article in Forbes which changed Bitcoin forever, and I found myself managing emergencies everyday without any time to do the work that'd need to be actually done.
2	1522840490	9	Do you have a link to that article by any chance? Would love to read it.
3	1522843675	6	"Adblock Detected"
2	1522842455	36	You found yourself "managing emergencies everyday without any time to do the work that'd need to be actually done." Yet you somehow found time to start up a bitcoin cafe complete with a $35,000 Backen pastry oven and $23,000 on a La Marzocco coffee machine.Oh and you also found time to spend customer funds on prostitutes.The trustee has made a claim against tibanne of $200m and you couldn't spend any of this money hiring a decent security team/decent coders to fix MtGox? What did you spend all this money on?The way you lie and seek attention is truly sickening Mark. 
3	1522843742	14	I don't blame him for seeking time to get a rest.Even I'm busy I still find time playing games just to get a break.What I didn't like was that I read somewhere that ex-employee said Mark didn't disclose company's financial situation after being asked multiple times even though it may have been too late by then.
3	1522847903	11	You know, if he was seeking attention for himself, we'd be hearing about him much more often than we do. I think the point of this post is actually the opposite. He wants *less attention* (and is willing to take temporarily elevated attention to achieve that).Also, I'd like to point out that the human mind requires time to wind off to retain the ability to do stressful productive work. It's impossible to use 100% of your time doing stressful stuff effectively.So, while you might have a point in criticizing his spending, it's pretty likely things would have failed even more spectacularly if he had tried to use all his time for the stressful work. You're basically saying that he should not have had any free time at all.Also, it's quite clear in hindsight whose money he was using. However, it's rather likely he didn't realize it at the time and thought it was his money to use. That being said, I do consider it to be criminally negligent to run an exchange without actually auditing periodically that you actually have the customer funds you're supposed to have. (So I actually agree that he was acting very irresponsibly, I just disagree with your reasoning for why)
4	1522849476	4	> You know, if he was seeking attention for himself, we'd be hearing about him much more often than we do. I think the point of this post is actually the opposite. He wants less attention (and is willing to take temporarily elevated attention to achieve that).Every time his relevance starts to fade he comes up with a new way to put himself in the spotlight.He has spouted the same rhetoric for years but still has failed to answer even the most basic questions about what actually happened. You could check this for yourself but he deleted all of his posts some time ago. Note that he won't answer any of the creditors poignant questions relating to what actually happened but he will answer questions about his underwear.At this point in time it's safe to say that yes he does just love the attention and this AMA serves nothing other than his own colossal ego and delusions of grandeur. >So, while you might have a point in criticizing his spending, it's pretty likely things would have failed even more spectacularly if he had tried to use all his time for the stressful work. You're basically saying that he should not have had any free time at all.You're putting words in my mouth. If you believe the story he has told, Mark didn't even have a basic system in place to reconcile account balances with btc wallets. But of course this can't be confirmed because the "records" have been somehow destroyed or manipulated. I'm not saying that he shouldn't have had any free time at all. What I'm just saying that maybe he could have spent **a few moments** using his wonderful coding skills or spent **a couple of measly dollars** of the at least **$200m** of our money that he spent on god knows what during the **several years** he spent running the exchange, to come up with a basic accounting system so that the thefts couldn't have gone on for so long or for such a large amount of money. He claims he couldn't find the time to do this very basic, obvious thing. He could however find time to go gallivanting around with hookers and buying expensive machines for his failed cafe. >Also, it's quite clear in hindsight whose money he was using. However, it's rather likely he didn't realize it at the time and thought it was his money to use.It's rather more likely that he knew exactly whose money he was using for a long time considering the emails indicating he was well aware he was in the red since the very beginning. Not to mention the suspicious trading activity of the markus and willy bots etc etc.
3	1522849956	3	I would certainly like to see him address most of these points.The prostitutes thing doesn't belong and deserved no response, asserting he spent customer funds on them is a wild speculation unless there is a public news report, guilty plea or finding of guilt on that point in particular I'm not aware of.  Moreso, I don't condone prostitution, but everyone has their own moral compass, and sex for money is a worldwide practice. Seems like an unnecessary personal slight.
3	1522854279	1	> $35,000 Backen pastry ovenMakes good fucking pastry tho, just sayin
0	1522837770	13	What happens to the excess Bitcoins / USD that will be left over since everyone is being compensated in fiat?Also why is the forgot password feature at https://claims.mtgox.com broken? I have tried changing my password quite a few times in the past years but it just never works. The email will arrive at my gmail account a few days later instead of instantly.
1	1522841211	17	Hopefully all BTC will be distributed to creditors. I am working trying to make this happen.As to the forgotten password feature, I'm afraid I can't help with that. You should try contacting the trustee (there is a phone number for assistance). I do see a lot of people complaining about this however.
0	1522835094	58	Welcome back. The stress must be horrendous but you actually looked a lot healthier in your 'release' pic than prior, well done, keep it up.

4	1522841264	6	For sure he was reading a script - there is no lie Roger won't tell for money.
5	1522843563	6	You can see his eyes reading along.
5	1522845049	3	According to /u/MagicalTux, neither him nor Roger knew any better at the time.
3	1522848379	7	Never forget how Roger Ver (aka /u/memorydealers) lied to the community then.  He continues to lie to the community now about the pump-and-dump scamcoin BCash that he is heavily invested in and shills constantly though documented sockpuppetry and astroturfing campaigns.
0	1522836839	34	If a movie is ever made about MtGox or Bitcoin in general, which actor would you prefer to play you?
1	1522837533	129	Jack Black. I really love the guy.
2	1522843907	13	Lol CALL UNIVERSAL, I HAVE A PITCH
2	1522853016	1	Would you accept Tommy Wiseau as a creditor in that movie and also "best friend"?"Why is this happening to me?". "Oh, hi mark". "Don't worry about the money". "You betrayed me". "I thought we were best friends"
2	1522853435	1	No offense, but watching Jack Black freak out at the part where everything goes south would be hilarious.
2	1522844345	5	Jack Black would be great for the Gox era Mark but what about post the "Japanese prison diet" phase? Jake Gyllenhall?And who would direct? I'm thinking Uwe Boll. 
3	1522853577	1	> And who would direct?Adam McKay would be good, he directed _The Big Short_.
2	1522845672	2	Not meatloaf? 
0	1522841487	13	Salut Mark,I'm one of the creditors and I would like to thank you for pushing for civil rehabilitation.I could find very little information about your legal troubles. Will there be a criminal trial? If yes, when is this supposed to happen?Do you believe that the US seized some of the stolen bitcoins or some of the proceeds of their sale?Do you plan on coming back to France and staying there when this is over?Lastly, I've been wondering what happened to the money that was sent to the Polish bank account during MtGox's last days. I sent a few hundred euros a couple of days before the site disappeared to try to buy cheap bitcoins and the trustee rejected this part of my claim. Surely, the deposit could and should have been linked to my account manually. Were all the late deposits simply ignored?
1	1522846662	10	Hi,Criminal trial has been ongoing since July 11th 2017, following my arrest on August 1st 2015. I can't provide any information on the future timeline however as I don't know yet how things will evolve, but this is still ongoing.If possible I think I'll stay in Japan, mostly because I like life here and after spending nearly 10 years here this is where I have the most friends and connections.For your Euro claim, you could dispute the rejection by the trustee within one month, so it's likely too late except that civil rehabilitation, if approved, will likely allow claims to be filed once again. I'd suggest filing again then.
1	1522849451	2	What is civil rehabilitation? 
2	1522851457	3	It's an alternative to bankruptcy. Bankruptcy would lead to the liquidation of MtGox's assets. The creditors would receive $483 per bitcoin and 100% of the cash they had at MtGox. The surplus (~160,000 BTC and BCH, plus ~200,000 BTG) would be converted into JPY and given to MtGox's shareholders (Mark Karpelès and Jed McCaleb) and the Japanese government would get a large portion of that money in taxes.If the court accepts to switch from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation, the remaining bitcoins and the forks could potentially be distributed to the creditors instead of being sold for JPY and given to the shareholders.We could hope to receive around 1/5th of a bitcoin for each bitcoin we owned, which is substantially better than $483. Plus, converting the bitcoins and the forks into JPY would be catastrophic for the BTC, BCH and BTG markets. This would probably also affect other cryptocurrencies that have nothing to do with bitcoin.Mark stated that he doesn't want the money and that he supports civil rehabilitation, which is fantastic. Most creditors do too in all likelihood. The court will only entertain civil rehabilitation if the plan makes sense and is in everyone's interest.

2	1522863396	1	Maybe I'm just sleep deprived but I don't understand how a PGP message proves your identity (I'm not questioning you're Karpeles).Maybe if someone sent you a message encrypted with your public key, then you decrypted it and they confirmed that was what they wrote? I just don't get how what you did makes sense, someone help.
3	1522863850	1	Just providing a PGP signature of the message "I am Mark" signed with his private key to be verified against the public key would be quite sufficient, unless someone else has got hold of the private key.
4	1522864164	1	Yeah, I need to sleep... Can't find Mark's public key online though.
1	1522857749	1	It is the same reddit username he has always had. 
2	1522860302	1	Always? I see three posts of which two are today's. 
3	1522860761	1	He deleted all of his post history recently.
3	1522861190	1	He's been active on Reddit for a long time.  History deleted, but many (not as many as I thought though) will recognize this account.
4	1522861696	1	It's like old men were watching kids poking a dead dinosaur...
0	1522838741	5	Mark, thanks for doing this AMA and for trying to help the process.I'm curious about the 'willy'-bot. I've found that you once mentioned that it was legal and for the good of the company, but it's intended purpose is still unclear to me. Can you elaborate a bit more on it?
1	1522843233	2	I'm afraid I can't comment on that due to ongoing legal proceedings.
0	1522836747	24	Hey Mark,great you're doing an AMA!In Feb 2014 Oliver Janssens sent you emails asking you to send him 10000 BTC of his coins from MtGox and pressured with his lawyer. One of these emails is shown in this post on [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=497847.msg6952045#msg6952045).On Monday, 24 Feb 2014, a 10000 BTC sell wall on Bitstamp popped up.One may call this coincidence, but I'm wondering, whether you actually sent Oliver 10000 BTC and this was his wall?
1	1522837080	10	> On Monday, 24 Feb 2014, a 10000 BTC sell wall on Bitstamp popped up.> > you can look in the creditor list if he is listed there. if no than he got his coins because otherwise he wouldve claimed  it in the bankruptcy and be in the list
2	1522837260	11	> Oliver Janssenedit:I just check the creditor list and he is intherehttps://i.imgur.com/9IIylTQ.png335126397 JPY and 385117 US Dollartotal = 3.545.358 so roundabout 3.5 million USD
3	1522839121	6	Actually I believe the JPY amount wasn't accepted. There are four columns if I'm not mistaken:* claimed amount in currency* claimed amount in JPY* rejected amount in JPY* approved amount in JPY
4	1522839242	11	Oh shit you are right.So he only had 385 thousand USD left on the exchange.How did he get his bitcoins/wealth out?:/
5	1522841107	6	He sold them to Bitcoinbuilder didn't he ?Then after doing this based on what I've read he also attempted to claim them during the bankruptcy process even though he'd previously sold them, he's been called out on this on reddit. Some searching will tell you all you need to know.
1	1522837261	14	I'm afraid I am unable to comment on individual users.
1	1522840768	2	> On Monday, 24 Feb 2014, a 10000 BTC sell wall on Bitstamp popped up.That turned out to be a mistake for whoever did it. When in doubt, HODL.
0	1522838666	24	Thanks for doing this AMA. On 2011/04/28 re the missing 80,000 Bitcoins Jed McCaleb wrote to you> There are 3 solutions I have thought of:> > - Slowly buy more BTC with the USD that Gox Bot has. Hopefully you would fill up the loss before the price got out of hand.> > - Buy a big chunk of BTC (really just moving the BTC debt to the USD side) If BTC goes up this is a huge win. Problem is there isn’t enough BTC for sale on mtgox. Maybe you could find someone on the forum to do it.> > - Get those crystal island people to invest･They have 200+ BTC so they could fill in the gap.> > Maybe you could just mine it？So that's actually 4 possible solutions. Which if any did you and/or Jed try to apply?Did you reply to this email, and if so in what way? 
1	1522843184	18	I'm afraid I cannot respond to this as it involves ongoing litigation and/or investigations.
1	1522842616	7	Does anybody know who those 'crystal island people' could be?
1	1522841746	6	He just kept running the fraud meanwhile most people in this ama thread sucking his cock
1	1522849261	2	So they were already trading whilst insolvent since 2011. Great.
0	1522837789	15	If it essentially comes down to you receiving most of the coins why not just distribute them yourself weighted on each individuals btc claim?
1	1522840923	23	I will try to if it ever comes to that. For now I'm focusing on making sure things do not get there.
2	1522842697	3	Who are the main shareholders and what % of the company do they hodl? Or is it basically up to you?
3	1522843645	7	Tibanne owns 88%, Jed owns 12%. Tibanne is 100% owned by Mark. 
1	1522839796	8	He already said multiple times that in that case he would try to find ways to distribute the funds, but he also said that if he would recieve it as a shareholder, there would be mayor taxes involved. So that's the worse option than CR.
0	1522837723	10	Would you add altcoins if you still had mtgox running? what's your future view on Bitcoin?
1	1522841010	18	Litecoin support was actually near completion, but I deemed it'd be required to first fix the trading issue before adding trading volume on the exchange, so it was never released.
2	1522849551	5	You should've added it for the lolz.
2	1522853486	1	I'm still waiting for MtGox to add Litecoin
0	1522847926	6	Well Mark, I guess your PGP message is proof enough for me.  I want to thank you.  Probably not something you hear a lot these days.  But back in the days before Gox went belly up, I was a plebe who had decided to look into bitcoins.  I had heard about them for a while but never had any money to invest.    I had gotten a career level job then and decided to jump in.  Naturally I wanted the most trusted and stable place to put my first investment.  I chose Mt. Gox because, well because it was the obvious choice.  So I sent out all the information requested and waited.  Two weeks went by and I heard nothing.  I got some hardware fob in the mail that would give me access to my account, but no account had yet been set up.  I contact Tech Support who told me that things had been really backed up there and they'd get back to making my account in a week or so.  That sounded really odd to me.  But I waited anyway.  At the end of that week, I had still heard nothing.  So I reached out again.  I got an apology and pretty much the same answer.  At this point I decided maybe Gox was not the best place for my money and went elsewhere.  Honestly I don't even know where it was but the coins I bought eventually ended up safe on the Trezor that sits on my desk today.  A few days after I made my first purchase at the Gox alternative, I saw the news about the coins lock down.  Then it went belly up.  Then people we camping out in Japan with big signs.  But my coins were safe in my other account.  Had it not been for the immense incompetence of your staff at creating new accounts, I would have given Gox my very first coin purchase.  And would have almost immediately lost it all for good.  And then I most certainly would have been so soured at the experience that I would never have had anything to do with crypto again.  So again I want to thank you and your staff for fucking up my new account create request and bullshitting me about it to the point where I no longer trusted Mt. Gox.  I also learned almost firsthand why you never ever keep your coins on an exchange and always be in direct control of your keys.  Thanks.  A lot.  Seriously.  I actually told myself that if I ever had the chance to talk to you, this is what I'd say.  So I guess a bucket list item has been checked off as well.  Noice.  Hodl.
0	1522838323	13	How much weight did you lose in prison and would you recommend it as a weight loss method?
1	1522843485	21	Lost 35kg in 4 months. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
2	1522854887	1	Food that bad?
1	1522842640	3	I gained 30 kg in there , during last 4 months of my trial (total 10m till release ) It’s painful and stressing your brain. Food was reliefWouldn’t recommend ;-)
0	1522836902	13	Were the auto-buy bots you were running on your exchange utilized to manipulate your balance sheet?  What purpose did they serve?
1	1522839658	2	I also want an answer to this question. 
0	1522838427	16	Why did the "Bitcoin Foundation", co founded by Roger Ver, not offer a single word of commentary on the MtGox catastrophe, or the slightest assistance to MtGox's victims, and how much (whether in bitcoins or other money) have you or your companies donated to the Bitcoin Foundation from its start and over the years?
1	1522842542	11	MtGox has donated slightly more than 10000 BTC in total to the Bitcoin Foundation (founded by Peter Vessennes of CoinLab). The domain names were also donated to the foundation after being initially received from their original buyer.I would guess there wasn't enough information at the time for the Bitcoin Foundation to feel comfortable being involved in any way with the MtGox Bankruptcy, that's sad but it's too late to do anything about it.
2	1522853427	1	Have you asked your friends at the Bitcoin Foundation whether they can send back those 10,000 so that they be shared among the victims of MtGox?Also "According to its founding documents, the Bitcoin Foundation's original members included Gavin Andresen, Charlie Shrem, Mark Karpeles, Peter Vessenes, Roger Ver, Patrick Murck and Mehul Puri"So, you and Roger Ver were co-founders there, and Roger Ver helped boost your credibility, while you donated money to this foundation, and yet afterwards The Bitcoin Foundation didn't do a single thing to help your victims.So, why shouldn't we see the whole of the Bitcoin Foundation as part of the same overall criminal operation, receiving MtGox's money and in return helping MtGox's credibility, in order to help MtGox defraud people?
0	1522847302	4	Hey Mark, thanks for doing this.I lost about 430€ on your platform, however when I registered my claim, the comma separator somehow slipped and my claim was entered as [seen here](https://imgur.com/a/35CAp). I could never correct this issue and trying to contact the proceedings person was unsucessful. Is there anything I can do to remedy this still?
1	1522850118	2	if they audited your account (as they should and as they did with mine), they will soon enought change this amount to its correct number.
2	1522850720	2	I entered this amount ca. 3.5 years ago. Nothing has happened since then, therefore I highly doubt something happening now. 
0	1522839405	10	**What can you say about the CoinLab/Peter Vessenes case so far?**
1	1522846737	18	It is a baseless claim made by CoinLab which is asking for 75 million USD from MtGox for having provided no sort of work, instead undermining MtGox's compliance with US laws by falsely representing they were fully compliant.Oh and it's also preventing this whole bankruptcy from moving forward.
0	1522836925	13	Are you allowed to leave the county?If so, would you be willing to give a talk at an event/meetup in Zurich about MtGox? (see http://bitcoinlectures.tv/ to get an idea how they are setup).
1	1522837568	27	I am unfortunately not allowed to leave Japan at this point. I'd be happy to attend on the situation clears up a bit more.
2	1522838147	10	I could help you to leave at anytime by boat
3	1522839301	43	I'd rather fight and earn my not guilty verdict.
4	1522844003	3	Big props to you for that.
5	1522846509	2	Though I don't think anyone would or should trust a nazi to smuggle them out of a country by boat.
2	1522843220	4	Sounds like a perfect situation for me!New Life goal: Get to japan and have a court say i cant leave rather than a visa saying i have to get out in 90 days
0	1522840799	22	"I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox. Ask me anything.".. should be..."I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of the exchange MtGox that was defrauding users and continuing taking wire and btc deposits up until the minute i shut the site down. Ask me anything."
1	1522840916	12	He knew MtGox didn't have the bitcoins, and he continued running that exchange for months and months and months, taking more users BTC, taking more fiat deposits, trying to use willy/markus to trade his way out of it, fucking fraudster scammer
1	1522846833	2	More like:"I'm Mark Karpelès. I put the "krupt" in "bankrupt". Ask me anything."
0	1522839018	5	Were the bots, later named Willy and Markus, your work? If yes, why?
0	1522838211	7	Hi Mark, I've no claim in as I missed the deadline. If you get all those BTC, will you pay me back my balance? I'm on the leaked db file and can verify my identity to match.
1	1522842226	8	I'll try to. I can't say for sure at this point if it's possible or not. Note that you may still be able to file if you didn't receive any letter from the trustee. I'd suggest contacting a Japanese lawyer if it's the case.
0	1522835733	13	what can you say about tether USDT? what is your opinion , is it going to be the biggest fraud?
1	1522835948	31	I hear about Tether USDT a lot, and I believe more transparency would help greatly. The issue, rather than is Tether really in control of the assets it claims having, is will the US let Tether be or will they try to shut it down for helping money laundering/issuing money without license/etc ?
2	1522836963	5	i agree, so what is your opinion about that questions you asking!
3	1522837867	21	I have no way to tell for sure. I do not think the US are really happy about Tether right now, and that might be exactly why US banks have blocked related transfers. When a third party bank starts blocking your transfers something really bad is going on.

0	1522838618	5	"Oh, hi mark!"1) Let's say you end up with the 160k BTC. Would the trustee decide wether to just hand the coins over to you or sell them for JPY? Would it be up to you? Could the trustee even be forced by law to sell?2) Let's say the coins are given to you directly: would you make an effort to distribute those to the creditors? Is there even a legal way to do this properly?3) If MtGox were still around today, what would've been its policy on forks like bcash? What's your personal opinion on this schism?
1	1522843132	3	1. The most likely is that BTC/BCH would be sold for JPY and then taxes deducted (multiple times) before I would ever see any of these. Because of the taxation issue it's likely a sale would be required in order for the value to be stable in JPY.2. I would try to. I do not think there is any legal background, so it may end being considered donations, which are taxed rather highly in many jurisdictions. Hopefully it won't get to that.3. MtGox would just implement both systems and let users choose to hold Bitcoins or Bitcoin Cash. We have always tried to remain neutral on this kind of issues.

2	1522855626	1	Ouch
0	1522844521	6	There are at least 2 stories I have come across of people killing themselves (and probably many more) after the MtGox incident. I'm not sure of the validity of these claims, but it would probably be best if someone investigated these claims and some sort of settlement was paid out to the families.
1	1522849359	2	I have investigated all such claims, and so far haven't came across anything. Hopefully distribution can happen before such a thing happens.
0	1522836973	6	Am I going to get any of my coins back? like any? one even?
1	1522837593	11	I'm afraid it's difficult for me to respond without knowing if you submitted a claim with the court and what the status of that claim is. Do you have a creditor number?
2	1522848103	2	My claim was rejected due to "such amount does not exist." I'm not sure what that means. There was, I think, about £90 fiat and about 1 btc in the account so perhaps it was too small an amount to claim?It wasn't a small amount to me, and would be worth much more now.
2	1522843358	2	I got years ago a Japanese letter in the Mail. How were we supposed to file a claim in Japan? 
0	1522838779	3	You mentioned the repayments are in fiat JPY. How Edit:Nvm question was answered and I missed it, I have a new one though; How many coins were never recovered?
1	1522843286	3	Bankruptcy law specifies that all liabilities are to be valuated as of the day bankruptcy is pronounced. For MtGox that was May 24th 2014, so the rate of that day was used. The bankruptcy trustee specifies on official documents he used the CoinDesk Bitcoin Index price.
0	1522841120	3	What happened to your wife and cat?

0	1522842675	3	What is your honest opinion of Jed Mcaleb
0	1522842819	3	Hey Mark, thanks for taking the time to reach out to the community.My question isn't related to bitcoin per se, but as a Japanese resident myself I'm interested in knowing what it was that initially brought you to Japan. Also, do you plan on remaining in Japan as a permanent resident or are there thoughts to go elsewhere?
1	1522849756	2	Visiting Japan (I spent 1 month as tourist in 2007) prompted me to decide to live here. It took 2 years until I could make this happen, and I don't regret it (despite all that happened).
0	1522845206	3	Why did you chose PHP?
0	1522845627	3	I have no question, and I didn't get a chance to use Mt. Gox (I got a verification rejection note the same hour the bankruptcy was announced, so I joke that was your last official act.) I just wanted to say your heart is in the right place with your effort to do civil rehabilitation, and that is much better than riches. I'm glad for you that you see this (and I hope the skepticism and other negativity doesn't bother you too much.)I know you said you weren't asking for forgiveness, but I hope when all is said and done that many people are able to forgive you and express that to you. Best wishes and God bless you. 
0	1522845874	3	how do you live with the shame? 
0	1522847958	3	In the event that you do receive a billion dollars, how many days do you think you'll survive until someone looking for revenge finds you?

0	1522840231	23	Fuck you. 
0	1522836461	11	Do you run a full Bitcoin node?
1	1522836706	21	MtGox used to run multiple bitcoin nodes. I am not running any node today however.
2	1522837216	18	Running one will bring some happiness back into your life. Recommended.
3	1522854292	1	Just like setting off fireworks brings happiness to Vietnam vets with PTSD
0	1522838139	7	How big should a block be?Also - does Japanese prison have starbucks?
1	1522841695	19	A block should be as big at it needs to be in order for users to not have to worry about confirmation times without being too large and have users have to worry about disk space. This is all a question of balance.
2	1522847034	3	this is the boldest answer in this AMA
2	1522842189	3	Thanks - what was your first french meal after leaving prison?
2	1522844251	3	What's about block propagation, block orphan, centralization?...
1	1522838754	4	No it doesnt. Otherwise he would not have lost so much weight
0	1522838644	7	Whats the plan with the remaining 200,000 BTC?Edit: I forgot its 160k BTC now
1	1522843158	13	35,000 BTC were sold in the past few months. I have no idea of what will happen to the rest as it's up to the trustee and the court.
0	1522837855	5	What are your regrets in all of that drama?
1	1522841406	16	No relying more on people, I guess. Doing a business alone is fine as long as things stay very small.
2	1522844558	3	How do you keep it small if you're a small team? I thought that's what exactly happened. You should have at least had a more formal corporate structure, so you aren't doing the accounting while coding.
0	1522838170	4	Will you come back and make crypto great again?
1	1522842119	4	No plan to "come back" for now. I'll do as much as I can to assist with the MtGox bankruptcy however.

3	1522860684	1	As an intermediate French speaker, I understand this as 'are you stopped *(recognised by people)* in the street?' but when I put this into a translation service it translates as 'do you make yourself stop in the street?'I get why the translation service would say that > *te fais-tu (you make yourself)*. But as a literal translation, I find it difficult to decipher.Which is the better translation here?
4	1522861119	1	Your first guess is the right one. Try deepl.com, it gives better translations for this kind of sentences 
5	1522862302	1	Thanks a lot, I'll give it a try.

0	1522839221	18	I lost many BTC on mtgox due to you committing fraud, deceiving your customers making them believe you were whole and solvent while u were running willy/markus trying to bring the numbers back.    When gox went down, i said i wanted my btc back, not fiat, i tried to submit my claims form with kraken but the website repeatedly did not work, i emailed /u/jespow twice, messaged him on here multiple times, all with no luck, so now i have no claims.   On top of this, you're now going to get all the btc through tibanne. Can you imagine how i feel, that you're the fraudster, I'm the innocent party, and you're running off happy with my btc while i'm getting nothing.     How about you dm me, i'll post you my accounts and an address and you can make sure I can my btc back. 
1	1522845035	7	yes this, this a million times.I was never taken on as a creditor despite filling in the forms via kraken, i have no idea why, no letter no nothing and defiantly no BTC.I still to cannot log into the mtGox site, no password retrieval, nothing, is anyone out there ever going to help???
1	1522843005	2	If civil rehabilitation is accepted, you might be able to submit a claim after all. 
1	1522848673	4	I don't have any BTC, so I wouldn't be able to send you anything. I remember your name, don't worry, I've seen you often enough to remember it.It's likely Civil Rehabilitation will open a new filing window. I'd suggest using it to file your claims.
2	1522850556	4	Thanks for the reply Mark, I'm glad you've seen me often enough. I lost alot of bitcoins and want them back. Something back. Anything back at this point. As for Civil Rehabilitation, lets hope it goes through and is allowed then. 
0	1522837892	4	What do you not like about Japan?
1	1522841502	12	The legal system, I guess. Compared to what we have in France it is still quite backward, and by European standards many elements are very bad, and in some case would be considered violation of human rights.It's nothing however compared to what happens in third world countries, but maybe something can be done about this one day. I don't know if it'll help but I plan to discuss more about this once the case ends.
0	1522839125	4	What do you think about people blaming Gox as the reason for low prices recently, do you think it's true or it has any merit?
1	1522849528	3	It's difficult to say, because even just mentioning such a thing can cause prices to lower. The price is based a lot on people's sentiments, which can change quite easily based on what they read.
0	1522840085	5	Have you considered setting up a charitable trust fund like the Pineapple Fund?MtGox happened. No way to turn back time. You're going to live a financially comfortable life. The only thing you can affect now is the future. You can do some serious good for this world.
1	1522847121	8	I do not believe anyone would believe in a trust I'd have setup. And I will not give up on trying to get all assets distributed to creditors.
2	1522849536	2	A humble and solid answer. Good luck in your endeavor.
0	1522840164	3	Hey, I always wondered if you were MagicalTux the Netadmin at irc.respublica.frWas running an irc network in the 00' as fun as using it?
1	1522849667	6	That was good times. Tbqh running an irc network in the 00's was much more fun than running one.
1	1522843055	5	There is a French documentary from 2007 called “suck my geek”, and magicaltux aka Mark is featured in it talking about what he was doing back then (if I recall, he was mentioning IRC)
0	1522840238	4	In a recent interview, you claimed the MtGox cold wallet was set up in such a way that you could not verify its integrity. I'm having a hard time understanding how this could be and why you chose to implement it that way. Would you care to explain?
1	1522847366	7	At the time because the cold wallet keys were generated on fully offline hardware, the issue of reliability of the PRNG was raised. To mitigate risks it was found it'd be better to generate many addresses, keep amount smalls and similar to MtGox withdrawals so they can't be differenciated by a third party, and not keeping a list of addresses as it'd give hints to anyone trying to bruteforce the sequence.I do not know if this fear was justified today, but at the time the purpose was to keep the security to the highest. If I was to do that today I'd use HD wallets and multisig to mitigate risk (multiple generator, and many keys generated from one seed).
2	1522856980	1	This is bullshit. PRNG vulnerability would imply that revealing a few **private keys** in the sequence would leak all of them. You did not have that risk for the public keys, nor for the addresses!If the list of addresses was able to leak any information on the keys, the entire cryptography of Bitcoin would be broken; no specific risk for your cold wallet.
0	1522840249	3	After the mt gox crash, were you scared for your life?
1	1522847677	6	I did receive some emails that made me rather scared, yes.
0	1522838608	7	There are plenty of MtGox customers who didn't make the creditors list due to not having authenticated accounts and/or not being able to read Japanese legal papers. Given that you 'don't want this billion dollars' could you find a way to return some of their bitcoin? Asking for a very many friends.
1	1522843013	14	You did not need authenticated account to file a claim and the procedure was available online, and in English too.I understand Civil Rehabilitation will probably open a new window for filing claims, so it'd be possible for your friends to file the claims they failed to file initially. There are also methods that would allow people to file claims even at this point in bankruptcy.
2	1522845132	5	Thanks, that's good to know. Can you elaborate on the methods that allow people to file claims even at this point in bankruptcy?
1	1522843179	4	Hey Mark - I was one of these unfortunate folks, I have emails to prove that I had a significant amount in my gox account, but am not on creditors list. Please advise on what I can do? 
2	1522846303	6	The best avenue is to contact a Japanese attorney. [The US embassy in Tokyo has a list of English speaking Japanese attorneys](https://japan2.usembassy.gov/e/acs/tacs-lawyers-tokyo.html).
0	1522837915	4	What's the food a visitor should go for in Japan?

0	1522839784	12	Thousands of people from this Community lost everything, thousands of destroyed lifes because of this piece of shit and now he's talking as if it wasn't that big of a deal. You shouldn't even be allowed to speak on this subreddit.Not even gonna start with how big of a damage this whole MT. Gox incident created for BTC and Cryptos> Hopefully, I can make what I’ve learned in this experience useful to the community as a wholefuck off and don't come back again. Seriosly, fuck you.
1	1522848363	7	They trusted the exchange, and knew the risks involved. This is a new world, and if we really want deregulation and decentralization, this is what it will cost
1	1522849948	6	Don't be so salty. This guy clearly fucked up, but it was not malicious. He was caught out of his depth with the meteoric rise in popularity BTC saw. I doubt anyone could have predicted the impact of BTC becoming mainstream overnight. What sort of mug puts life destroying amounts into a speculative, largely unknown, intangible, and unregulated "asset" anyway?Not supporting MtGox at all, but back then Bitcoin was a complete and absolute gamble and people knew the risks. People don't sympathize when a gambler loses money at the track, or on the stock market, so why should people sympathize with people losing money in Bitcoin? 
2	1522861654	1	Couldn't agree more.  It's a new concept, new technology, lacks the regulation of a traditional market.  It's a huge gamble with huge potential rewards or losses.  People who are salty because they lost their entire life gambled with their entire financial life.  They wouldn't be complaining if they made a lot of money.  Only a fool would gamble everything, and only a fool would bet their financial future on a highly speculative asset like bitcoin.  And I don't pity the fool for their own mistakes
0	1522840608	2	First, thanks for doing this, you'll undoubtedly cop a lot of (possibly deserved) anger towards you.My question, do you still believe in Bitcoin? Where do you see it headed in say the next 5 years and in your wildest dreams when you got into Mt Gox did you ever see it going this way (both in BTC adoption and what happened to Mt Gox as a whole)
0	1522840889	2	When did you hear about Alexander Vinnik? Where you involved in helping to trace the stolen Bitcoin?

0	1522843391	2	Can I have my bitcoin back?
0	1522844323	2	I think you are a liar, I think MTGox tryed to trade those BTC's during this last 4 months and is still trying. This post is something like "Hahahah bunch of idiots we took your money, crashed the market twice and you all paid us billions of dollars for that! Thanks and don't forget we will crash the market again in the near future!"I just hope you all sell those coins trying to crash the market and get rekt at some point.
0	1522844762	2	Did you think about asking Satoshi if he would donate some of his stash towards the creditors?It would help bitcoin immense if its final clear that satoshi doesnt have anymore coins and for himself he would also be much more safe if he doesnt own that much anymore.Please contact him or ask nick szabo
1	1522847253	3	That is not needed. An update to the wallet software can be issued that voids all transactions to Mt.Gox ever, so that every wallet that ever paid any amount to them, will be automatically reimbursed. This version of the wallet software needs 50% majority on the network to be accepted by the blockchain, but in principle, everybody ever having lost money to Mark would be magically able to grab them back. Much easier than the current process!

0	1522845577	2	I didn’t read anywhere that you will distribute or refuse any coins or funds you may end up profiting.. maybe I missed it.I too can say that I do not want to receive a billion dollars that belong to my past costumers that I have wronged. For lots of reasons, some that you mention. However that does not mean anything really. ‘I really didn’t want this money, it feels bad, I’m sry, but thanks’
0	1522845599	2	Are you a Dread Pirate Roberts 
0	1522845729	2	I started yesterday thread with direct question to Mark in mtgox insolvency disscusion sub about his plans and he has some misguided look regarding tax.         /r/mtgoxinsolvency/comments/892opx/mark_if_mtgox_does_not_enter_civil_rehabitilation/          If he recevie this surplus as a dividend, tax advance is 40% but later settled on his final personal anual net income tax (20.4%) what would get him big tax return. Beside, when trustee settle with all creditors, what he almost can do with recent btc/bcc sale and no need to further btc+ forks sale, or at least not all remaining btc, Mtgox and Tibanne are not longer in bancrupcy liquidation and can resume business with this capital without requesting paying to the shareholders as a dividend. If trustee or court decide current claims is all we get - its over for us. This remaining btc+forks liquidated or not stays as mtgox assets and then bancrupcy proceeding can still get switched to the CR, just without liabilities to us - unsecured mtgox creditors, we would be regarded as settled. Beside, Trustee or nobody can force any shareholder (Mark) to receive dividend. If they liquidate remaning btc (by court order) even there is suficient monies to settle all creditors, this remaining capital can stay at mtgox for whatever time shareholders decide (at mtgox held bank account). Also, Mark can make us, unsecured creditors as Tibanne shareholders where Tibanne own 88% Mtgox, but hes not obligated.

You are a builder as you said and I hope you ll manage to do what you just shared, that would be a beautiful gesture and honorable end of this story. Hopefully you ll use yoyr gift for something else in the future. 
0	1522854117	1	I don't have much to add to all these comments. I just hope that you will put the BTC that you are unable to refund towards a good cause.It is too much money for one single person to have. Many good things can be done with it.Best of luck with everything going on.
0	1522854636	1	I lost ~8 bitcoins from you guys back in the day. I tried to move them and you wouldn’t let me. I tried to cash out and you wouldn’t let me. Can I please have them back?  I could really use the money. I have proof of you need it. 
0	1522860022	1	Hey mark! Nice to hear from you. When I filled my claim I was asked if I would rather like to be refunded in btc or Fiat money, but somehow the trustee sold btc under 500usd. Also I was told that kraken would help in the process, what is kraken role in all this? What are the chances to receive my btcs Back? Cheers
0	1522836482	7	did you sell the bots ran on mtgox that time, and what do u think about the volume on usdt exchanges and do u believe there is suspicious bots running .. and why do you really believe bitcoin grow that too fast in 2017?
0	1522838488	6	Are you planning to get involved with bitcoin again? Do you hold any?
1	1522842708	2	Not at this point, and no.
2	1522852602	1	That's what I would say if I was asked too.
0	1522839258	7	Where are my 20 Bitcoins?
1	1522846974	3	Did you file a claim? If so you'll get a part of this from the bankruptcy, and I'll try to cover whatever remains after that as much as I can.
2	1522847562	2	I have filed a claim for my fund that were lost - but I haven’t heard anything regarding the bankruptcy for over two years. Do you know when things will be roughly able to proceed??
0	1522835875	5	Would you sell?
1	1522836332	6	Sell what? If you mean MtGox, I'm afraid I'd be unable to even if I wanted to because of the various ongoing bankruptcies.
2	1522836832	6	> The way bankruptcy law works is that if there are any assets remaining after the creditors have been paid in full, then those assets are distributed to shareholders as part of the liquidation.I read that so you would receive a major part of the remaining funds in BTC (not fiat).
3	1522837953	4	Payments to shareholders in Bitcoin are unheard of, and are probably not an option since taxes on payments to shareholders have to be calculated, which means whatever is being paid need to have a stable value in JPY.If I end receiving BTC however, I wouldn't sell but instead find a way to distribute this to creditors.
4	1522838709	7	The trustee himself stated that he never market sold, do you have any insight if the Bitcoins have really been auctioned (or OTC traded or whatever)? People don't seem to believe he really didn't cause the major dumps.
5	1522843421	5	I'm afraid I do not have any insight on what happened more than what was published on mtgox.com and said during the creditors meeting.
6	1522846832	2	"since taxes on payments to shareholders have to be calculated" Hi Mark can you please elaborate? Prior to this case I received money out of 2 bankruptcy proceedings (tax free).

0	1522842579	3	This ama is a farce . I have nothing against the guy and or mt gox and I didn’t loose anything Reading the comments here is breaking my heart. People lost money and all are asking the same question which isn’t answered and the real questions won’t be answeredEven if people can claim many people weren’t able to do so, and they’ll still sit on a loss. Easiest way would be to make a diff of claims and balances and refund those that missed the claim at least in half, the remeinaing btc distribute to everybody fair share If this won’t happen you’re a real fraustar and most likely end up being shot. I think you’re smart enough knowing if you get rich out of this dilemma you’re a dead men and somebody will eventually do it. I believe the real intention if you distribute the coins is simply to stay alive I wish you personally good luck in life and hope everything turns out good for you and family I hope everybody gets bitcoins back and they can have a peaceful life 
1	1522845927	4	> This ama is a farce .Mark is an evil narcissist who revels in the attention. He is truly a master of farce.He delayed the forming of a real creditor group by acting as the de facto leader of the bankruptcy community through the mtgoxinsolvency subreddit and offering legal counsel that was woefully incomplete and has resulted in the outcome that legally he will receive most of what's left over.He continues to antagonize us even after he deleted all his reddit posts and claimed he was quitting reddit. I lost many millions of dollars I could have used to better my own life and the lives of those I care about, he makes me feel sick and violated to the very core of my being. 
2	1522846124	2	I’m sorry for you. I hope justice comes to life and you can take care yourself and your family 
3	1522846913	2	I don't think it ever will but I do appreciate the sentiment.
0	1522843703	3	If you don't want those bitcoins, I think the best solution is to accept them, and to burn them (you can send them to a void address, I know it is commonly done on ethereum for tokens, there must be something similar for bitcoin, or you can send them to a locked address, with private key lost).This way those bitcoin will never frighten investors anymore.
0	1522846180	3	I lost 120 BTC that I wouldn't have if mtgox announced they had been hacked when originally discovered. I guess I'm to blame for trusting your company, but why didn't you tell anyone? Why is the bankruptcy process taking so long? Do you think realistically we're ever going to get any money back?
1	1522854076	1	Had MtGox announced the hack prior to bankruptcy, only part of the people would have been able to withdraw, and remaining people would be left with nothing. The purpose of bankruptcy is specifically in this kind of cases to equitably distribute whatever remains. It shouldn't take that long, however, and CoinLab is largely to blame for the delay.
0	1522835680	8	**How much did you pay Roger Ver to post** [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIJ_jpmwzo)?
1	1522836016	15	Nothing. Actually this whole ordeal is very unfortunate, and in the end we covered what we knew was being an issue at the time (banks blocking MtGox related transfers) while the issue was happening on the Bitcoin side.
2	1522844400	4	lol... stop lying you make me puke. This whole AMA is a shit show of lies. Go back to jail
2	1522836200	1	**Oh really!...so why didn't you retract what he was saying, when you knew he was lying on your behalf?**
3	1522840851	12	Bold makes your point stronger
1	1522839038	2	Oh, he didn't pay him directly, he paid the Bitcoin Foundation, which Roger Ver is a part of.

What did you look for in hiring someone?Each employee is quite unique and it'd be difficult to group people in "basic units". The most important trait I will look for is motivation, followed by adaptability and skills.People with no motivation will not produce good work, even if they have the right skills. On the other hand people may learn if they have the right motivation.> Tips for people getting into cryptocurrency now?Same as always. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Store coins on hardware wallets if you can, or on safe devices (mobile phones are probably safer than PCs) and backup your private keys *somewhere safe*.> How do you pick up women?There's no generic way to "pick up" women. Spend time with someone and you'll know if you're made for each other. Or maybe not. Actually there's no way to tell for sure.

1	1522849585	3	That would be the trustee's call, as I don't have authority for this. My guess however is that even if such a lawsuit is successful it wouldn't bring anything substantial.
0	1522839674	2	How was Japanese prison? 
0	1522839846	2	What do you think about the current btc price? Do you think its still overvalued and will go down lower?
0	1522839909	2	Hey Mark, how could you let cyber security become so lax at Mt Gox? 
0	1522839915	2	Do you still drink frappuccinos on a daily basis?
1	1522848806	3	I never drank frappuccinos on daily basis, sorry to disappoint.I did drink something from Starbucks at the time, but today I only drink tea (non sweet kind commonly found in Japan).
0	1522840291	2	Did you see/do you remember receiving the emails from Ross Ulbricht./Dread Pirate Roberts trying to contact you shortly before his arrest? If so, what were your thoughts at the time?
1	1522848942	3	Actually the email in question was sent to my mailbox at the bitcoin foundation, which I never setup and didn't even know existed, so I learned of those emails only after his password was accidently leaked.
0	1522840318	2	**what are your thoughts on successfully having turned 'Mt.Gox' or just 'Gox' into a verb (eg. Jamie got goxxed!) ? thank you.**
1	1522842977	2	Just google it ... k?
0	1522840582	2	Not really a question. But in the last days, 600 US dollars disappeared from my MtGox account. It was converted to Bitcoin and transferred out. Your support staff offered no help whatsoever, and there was no indication that anyone had hacked my account or my linked email. Your company made me lose all faith in Bitcoin as a viable currency due to these antics.
0	1522840593	2	What happens if the courts decide the rest of the 160k BTC will be YOURs.  What will YOU do??
1	1522849116	4	I'll try to distribute to creditors as much as possible.
0	1522840879	2	there is something majorly wrong with the world when company can losses a large sum of it clients money yet - walk away with billions in profit for it. I just wish they recalculated the balance or sold them and paid us out at 1K so at least we could buy bitcoin cheaper. If you had 1 bitcoin, the claim should be for 1 Bitcoin and at least 1 Bitcoin Cash 
1	1522849168	2	I couldn't agree less, yet laws aren't ready for this. I'm hoping this case will set all sorts of precedents and future bankruptcies will be handled better.
0	1522841004	2	Can you petition or send the 160k BTC to a burner dead wallet? 
0	1522841134	2	This is hilarious, whoever claimed it back then basically was forced to hold couple years, and now they get cash equivalent of what they had at that time with BTC still to be given back.All in all everyone involved in mt gox that did not fail to make a claim is better off now then selling off back then, all by incompetence and dishonesty.Isn't crypto wonderful? I mean, I wish all best to everyone involved, but don't fucking tank whole market with these shenanigans. If you don't want to be a billionaire, use these BTC to expand markets instead of destroying it. If these BTC are freely given back, most I assume Will be sold fucking up whole ecosystem.
0	1522841536	2	If CR does not go ahead are you planing to distribute the remaining assets yourself?
1	1522849177	2	Yes, as much as legally possible.
0	1522843422	2	Most of all, how did you lose all that weight? It's for research purposes.
0	1522844212	2	Hello, Mark come to our french forum called jeuxvideo.com, there is a finance forum we want you here pls
0	1522844591	2	When am I going to get my money back? Asshole
0	1522844777	2	How come that transactions made before the announcement (and thus didn't convert to btc) were neither returned not recognised/accepted by the bankruptcy attorney?
1	1522849403	2	I believe you're talking about the Polish account. Because there was a separate bankruptcy process some of the information didn't come through correctly. I believe you'll have an opportunity to file again within civil rehabilitation if it happens, and I sure hope it will.
0	1522845773	2	Hi Mark, sorry what happened to MtGox. Here’s a cheeky live tracker of the amount of money that went missing in the hack and its value today. How much has been found so far, out of interest? Do you look at the rising/ crashing price of bitcoin and think... wow that’s gone into Billions now? https://hodlformoon.io/bitcoin/850000
0	1522851473	2	Why are you so fat, yet French? Where did it all go so wrong?
1	1522853876	1	There are plently of fat French people, but anyway I'm not that fat anymore.
0	1522837480	2	If mtgox enters civil rehabilitation, it means that the company would than pay out the remaining 160k bitcoin.Would YOU or the rehabilitated company than try to run the exchange again? A lot of creditors would probably like that if they get as a gift part ownership of the exchange and maybe a small extra return over the next 10-30 years?They could also sell their share of ownership to investorsPlease do thatHow many million USDollar would it cost as a investment to start the exchange running again? Maybe money for that will be found
1	1522839596	4	Nobody wants MtGox to reopen as an exchange. Most just want their BTC. Without setting up a completely new infrastructure it would also be impossible to relaunch it. And today, there are so many other exchanges, NewMtGox would have a hard time to accumulate volume. The risk of this venture would be too big. 
0	1522838561	1	Why is the trustees dumping to the market instead of otc, another 10,000 was sent yesterday to bitfinex and another dump this morning from bfx??
1	1522842896	6	The trustee [claims he didn't dump on market](https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20180317_qa.pdf): "Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and BCC, not by an ordinary sale through the BTC/BCC exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the extent possible."
1	1522840576	4	1. Trustee said he didn't sell in the open market (see pdf on MtGox.com)2. Those movements are not the GoxCoins. https://www.cryptoground.com/mtgox-cold-wallet-monitor/
0	1522838601	2	Whats your thoughts on Ethereum?Do you prefer Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash?Thanks
1	1522842938	4	I like the concept behind Ethereum as it's interesting, but I believe too untested (maybe not anymore?) for any kind of serious use.As to Bitcoin / Bitcoin Cash, I have no preference at this point.
0	1522838341	3	Hi Mark,1. During the heydey of Mt Gox you were the most popular bitcoin exchange. A lot of child traffickers who accepted bitcoin via pedophiles using backpage.com would have laundered some of their ill gotten gains on your exchange. Did you help authorities identify and arrest these sick people?2. It's impossible for a gaijin like you to do millions of dollars worth of business in Japan without regularly paying the Yakuza. How much were these payments worth and did you ever suspect that the stolen coins, which you covered up for months, involved organized crime?
1	1522842401	17	1. MtGox cooperated as much as possible with law enforcement when presented with valid requests that did not infrige privacy of the MtGox userbase in general.2. I think your image of Japan might be slightly off.
1	1522839133	3	People never talk about how organized crime is involved in most major events.... Theres a reason for that... They kill you if you do
