0	1522812703	17	Shiet you can do this with softforks?I must admit, Bitcoin is getting creative.
1	1522823496	16	Exactly the reason I support Bitcoin core team. Rational people with rational ideas.
2	1522844059	5	Actual engineers proposing actual engineering.
1	1522813661	6	That was one of the major advantages to the script versioning feature enabled around the same time as SegWit. It allows Bitcoin to evolve via opt-in features without requiring a hard fork.
2	1522860889	1	> enabled around the same time as SegWitSegwit is what enabled script versioning.  By separating out the witness data into a new data structure, they incorporated a new field in that data structure called "witness version". 
2	1522824897	0	Meanwhile, the shitcoins are planning to release all future features via hard forks. Grab your popcorn.
3	1522828571	6	Shitcoins aren't necessarily useless. They are random experiments (mostly trivial) that might generate a useful result occasionally without risking the entire Bitcoin community.It's hard to justify the existence of most shitcoins though.
0	1522795324	10	so this might come in this year?
1	1522796741	13	yeah, I just listened a video from Andreas A - he says MAST will come first, then Schnorr. Schnorr probably not in this year.
2	1522854538	1	Yeah, the issue with schnorr is that even though the idea was known/understood, it was only implemented under a patent, and so there's no open source reference code. That means to implement it in bitcoin you're literally starting from scratch, which makes it take that much longer.
0	1522798518	7	by how much % will MAST reduce tx size?
1	1522823448	2	MAST is not so much about reducing TX size (although it does) but more about privacy. With MAST it will be a lot harder to track a specific users transaction history as MAST only requires the most immediate signatures in the tree as a proof of ownership, and not the entire merkle tree as we use now. 
2	1522824797	2	MAST does reduce transaction size, though. Given several alternatives for authorizing a spend, MAST allows only the alternative that is actually used to be disclosed in the spending transaction, with the other alternatives being summarized in a Merkle tree. It's only a significant cost savings for outputs whose redeem scripts have a large number of alternative redemption criteria. For instance, you could have a "3-of-100" multisig output, and spending it wouldn't require encoding all 100 public keys in the redeem script, thanks to MAST.
3	1522825267	1	Certainly! MAST is quite exciting, I was just trying to explain that one of its main goals is to increase privacy and reduce traceability. It certainly reduce TX size (quite a bit) but Schnorr will give us even smaller TX and faster transaction as well. It's just good stuff after good stuff. 
4	1522826056	1	Definitely, so much good stuff in the pipeline for Bitcoin. I'll be so amused when the BTrash "developers" (if they could be called that) utterly botch their attempt to incorporate these enhancements.
3	1522834304	1	Presumably MAST will enable us to do more complex locking scripts, thus any estimations on how much it reduces tx size don't tell the whole story. How much it reduces tx size depends on the transaction, an average could be estimated but that neglects the fact that with MAST we will start doing even more complex scripts, that is, the "average" transaction will change.Afaik MAST goes far beyond simply "reducing the tx size by 20%" or whatever % it is. It would be more accurate to say it "reduces tx size by 20%, WHILE allowing more complex scripts", as well as all privacy enhancements and enabling for further development (I think stuff like Taproot depends on MAST being implemented)The one thing that I haven't wrapped my head around, and notabene I'm quite new to bitcoin development, is the size of the locking script itself. MAST allows us to only publish what's necessary of the redeem script, but afaik it has no effect on the locking script itself? So given very complex conditions, won't the locking script remain large, and grow as the conditions get more complex? Or is the locking script always hashed when transactions are constructed? As I'm writing this I feel like that's the case, but I'm not certain.
4	1522854743	1	> Presumably MAST will enable us to do more complex locking scripts, thus any estimations on how much it reduces tx size don't tell the whole story.Yeah, there's the removal of a current high cost barrier, which will enable types of transactions nobody would do currently because they'd be stupidly large. 
2	1522839347	1	Doesn't it only affect multisig? Surely that's really only an obscure usecase?
3	1522854809	1	Now, sure, but maybe with MAST there are transactions that are now feasible to make which would have previously been very large and thus too expensive for anyone to bother with. 
1	1522811164	1	Not by more than Schnorr sigs will.
1	1522832868	1	A bit. Not much. It's not a deal breaker when it comes to additional capacity.
0	1522830898	6	Focus on features like MAST. Not price, not bch, not Roger. Features will win, nothing else matters. Everything else will follow
0	1522832921	2	Just to clariy, the 'smart contracts' are nothing like Ethereum smart contracts in terms of a capabilities.
1	1522835143	2	That's true, and the title of the article might be somewhat misleading as it says: "enable smart contracts on Bitcoin blockchain"Afaik there is no added functionality with MAST, only optimization, improved privacy and groundwork for further development/improvements.But we really don't want Ethereum-like smart contracts possible on our base layer anyway.
0	1522857151	1	I see now. Bitcoin's price will continue to go down in the interim. Meanwhile, investors and whales will buy up Ethereum. They will then hail Ethereum as a major improvement over Bitcoin (keep in mind your average person doesn't know about Ethereum, only Bitcoin.) Ethereum's price will skyrocket then they will sell. Around this time MAST, RSK, etc. will have been implemented. They will then rotate their Ethereum profits back into Bitcoin and talk about how Bitcoin has these capabilities now too. This will gain them double profits and by this time most alt coins will have failed. Adoption should begin shortly after.
