2	1522802636	1	Do vert
0	1522788590	9	What's with all the sperm swimming out of the crypto logos? J/k bud, looks good!
1	1522808875	3	okay wow, i was hoping we wouldn't have to have this talk until you were a little older, but when a blockchain loves another blockchain....
2	1522836461	1	... you get atomic swaps?
1	1522788624	1	haha thank you! 
0	1522795139	6	The circuit trace thingies are creeping me out, like they have a digital infection
0	1522800833	5	the circuit looks like sperm
0	1522811283	4	The Bitcoin icon needs a bit more contrast.
0	1522787874	3	Cool+1
1	1522787947	2	Thank you sir!
0	1522811592	3	They look ok but too faded and low contrast. And the highlight swoops on each can be deleted.
1	1522838054	1	Agreed, they look like they have some kind of filter over them... Looks a little dingy or pale.  I think they'd look better with more saturation and contrast.But I hate to make any criticism because I do think they're awesome.
0	1522791813	2	Looks super cool. A little contrast for bitcoin wouldn't hurt though, it looks faded next to the others.
1	1522791853	1	Good point I will add some
0	1522796233	2	I think you have a nice portfolio! ;)
0	1522798945	2	make NEO green to match it's signature color
0	1522802046	2	Where’s bitconnect
0	1522803128	2	Your work is really good, I regularly pay for stuff like this, do you submit anything to stock sites?  (like https://graphicriver.net/ ?)  if not, you should look into itEdit: Nevermind, I see on your site that you do, awesome!
1	1522835903	1	Thank you so much!
0	1522814387	2	What's with the wiggly lines? looks like sperm cells, sorry for being rude. Well done on the designs, and thanks for sharing!
0	1522815573	2	These are like Pokemon Gym Badges.
1	1522824364	1	I was going to say the same thing. Gotta hodl 'em all
0	1522817212	2	the pubes on every icon reduces legibility and adds noise to them
0	1522788280	1	Awesome details in there, I would use them on my website (if I had any) :D
1	1522788522	1	haha well you are welcome if you will have one in the future. Who knows ;)
0	1522788290	1	They look good, nice work
1	1522788527	1	Thank you!
0	1522791191	1	nice spermatozoöns
0	1522792141	1	Make the B and outlines in Bitcoin less desaturated imo. Amazing design
0	1522792554	1	wrong order
0	1522793135	1	They look great, well done. Plenty of webmasters out there building out cryptocurrency-related websites and free icons such as these are a major help to them.
0	1522798270	1	Best designs I’ve seen so far
0	1522803711	1	Lisk?
0	1522804806	1	Very cool!
0	1522805713	1	Bitcoin is available for free?
0	1522811433	1	Request: Lightning
0	1522812438	1	Super nice but BTC needs the symbol to be dark like the others for more contrast.
0	1522813725	1	Looks like gym badges 
0	1522815186	1	very beautiful
0	1522817440	1	Make the contrast higher. Deeper colors and deep deep blacks. 
0	1522827696	1	+1 there are not a lot of individuals taking care of good pictures/icons for the crypto space! thank you! good job!
0	1522829024	1	Very nice of you to share! Awesome detail and love the style!
0	1522836534	1	Very nice! Should we see more coins like stellar, eos or credits?
1	1522836850	2	Yes I think since you guys like it that much, I will add all the coins (of course except bitcoin cash)
0	1522852915	1	Bitcoin and Litecoin have the largest symbols, followed by Ethereum. Not sure why you made it smaller in comparison. The bottom 3- the symbols are too small and I think they would look better presented like the top 3, that is, not on a dark circle background. It seems unnecessary.  Aside from that, I love the look and feel of these. Very vintage and nostalgic. Brilliant work.
1	1522853006	1	Thank you so much, your feedback is really great. I will try to implement those changes
0	1522854809	1	Love them. And thanks so much for sharing it, although I only found 3 files in the zip? 
1	1522854883	1	Yeah sorry about that, I will add the rest soon
0	1522856068	1	Steem where is Steem i want one for Steem :D
1	1522858152	1	I will add more the next days :)
0	1522828928	0	I'm too lazy to look. What are bottom 3?
