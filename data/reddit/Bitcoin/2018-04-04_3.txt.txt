2	1522811243	10	Looks like it with sign that says accept Bitcoin and Etherium.
1	1522836024	1	How much overpriced are them?
0	1522807958	12	That enjoy the ride display is upside down 
0	1522795678	8	That's pretty impressive.
0	1522793053	8	Man, worst time to be selling those shirts. All the people who got burned cant even afford one of these.
1	1522793582	2	They must be broke cryptophiles... I pity them.
2	1522801574	2	Looks like they have a little kiosk in a mall. That's not cheap to set up. And I bet they sell a few shirts too. They don't need your pity, but maybe you need theirs. Projection. Yeah, it's a thing.
1	1522836118	1	I ordered 100 btc hat pins a month ago and haven’t sold a single one. Unless this company has a great local crypto community, that business is gonna go belly up in 6 months.
0	1522801856	2	West Edmonton mall? 
0	1522803304	2	Stonebriar mall.
0	1522823242	2	That "Bitionaire" shirt wasn't too well thought out
0	1522831444	2	Oh nice, you should see if you can get them for $7 rather than the $20 they were priced at yesterday... no wait that's bitcoin haha I get confused.
0	1522803383	1	West County Center?
0	1522804830	1	Oh man. I will visit this mall.
0	1522814465	1	That mall near Miami?
0	1522814552	1	pretty awesome
0	1522817052	1	Not a great indicator typically. E.g. any mall store or kiosk dependent concept ever
0	1522822084	1	Fuck I want that blue LTC shirt 
0	1522837173	1	I think that there wouldn’t be so much btc payers, because everybody holds that coin as first, in the second it’s not so usable to pay for btc now, because you have to wait sometimes for hours after your transaction confirmed, in third there are huge fees, which sometimes equal to the price of thing which you wanna buy. it’ll more usable to pay by another currencies with a very fast transactions and very small fees, like stellar (14k tps) or Credits coins (400k tps) or some others with a same opportunities.
0	1522844702	1	What kind of people buy shirts with their state on it? Do they not know how to remember or describe where they are from?  Might as well get an entire map on their shirt so they don’t get lost. 
1	1522859773	1	I saw a stripper named Texas with a tattoo of Texas on her ass. This in IL mind you. Not sure but I think that somehow answers your question. 
0	1522844391	0	Those shirts are so fucking cringe.
