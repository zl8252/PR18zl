1	1522846598	3	That's right lol
0	1522833375	9	Why every single one of these bitcoin related ADs smell scam from a mile ?What audience are they targeting ?
1	1522838426	9	The audience that has heard about the astronomic rise of btc price but is too dumb to learn about it themselves.
2	1522846621	1	This also right 8)

0	1522840530	3	An ad trying to take advantage of the less informed by promising crazy gains should not be seen as a positive. CFD's are insanely risky for those who don't understand them. Read up on the Swiss Frank un-linking, people with relatively small positions ended up losing thousands. in one case a ¬£2 position led to a ¬£5500 loss! Bitcoin would not have the same leverage ratio of course, but losses can still be phenomenal https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/how-could-a-teacher-on-18000pa-lose-280000-spread-betting-10115157.html
0	1522845084	3	Got the same mag a month ago, registered with invest.com which it advertises and yesterday got an email from them stating they are closing! 
1	1522846749	3	Well, that's good. These sort of companies are pretty parasitic at the end of the day...It doesn't take science knowledge to own some BTC. Isn't it supposed to become a day to day thing? That's why I am not even turning my stake back into fiat
0	1522844511	2	I saw these type of hype posts while losing thousands in a solar company. I‚Äôm grateful for that experience, it helped me avoid bitcoin and keep avoiding it at the moment.How would an Ad in a magazine help reinforce the idea of purchasing this product, really?Edit - I struggle to choose which hype thread to post in... they‚Äôre literally all just trying to convince themselves their investment is smart, and people watching will see this mass positivity and invest without REAL research on the subject.
0	1522820534	1	Aye nice!
0	1522825922	1	Hore
0	1522833558	1	I saw it in an EasyJet flight too, there were 3 or 4 full page adverts plus a couple articles about bitcoin and cryptos.Pretty incredible if you think about it
1	1522846938	2	That's right, it was an EasyJet flight and there are other pages talking about crypto...I took snaps but I didn't want to spam Bitcoin page, also because other ones were pretty generic but still all about investing in it. On the other hand, I was travelling home from another flight the other day and while I was on the train from gatwick airport (UK) I saw at a tube stop the big poster Ad saying "Have you ever invested in Crypto? la di da" I didn't have time to take a snap but I was like "Hey!!"
2	1522847188	1	Yes, shit's getting real.It's a bit disappointing that even with all of that publicity, the market doesn't seem to be able to attract new investors. People probably still feel overwhelmed/suspicious of crypto...I guess we need more day to day adoption.
3	1522865785	1	I'm my country they say..."Rome wasn't built in a day". I can see where they come from by saying something like that
0	1522827495	1	Jesus. Moon
1	1522849921	2	didn't read the ad did you? Its a scam
0	1522836370	1	1mln.‚Ç¨ in the end of 2020, thats the only thing I want to believe on this pic., but I‚Äôm not really sure about that. I think that this Bitcoin comes to the past and in the nearest future another currencies will reach the forward positions because of the more advanced technology, such as stellar or credits for example with a very fast,cheap and safer transactions.
1	1522838266	-1	I think Stellar has a great shot at this.
