0	1522812310	6	Thats a nice bounty...
0	1522814562	5	I have a few connections to this show. I love when btc is mentioned in the blacklist and on Mr robot 
1	1522836121	3	Well tell someone it's way over $700k
0	1522836202	5	It's from season 3, 2 years ago.
1	1522836487	2	Ah, that explains how it's only $300 per BTC. Was wondering since it hasn't been below $1k for a year now.
0	1522825477	2	Meet you at the last right location, guys. Split the reward 50/50  
0	1522835707	2	Is the Blacklist worth watching?
1	1522836215	2	Yes.
1	1522860998	1	Yes, the technobabble is kind of bad at times, but it's still a pretty good show. It's on Netflix right now, usually a season behind whatever season is airing.
0	1522839675	1	Aram also uses it in a season 1 episode to securely transfer money from one account to another when Reddington suspects him of being the mole. He does a “quick transaction” in under a minute using bitcoin and a few other things. Very unrealistic for the time... 
1	1522861145	1	The technical scenes can be kind of cringe-inducing, but it's not a bad show. There's been a few instances where Aram "hacks the hacker" in a very unbelievable and unrealistic way, but for an action-oriented TV show, there's been far worse out there (CSI/NCIS, *ahem*).
0	1522840255	1	BTC has been featured on various shows lately, it's great.
0	1522856128	1	That means btc would be worth $256.10 USD
0	1522856603	1	I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen this show to watch it. Fantastic character development and storyline.
0	1522860659	1	Startup is a show on Crackle about crypto.  It's kind of interesting in ways.
