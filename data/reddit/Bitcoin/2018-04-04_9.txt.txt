0	1522783954	38	Can confirm. Have personally seen Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille murder and drink the blood of several babies. I don't agree with Roger on much but this is without question. 
1	1522784921	7	Iâ€™m happy Roger warned us. When I look at Roger I always wonder how much goodness can exist in a single person.
2	1522785195	5	Exactly. That's why he's called Bitcoin Jesus.
3	1522785274	17	\* Bitmain Jesus.
4	1522785639	9	You kinda ruined it with the non-sarcasm :( 
5	1522822457	5	Still funny...
1	1522803095	1	Doesn't that just show that they're just atheists?
2	1522828614	1	No, thats with kitties

0	1522795866	23	The way Roger Ver spews constant vitriol just reeks of douchebag. All he does is repeat the alternative facts that he feels benefit his marketing movement, talk loudly, and has a complete disregard for reality, just makes him seem desperate.
1	1522806943	8	He was born in silicon valley, you couldn't get a better more easy start to life, millionaire criminal at a young age and dodging taxes and other rich man problems ever since, while crying crocodile tears for the poor and blaming everyone else.
0	1522781468	6	Gross
0	1522812558	3	Is this guy off his nut or what?
1	1522826863	2	Yes
0	1522828322	3	More fake libertarians are getting dumber because of Roger, Bcash people are literally turning into full retards because of Roger.
1	1522828728	1	Dont forget Falkvinge and faketoshi
0	1522782711	4	Bitcoin "oracle" seems desperate.
0	1522799111	5	Just watch his presentation from the SV conference.  It's one logical fallacy after another.This particular one is:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion
0	1522784461	6	That coffee argument... So Satoshis original plan was according to ver. that only ~17 million cups of coffee can be served per day...  (32000000\*6\*24)/266No! **we need the lightning network.**
1	1522813869	1	So bcash can only support 17 million*8= 136 million cups of coffee per day? Too bad it won't be enough for even the US as americans consume over 400 million cups of coffee per day.(400M cups/day according to a 2011 survey so probably over 400 by now)
2	1522814066	1	I love stats.  Thank you!
2	1522825228	1	If your \* 8 is for eight megabytes... Then the limit is (8000000*6*24)/266 = 4 million cups of coffee.. But the is not satoshis true vision^tm
0	1522782219	2	Hah!
0	1522837572	2	This guy is completely insane
0	1522796284	2	When did he get out of jail?
1	1522803849	3	Too fucking soon.
0	1522831098	1	Full debate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSbPz4g9rZQ
0	1522848478	1	jeez whats wrong with this fool?
0	1522850862	1	Is Roger doing something fishy in his free time that we are not aware of?
0	1522790622	1	1 BCH = 0.095 BTC  ...do I need to say more?
1	1522803205	3	[when 0.01?](https://medium.com/@btcWolves/bch-heading-towards-the-abyss-f1b2b9ec41f1)
