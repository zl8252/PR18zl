1	1522874049	47	I have a buddy in statistics who basically says "what do you want the data to conclude?" to his clients when they hire him.It's a good source, sure, but charts can be deceiving.
2	1522874605	46	Your buddy is not in statistics. He's in customer satisfaction. No statistician would say what he is saying. 
3	1522874755	28	There are tons of ways to lie using valid and accurate statistics.  A simple/obvious example:  93% of people who have ever consumed H2O are deceased. A better way to say this is "Your buddy is not an honest statistician.  No honest statistician would say what he is saying."
4	1522884587	8	96% is more accurate. Mortality is not guaranteed, only 96% probable according to current data.
5	1522946788	1	whoosh

4	1522921729	3	Holy shit! How do I stop consuming this deadly H2O?! 
5	1522939586	1	7% chance of immortality broroll the dice
5	1522946098	1	*dihydrogen monoxide
4	1522875071	6	I never said there weren't tons of ways to lie. I'm comfortable with the way I said it. Anyone who meets with clients and finds out what they want from the data before even looking at the data it's not working as a statistician. Anyone with Excel can do that. Having Excel does not make one a statistician any more than this guy's friend is
5	1522936162	2	hodl to the moon!
5	1522928789	0	God you are obtuse. Do you live in the real world? 
6	1522933014	2	I bet you have a lot of friends. 
7	1522939537	1	Not everyone has your work ethic standards, in fact is has been proven over and over that corporations use statistics to lie.
4	1522927557	1	Seat belts are bad for you! The number of seat-belt related injuries increased after they were made mandatory!
4	1522876793	1	Not lying but rather making the data show something else. His chart could be misleading but a chart that lies isn't a data chart.
3	1522876957	4	It's probably said sarcastically to expose confirmation bias within clients. Those clients would reciprocate either with either 1) I get it, let's let the data speak for itself or 2) Here's our conclusion, go find some data that conforms to our opinions. Statisticians are, unfortunately, often at the mercy of clients with confirmation bias
3	1522879606	1	> No statistician would say what he is saying.Well that depends on whether his future pay depends on customer satisfaction. The point is that with some clever thinking, there's a way to present the facts that help most possible conclusions you could want to get. Not all, of course, but most.'The truth' is not as simple as some people wish it was. Lots of times, there are actually several equally justified ways of presenting data, depending on what your perspective is.

2	1522876241	6	I totally agree that you can present data in a certain way to reinforce your opinions . That is why I stated that it is important to gather information from as many different sources as possible before making decisions. That is what the internet is good for. I happen to like that this particular post is presented in nicely put together chart for me to digest quickly.

1	1522902900	1	These charts imply that over time it will always just keep going up.They're no better than any other speculative TA
1	1522890476	-1	because some people are going to lose a LOT of money when this crashes
2	1522944878	1	And some will make a shitload.
2	1522898325	1	We already did so. For those of us who didn't sell at the top and have mostly hodl'd it's impossible for us to lose all that much more. ;-)

0	1522877163	20	ITT people saying the chart is misleading, but can't show a chart that goes back farther than December that contradicts it... And don't realize the charts look the same after each ATH- the previous spike is just so small in comparison they just don't notice it.All these people saying the past doesn't predict the future, but can't find any data saying the upcoming generations don't prefer decentralization, and do trust banks/government.
1	1522900308	2	Trading currencies and crypto currencies can be likened to driving a car backwards without the benefit of a rear view mirror. It can be done only looking from where you came from but you had better be prepared to stop and change course if the road suddenly becomes a sharp corner.
1	1522936720	1	> ITT people saying the chart is misleading, but can't show a chart that goes back farther than December that contradicts itThe chart was made in March 19, 2018. How could it be wrong about whats happened before December?Are you saying this chart is an accurate prediction of the past?
1	1522898415	-4	It’s misleading because the Y axis is not uniform, and so the perceived rate of change is misleading. If the y axis was uniform, the plot would look more like the Grand Canyon. 
2	1522899916	20	Its uniformly logarithmic. Linear scales are misleading. You can't even decipher compound interest from fixed income investments with linear scales, as on long time scales it turns into canyons too. With logarithmic scales you get straight lines for constant interest rates.
2	1522903003	6	It is uniform log, and seems to  e showing a much more uniform trend than the linear graphs.Still haven't seen a more accurate one.. 
2	1522903531	7	The Y-axis is perfectly uniform... are you not aware of logarithmic scale graphs (and why they're used)?
0	1522899072	6	I'm still bullish
0	1522919572	3	It's crazy that my fiance had about $2,000 or so in Bitcoin in 2015 before he died and now it's increased in price so much that if I knew how to access his wallet, I would have so much money. Not trying to sound like a terrible person, I just know that he's thinking "wow, I wish I could tell her how to get that" too. Of course, I'd rather him just be here...
1	1522926549	1	Do u know how he had it stored 
2	1522927313	1	I can't remember. Maybe I have the name of it wrote down somewhere, but I don't think so. He kept it all very untraceable and everything he did was hidden in layers of codes. He would of told me, but I never cared to ask since he had it all under control.
1	1522940526	1	How much Bitcoin have you purchased since his death?
0	1522897659	15	>Hey guys on a log chart a 70% drop doesn't look so bad!Fucking kek

4	1522938517	1	> lmao made a comeback?I don't know, I see it a lot in memes and meme-speak.
0	1522909012	5	If you extrapolate, just 1 BTC will be worth more than the entire world's GDP eventually, so where does the pattern break down?  
1	1522936775	5	Never. bitcoins growth will exponentially increase forever.If you want to predict the future of bitcoin just draw a straight line going up. 1 BTC = 1 BTC
1	1522929744	1	Past the moon and at the event horizon of the black hole in the centre of the galaxy.
0	1522923394	2	It is a bit sad we have this high inflation environment for two more years, but this is needed due to the level of current technological advancement. If Bitcoin survives to next halving it is going to OBLITERATE all fiat currencies.
0	1522933821	2	Next halving is going to be glorious!!!
0	1522938608	2	The 10M at the top of that chart...  Could you even imagine?

0	1522885737	7	Conformation Bias chart
1	1522896254	0	And I'm pretty sure Bitcoin's value would be nearing the bottom green line at today's price. But it's okay because they're not price predictions.
2	1522898077	6	The data is not that far behind.. If you overlay the most recent data it's just come below the top line at todays pricehttps://puu.sh/zWxfi/a557df2035.jpg
3	1522899255	0	 don't do that to yourself...  data??  Ouch man. You're gonna get hurt. 
4	1522905627	2	IDGI.. are you saying the trading price is not data?
5	1522936900	1	If you could predict future price just from previous price how would investors ever lose money?There are hedge funds with billions of dollars to play with, do you honestly think they can't afford the best mathematicians in the world if predicting the market was as simple as applying maths to a graph of previous price?Lots of factors go into price. If price was only caused by previous price then you could predict future price based on price alone.
6	1522942573	1	I didn't make any predictions, I just showed that the current price is not closer to the bottom green line as suggested by another user
5	1522905843	-1	Ouch. Not really buddy 
6	1522942114	1	Why are you getting hurt so much? I DON'T UNDERSTAND
7	1522944350	1	Ouch!! It's painful
2	1522899369	1	 Value?  It's not possible to properly value. You're trying to predict a trend with no evidence. Don't hurt yourself, especially if you don't have money to burn.
0	1522867390	2	So we are in for some cheap bitcoins before the halving makes it take off again?
1	1522873469	1	it could be like from 2013 to 2016, it didn't stick in the green dotted range, who knows
0	1522883626	2	Beautiful chart
1	1522889500	1	the idea behind it is indeed smart
0	1522916536	0	I'm bullish on BTC, but this chart is beyond retard
0	1522919571	1	So we are dumping to around 2.5k to hit that bottom line.  Good to know. 
0	1522929667	1	It all makes sense now 🤗
0	1522930715	1	This chart makes it look like we're about to look at a $5,000 BTC
0	1522944819	1	Is it a coincidence that the last bull run started after the last halving? I think not.
0	1522898737	1	Charts can be made to show anything you want to see. Its a feel good mirror
1	1522908744	3	Show us long term chart that is bearish.
0	1522881211	1	"not for predictions"Oh really? You put the lines in extending past the present into the future for a reason. It's not a legal prediction but what is the point of this chart if not to suggestA) that the price is still consistent with a logarithmically increasing price, orB) there will be a price bump after the next halving?
1	1522945065	1	The price could be anywhere below the bottom line or above the top one.
0	1522878547	1	Later
0	1522868758	0	Sure, if everything else on the market looks the same as it did those years as well. Hint: it wont ;)
1	1522868991	3	You seem really knowledgeable. Tell us more.
2	1522871972	11	It seems to me that bitcoin is definitely going to go up or down, unless it holds its current value.
3	1522877621	3	This is good for Bitcoin.
0	1522872465	-5	I see a crash to $2000 this year and then a upward trend to 50k until mid 2019. It has to be a big crash this year, otherwise BTC will not go forward. With every big crash many unnecessary panic sellers leave the stage and remain only true bitcoiners... [It's always good to remind this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VIfo4YbELY&feature=youtu.be)
1	1522872976	14	> It has to be a big crash this year, otherwise BTC will not go forward.Circular reasoning.  
1	1522898622	2	That doesn't make sense. Driving away weak hands so only "true bitcoiners" remain is the opposite of mass adoption and the widespread demand that comes with it. It's a thought that may please the ideological purists but won't help their bottom line.
1	1522912562	1	Sadly if BTC goes under 5k, everybody here will buy a bit, cancelling completely the downfall to 2k.
0	1522930457	0	Thats a fuking stupid chart/graph.
0	1522868717	-15	Yeah, this is another attempt at manipulating market data to make it look better than it really is.  For starters, they put the bitcoin price on a log scale, which increases the upward slope. In doing so it also de-emphasizes the massive recent downturn from $20k to less than half of that. But because of the BS log scale, it only looks like a tiny blip a the end when in fact it's much more massive of a downturn and sell-off.     You need to tag people who post crap like this and avoid them if you want to truth.  Otherwise, if you enjoy the lies, then by all means continue contributing to the FOMO lies.    [have a look at a real, non-logarithmic chart](https://i.imgur.com/glGJwUR.jpg)
1	1522869242	18	Log chart actually decreases the upward slope, eh?
2	1522874175	5	it increases upward slope for lower values compared to an absolute chart showing ATH. the log chart nevertheless is the better depiction as realtive value changes are far more interesting.
1	1522880781	8	Yeah and your linear chart makes it look as if completely nothing has happened in Bitcoin from 2013 until late 2017, how does that make sense?
2	1522880905	-2	Because that's actually what happened, more or less. It was extremely stagnant in price.    This is important to see because it highlights that for the majority of bitcoin's lifetime, it was not going to the moon.  The majority of it's lifetime, it was not increasing exponentially. Thus the log chart misrepresents the data for the lifetime of bitcoin.
3	1522891897	1	It wasn't stagnant in the first part, it crashed, from $1100 to below $200. And your chart makes that part look like a flat line, which means it's bullshit - it would have also looked like a flat line if it went back from $200 to $1100 back then. If you can barely see a movement 5-6x up or down on a chart, then it's useless. And the current crash, which looks soo scary on your chart, is actually just half of that crash. If you invested $1000 in winter 2014, you'd have $160 a year later, and if you invested $1000 in December 2017, you'd have $300+ now. Your chart doesn't show that.
4	1522897188	0	> Your chartSon, both charts have value. Log scales allow a large range to be displayed without small values being compressed down into bottom of the graph. Normal scales allow a large range to be displayed without recent changes in value being compressed.
1	1522877349	3	If it was a massive sell off then it would be returning to a dollar. Calm down.
1	1522876885	5	Thank you for weighing in with the Bcash perspective.
2	1522896598	2	> Bcash Literally not even mentioned.
3	1522903007	0	No need.
1	1522869389	4	Tag me, please.
2	1522869435	-19	Already did. And I will downvote and call out any more of this fake data and FOMO bs I see.  
3	1522869673	6	What makes this fake or FOMO data? I don't understand. This chart is fantastic as far as I'm concerned. It's interesting data.
4	1522870645	6	Go look at the stock market and pick any new company that has performed well over the 1 year.  Let's say they did an IPO at $25 a share (opening price) and it's currently at $250/share, or a ten-fold increase.  When placed on a logarithmic scale, where it increases from $25 to $250 to $2500, etc... you're going to see a nice steep incline from $25 to $250.  Now, knowing all that you know about how the stock market works, is going from $25 to $250 over the period of 1 year a solid indicator that it's going to be $2500 next year? Of course not.  That's insane.  But...the graph makes it look like that's going to happen.  Wrong.  The graph shows what has happened, not what will happen.    When a company has an IPO, and is successful, we usually see a pretty steep increase in price over a relatively short amount of time. But of course it soon levels-off and grows at a more reasonable, not exponential growth.  The same holds true for bitcoin.  Just because it got hyped up into a bubble doesn't mean that hype is going to continue forever and ever until it (LOL) overtakes fiat.  It's going to level off at a point. So the prediction of $100,000 at 2020 is pure fantasy BS.    More important is that the log scale also obfuscates major declines near the peak.  It went from $20k to now about $7k (currently less), which is more than half of price lost, yet, on the chart, it's but a pimple.  It's obfuscating the real data.  The real data is the shit was cut in half and this chart doesn't represent that reality very well.    Another example for you:  Let's say you have a friend and they want to borrow some money.  For most of us, it's no big deal to loan anywhere from $1 to $10.  But $10 to $100 is a different matter.  Yet, why is it given the same amount of high space in a logarithmic chart?  Are we to be fooled into thinking that during the first 2 years of bitcoin, when it was priced from about $0 to $10, that it was doing anything other than stagnating and virtually worthless?  When in fact, that was very much the truth.    [Put the chart on a price line from when bitcoin became somewhat popular (~$1000 near the end of 2013) to the current price and don't use a logarithmic scale.](https://i.imgur.com/glGJwUR.jpg)  What you will see is a lot less exciting and less upwardly mobile. Now, that's not to discount the fact that bitcoin made great gains during that run from 2017 to 2018, but that hype run is not indicative of the direction it's headed. The direction it's headed from the crash down from $20, is downward, not upwards.  The market indication, that is useful to investors, is that it's downwardly mobile, not upwardly mobile.  Because we can clearly see the rise and fall from $20k was an unrealistic hype bubble.  Once you scatch that shit out, then what you see is:  short term (3-6 month) speculation is downward, but long term speculation, based on prior non-hype performance, is up, but not as much as OP has made it out to be.  
5	1522870846	1	I got something totally different from the chart. It actually foretells a prolonged bear market for the next 3 years if the $1,200 bubble is any indication of a pattern.
6	1522871654	4	There is no long term pattern or speculation for bitcoin.  Any attempts to do so are inaccurate.  Here why:    Lets say it's January 1, 2015.  More than a year ago you saw bitcoin go on a meteoric rise to about $1200 and then crash back down to about $300.  The forecast, on January 1, 2015 was exceedingly pessimistic and negative, based on prior data.  By all indication, bitcoin was at the end and barely alive.  So why couldn't we predict the boom from 2016 to 2018 based on prior data?  Because you cannot predict the long term future of a chaotic system like bitcoin using prior market data when the prior market was never stable in the first place.   Fast forward to 2018 and here we are, pretending we can see far into our crystal ball 2 years into the future when we were unable to do that on January 1, 2015?  What changed that we now have some magical insight?  Nothing of course. It's just more people spreading FOMO.    But, the data isn't entirely useless.  We can make reasonable short term predictions.  For example, I can pretty safely predict that bitcoin is not going above $20k by tomorrow afternoon.  While that might be possible a few months out, it's just not going to happen overnight.    With bitcoin, you can only look into the future by a few days to a few weeks.  1 week out it could be + or - about $2-3k, tops. Like it's not going to be less than $3800 or more than $9800.  2 weeks out that margin of error is even more.  1 day out it's it's probably not going to be more than $1000 +/- from where it is today.  That is the predictable volatility of bitcoin based on typical daily or weekly market swings.    Now, we are also into a downturn from $20k, and that trend has been, each week on average, down.  So next week, it's probably going to be on the down side of that +/- $3000 variable.  And that's not going to change until we see an extended period (3-4 weeks) of leveling-off or going up in price. Indicating that it has either stabilized or rebounding.  
7	1522872555	2	I believe there is a pattern, and order beneath the chaos: a series of bubbles (i.e. 10x followed by an ~80% drop) until it stabilizes at a very high value (i.e. $5T+). I wrote [this article](http://realvirtualcurrency.com/real-virtual-currency/2013/04/22/bitcoin-the-beautiful-bubble-machine) 3 bubbles ago and my framework has given me the confidence to just accumulate and hodl.
8	1522872864	1	At the end of 2013 it crashed because of MtGox as well as problems with mining equipment being on pre-order for too long.  The late 2017 crash was due to clarification of tax laws, as well as it generally being a bubble that had to pop.    Two totally different events.  That's not enough data to make predictions on. I understand the pattern you are seeing by looking at the raw data, but the raw data is not enough. You need to understand what triggers the events.  That is why we cannot predict the stock market in the same way. In the case of stocks, we need to look at the company, not the charts.  
9	1522873453	1	In many ways, I think the run up itself is the trigger for the correction. It's a bit like gravity. Anything commodity that goes up 10x in 3 months is going to enter a bear market. There are simply too many people in the black for it to be sustainable. Plus, while we don't have a ton of data points, we have at least 4: summer '11, early '13, late '13, and late '17. Yes, there will always be some kind of precipitous for the bubble to pop. But like a balloon surrounded by needles, it doesn't really matter what it is. That's my humble opinion!
9	1522874210	1	>That is why we cannot predict the stock market in the same way.You should tell the financial institutions that all of their CMT's are a waste of money and that the statistics they have proving technicals work in specific scenarios are probably bs. 
6	1522892448	1	Notice that we were way higher above the green lines in 2013, because that was the *second* bubble in a row, now we only had one. We're practically at the same level as Jan 2015 in relation to the lines.
7	1522896374	1	If we get a double bubble in 2017/18, you won’t find me complaining. 
5	1522892605	1	> Now, knowing all that you know about how the stock market works, is going from $25 to $250 over the period of 1 year a solid indicator that it's going to be $2500 next year? Of course not. That's insane.You're right. Except Bitcoin is not a stock, and its price doesn't work like a stock's price, so any such knowledge of how stock prices work can only be partially useful.
1	1522873928	3	log is a better representation as it's a relative depiction, which is all that counts. absolute data on it's own is useless. it's nonsense like people buying altcoins because they're cheaper per coin.
1	1522873605	2	You can say the opposite is true: that even though bitcoin lose more than half its value it’s still up from ~$200 just a few years ago. Log shows a better picture of long term growth. 
2	1522873873	0	> Log shows a better picture of long term growth.    No, it doesn't.  It just shows you what YOU want to see.    On OPs chart, the scale is 10x. 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc...  Change the values, to 100x, also logarithmic, and what do you see?  Logarithmic scales for bitcoin are ridiculously bad at representing data such as a long term stagnation periods that surround the 2 major bubbles.  Any argument otherwise is either ignorance or lies.
3	1522874813	7	Yeah duh. Log charts are used to observe growth rates in exponents. Bitcoin started off as mere cents 9 years ago. A log chart is appropriate. The point is don’t throw a hissy fit based on price movements since December. 
4	1522874904	0	Are you trying to change my mind or call me a moron? Because you're not going to accomplish both.      Edit: Oh, I see, we're calling people morons and then changing the text.  
5	1522875119	2	[removed]
6	1522878578	1	Stop berating people.
1	1522897540	1	Why are you attacking the log scale so much? I read most of your comments, and your problem is that you think this graphic is implying future predictions. The log scale makes sense to help visualize the sharp rises and falls from a proportional standpoint, which makes plenty of sense considering how people are likely to think about their gains and losses.The graphic is completely clear about it being a log scale; log scales aren't inherently misleading.  It is also clear that the green lines do not predict the future price.The worst thing you can fault them for is continuing the green lines further than they should have, as it seems to appear as a prediction at first glance, and that could be misleading if someone doesn't read the text.

If I have *y* amount and it doubles, then it'll be twice as high on the chart.  If I have *z* amount and it halves, then it'll be half the height on the chart.  Log charts show *real* changes in value.Linear charts on the other hand show some arbitrary figure that can be manipulated at will to show misleading information.  Let's imagine a simple case of 10 satoshi is the same value as 1 McDonalds hamburger.  If I have 20 satoshi, I can buy 2 hamburgers.  If you have 100 satoshi, you can buy 10 hamburgers.  If the value doubles, then on a logarithmic chart, we can both see that our values (in terms of hamburgers) is twice as much.  My line will be at exactly 4 hamburgers and yours will be at 20 hamburgers.Compare this to a linear chart.  On the linear chart, your line went up 160 units higher than mine (mine went to 40 and yours went to 200), making you appear to have done 80 times as well out of it than I have.  This can easily shown to be arbitrary manipulation since you can change these apparent values just by introducing different units.  Instead of satoshi, we could measure in µBTC.  In µBTC, I went from 0.2 to 0.4 and you went from 1 to 2.  Looking at it that way, you only did 0.8 better than me.  In reality however, we both did equally as well - doubling our value.    If it's still not clear, do the same thought experiment with dollars and cents.  Me going from 200 cents to 400 cents and you going from 1000 cents to 2000 cents.  Whether you choose to call those values $2, $4, $10 and $20 is irrelevant - the meaning is the same.  Simply put: directly convertible units are meaningless and only percentage change can be used for anything meaningful.^((note: do not spend all your BTC on hamburgers.  If you die young of heart disease and poor due to having no BTC left, you miss out on all the fun of being a curmudgeonly old man like me who can tell people to get off his oversized lawn)^)

This post is not claiming some objective truth, it’s just someone’s view on zoomed out trends in price movement.   Saying an asset has a history of cycling boom and bust with an overall upward trajectory is hardly a lie.

All these “experts” saying it’ll bull in the next few months are the same people who lost their life savings and said the same bullshit excuse millions of times. The profitable side of bitcoin was about a year ago to late November last year. Don’t get salty bc you too invested thousands into a currency that failed 🤷🏼‍♂️

0	1522868423	-5	By the looks of this we are sitting at or below $8k til the next halving?
1	1522869194	7	? I don't see, where you get that information from. I see the following: In about 12 months bitcoin will be at $10k worst case, best case about $35k. When the halving occurs, it should be at least at $35k, best case would be around $100k. That's in about two years and a little. One year later, in mid 2021, worst case scenario is bitcoin around $100k. Just the interpretation of the graph, not necessarily my opinion.
2	1522869758	1	I'm basing it off the fact that once the price peaks during the halving window, it doesn't come back up to that peak again until after it has halved. 
3	1522870944	3	Looking at your post history, I see you're an altcoin shill. Now I understand...
4	1522872260	7	Lol I love people like you
5	1522915901	-1	Btw hope your realized the *two* peaks within the halving period before, don't you.
