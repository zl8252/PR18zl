0	1522913500	22	what r u smokin?
1	1522913970	1	Being optimistic is not smoking something !!!
2	1522924346	18	No, just a great way to get fucked and lose money. By all means, keep doing that.
3	1522928032	2	Careful.  With comments like this you may trigger intense flashbacks to 2011... 2013... and the gazillion other times optimistic bitcoiners were lampooned by naysayers for taking the long view :pTL;DR: [Not this time] (https://youtu.be/-hlN2nel5HI)
4	1522931026	2	How bad is it going to suck that people like you who missed out on 5+ rallies are dumping your money into it now thinking there has to be another one, only for you to lose all your shit?Basically you guys are the definition of FOMO.
5	1522931355	6	Check my reddit history friend.  Been here on r/bitcoin since 2013.  And prior to that was integrating bitcoin for non profit projects.  I'm a coder in love with the technology; not a get rich quick speculator.But hey, we're all on a different path.  What will be, will be.  Peace x
5	1522943387	1	How bad is it going to suck when people like you who were so sure there would never be another rally miss out on an yet another opportunity to buy in and reap the profits of it once it happens?Basically you are the definition of FUD.
6	1522953168	1	Except there's way more of a proven track record of newb investors getting fucked over FOMO then there is with FUD. 
5	1522941997	1	RemindMe! One Year
3	1522928662	-2	If you're keeping your money in a bank, it will buy a lot less a year from now. If you put it in Bitcoin, it will buy more.
4	1522933433	5	If you think banks are lesa stable than bitcoin, you're fucking delusional to the point of ridiculousness
4	1522930666	3	That's a bit of a stretch
4	1522930469	5	Yeah, you don't really know that. And the value of money doesn't really fluctuate that much that you'd buy a lot less a year from now.
4	1522933627	1	On average the inflation in my country is 2% per year (I think it's 3-3.5% in the US), I am not sure that would count as **a lot**.Plus why would I keep it in a bank with barely any interest when I can buy a low-risk index fund? That way I'll steadily make ~5% profit each year, i.e. beating the inflation.
4	1522933911	1	Depends on how much you keep in the bank vs. how much you invest in Bitcoin.
4	1522938507	1	Guaranteeing gains is a sure sign someone is smrt. 
4	1522931073	0	deflation is not a characteristic of a currency. bitcoin is not a currency if what you're saying is true.
5	1522951074	1	it's a currency for all intents and purposes smart guy.you wouldn't call the internet a telephone but that's what it is
0	1522929749	3	haha, Good one!
0	1522918361	7	Honey badger don't give a flying fuck.We will rise again, smart money buys now when everything is long faces and despair and sells when the dumb money starts pouring in.
1	1522928582	1	No, smart money never sells.
2	1522929279	1	Of course it does don't be naive. If you had known this would you not have sold at ATH and increase your stake by 50%?
3	1522931588	2	> had knownI don't have a magic 8 ball so I didn't know. This is why hodling is the sure fire way to never lose Bitcoin. Sure I could have sold some at the top, but I didn't know it was the top. If you told me you did, you're full of shit. 
4	1522931602	1	You may rely on it
5	1522931948	0	I love you :) 
4	1522934309	1	I absolutely sold the top.  I also sold sold some when my stake more than doubled which was way before the top.  I also sold on the way back down and have hardly any bitcoin left.  When an investment you make has spectacular returns in a short timeframe it is smart to bring some back and not expect it to keep going up at that exponential rate.  You donâ€™t have to sell it all, just sell some.  It improves your cost basis and you can still ride the upside.  Likewise if something starts dumping but is still above your cost basis you can sell some.  Each time we had a large bounce I sold some.  If I had just held I would still be up but no where near what I pulled off with this simple strategy.  If you want to just be a hodler that is cool but there are definitely different strategies that can work out too.  Iâ€™m playing very safe from here.  I only grab a small stake if we seriously dump.  We hit 6100 Iâ€™m buying.  
5	1522935248	1	So you think 6100 is a great buy in ?  don't think its going sub-5k?
6	1522938126	1	We're not hitting 6100 apparently, those damn whales.......
7	1522939660	1	perhaps this is just a sideways bottom area.  Im blindly bearish so I'm not trusting anything.  
6	1522946326	1	I donâ€™t try to predict this, I just stick to my plan.  I buy a little when it dumps hard and sell some if it pumps hard.  I also hold a little bit, but just holding doesnâ€™t work for me and neither does going all in at any price.  Iâ€™d rather buy low and sell high.  Another way to think of it is balancing.  Bitcoin dumps a bunch it is probably irrationally low.  If it jumps a lot it is probably irrationally high.  Pretty simple.  No one can predict this.
7	1522947480	1	thats a good plan!
0	1522939165	1	How can cryptocurrencies fail from now on I really would like to see a possible scenario. It seems basically impossible to me
1	1522950264	1	Depends on your definition of fail. 
2	1522951969	1	I mean going to the trash can as a whole.
3	1522952933	1	If btc dropped and stayed around $1000-1010 a coin for 10 years, would you consider that failed? 
1	1522948318	1	Totally agree with you
1	1522949490	1	You cannot imagine a scenario where cryptos fail?
2	1522949574	1	no I can't. Web3 has certainly come.
0	1522947431	1	explains the bart patterns going on with btc, its all true!
0	1522948588	1	haha yes umm... any day now!
0	1522935561	0	Bitcoin will rise, just wait and see...
0	1522931257	-3	I think that investing in bitcoin rather good but theit transactions speed could be improved. Nowadays there are new blockchain technologies are coming up, they are more profitable, fast and easy to buy. For example EOS or CREDITS with much faster transactions speed and SC supporting.
1	1522935130	4	>  Nowadays there are new blockchain technologies are coming up,No.> they are more profitableProof that you don't know what you are talking about.> fast and easy to buyYea buying a token for a chain is easier than buying the thing you need to buy in order to be able to buy that token, logical.
1	1522935479	3	Is this a troll account?
1	1522934300	2	Have you heard of decentralization?
1	1522934345	2	Well, I am a newbie and I ve invested in BTC, CS and EOS. What do you think?
2	1522934627	2	What is CS?
3	1522952637	1	Counter Strike
