0	1522886820	8	This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://btcmanager.com/bitpesa-ceo-we-are-demonstrating-use-cases-for-bitcoin-everyday/) reduced by 89%. (I'm a bot)*****> Rossiello is at the heart of a growing bitcoin revolution in Africa called BitPesa.> BitPesa isn&#039;t just a bitcoin company; it also offers mobile money and cross-border payment solutions in a market that has traditionally found it difficult to transact with overseas businesses.> BitPesa isn&#039;t the only bitcoin company that is seriously tackling the African market as there are a handful of startups committed to providing bitcoin services for different sectors of the emerging market in Africa.*****[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/89uzvd/bitpesa_ceo_is_frustrated_about_medias_obsession/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ "Version 2.00, ~305858 tl;drs so far.") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr "PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.") | *Top* *keywords*: **Bitcoin**^#1 **market**^#2 **Africa**^#3 **remittance**^#4 **BitPesa**^#5
0	1522909741	4	I always had my doubts about LN but im starting to get more and more excited for it.
0	1522894219	5	Yes... blockchain is the industrial use-case, companies building private blockchains, bitcoin is seen more and more as something that's seperate from the 'industrial use-case' 
0	1522913507	3	Can confirm all males.Got to say I am super surprised there is not more adaption of bitcoin in Africa. The fluctuation of currency over there makes bitcoin look like a joke. Not to mention that phone money is already in common use.
1	1522915210	1	Check Zimbabwe out - they mass adopted it quickly last year.South Africans where the voices behind Luno adding Ethereum - despite Luno being in South East Asia and Europe.Edit : Bitpesa is a similar thing to Mpesa - most successful of the Phone Money gigs.
2	1522918039	2	Is there a reliable resource that summarises all these Bitcoin-related use-cases/developments/issues in Africa?
3	1522936270	2	I get my news from News.Bitcoin.com You could search the site for Africa related articles for a "best fit" solution.I myself am also looking for reliable and trustworthy BTC Africa news portal type thing.
4	1522943421	1	Why would you get any news from there? It's the fox news of crypto news sources. Unashamedly biased and pushing an agenda.
3	1522934965	1	I live in Africa, and I can assure you that these are mostly fantasies by people looking for use cases (beyond speculation) of bitcoin.   Such people know nothing of Africa and can't be bothered to learn.The first reality is that almost all African currencies are no less stable that currencies elsewhere, and all African currencies are certainly more stable that bitcoin.  You will sometimes read stories of the Zimbawean dollar; what most people don't know is that such a thing has not existed as a currency for almost 10 years: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollarThe second reality is that large-scale use of bitcoin in Africa is next to impossible, for a very simple reason: people cannot get their hands on it.   Most people do not have the disposable income to buy bitcoins, and mining it is even less of a practicality than in other places.   Third, there are very very very few places in Africa that will take bitcoin for anything.    Zero for practical purposes.Sure, there are people in Africa who are interested in bitcoin.   But it is mostly the same as elsewhere, i.e. as a speculative investment.
2	1522935810	1	> Check Zimbabwe out - they mass adopted it quickly last year.I live in Zimbabwe.   When and where did that happen?   Actually, a more basic question: how and where can a person get bitcoins in Zimbabwe, and where can they use it?
1	1522918970	1	>The fluctuation of currency over there makes bitcoin look like a joke.Does it? It seems that [one of the most volatile currencies in Africa is the Zambian Kwacha](https://www.fxcm.com/insights/top-10-most-volatile-currencies-of-2015/), and it shows a volatility of [0.68%](http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=ZMK&To=USD) in the last 90 days while BTC shows a volatility of [6.09%](http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=XBT&To=USD) for the same period. What African currency has a higher volatility than Bitcoin?
2	1522929949	2	Love how you arbitrarily chose 90 days. Specially the last 90. Why not compare over lifetime of the currency... or a higher sample disregarding outliers
3	1522932427	2	I didn't arbitrarily chose 90 days, I chose the data that I found most handy and seemed somewhat reasonable. You're free to quote a longer period that shows contradictory results?Edit: Checked a different source for past 52 weeks [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89uq8k/bitpesa_ceo_is_frustrated_about_medias_obsession/dwulfrd/)
3	1522937553	1	That sort of cherry-picking is already obvious to anyone who has known about bitcoin for more than 90 days and it is only going to look more obvious as time passes."Why does everyone who criticizes bitcoin start their data in December 2017 and everyone else uses a larger time frame?"I cringe to watch people grasp at straws like that, as if fudging numbers in a reddit post will stop people from using the most efficient way to send money internationally.
2	1522931248	1	Your link for most volatile currency is from 2015. The Kwacha isn't nearly as volatile as the South African Rand. [Here is the Rand (blue) vs Kwacha (black) for the last year.](https://imgur.com/gallery/qUnc7) [Here is BTC (black) vs Rand for that same period.](https://imgur.com/gallery/UwhNP)
3	1522936509	2	Fuck the Rand - I earn it and my buying power isnt stable in general. The political side of it could have been avoided if we just stopped the segregation in the 60's like everyone else. 
3	1522932693	1	The graphs don't lend themselves to being easily interpreted at all, because of the scaling difference. Do you have a quantitative result that accounts for a computed volatility or even just standard deviation? I'll take a look in a bit too, but I have to finish something quickly.Edit: According to [this source](https://uk.investing.com/tools/forex-volatility-calculator), over the past 52 weeks, BTC/USD displayed a volatility of 52.73% and ZAR/USD displayed a volatility of 1.39%.
1	1522937992	1	There should repeal the law forbidding women from benefiting from cryptocurrencies. It's a travesty.
0	1522906477	1	So this is a post about not talking about price. I think probably will get mod crushed no? Very confusing.
0	1522937813	1	Annoying that the article leads with "Look! A *female* CEO!" instead of their actual value proposition.> Elizabeth Rossiello founded BitPesa in 2013 in Nairobi, Kenya. Before then, she had previously worked at Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse.Yes, those poor underprivileged Goldman Sachs analysts need all the help they can get. Where can I donate to help feed starving African banking analysts?
