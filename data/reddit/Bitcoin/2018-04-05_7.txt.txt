0	1522916947	28	Sounds like theres a redemption arc incoming. Will he make it, or go back to his greedy way? Find out in the next episode Youve Got Goxxed.

1	1522923664	28	He's French
2	1522927019	-2	No, he's Jewish.

3	1522952417	1	Jewish is not an ethnicity you dweeb
3	1522927997	1	[Whatever you say  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ] (https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shrug-800x413.jpeg)
4	1522928384	-4	You felt the need to distinguish French from American, and I corrected you. It became unimportant when it turned out that it was a Jew this time too.
5	1522929157	8	Wierd discussion. You can be a french jew right so are you not both correct?
6	1522932133	8	Religion != Nationality, so no.That's like trying to store a string in a float.
7	1522932410	6	I dont get it? You cant be Isreali and french (except dual citizenship, but for argument sake), but you can be a french jew. Like I can be a scandinavian pagan.Do you think this is incorrect or are we talking past eachother?
8	1522936346	5	We're on the same page re: national citizenship.In the comments above though, one person is talking about citizenship and the other religious affiliation; or more properly the religious connotation of a surname, which is even more abstract. So I think *they* are talking past each other.
9	1522936949	3	Ye, that was my point. First guy says american, second guy corrects him by saying french and third guy say jewish not as an correction, but instead as an addition. Jewish isnt just religious though. Its like a wierd mix of heritage and religion, but that neither here nor there.
8	1522935892	1	It's actually more complicated because you can be a Jew (religious) and be a Jew (racially if your mother is Jewish) and those are both separate from being Israeli (commonly called Jews).
9	1522948595	1	But arent the two first types always "invited" to become Isreali? Meaning its not completely separate?
1	1522921039	6	Of course you say this and get upvoted while all the Americans are asleep.
1	1522928001	1	and rich
0	1522916069	8	Before 160k coins after 160k coins.
1	1522916928	7	650k
0	1522925756	4	he will find another 100000 bitcoins in a "lost" wallet next month!
0	1522928116	7	He got a tan, a nice haircut: He's a walking advertisement for Japanese prisons.
0	1522934854	2	/u/magicaltux I didn't see you comment on this picture during AMA... we are waiting. ;)
0	1522919483	4	It’s amazing what prison food can do.
0	1522931912	3	#Kaperles did nothing wrong!
1	1522941476	1	 FreeKarpeles
2	1522943599	1	Leave Karpeles Alone!
0	1522918226	7	The irony is the first image is before he had his shit pushed in. 
1	1522925074	-3	have a tea-splurting-thru-my-nose-over-my-keyboard upvote :)mental note: dont consume any liquids whilst reading reddit ...
2	1522931932	9	That's your reaction to a low-effort prison rape joke?
0	1522931702	4	Fuck this guy. Can we stop talking about him? That whole ama is a fucking joke. I can't believe it has 4.7k upvotes. I doenvited it the moment I read the title. Fuck him. He can rot in hell. 
1	1522935039	7	someone was goxxed hard
0	1522918791	2	\#HandsomeMark
0	1522916409	2	Is this even same guys? 
1	1522922278	6	Some good conspiracy theory material right there.
2	1522924120	6	They killed the real Mark and replaced him with a body double! and by they I mean the annunaki lizard men from planet nebiru! satan is coming back and the 2nd coming of our lord and savior jesus christ will defeat him he will save those who repent!- oh shit, this started sounding too authentic, there might be a religious fanatic hiding inside me, someone help me get it out, the government has put radio tracking chips in my dog so they can monitor my conversations and watch me masturbate. 
0	1522931350	1	Probably because that Bitcoin Cafe where he worked closed down 
0	1522933690	1	Mark now kinda looks like keanu Reeves to me. Anybody feel me?
0	1522934567	1	I DONT WANT THIS MONEY.  OH NOESSSSSS
1	1522943625	1	Give it to me 
0	1522937160	1	Havent seen a transformation like that since Neville
0	1522939080	1	Does Mark have a lady now? 
0	1522941184	1	Everyone looks nicer when being a billionaire
0	1522943687	1	The douche didn't answer my question in an "Ask Me Anything" post >[How did you lose so much weight? What was your routine in prison?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89o16y/im_mark_karpel%C3%A8s_exceo_of_bankrupt_mtgox_ask_me/dwsmpv8/?context=3)And some neckbeard even had the gall to downvote me. People, it's ask me **anything**
1	1522947581	1	he answered someone else who asked the same question, he said lost 35kg, mostly because of crappy food and small quantities. 
0	1522949880	1	I cannot answer that due to legal. I cannot answer that because I'm nowhere to be found. I cannot answer that because I'm in jail. I cannot answer that because I was trying to fix things. I cannot answer that because if I told the truth that'd be the end.He wants "back in to the community" because he's sitting on a big pile of bitcoin that was basically stolen and people got fucked. The same exact exit scam that miners pulled with "refunding you original value later."And reddit / social are the perfect places to foment false support like that dogshit AMA full of shills and nocoiners, anonymous accounts + "praise" = hey guis i'm back!The chat transcripts and bullshit prove that there was basic scam delay tactic[lol at cleartext passwords on Magic The Gathering Online Exchange](https://imgur.com/xMeW43a)
