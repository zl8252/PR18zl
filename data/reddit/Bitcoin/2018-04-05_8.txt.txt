3	1522949954	1	No worries. Iâ€™m just a noob getting a feel for the space. 
2	1522952832	1	The main problem I had was I opened my first lightning channel to the ACINQ node (because there's a button there that makes it very easy) and kept getting errors when I tried to make payments. I didn't look too much into the cause of the errors (and didn't save the error msgs) but I think the problem was lots of people using Eclair are connecting to that node and sending money but can't receive it which is causing the channels to be exhausted. For now, I would recommend opening a channel to [one of these nodes](http://lightningnetworkstores.com/) since they're all probably pretty liquid. This won't be an issue in a few weeks once the network grows more. Aside from that, I thought everything else was slick.

1	1522942347	1	It isn't going to have such a direct effect. If anything it could drive the price down by making bitcoin easier to spend again. At least it should mean that if the bull market does start to kick back in, there should be less flowing into altcoins falsely claiming to fix scalability.
2	1522942683	1	One of the negative effects of the bitcoin tech was the fact that it could not support the load back in december and the fees climbed up to 100$/trans. At least we won't be having that sort of a congestion for some time.

0	1522952139	1	Node.acinq.co is the node we have to use? What is the min funding?
0	1522945426	1	What about an.. iOS version? >:)
