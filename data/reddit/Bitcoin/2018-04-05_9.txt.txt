Submission title: I used to check the bitcoin price every day...but now I check the lightning network nodes every day...it feels a lot healthier and I feel more confident in my never sell position. Plus, the LN is always growing.

1	1522890511	3	Last bear market in 2014 I checked every day. Good news dropping the price 10% over and over was agony. This bear market I donâ€™t give a fuck. [Mr. Bean on a roller coaster.](https://giphy.com/gifs/rvhps5a80Ov4s) Wake me up at $25,000. 
2	1522893532	1	been in this since 2014?  Impressive.
3	1522906545	1	Me too.
4	1522931051	1	wow - if you don't mind me asking-  were you selling at the top or have never sold?
3	1522926319	1	iam here since 2013 and some are even earlier. this tech is a marathon and you are still early when you join today.
4	1522930910	1	were you selling some at the top?
1	1522910061	1	I have the opposite habit. When the price is very high, I usually ignore it because it's "good" anyway.When the price is low, I go in buying mode and put orders under the current price and I check a few times a day to see if my orders executed yet :) 
2	1522920437	1	Yes, that is the non-standard cycle! 
0	1522905794	2	Umm if the price is low, that means you should be checking it more, as it means you can now enter the market and get more out of your fiat conversions. If you only check prices during bull runs, it indicates you're buying at the top instead of at the bottom, I don't recommend this strategy for anybody.You need to train your mind into looking at the benefits of the bear market instead of being upset by it. Everyone should try embracing it as a short term buying opportunity. 
0	1522865660	6	Moving the goalposts.Classic sign that you shoulda sold.
1	1522865759	13	No way. When I got in I didn't get in based on FOMO or "get rich quick" nonsense the idiots a few months ago did. I got into it because I fell in love with the tech, and decided I will never move my holdings back to fiat. What's a bitcoin worth? A bitcoin is worth a bitcoin. 
2	1522865933	3	A bitcoin is also now worth less than 1/2 of what it was worth a few months ago. If you like the tech you should go work for a company that is utilizing blockchain.
3	1522867961	5	This, if you are in for the tech go help tech, whats the point of investing lol.
4	1522871125	3	It's actually completely normal for early adopters to be in it for altruistic reasons. Not unique to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.
5	1522889492	2	It's hard not to be "altruistic" when you already go your FU money out of your early investment (unless you're a DB).
6	1522928593	1	It's not a phenomenon limited to the wealthy. As a kid I refused to run Windows on my computers and would only run Linux operating systems. Because I wanted to be an "early adopter", I loved the tech and knew it was better, and I thought it could make the world a much better place. I still only run Linux (waiting for the world to catch up). Wealth and returns have nothing to do with it sometimes.
4	1522878195	-2	Investing = leveraged theft.Some people are just klepto's.
3	1522887994	0	Could you be more cunty? Every enthusiast has to be professional to live up to your expectations? Gfy. 
4	1522889287	5	> A bitcoin is worth a bitcoin.Is a stupid meme that needs to stop being spread. Just gotta call it out whenever I see it. Don't have to be a professional but I hate seeing people spread bullshit in an attempt to convince themselves and others that bitcoin can't be a bad gamble because "you can't lose unless you sell"
5	1522906705	0	I get it. I've been here since 2014... Yeah, this corrections sucks. But, I didn't lose then because I didn't sell.  
6	1522925295	1	Opportunity cost. You lost because you could've sold and bought back like double the crypto.
7	1522929882	1	Or you could have sold and bought back half of what you have. If you are not a trader you are a gambler, and gamblers lose
4	1522928748	1	>Could you be more cunty?... also you>Gfy
2	1522910735	1	If you love the tech why are you hoarding them instead of using them for transactions?
3	1522915796	2	Just because you like porn doesnt mean you always pay for it.
4	1522930486	1	Ever*
3	1522928509	1	 Are you illiterate? 
2	1522877629	2	Enough with the liars ...Same as you wanting a girl, she says no ...    then you say you only wanted to be friends anyway because you appreciate her too much.You wanted to get rich and found out you will not .   Now you have to justifiy it somehow 
3	1522879636	10	You're having a bad day aren't you? lol
4	1522882679	-7	Not really . .Have my girl and my profits from selling at  $19000....Just hate seeing denial over and over here 
5	1522888246	12	You didn't sell shit you poor nocoiner troll. 
6	1522892882	4	lol so true 
5	1522892948	7	the wonderful thing about this reddit thing is that I can click your little blue name and see that [you "supposedly" sold at $10,000](https://www.reddit.com/user/maerim264/comments/887g60/i_sold_at_10000/) (which you posted to your own profile - not this sub - or anywhere else). There's more to life than[ being negative in the entirety of your reddit account's short life](https://www.reddit.com/user/maerim264/comments/)And even if you're paid to do this and "dont care lol", you know it doesnt feel good...  Like deep down...  
6	1522921617	1	Sold at $10,000 too  Feeling great Triggered? 
5	1522887830	2	You can't stand the fact some people hate fiat can you
3	1522889842	1	And what makes you qualified to analyze his motives with such little information? Ask.. don't accuse.
1	1522881033	4	Spending everyday on a subreddit of a technology you don't understand.Classic sign that you don't have anything to do in your live. You shoulda find some hobbies.
2	1522881355	1	Sorry for your losses.
3	1522881688	3	I bought years ago, I'm quite happy where I am. Sorry for your life.
4	1522881987	1	Born years ago, been having a great ride :)
5	1522882172	5	If what you are doing is a great ride, sorry for your loss.
0	1522912016	1	Never sell? You plan to live forever? When are you going to enjoy the money? I'm more interested in your secret to immortality than your investment strategy... 
1	1522930007	2	Most people here are in their 20-30s it makes sense to hold for at least a 5-10 years
1	1522915537	1	I buy and use it when i get the chance somewhere. I actively seek out businesses accepting bitcoin when travelling, its a fun side adventure almost :)  But i'm holding, not cashing out but instead using it. Hopefully some day ill buy bigger items... 
0	1522926172	1	I am having a rough time looking at the price decline for 3+ months.
1	1522942412	1	Then you've got the wrong mindset. Dive into the tech help and learn while you accumulate and you'll realize selling is not a good idea regardless of price.

0	1522899456	1	Always growing?? *facepalm*The only that keeps growing in this universe is entropy and human stupidity!
1	1522932688	1	The universe itself keeps growing too!
0	1522897042	1	I call BS on this statement 
0	1522903415	1	Got in for the money. Stayed for the tech. No right or wrong way to do this OP, everyone finds their own path. 
0	1522870414	0	Lol. Nice year in your username however.
