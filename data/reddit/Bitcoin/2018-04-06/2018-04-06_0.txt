0	1523022033	85	A hodler has been spotted in the wild
0	1523019293	33	YUS!!!!!  I was thinking of using it again to work on my Spanish.  Very solid app actually.. time to try again lol! 
1	1523024687	1	If you like duolingo, seriously consider trying Lingvist for Spanish. Personally I feel like it’s more useful 
2	1523025248	1	I use both. I think Duolingo is more fun, but lingvist is more learny.
3	1523025613	1	*learny*
4	1523029626	1	You get an up vote observant fellow.
2	1523034701	1	How is Lingvist different? 
0	1523024308	1	Respect for trying to learn another language. !ban 2
1	1523029796	1	Ευχάριστο :)
2	1523030047	1	*Ευχαριστώ thumbs up for the effort its a really difficult language
3	1523030133	1	Ναι φυσιολογική ειναι δύσκολη αλλά νομίζω ότι αυτό είναι ενδιαφέρον. 
4	1523034824	1	"Ναι, φυσικά είναι δύσκολη". Proper gender for adverbs is the neutral gender, and "φυσικά" is a better equivalent for "naturally" or "of course", as "φυσιολογικός" is used in the more formal or biological sense, as in "normal, not different than the accepted norm". Congrats again on learning Greek, I don't think I could do it as an adult if I hadn't done it as a kid and spent literally a decade on it.
5	1523035314	1	Ευχάριστω!  
6	1523038630	1	*Ευχαριστώ the tone is on the omega 
4	1523034914	1	So you use the female endings for  φυσιολογική   and  δύσκολη  , but use masculine in  αυτό  , so it's unclear whether your inferred object is the masculine act of learning the language, or the feminine concept of the Greek language.Maybe change αυτό  to feminine is after  ενδιαφέρον add in "glosa", for language \(but literally tongue\), might be the "best" way to say it
5	1523035298	1	Ευχάριστω! 
2	1523030098	1	not that what you wrote is wrong, it means *pleasant* but i guess you wanted to say *thank you*
3	1523031962	1	It means thank you, lol
4	1523034086	1	let me know better
2	1523036656	1	Ευχάριστο  = Pleasant(for neutral gender things)Ευχαριστώ = Thank you
3	1523037488	1	Ευχάριστω
4	1523038052	1	You put the accent on the wrong letter. The accent goes over ω. And the accent defines which syllable is stressed(more pronounced).
0	1523033799	1	χοντλ μαλακες
1	1523034886	1	Κλαίω
1	1523035153	1	roflmao

0	1523025080	1	Which language is it ? I recognize some Greek letters but it looks more like Georgian or something.
1	1523025686	1	It is greek
2	1523025728	1	Epharistos
3	1523037017	1	Efharisto ευχαριστώ Παρακαλώ 
0	1523029455	1	It says "Bitcoin is an international currency." The language is Greek and so am I. EDIT: Was so excited to be able to answer, I didn't see the translation. Όλα καλά...
1	1523029872	1	Δεν είναι πρόβλημα... να σαι καλά φίλο μου :)
2	1523030374	1	Perfect... thank you... only φίλε or φίλη μου... in this case the latter. Gender specific for female friend. 
2	1523035074	1	 φίλο  or  φίλοs, is the third person masculine, the 2nd person \(you talking TO the subject\), is as the person said below,  φίλε.
3	1523035421	1	Ευχάριστω
4	1523037083	1	Παρακαλώ 
0	1523027636	1	I see a developer bought some currencies.
1	1523033352	1	It's the users that collab and create the courses afaik. Probably not a dev in this case.Pretty good idea it seems. A site where all the content is made by the users and you just provide the platform.
0	1523028061	1	Everybody can do his or her part
0	1523028563	1	I already loved Duolingo (Taught me German) but after this I'm ready to get a little green owl tatoo. 
0	1523028838	1	I love duolingo. 
1	1523029921	1	Similar to btc in a fundamental way 
0	1523022429	3	Waiting to see this in spanish and hebrew courses!

1	1523034324	1	diethnes
0	1523032567	1	Andreas is that you?
0	1523022423	7	Duolingo is just a crowdsourced translator. That's likely from a news article or something, not a Duolingo employee
1	1523027533	1	That's not true at all. There *used* to be something like that, called language immersion, which isn't in the image, but they culled it because of legal issues, or so people believe.
2	1523030832	1	Thanks for the correction, just saw it here:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duolingo#Business_modelSays the space was too competitive
3	1523030835	1	Non-Mobile link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duolingo#Business_model***^HelperBot ^v1.1 ^/r/HelperBot_ ^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^Please ^message ^/u/swim1929 ^with ^any ^feedback ^and/or ^hate. ^Counter: ^168518
0	1523027959	1	That’s awesome. I love me some duolingo
0	1523030941	1	Greek 
0	1523033579	1	Why in Greek? The pun was intended?
0	1523035445	1	I'll repeat this mantra daily until our dark days are over. I am getting uncomfortable seeing Bitcoin at these levels but as long as we're over 5800 we should be alright.
0	1523035531	1	;)
0	1523035610	1	Feeling bullish.
0	1523037451	1	I don’t get what this post is trying to say, is it supposed to be funny and I missed the joke? 
0	1523019840	-7	That is crashing
0	1523030994	1	Crypto going global
1	1523035288	1	No, it will never become a thing. 
2	1523035386	1	Can you just delete your account pls? Thank you.
3	1523035448	1	Why does the truth hurt?
