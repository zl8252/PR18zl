0	1522967950	47	Save those FUD posts from 2017-2018 guys... It will be a fun read soon.
1	1522972364	7	Yeah, sooner than people think and a lot more fun.  
2	1523006178	5	Yeaaaa, no.
1	1522997648	4	to the mooon ... NOPE !
0	1522976431	8	That Kevin Short guy was always bearish for some reason...
1	1522993392	5	Because he was always `Shorting` bitcoin
0	1522998992	12	There is hardly any relevance of what happened in 2014 to 2018, the market landscape and the reasons for the collapse are different. Basing your mood on some events in the past may be convenient but is a self deception.Instead, be frank with yourself and admit the risks involved. Don't be afraid of risks. Denial of them will only increase their impact on you and your investment.
0	1522998414	14	My only issue with referring to the 2014 crash is the fact it wasn't "Mainstream" at the time. This isn't just a crash of price but a crash global trust for it. I'll still HODL and buy more because I have faith in Crypto. But to say we're fine because we've been thru this before is inaccurate in my opinion.
1	1522999228	5	It looked pretty much the same in 2014, it was a bit more difficult to buy so less people did it. And the people who heard about it in 2014 might have bought now. It was the same, at a smaller scale. This time many people talked about bitcoin, but still very few actually owned any.
1	1523000471	3	It isn't mainstream.... yet 2024 maybe..
2	1523000756	1	I ment Social media mainstream, where everyone that knew nothing about it was buying it up. It was all over the news, Facebook, in 2014 most people I talked to never heard of crypto currency, now my Cab driver and barber brought it up to me.
3	1523006913	3	I know very few people who are into bitcoin...  most have no idea what it is... It is like the Internet in the early 90's..  people are avoiding it because they believe it is dangerous... just like opensource..
4	1523015084	2	same here. western Europe... most people heard of it but are afraid  
1	1523019430	1	It was the exact same scenario in 2014 as 2018.  It was being talked about by random people who weren't nerds, mania happened, a crash happened, and it was a bear market for like a year.  Same thing that's happening now.
1	1523028554	1	Bitcoin is doing better than ever tech wise. What evidence supports any other narrative than "things will be fine"? 
1	1523030689	1	Global trust? What trust exactly are you talking about? 
1	1523003870	0	[deleted]
2	1523004459	1	Haha really? Fixed it.

0	1523019306	2	wow amazing, and when we bottom out soon, lets take a pic of that because one day paying 6k for a Bitcoin will seem like a dream
0	1522995465	2	2025, the price of bitcoin lost 5% to trade at $25,543 after Google said it was about to launch its own blockchain project...
1	1522996022	3	You mean 255,543 right?
1	1522996672	2	Two more halvenings?  Uhh, yeah, it'll be waaaayyy more than $25k.
2	1522997870	1	And Googles not waiting that long to launch a blockchain project. 
3	1523036161	1	Google is welcome to compete if they can.  The field is wide and diverse.
0	1522990110	1	Sweet, well lucky for you there is an article about it dropping to $50 dollars from the past. This way no matter what, you can suppress your feelings of anxiety about spending real money to buy real 0's and 1'sCrypto has become a joke. Garlicoin, bunnycoin, bitconnect, Jesus, Money is supposed to be simple, trading my money from Canadian to USD is a big enough pain in the ass. This crypto is a fad. 
1	1522999308	1	Crypto isn't for everyone yet. In a few years even the technically illiterate will be able to do it with a swipe on their phone. You are welcome back then.
0	1522993297	1	Sweet 2014s))
0	1523011770	1	Is this supposed to be a FOMO post?
0	1523013212	1	This is dated June 2014. The ATH was Dec 2013. We are exceeding the pace of the last drop by circa 2 fold. Hopefully the best market will also be twice as short (forgive the pun). 
0	1523016383	1	The risks vary from time periods.  It maybe convenient for you to feel good about it but it doesn't apply to the present circumstances.  
0	1523028466	1	It's a bad time for all market.
0	1523006234	1	Umm its completely irrelevant. Stupid people always thing what happened in the past will happen again but it probably won't. There was a reason for that crash, now we are crashing because it was a bubble and people totally lost interest.
0	1522960369	-4	Never mind lol
0	1522960342	-4	You mean 2017?
1	1522963651	11	it was updated 2017. original publication was 2014
2	1522963702	1	Yeah, that‚Äôs why I said nevermind..
3	1522968865	6	But you replied to OP instead of to yourself so no one saw the connection.You also could have just plain edited or deleted your post instead. 
4	1522976395	7	Hey I‚Äôm still new here, thanks for the tip! üëçüèº
