0	1522987448	21	Personally I prefer my "bitcoin not blockchain" line from the interview, but this is not too far off. :D
1	1522994359	2	You took bitcoin out of your pitch deck ROFL!
0	1522974550	25	LN has me thinking about how it's often a good idea to divide money into two pools:- **savings** Hard to use and keys kept offline. Think retirement or vacation fund.- **spending** Easy to use and keys kept online. Think walking-around money.This way, a compromise of the spending pool doesn't compromise the savings pool.Having used the early Lightning wallets a little bit, they seem positioned as a good method for managing walking-around money:- instant confirmation, useful in brick+mortar POS systems and online alike;- no need to monitor the block chain if just spending;- can be used to pay for metered services;- can be used for micropayments;- account model is a natural fit for LN wallets, unlike the UTXO model that causes so much confusion among new users who will likely start out with walking-around money only;- fees will likely be based on the amount of money sent, not the far more abstract notion of transaction size/weight.The transition probably won't be easy or quick. The on-chain mobile wallets developed over the last 5 years will pretty much be useless under LN. It's not the kind of thing that will lend itself to being bolted on.But I do expect to see a burst of innovation around LN walking-around wallets. It's not unreasonable to think that this could lead to a resurgence of interest by merchants in Bitcoin as a form of payment - especially for smaller payments and metered services.
1	1522999553	5	I think its important that you brought up point #1, actual instant confirmation with 0 trust involved.LN will go a long way to solve scaling, but with instant, trustless confirmations we opened up huge new opportunities and actually made bitcoin useable for every trasaction
1	1522984950	2	Yes.Once you batch everything down to exactly-paid transactions, Bitcoin is $0.01 Per $5,000 cost. If $20,000 it costs $0.04 to send.Once you Lightning Batch, you can double batch, for infinity scalable transactions, maybe. 100 Transactions per BTC Movement at 0.01 Each.The key here However Is sustaining a Cost above $15,000.
1	1523002305	1	*‘account model is a natural fit for LN wallets, unlike the UTXO model that causes so much confusion among new users who will likely start out with walking-around money only’*This point is interesting. Are you able to make further commentary on your thoughts around this ? I had not considered the change here. Even though it is a key feature of LN. 
0	1522982754	3	It about time for more website to have share links to Minds, Gab, Steemit etc. I am surprised that forward thinking people still only have links to twitter and all the corporate crap that comes with it. Social sites that are actually using crypto rather than facebook that just takes your data and sells it. Just sayin.
0	1522969141	22	In truth, Lightning makes all other alt-coins useless
1	1522971002	13	I actually disagree. With Lightning you'll eventually be able to do cross-chain payments. Holding one crypto but paying someone accepting any other crypto that supports Lightning? That will be awesome for all cryptos.
2	1522972060	10	Sure, but how does being able to swap to another coin, give that coin value, when alternatively, you can just use Bitcoin?  I'm not even arguing that there won't be room for others, I just don't see why cross-chain payment would automatically make those other coins useful.
3	1522986159	3	If you want more anonymity, you'd swap to use Monero or Zcash. If want to train AI models without ever letting a third party sell your information/breach privacy because you own your own info, you might swap to use Open Mined. The whole ecosystem may work together to provide utility when you anchor it to Bitcoin.
4	1523024365	1	> If you want more anonymityI can use the [onion routing](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md) that's part of the lightning spec.> If want to train AI modelsWhy would we want to do that?
5	1523031517	1	Onion routing is a great feature, don't get me wrong, but it could be compromised. There may be use cases which require different anonymity models, like zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, in Zcash), or Ring Signatures in Monero. > Why would we want to do that?In home automation, I would like to my house to do certain things that cater to my own sleep cycle and work habits and such. I would like to train an algorithm that optimises how my family uses things. I will not trust a third party to have that information, because it could lead to breach of privacy and selling of my information. 
3	1522984220	4	I think that it has value, some random guy maybe support xcoin in his store and only accepts xcoin, you are not going to enter his store and call him a shitcoiner. This would allow a world were even if people disagree you can still use your bitcoins.
2	1522972800	8	Can you articulate a significant use case where an altcoin would provide more utility or advantage than a token built upon lightning and bitcoin?
3	1522998493	3	To me this is where an establishment wants you to use their coin for reasons of monitoring or further data collection etc. This could be places like Casinos, Disneyland, Theme Parks, shopping centres or in game credits, Esports, Xbox to name a few ideas. Extend this to airmiles rewards or discount vouchers and so on. Not saying here that these are better than bitcoin but where a business may chose to use an Alt for their own interests (they would still accept bitcoin for these alts). One would assume an instant cross chain swap is available. Note: It seems to be we are moving into a time where we can classify store of value coins, platform coins to that of utility tokens. This is s good read: https://hackernoon.com/the-different-categories-of-cryptocurrencies-a57ba4d77c9a
4	1522999694	1	This was great ideas. If I ran a business though I'd build ontop of bitcoin to take advantage of its security model and still have the same utility. But there might be a reason not to want to do that, interesting times ahead.
4	1523003243	1	Thanks for your comment. I didn't think of that until you point it out.
4	1523003428	1	I'm not sure what the advantage would be of not simply using centralised tokens for this? 
5	1523005175	1	I agree. I don’t think on principle this is ‘better’ than bitcoin but can see how this may come about. In a sense many ERC20 tokens are centralised, just held in a decentralised platform. 
4	1523018311	1	Okay, fair enough.  That might be a valid but limited use case
3	1522991625	2	namecoin? privacy coins like monero and dash? Just two I could suggest
4	1523024443	1	Namecoin never solved its squatter problem, that's why it never caught on.[Onion routing](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md) is already part of the lightning protocol.
3	1522999599	1	Cold storage of small amounts of money, under the value where it would be worth storing in bitcoin. A lower value chain, such as litecoin, would be useful for this. 
3	1522974657	1	How about utility cryptosystems, where the tokens are rewarded to resource contributors by resource consumers (like in filecoin).Lightning network will allow people to gain access and use  these systems by paying with Bitcoin (avoiding exchanges to buy filecoins) and also allow people to cash out of them easily too.
4	1522975074	3	Those tokens can exist more securely ontop of the Bitcoin blockchain
5	1522976685	1	Or how about multiple store of value alternatives to BTC that uses a variety of different algorithms.It would allow people to hedge their bets against BTC in case a serious vulnerability is discovered in the underlying algorithms; and make the cryptomarkets more robust.
6	1522981556	1	The market for a store of value, which is all a currency really is, is market that favors a natural monopoly.  The nature of money is such that if you have two currencies competing in a free market, one will grow at the expense of the other(s) until there is only one.I do not see how other currencies can exist in equilibrium with Bitcoin.
7	1522981777	3	I just explained the use case for other store of value currencies... as a hedge against the Bitcoin algorithms being found insecure, and to make an individuals portfolio more robust.Lightning Network allows transactions between different coins so that counters the mechanisms that would promote a natural monopoly.
3	1522986282	-2	maybe IoT machines that uses IOTA as a currency to mantain themselves and negotiate with other machines, could be rented or bought with money from btc to iota, keeping the economies separated. Human to machine, and machine to machine.
4	1523001856	2	BTC and Lightning are both capable to do machine to machine payments. the problem for this kind of stuff is not the payment but the AI requiered for those machines to execute payments that makes any sense. However there are a bunch of altcoins that have different pros and cons and it would be nice to switch between them. i think there will only be like 10 coins with a significant market cap in the future
5	1523013592	1	any digital currency can work for that purpose, but the idea behind it is to have separate economies for these purposes.
2	1522971674	-1	This. As dominant as Bitcoin may become there will **always** be a use for altcoins. They are the R&D that brought bitcoin to be in the first place. A breeding ground of idea.Bitcoin will probably consume the best of these ideas as they mature, until we have BORGCOIN, and then?
3	1522976404	8	Bitcoin by all accounts brought altcoins to be in the first place by definition.
3	1522978487	3	>They are the R&D that brought bitcoin to be in the first place. A breeding ground of idea.Wow, this is all sorts of wrong. Do you have any examples of altcoin tech that has made it to Bitcoin?
4	1522982961	5	Segwit?Was tested on the litecoin network.Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency in existence though, so their actual statement is false.
5	1523008548	5	Segwit was coded mainly by Lawrence Nahum of blockstream. It's a bitcoin core project. The reason it was activated on litecoin first was because of the MASF issues. The miners kept blocking activation and there was a narrative going around that funds could be stolen from SegWit addresses. So regardless of flawless testnet operation it was still being blocked by some big miners. Charlie lee approached the bitcoin core devs and suggested getting it activated on litecoin which happened. Then he set up SegWit address with the equivalent of $1 Million USD worth of litecoin in it for anyone to hack the funds out of. In the end, no one claimed the bounty and all this didn't work and the UASF had to be activated to get SegWit on main net. The testing was already done. Litecoin just has the privilege of having centralized governance.
6	1523024958	1	I know that, but there's a definite advantage to actually testing on a main net.Bitcoin isn't centralized, so public and easy to understand proof that an upgrade is secure is important for consensus.
5	1523022698	1	Like everything else in litecoin, it wasn't created for litecoin. We were talking about real "R&D" tech innovations. People mistakenly think these altcoins are hubs of innovation and it's just plain false./u/jakesonwu explained the Litecoin situation excellently already so I'm not going to repeat the whole thing.
3	1523007484	0	>They are the R&D that brought bitcoin to be in the first place. A breeding ground of idea.You have got to be kidding me with this. I keep hearing about this superior alt coin tech. Can't wait to actually see it. When you look at alt coins all you see is either ridiculous ideas that were laughed out of the room, old BIPs, copy paste jobs or code that is based on research performed by blockstream but because altcoins are centralized and don't give a shit about testing they slap dash it in first. Monero has the right idea but that's about it. You will find traces of bitcoin development in just about every single alt coin even the very small amount of non bitcoin codebased ones but please tell me, when was the last time bitcoin devs borrowed code from an alt coin ?
4	1523011712	1	It's the primordial-soup concept and early-testing functions of the altcoin space that allow ideas to develop and test before they're integrated into Bitcoin.I was saying Bitcoin may as well be the original altcoin - Bitcoin developed as an alternative currency to fiat, gold, etc.Didn't Litecoin deploy Lightning Network first? It was developed for BTC, sure, but it was deployed elsewhere in a space that was more forgiving first. In this way we can also see altcoins help protect the stability and security of Bitcoin.
5	1523013506	1	https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8a3piv/lightning_labs_ceo_elizabeth_stark_shifting_the/dwwl1qx/
6	1523014192	1	Yes, even if altcoins are only for political disagreement - they are still useful to us.
2	1522997439	0	I look forward to swaps as well. We will one day see a world where merchants who accept Bitcoin will be able to be paid in Litecoin, miners of ASIC resistant coins like Vertcoin could swap it easily for BTC, Monero users will no longer have to get them in exchanges and swap via LTC directly for Monero if they want privacy, others who own Decred, Particle(?) Komodo, Ethereum and even Stellar Lumens if they use Lightning will also be able to join the party.  Eventually all the major cryptos will coexist like merchants accepting different credit cards at the moment. Question is, will the communities of each crypto be able to embrace and help each other, or will it be more like "I only want my crypto to succeed and the rest can burn and disappear"?
3	1523020282	1	Well keep in mind there are some limitations. In order to support Lightning, a crypto must:* Use the UTXO model (or be able to emulate it via smart subtract perhaps)* Use a scripting language supporting HTLCs* Have non-malleable transaction hashes* Support multisig accountsThere may be a few others I'm missing, I know there's a post detailing the requirements somewhere but I can't find it. Basically it has to look a lot like Bitcoin.
3	1523015426	0	If you believe in altcoins you believe in inflation.
1	1522984272	2	Arguably they already are superfluous. 
1	1522996916	0	Bitcoin and Monero are all you need. 
2	1523004287	-2	both can't scale though  Don't buy into the LN bullshit.  Merchants are not going to use anything that takes a week to close a channel just so they can get payed.  Elizabeth Stark is the [Elizabeth Holmes] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes) of blockchain. 
3	1523004293	0	**Elizabeth Holmes**Elizabeth Anne Holmes (; born February 3, 1984) is the founder, Chairman, and CEO of Theranos, a privately held company known for its false claims to have devised revolutionary blood tests that used very small amounts of blood. In 2015, Forbes named Holmes as the youngest self-made female billionaire in the world due to a $9 billion valuation of Theranos. The next year Forbes revised her net value to zero dollars, given an updated $800 million valuation of Theranos and the fact that many of Theranos' investors hold preferred shares and so would be paid before Holmes (who holds common stock) in a liquidation event.In 2016, after a series of journalistic and regulatory investigations that questioned the veracity of Holmes' claims, federal prosecutors began criminal investigations for potentially misleading investors and the government about Theranos' blood-testing technology.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
0	1522967144	15	I used lightning to buy some stuff yesterday. It is amazing to transact without a third party instantly. It's just mind blowing... I can't stop thinking about it. 
1	1522973704	7	Tied to pay with eclair at yalls and blockstream store. Both failed :( 
2	1522974689	2	Did you open the channel directly with them? had same problem using acinq node (#recksplorer donation worked fine though..) worked fine after opening another channel with blockstream store "02f6725f9c1c40333b67faea92fd211c183050f28df32cac3f9d69685fe9665432@104.198.32.198:9735" url here: http://lightningnetworkstores.com/
2	1523003615	-2	The network is pretty young, a lot of the nodes are not sufficiently connected or the channels aren't well funded. So sometimes it fails to find a route to reach your final destination.  I did 3 transactions so far.  1. A channel connected to a random node. Tried to pay at bitrefill ,failed. Seemed it couldn't find a route.   2. A channel directly connected to bitrefill. Bought a 10 Euro steam voucher. Instant success.   3. I used the same bitrefill channel to pay for bitcoinshirt LN test. Automatically did its routing, took 30 seconds to succeed.
1	1522967310	3	Isn’t the lightning network itself almost like a third party?
2	1522968481	12	Nope.
2	1522968428	8	It has nodes like the main chain. Crucially you don't have to trust them as you always control your coins.
2	1522982459	5	it's a simple question. why the downvotes?
2	1522982692	2	You interact with third parties by routing on the LN, but you don't need to trust any of them with your money or even your information.It's like saying that you're using a third party to drive to work because other drivers are stopping at stop lights for you.
3	1522982842	0	Nice analogy. Thx!
2	1522968507	1	If the lightning network is a third party, than p2p networks would have to be considered a third party. In other words, no, it'd be a real bastardization of the phrase in order to stretch it's meaning to include ln.
2	1522968200	0	It's open source. There's no party that can stop you from participating or change the rules for 1 person. It's like saying that Bitcoin is a third party because Satoshi developed it. 
0	1523012150	0	Question: Is Elizabeth Stark a technical person? Can she code?
0	1522998584	-1	That's great - Elizabeth Stark Today bitcoin price is 6,577.18 USD, its good for a move now.
0	1522996131	-2	'bitcoin not blockchain', because lightning network is not a blockchain.  its not bitcoin either, lol
0	1522973155	-18	What if I were to tell you that neither bitcoins nor blockchains will ever amount to anything and you're wasting your money?
1	1522974253	18	I would tell you you are posting in the wrong sub
1	1522977088	15	I would reply that we've been hearing this since 2009.
1	1522976219	5	I would tell you that you wouldnt be able to tell innovation if it kicked you in the face.
1	1522978236	6	They've already amounted to something, so your argument fails from the outset.Arguing that they will eventually become worthless is better, but that can be said for pretty much everything. Unless you're willing to commit to a specific time frame, such predictions are worthless.
1	1522982323	5	there is nothing right now that supports this claim
