1	1522997234	23	No, I prefer the memes over these crazy threads where everyone displays how little they know about even basic economic principles.I don't like the Fed either but a first year intro to economics class can debunk most of the bullshit in this thread.
2	1523028206	1	Here's a simple example that will help you wrap your head around it, even without an economics degree. Imagine we're playing a game of monopoly, and I decide I'm going to fire up my printer and just start printing new monopoly money for myself. I then start buying up all the assets on the board and outbidding everyone for houses and hotels, thereby raising the prices of everything so you have no possibility of winning. Would you say that's a fair game? Would you mention anything if someone did that in a game of monopoly, or would you just keep your mouth shut and continue playing? My hunch is that virtually everyone would get angry and make the person with the printer stop, or just quit the game all together. It's surprising then that those very same people stay quiet when the exact same mechanism for cheating is applied to the real world, and they'll happily continue along and devote decades of their lives working for paper money all while the printers are still rolling.

The actual problem with the world - for normal, working people - is the lack of inflation combined with the lack (or destruction) of organised labor. This notion that inflation robs the people is, sadly, arse-about-face. Inflation forces wealth hoarders to spend money into the economy and also allows normal people to borrow to buy an asset (house) with less likelihood that they will be heavily encumbered by that asset forever. Of course the trick the baby-boomers pulled was to inflate their way into asset ownership and only then, kill inflation and limit asset production. The bastards!
4	1523037638	1	I'm gonna call bullshit. They don't spend all that inflated money. It gets invested into their friends' corporations, stocks, and bonds. Rich people don't hoard money, because they KNOW that fiat is worthless. Meanwhile, US working stiffs get fucked over by rising prices and stangnant wages along with increased tax burdens.
3	1523028580	1	you have no clue what you are talking about.
4	1523028838	1	Which part of my example did you have trouble with?
5	1523037622	1	The part where you pretended that monopoly is anything like a real economy and that the fed just prints money to buy properties. Could you outline just what analogies you were trying to make with your example? 
1	1522980422	7	Lambs moon noise is annoying. If you look at the underlying technology and the freedom that will grow from it. There is the real power.
1	1522999781	5	The post doesn’t actually make sense though. Bitcoin is inflationary and will be inflationary long after you are dead.In fact, the bitcoin rate of inflation is currently higher than the rate of inflation of the USD! The USD posted 2.18% in 2018, bitcoin is approximately 4% (see https://charts.bitcoin.com/chart/inflation).Are we really celebrating that in 120 years (the USD has existed for 240 years) bitcoin won’t be inflationary and the USD might? What are we fighting for/against exactly?
2	1523010773	5	your confusing the 2 inflations. one is the inflation of the money supply and one is the inflation rate. Due to adoption bitcoin has a negative inflation rate. 
3	1523012669	2	So then we all agree both USD and Bitcoin are currently inflationary (the supply of both is increasing).The comparison I gave is to a small degree apples and oranges, but it’s hard to talk about purchasing power (the core concept of inflation) in any useful sense because there’s not a lot of evidence anyone is actually spending it (HODL yo).You have to pick your timeline carefully when you say it has negative inflation - in the last 30 days bitcoin has lost 40% of its purchasing power (when traded to fiat). Most other timeframes you’re right - purchasing power (to buy other fiat) has increased - but this is by chance not design.
4	1523026612	1	> there’s not a lot of evidence anyone is actually spending itNobody is spending it.  People are hanging onto it in the vain hope of getting rich.    Others just use it to hide proceeds of crime.
4	1523034026	1	Also, the BTC supply inflation is known in advance (also decreases by half every four years so will much lower than USD in 20 years), and not controlled by the central government.  Many people are not worried about 2% inflation.  The worry is that this low rate will not continue.
2	1523027635	1	I think your mistake is assuming we care about inflation because of the effect it has on purchasing power alone. While that's obviously an issue, the bigger issue (for me) is that the people who print fiat currency use it for really evil shit and I have a big problem with my money being stolen from me and used to drop bombs on poor people on the other side of the planet who I've never even met. While Bitcoin may be inflationary for a while yet, I don't have the same moral issue with where that newly created money is going.
2	1523002263	7	The money supply doubles about every 10 years. That's 10% real inflation, no matter how the government tries to downplay CPI (which doesn't even attempt to measure money supply)
3	1523027699	1	>The money supply doubles about every 10 years. That's 10% real inflation, no matter how the government tries to downplay CPI (which doesn't even attempt to measure money supply)Absolutely false. Inflation specifically refers to an increase in prices. You are conflating that with a related but entirely separate concept known as monetary inflation. 
1	1523012384	1	Nevertheless Im buyin this dip DCA
1	1522987000	1	[removed]
2	1522995915	1	their :)...unless there's some joke im missingand agreed, this sub has gotten marginally better in the last few weeks
3	1522996115	1	I was so focused on the parens around it that I fked up the grammar lmao thx.  Maybe they are radar though too?
0	1522983371	9	So, inflation is BAD!!!But Bitcoin losing its purchase power from 20000 dollars to 7000 dollars or lower is nothing to think about. Even when this happened in a matter of few weeks.
1	1522986876	2	[deleted]
1	1523018049	0	Was OP about price inflation or monetary inflation?
2	1523026762	1	The end goal of any currency is to purchase something of value from the market.Saying that inflation reduced purchasing power is implying that you can buy less stuff using same amount of dollars. So, something you used to buy for 10 dollars now costs 11. That's inflation. You lost purchasing power.Bitcoin could purchase 20000 dollars worth of value at ita peak. It cannot do so now. It can only purchase worth 6-7000 dollars. You lost purchasing power.
3	1523027187	1	Do you think OP is talking about _price_ inflation like you are?
4	1523027377	1	In most cases, monetary inflation follows price inflation. No matter what the OP is talking about, the end result is that the consumer gets stability in the short to medium term. This is something that Bitcoin doesn't have as of now.
5	1523027946	1	But it wouldn't make sense to say that price instability is _taxation_.
1	1522991095	-1	You are forgetting that the “boom” just happened out of nowhere, and disappeared just as fast. In November bitcoin was 6.5k ish. Today its at 6.7k. 5 months total. That 20k was short lived, so you can’t base any assumptions on that. All that needs to happen is someone who whats to undermine crypto or just quickly make a killing to    dump a shit ton of money into it to create a lot of fuss, then wait for the idiots to start taking out mortgages out on their houses to invest into something they have no clue about, then cash out, causing the price to fall. And there you have it, they made a ton and hurt crypto’s reputation. Now you have a bunch of hurt people bashing and talking crap trying to cut their losses and get out with only bad things to say about crypto. What happens when you corner a beast? It starts to fight back furiously, even though it doesn’t stand a chance. At its peak, crypto was a 550B market. So if you had 100B at your disposal, you can easily pump and dump the entire industry, walk away with a good profit and leave it with a bad reputation. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was a doing of a large banker or even a government who understands what bitcoin means for them, and don’t want it happening. On the other hand, if bitcoin held at 20k for a year of two, then suddenly went to 6k, then it would mean that its in serious trouble. But that little spike, that came and went means nothing. It will continue falling for a bit before it goes up, but then it will continue to rise. Historically, its been averaging 100% increase every month. A nice steady climb until this pump happened. So it will continue to do so once it recovers and the miners keep mining. Nothing to fear!
1	1522991173	-1	Bitcoin is not treated as legal tender... so you're comparing apples to oranges.  If bitcoin were treated as legal tender then it would function like a digital gold standard.  Price fluctuations will stabilize with user adoption, and legal backing.  
2	1522991559	2	>Bitcoin is not treated as legal tenderTrue>so you're comparing apples to oranges.The OP is the one starting the comparison by pointing out that the dollar lost it's purchasing power.>If bitcoin were treated as legal tender then it would function like a digital gold standard.If>Price fluctuations will stabilize with user adoption, and legal backing. If it happens.Speaking for myself, I have no use for Bitcoin. I am perfectly happy with the Indian rupee. It has served me well for 27 years and it is stable enough that I don't need to worry about it. Bitcoin serves no purpose to me.
3	1522993094	1	What do you do in the event of an economic crisis when capital controls and bank bail-ins are enacted, stealing your savings to prop-up insolvent banks?  
0	1522993938	7	And yet bitcoin inflates... hmm
1	1523006744	3	Will inflate slower than fiat by 2020. After that, he will be deflationary.Bitcoin is in fact inflationary, but i think, more BTC is lost than mined even in these days.
2	1523029827	1	"In economics, inflation is a sustained *increase in the general price level of goods and services* in an economy over a period of time."What you are talking about is monetary inflation or increase in money supply and not inflation.please stop confusing people by misusing terms.
0	1523011073	7	I know this is /r/bitcoin but I need to say what I feel, even if I feel this won't be popular.A currency cannot have 0 inflation or deflation.Bitcoin's sort of deflative by nature, which is not a good thing for a currency.Let me put it in a perspective.You have 500'000 $. You know your 500'000 $ will be worth less in two years.Let's say that you're looking for a flat. There's a nice flat near your area that costs 500'000 $.You can make two choices:-a) buy it-b) waitNow, the b) scenario with an inflative currency is not wise (unless you invest it and have a return that beats inflation). As inflation will make your dollars worth less with time (and the same flat may cost 525'000 or be unavailable in two years) you're pressured to spend your 500'000$ now and get that flat.The inflative nature of pretty much any currency is good for economy. In the end currencies are only a mean to trade goods and services. Knowing your money is worth less tomorrow makes you spend your money now and moves the economy. You'll get your flat. Who sold you the flat will maybe get a rare Ferrari, idk. The Ferrari owner may start a business.Now, all of these things are way less likely to happen with a deflative currency.As you know that your 500'000 might be worth more in two years you're invited to hoard it and wait, not to spend it. In two years the same flat may cost you 480'000 $ and you'd save 20'000$. But what happens in two years? That if you wait another two years you may pay for the same flat 455'000$.This leads to you not spending your 500'000, the home owner won't get his Ferrari, the Ferrari owner won't have the cash to start the business.Obviously the inflative nature of a currency has a bad side: if you're a saver and you don't want to spend your money you're gonna face the problem of your savings devaluing with time. You're pressured to either spend it or invest it. But investments not always turn well. So your savings may devalue even more.Here a deflative currency shows its benefits: you know your currency won't be worth less tomorrow and you can sleep just fine.But again a deflative currency won't really work as a currency. People are not encouraged to invest it, spend it. It cannot move an economy.That's one of the problems I see in most cryptocurrencies. While I do understand the philosophy some of you have of a store of value is right, it also leads to: "how can Bitcoin really function as a currency if hoarding and holding is promoted rather than spending"?Shops that implemented Bitcoin payments did not see a real spike in sells except for the very few weeks from the news.Why?Because each and everybody is concerned with the fiat value and promotes a holding philosophy.Yet, even without those memes and philosophy pretty much anybody can understand that the limited amount of Bitcoin does not promote spending it.I think Satoshi was a great mathematician, yet I don't think he was a great economist. He couldn't be everything, and this subreddit has moved past his ideas for many things (block size, e.g.).In the end I think that if Bitcoin had an acceptable inflative nature (2%/year) and a PoS (so holders and spenders can both have benefits) system instead of a PoW system Bitcoin's economics would've looked better.I just can't see Bitcoin making a case for being a currency at any point. It's always gonna be a second layer of currency transmissions. I know some people argue that "you will use Bitcoin for big payments", but in the end, why would I, and why would the seller accept it if he's less likely to make many smaller payments?At some point, as a community, we really do need to rethink the fundamentals of Bitcoin.What I feel (or better, know) will happen tho, is yet more phylosophical wars that will lead to nothing.In the end Network's stability derives from consensus, and it's pretty obvious we cannot reach consensus without yet other forks.And since most people are concerned with Bitcoin-fiat price rather than using Bitcoins the same thing that keeps Bitcoin price high (it's store of value-ish nature) is the same thing that will prevent it from achieving anything (it's deflative nature).
1	1523027833	1	forcing people into deciding to spend their assets now because in the future they know it will inflate and be worth less than it is now is not a good thingpeople should be making the economic decisions that they want to make, not because of some constraint that their currency (and by extension, their cumulative labor) places on themMe wanting to buy a donut should have more to do with me wanting the donut than the fact that in the future this donut will cost me moreand besides, negative rate bitcoin loans are possible. it's not like we can't think of clever ways to implement that.
2	1523028150	1	> it will inflate and be worth less than it is now is not a good thingWorld economy during the last 70 years proves you otherwise.
0	1523018215	2	Is the point of this to say that inflation is inherently bad?  Or that Bitcoin is immune to inflation?
0	1523026384	1	is inflation really a bad thing tho
0	1522982053	4	Bitcoin can be inflated through forking.  Last year when it was splitting into other coins was very dangerous.  Inflation turning a currency into garbage is the fate of all money.  The people maintaining it start openly degrading the currency and at some ppint people stop accepting it.  BTC is an attempt to break that cycle.
1	1522989449	10	Bitcoin cannot be inflated through forking... shitcoins do not equal bitcoin.  
2	1522990058	2	People realized that, and it failed.  Now the oligarchs are trying to capture it or manipulate it into oblivion.  There are scammers in crypto, and the governments and banks see it as a threat.  Any perceived vulnerability will be attacked and exploited.
3	1522990611	5	Unless they can successfully ban math and science, then they will fail.
0	1522976495	4	*"Fractional-reserve banking is the practice whereby a bank accepts deposits, makes loans or investments, but is required to hold reserves equal to only a fraction of its deposit liabilities."***ELI5**: Banks reserve approximately 10% of your savings deposits (your savings account), the rest is loaned out (spent) as credit through Real Estate, credit cards, car loans etc.When people say banks print money out of nothing, what they really mean is that they are spending other peoples savings - the law of physics means you can't print cars or houses out of thin air, but banks can spend other peoples money (savings) to pay for them instead.A lot of people don't like that banks spend $90 out of every $100 they deposit into a bank, with Bitcoin nobody is loaning out your coins, so your money is still there at the end of the day and not being used to prop up the housing market or stock market.**BUY BITCOIN**https://imgur.com/a/ytDQT
1	1522982622	9	Banks loaning money around is the fundamental idea behind finance.By pooling everyone's money, banks allow patient people to safeguard their funds for future use while simultaneously funding projects for people that need it now. If you sit with 2 million worth of bitcoin idle in your wallet, the economy suffers a large opportunity cost. If literally everyone was doing that, the economy would probably shut down in a day.
2	1522999359	3	Ok deposit your bitcoin with me and I will lend out 10 times that amount in BCH or eth or rupple or petrocoins. There you go fractional crypto. Who's with me?
3	1523020234	1	I mean that's kinda likely to happen if BTC was used as a currency
2	1522985048	3	Yes but as we know there are very deleterious elements (and given the choice many people would prefer their savings were not used for investment in asset bubbles), for example during a market crash in the cycle of a market, when everything valued in debt has reached a peak e.g. sub prime real estate, it starts to crash. The savings in reserve (fractional reserve) are so small they cannot support the crash in price of all the inflated asset classes. This knock- on effect can result in reprecussions, such as bank "bail-ins" where a bank can use up the reserve of peoples savings to catch the fall (bank insolvency), leaving little savings left in the banks for people to withdraw.The classic historical context of this occurring is called a "bank run" whereby people line up at ATMs to withdrawal their cash in order to protect their wealth.Savings are a backbone of an economy and modern economics has done a good job of promoting credit over wealth accumulation. i personally would rather my own savings remain just savings, in order to reduce risk that my wealth is wiped out or devalued in a crisis.**Bitcoin is an attempt to provide a savings vehicle (a second choice) without the risks associated with fiat fractional reserve banking.**
3	1522986305	3	Sure you make valid points, and bank runs are obviously a serious issue. On that note, you should read Diamond and Dwybvig. Regardless, Bitcoin is not a good solution for this as it is equivalent to sticking money under a mattress (with the added risk/reward of its price fluctuation). On that note, if you are willing to use bitcoin to hold all your savings, you'd have to extremely risk loving or borderline insane.There are thousands of people in the academics and governments that are trying to solve this issue while keeping the benefits that banks give to society.Lastly, that is not what bitcoin is intended for. Bitcoin (and well blockchain) is intended in essence to replace transaction intermediaries (not banks) such as visa or western union. Technically, bitcoin was initially a solution for the double-spending problem in a decentralized framework, and what people make of it nowadays is kind of ridiculous in my opinion.
4	1522987237	4	I just read the synopsis of that and it does nothing to alleviate the fact that real-world examples of financial crisis do occur and people are impacted regardless of "emotional sentiment". I'm not interested in herd behaviour, i'm interested in a savings vehicle *that sits outside of the banking system*.Also I disagree with your second paragraph (this whole currency vs storage of wealth argument), you sound like a Bcash kinda guy but I will post my belief on what Bitcoin is.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Storage of value in the purest sense is money that:**a)** retains value over time and**b)** increases in value over time (deflationary).*This is why Gold is a tier 1 asset (see "Exter's pyramid") despite never being used to buy groceries, coffee, entrance fees to clubs or pay bills. Storage of value rates higher than medium of exchange, otherwise fiat would be considered better than gold for reserve purposes but it isn't, (it's trash for storing wealth e.g. housing, healthcare and food all increasing comparatively) but makes an excellent medium of exchange - the functions are seperated.**Most Cryptos are probably both, but private storage of wealth is more critical at this point in time as we already have fiat and credit for shopping but not many avenues for savings that outpace inflation.*
5	1522987878	0	All of this has nothing to do with herding... Why you mention this is a bit obscure. When I say people are trying to solve this issue, I refer to the banking issues you raised, not trading behaviors (sure I did a research on that, but it's not the topic here).Cryptocurrencies have been historically deflationary but their volatility is way too high for them to be a proper store of value. Of course, what I said does nothing to alleviate the financial issues you raised. I will obviously not sit here and pretend I have a solution for financial crashes. I simply mention there are lots of effort being put on this and that bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are NOT a solution candidate for the stability of the financial system.By the way, a general consensus that came out of the 2008 crisis is that all things considered, the economy is still better off than if finance did not exist, and QE worked surprisingly well for rebalancing the US economy post-recession. The real issue here is financial institutions being too big to fail and bail-outs creating serious moral hazards.Here are some legitimate attempts(mostly academics) to tackle these issues:https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/FEDS/2006/200611/200611pap.pdfhttp://www.sfu.ca/~dandolfa/Allen%20and%20Gale%202007.pdfhttps://www.coll.mpg.de/pdf_dat/2010_42online.pdfhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.589.1748&rep=rep1&type=pdfhttp://www.people.hbs.edu/shanson/hanson_kashyap_stein_jep.pdf
6	1522989317	1	Bitcoin is a solution in progress. We are here to build Bitcoin, not put our hand out merely for reward. You do not sound to me like a builder. You are a rote learning, text-book reader who is merely repeating to me what the mass-circulated books say in every university across the world - every college graduate is a genius, right? But let me tell you that those who make history think outside the box.QE is debt. Do you know how much debt the world has accumulated since 2008? It is nearly $100 Trillion. Please think more carefully about this because you do not demonstrate an understanding of long-term consequences and risk associated with debt accumulation of such a magnitude.Let us just keep printing money and all our dreams and fantasies will come true.
7	1522989889	0	Not saying QE is great, just that its effect has been better than anticipated. Sure you can throw around big debt numbers, but these are meaningless without some logical arguments. What are you trying to prove exactly?I am not telling you textbook knowledge, I am trying to elucidate your arguments about bitcoin being a solution for real financial problems, and so far you have not convinced me. Maybe take a step back with your personal attacks, go to bed and think a bit about how bitcoin or cryptocurrencies can actually help here. I am willing to engage in a real discussion but it is a waste of time if you do not have a properly constructed arguments to support your "out of the box" thinking. So far, if I want to store value and create some growth outside of banks, I can just invest in bonds.So indeed, a work in progress it is.
8	1522990273	2	The more debt a nation accumulates, the higher the interest payments. Without perpetual infinite growth this burden of repayments becomes untenable. What you are proposing is infinite growth and that is simply not possible - which is why many like myself plan to hedge against future risk by investing in **an asset class that sits outside of the banking system**.I have already stated quite clearly the clear risks here but you have failed to digest them. An argument is not won by linking me to a Central Bank website - the fact you cite the Federal Reserve is a clear demonstration to me that you are following the herd narrative.Also please carefully read the snips posted in the imgur link I provided in my initial post. You can support CB criminality but I myself refuse to do so and support and promote alternatives.
9	1522990879	1	So in short, you are refusing to read logically constructed arguments by academics (not the federal reserve itself), but are asking me to digest sensationally written news headlines? Are you kidding me?Again, if everyone invests in an asset class outside the banking system, we are back to the initial problem I raised, of an economy with no funding thus no potential for growth. I am not endorsing infinite growth, that is a ridiculous idea, but you think holding cryptocurrencies can solve the worldwide national debt problem? I am flabbergasted honestly. By the way, if you paid a bit more attention, you would have seen: "NOTE: Staff working papers in the Finance and Economics Discussion Series (FEDS) are preliminary materials circulated to stimulate discussion and critical comment. The analysis and conclusions set forth are those of the authors and do not indicateconcurrence by other members of the research staff or the Board of Governors. " 
2	1522990313	1	During this early speculative phase... people are going to do a lot of holding. When bitcoin becomes a household item, and everybody uses it, then the massive price gains will come to an end.  At that point... why would wealthy bitcoin holders continue to horde it?  Being scarce (like gold) it would incentivize saving and lead to more thoughtful investment, but the economy would not grind to halt... just grow at a sustainable rate.  IMO  
1	1522983679	6	>A lot of people don't like that banks spend $1000 for every $100 they depositFixed
1	1523002338	2	> When people say banks print money out of nothing, what they really mean is that they are spending other peoples savings - the law of physics means you can't print cars or houses out of thin air, but banks can spend other peoples money (savings) to pay for them instead.No, they're *literally* printing money -.. and that means on paper AND digitally in the computer . so yes they DO create money out of thin air.BUT not every bank, only central banks. A government takes a loan. The central banks create the money. Every time.
1	1522977533	1	Inflation is the next step. One part of this rampant inflation occurs because peoples savings are being issued out as loans/credit which means everyone gets a mortgage or car loan and this inflates/raises the price of those assets due to the increased demand of those assets relative to how much money you earn or you have saved in the bank.
1	1522986316	2	quote “ *When people say banks print money out of nothing, what they really mean is that they are spending other peoples savings - the law of physics means you can't print cars or houses out of thin air, but banks can spend other peoples money (savings) to pay for them instead.*”This is simply not correct.What fractional reserve banking means, is that banks have the license to *create* money out of the blue, up to ten times more than the reserves they have.When banks make a 100 mio dollar loan for a new construction site, or some investment, they simply print some new money for the purpose. Not physical cash, but account money. The money never existed before the loan existed. Yet they are transferred to the guy who spends them on real things. And suddenly you have more money in the society, and thereby inflation.The banks then earn profits on the interests and gradually “destroy” the money again as the loan is paid back. So everything adds up, but still, in the period the loan lasts, the bank has increased the amount of money and created inflation,When things go wrong and the loan is not paid back, the inflation will remain, and the tax payers will bail out the bank.It’s pretty extreme that this is actually allowed, and it’s something that is not really taught in schools or common knowledge. Switzerland has made fractional banking illegal several years ago.
2	1523021193	1	they are using the debth to controll the demand ao they can cobtroll the inflation by adjusting interest rates
2	1523004245	1	Stop watching conspiracy videos. They don't create money out of the blue. They guy you quote is right, they just lend the money from the depositors. And they are allowed to lend up to 90% of the deposited money.  You can "print" money yourself exactly like a bank does. If a relative gives you 100$ for safe keeping, and you lend 90$ to someone else, then congratulations, you just created money. People that deposit money in banks are aware that their money will be lent to someone else, but for that service, they receive a small interest and guarantee of safe keeping. Money that is not used is wasted opportunity. Banks are intermediaries that help put unused money to use. The only problem with banks is when they get too greedy, and start to offer loans to individuals/entities that have a high risk of default. And another thing: Switzerland in no way made fractional banking illegal.
3	1523028563	1	There's no conspiracy, you just don't understand how fractional reserve banking works. They absolutely do create money out of thin air. Please do some additional reading. 
4	1523028991	1	Did you read my example how you as an individual can "create money" exactly like a bank does? There is absolutely nothing wrong with fractional reserver as long as the intermediary does a good risk analysys before lending the money
5	1523029681	1	Sure, let's use your example. Let's say I'm the bank and I start with no money. You deposit $100 and I now go lend out $90 of that to Sally. Sally now has $90 and owes me $90. She puts the $90 in the bank, and I immediately lend out $80 of it to Bob. Bob now owes me $80 and has $80. He puts his $80 in the bank and I immediately lend out $70 of it to Tim. So by now I am owed $240 from Sally, Bob and Tim, and you still have your original $100. The total money supply has gone from $100 to $340 with only a few deposits, and I'm not even done yet - I'll go on lending the same money over and over to new people until in the end I am owed 10x what the original money supply was. Where did all of the extra money come from?
6	1523030002	1	The money of the depositors are out of circulation. They agreed, when they deposited, that the bank can do whatever it wants with it but promises to return them to the depositer when he asks. It's an agreement between them from which both parties win something. You as an individual can do exactly the same thing just like a bank. The money you will be creating is just virtual, and temporary. In circulation you would still only have the initial 100$.
7	1523030214	1	Did you read my post? Once everyone pays back the $1000 they owe me, you still have your $100. Where did all of the extra money come from? Oh and there's interest on the loans.
8	1523030574	1	I dont have 100$ because i gave it to the bank. The bank has my 100$ and i have a promise that i can get them back whenever i want. I can withdraw it, but if the bank doesn't have it because it lent it to someone else, the bank eill apply for a loan too. As i said, no actual money is created, its just accounting tricks. 
9	1523030779	1	I'm not talking about your $100 though, I'm talking about the $1,000 that everyone owes me from your $100 principle. Where did all that extra money come from? Stop avoiding the question, fight through the cognitive dissonance you're experiencing now and address the part where new money was created.

4	1523029150	1	From a signed petition that is going to be put up for a vote to actually making it ilegal is a long way. 
5	1523031832	1	Not saying it was but was just clarifying
3	1523035833	1	Gigafrancu:There is no conspiracy here, but banks DO create money at will. If someone deposits 100 dollar in the bank, the net result of loaning out 90% of it will be an additional 1000 dollar in the society. Happens like this: Someone deposits 100 dollars in the bank. The bank loans out 90 dollars to someone else who spends it on services/goods.  The new guy who just earned the money deposits his 90 dollars in the same bank, and the bank then keeps 9 dollars and loans out 81 dollars to a third person which is spent on goods/ services. If you continue like this the bank in the end will have created loans for 1000 dollars that are all spent on real things. So they created 900 dollars out of thin air, which are added to the total money supply. When the loans are gradually paid back, the money will be removed again from money supply. IF they pay back. This risk is taken by everyone else in society who’s money is less worth as this inflation goes on.True?
4	1523037002	1	The money that is circulating in the sociaty are max 100$. The rest is just accounting numbers in the bank's books. There will never be 1000$ circulating in the society. What fractional reserve banking does is put unused money in the hands of people that have actual use for them. A healthy economy needs money to move hands.
1	1523012823	1	Not arguing either for or against fractional reserve banking, just want to expand on it. That $90 will end up at a second bank, of which 90% will yet again end up at a third bank, and so on. The result is that for every $100 which is injected by a central bank, banks will effectively expand it to $1000 if you assume a 10% reserve.

1	1522989850	-2	The middle class is harmed by inflation, not the rich. Is 2 percent per annum modest in your world? Did you know some economists are proposing 3 or 4 percent per annum, is that "modest inflation" to you? 
2	1522991205	5	> middle classthe middle class absolutely benefits from inflation - given that so many of them are eyeball deep in mortgages or student loans. every year the value of the debt just get crapped on by the Fed.if you are a wealthy person with massive amounts invested in business ownership (equity investments) or credit to other businesses (bond investments), you hope for dear life every day that these businesses you are involved in make enough money just to overcome the value lost through inflation.
2	1522990729	2	What makes you think the middle class are harmed by 2-3% inflation? The middle class generally get COLA (cost of living adjustments) each year to ensure they have the same purchasing power. Inflation eats away at cash savings, and since the vast majority of wealth isn't in cash, that's really not a problem. The average person/family needs 3-12 months worth of living expenses in cash as an emergency fund, this is insurance. Any wealth over that emergency fund is put into productive assets to build more wealth. Your cash emergency fund is insurance, and insurance costs money. So you have 20k in cash and that costs you $400-600 a year to protect yourself and your family from cashing out investments that bring you a higher return/would have penalties for cashing out.If anything, inflation hurts the working poor that make minimum wage and don't have access to competitive wages to get COLA.
1	1522996783	-3	Arguably, inflation provides the greatest incentive to hoard wealth and not put it to work- because you can simply invest in things newly printed money is used to buy (real estate, stocks) and get richer as more and more money is printed. 
2	1522997161	4	You guys are the reason people don't take bitcoin seriously you know that right? Almost no understanding of basic economic principles let alone inflationary policy. 
3	1523002753	1	Thanks. I appreciate you taking the time to educate me instead of just blindly saying I'm wrong without saying how- it is a breath of fresh air. 
4	1523003601	1	Np. Go to school if you want to learn. 
5	1523004302	0	So there aren't any books, sites, youtube videos, reddit comments, blogs that have this information? I have to physically register at and turn up at a school?Incidentally, when I was actually at school, and later doing professional qualifications, I was taught incorrect facts (that deposits create loans, for example) how can I be sure they are teaching the right things now?
6	1523019131	1	No, there really isn't a YouTube video or article that will explain monetary policy in appropriate detail to give you a proper perspective on the subject. Go take a class at your nearest college, I promise you it will be worth it.

2	1523022786	1	Just because you're ignorant doesn't mean innovations aren't happening. 
2	1523018404	-1	_Obviously_ the most important recent invention was encouraged by inflation. That's why we're here.
0	1523002597	2	While it may feel true on the surface, fact is that most people have loans which actually get discounted by inflation. Even people without loans dont put their money in fiat, but in stocks. If you put your money in your mattress (except for minor emergency fund) you're a god damn moron.
0	1523023780	1	This is always weird to me. Who invests in currency? If you invest in assets, it doesn't really matter what inflation does. In Germany during the massive inflation, if you invested in assets (printing press, real estate, stocks, brewing equipment) you weren't hurt much at all by the inflation and may have been better for it. 
0	1523028523	1	And so are tarrifs. 
0	1522982359	1	Milton Friedman was also in favor of having inflation be regulated by a central computer.One of the shortcomings of the Bitcoin system is that there's no such system in place.
1	1522984255	5	It's a feature, not a shortcoming.
1	1523007510	2	Do it and make better crypto. If its good idea, bitcoin will plumen in comparison with your coin.
0	1522986204	1	I'm no right-libertarian, but this is where they and I see eye to eye. If I'm supposed to work all day my entire life for government-issued currency to exchange for the things I need, then that currency had damn well better be dependable and responsibly managed. I put my tiny amount of wealth into bitcoin to protect it from being evaporated into nothing without my consent.

0	1522987977	1	Technically, it's taxation without representation, at least in the US. The fed is merely appointed by congress, not in control of them.
1	1522989732	1	> The fed is merely appointed by congress, not in control of them.Fed Board members are nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate. The Fed is supposedly independent, meaning other than that function, Congress has no control over them.  Congress could initiate new legislation to change that, or abolish the Fed, however, they seem very content with what has evolved.

1	1522970736	-1	Very smart. Friedrich Hayek has a good economic policy as well.
0	1522992632	-2	Somebody explain to me how on earth will bitcoin check inflation. A limited supply of some arbitrary money will just promote hoarding. And hoarding will simply choke the life out of economy. 
1	1523007403	3	Inflation and poverty of poor (most people are poor - 1% owns 99% resources) will reduce buypower. So you will have lot of poor people who cant affort to live or eat and on other side you will have 10 big wealthy guys who can afford anything they want when they want. So the consumption of every consumable thing will decrease and thus prices will start to rise even faster. Now check how price the inflation of housing and food prices. We are at the beggining of hyperinflation in developer countries. There is no solution. We have already woman a children working, now even elderly people are working... And everything is bought with debt. When we will starting paying the debt, we will consume less. Prices will go higher. Enjoy endgame of captialism. Or you can try to switch to deflationary money.
2	1523020306	1	Why it BTC deflationary?
2	1523029065	1	>Inflation and poverty of poor (most people are poor - 1% owns 99% resources) will reduce buypower. So you will have lot of poor people who cant affort to live or eat and on other side you will have 10 big wealthy guys who can afford anything they want when they want. that's bs. Poor people don't have much money that would be affected by inflation / deflation and usually live from paycheck to paycheck that usually gets adjusted to the inflation.Rich people, on the other hand, would profit big time from a deflation. They could just sit on their money and get richer every day bo doing nothing at all... they don't even need to lend out or invest their money giving other people a chance to climb up the laddder.>We are at the beggining of hyperinflation in developer countries.the inflation for the EU is projected to be 1.1% which is way below the 2% target.>We have already woman a children working, now even elderly people are working... And everything is bought with debtthat has more to do with people in developed countries arent getting any children anymore and how our social security systems are build up.
