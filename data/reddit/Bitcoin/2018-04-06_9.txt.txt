I mean that must be crossing some kind of line, they aren’t even trying to block something that could be classified as “illegal” so their reasoning is extremely superficial.
1	1523005199	35	Once you deposit funds into a bank, it’s no longer “your” money.  It’s now an asset of the bank, with an offsetting non secured liability on the bank balance sheet.  in essence, when you deposit YOUR money into a bank, it becomes the banks money and they are in ultimate control of that money, as is indicated in this situation!  They have a contract with you, that gives you unsecured claims to the money...  but of course, you can’t actually take them to court and sue them, you need to take them to arbitration, and use the banks chosen arbiter, who is paid by the bank, and who cannot survive without the relationship with the bank...   in other words, good luck, your going to need a hell of a lot more than that though!The solution, get your money out of the banks!  Hold cash, crypto, or physical bullion, and you’ll be in control of your own finances.   When enough people do that, the bank cartel will come to realize that they no longer have a monopoly over money, and they will be forced to start actually competing, instead of just robbing from the people. 
2	1523006071	5	If you were to bring down the bank cartels, the best way to do it would be to introduce a better alternative.Fin-tech companies coming will soon patch that void and hopefully all banks will cease to exist. I'd give it 10 to 15 years. It's only 2 actual things that banks do for individuals:1. Deposit & access funds 2. Loans & alternative financing With blockchain & all forms of crowdfunding (donation, equity, invoice financing) alternatives coming up... you see where I'm going with this...In the future, the "Bank Era" will be looked upon as the dark ages.
3	1523008816	4	I hope to god your right on your prediction...  because banks do a 3rd thing for individuals as well...  dilute the individuals wealth as a result of their monopoly on creating a debt instrument and inflating the supply of the currency at the banks benefit, and the individuals detriment.The problem with your theory is that the banks have such vast control over modern government, that simply creating a better alternative isn’t going to be enough I’m afraid!  I suspect it’s going to take an outraged, and determined public to force the issue, and Im not sure we have a public that has the stomach for that!
4	1523021551	2	It doesn't matter how much control they have, you can't stop technology, at best you can postpone it. Sooner or later the Bank vs Fintech war is going to be like Libraries Vs The internet. It's just about creating something that can do the banks job a lot better. Plus more and more people are already getting disillusioned about banks right now, it's just a matter of time.
3	1523020908	1	Every single transaction you make is based on the trust that is implicit in the banking system of the country. If the shopkeeper cannot deposit the money you gave him in his account he wont accept that. People are simply taking all the transactions as something happening on its own.
2	1523035970	1	Too bad they do not have credit unions in India. Something like the co-op ones here in the US. Yes, they are still banks but they are people driven not like Chase, Wells Fargo, BOA etc.

1	1523004953	8	It's okay if they don't want their clients to use credit card because of risks involved!! But seriously why do they care or be able to control how I spend money I worked hard to earn
1	1523027714	1	This is in India, so I don't know what kind of consumer rights are in place there.I had a similar issue with a small bank in the United States awhile back. They closed by personal account citing that they do not allow virtual currency transactions. I had sent $800 to coinbase one time. I reported the incident to CFPB and had them investigated by the FDIC who sent me a letter of the results. Any private banking institution can end a customer relation for any reason.
1	1523029602	1	citibank does it here in the States. They will close your account if they see anything bitcoin related.
2	1523029982	1	By "Close your account" - what exactly happens? they just give you back your money and say we don't want you as a customer??and as a follow up, where do they send your money when they close your account?,It sounds so ridiculous it's hard to process...
3	1523037786	1	Yea idk, didn't happen to me I have a different bank, but Some one else had posted a screen shot of an email they got from citibank closing their account.
1	1523010587	2	Well credit cards are technically loans, so I could see why they would restrict that.  And the anonymous non-refundable nature of crypto currency would make it impossible to ever recover a fraudulent charge. Fraudulent charges you are not responsible for and the bank must project you from. I still think we should make purchases with our own money. 
2	1523018090	2	Debit cards, however, aren't loans at all, just a way to accept your money what you already deposited - same true for the Netbanking (initiating wire transfer) - and prePaid cards are means that you already PAID for them (this is why they are PREpaid cards)
1	1523020784	2	The RBI made crypto illegal so the banks have to comply. 
1	1523006508	4	They are not prohibiting what you use your money for, but what you use the credit card for.
2	1523006586	2	Debit Card is also mentioned so it is your money
3	1523007028	5	Doesnt matter. They can still not allow you to use the card for certain things. Theres a difference between them telling you not to use the card for something and using your money for something.
4	1523007546	1	I get what you are saying, but a debit card is just a way to access your own money. That's like locking someone's stuff in a room and saying "we aren't stopping you from accessing your stuff, but you can't use this door. " - "Maybe climbing through the window or something"
5	1523008704	3	If you want to use that analogy, they only lock one of the two doors to the room. The door they have installed themselves even...
6	1523008908	1	ok, what would be the second door then? 
7	1523009299	4	Withdraw your money. Bank transfer. 
8	1523012494	1	So basically take your money and move to another bank
9	1523019929	2	Its your money, and you can still send money to crypto exchanges I believe
1	1523027383	1	Besides, what are they baning exactly besides "bit coin"? "Virtual currecies"? what is that?  I guess it does include Amazon gift cards.
1	1523007278	-1	And now you realize why we had to use f-king TETHER!! And all you noobs were just being sheep spreading FUD about tether. Tether was made bc banks were colluding to block people from buying crypto. Just buy it through local bitcoins or directly with tether or mine it. Bitcoin is permissionless and trustless no govt can stop it.
2	1523029665	1	Bitcoin mining is useless(impractical)for regular people and not worth the time.
3	1523032783	1	You can be comfortable with 5 rigs which doesn’t cost a kidney. 
2	1523020132	1	But can't banks stop tether purchases? Tether still doesn't make sense to me. It makes sense if I was wanting to print my own tether to infinity to buy something that is finite.
0	1523006280	19	localbitcoins volume in india will go up next week
1	1523015258	3	except they ban it. as they did in germany. you can still access per VPN, but the volumen is basically non existent. you need to drive to the netherlands or other country around.
2	1523015708	7	Bisq
3	1523016048	2	Zero Volumen. There are **3** sell orders for USD right now. 15 for €. And the prices are way over market level.But yes, i'm in general a fan of decentralized exchange. hope they will be the future.BTW:Looking on the bisq faq:> Will my bank know I’m buying bitcoins?> > There have been reports that some banks have closed client accounts when they see that there is Bitcoin activity involved.So i would say, no chance for indians.
4	1523020218	2	Bisq and local Bitcoin are chances. Low shitty chances. But the banks are fighting this because they know they will be obsolete.
4	1523032572	1	the banks have literally no way to know what the Bisq-involved fiat transaction is for, unless either one of the parties involved declare it to be a [insert_crypto_of_choice] transaction to their own banks.
2	1523035600	1	What about [Bitcoin Treff](http://bitcoin-treff.de/)? I thought this was like the German localbitcoins.
3	1523036878	1	interesting. did not know this page. but looks more like the local trade option in mycelium. so no trading using the website, but only to make contact. so no escrow for example. but will check it out. thanks.
0	1523003206	15	More like NO bank.Hue
0	1523024072	5	This is why bitcoin was created. If anything, this is encouraging news. It means banks are scared to shit
0	1523012523	8	Bhang Lassis - goodBit coin - bad
1	1523035664	1	banks be like 'NO BTC. BC'
0	1523003613	8	Time to stop using those banks.
0	1523013376	6	Our politicians sucks,they are soo corrupt .Taking our country back to stone age. I went to SBI bank to take 3L cash out of my account and to my surprise they said they are out of cash ,how is it possible that big branch in metropolitan city doesn't have 3L with them ,anyways it took them 2 days to give me cash, I have waisted my time visiting SBI branch multiple times and I have to give them a letter signed with explanation that I need this money for an ongoing construction in my house.After sharing my views with others they all have same experience. What's happening to our country now a days?? It feels like something freaking big is going to happen something like financial crisis or something.i am no expert just my intuitions.
1	1523017812	4	Never keep your money in only 1 bank account. Distribute.

0	1523019043	3	Cash and local bitcoins seems to be a growing need..
0	1523020802	3	Lookup Bisq.
1	1523035663	1	Love Lobster Bisq! Think I may get that for lunch today :)
1	1523025231	1	You can use INR there?
2	1523025288	1	Well probably not yet, but lots of money to be made for the people who do it first. Big spreads. So if you have to buy and/or sell, it’s a good choice alongside localbitcoin. 
0	1523004254	4	You can still deposit cash in to the exchange and buy isn't it? I was in favor of Modi government but recent years have only made me not vote them in the next election 
1	1523005642	3	I am surprised all of this is happening at the time when they are already pushing for elections. First you demonetise currencies, then ask the citizens to use the fintech companies for payment, and then you decide to do this. 
1	1523009790	2	Modi absolutely fucked you guys over. And it was all for nothing. In the end nearly all the "Black" money was exchanged for new money. Just as black in the same hands as before. Just screwed up your economy and drove millions into crypto. He is just a fucking dawk.
0	1523011840	2	Well, at least they didn't close your account.
0	1523027132	1	india interest to realise own cryptocurrency India banning cryptos stupid govt
0	1523029615	1	Yes bank says no
0	1523030875	1	So YES bank said NO to crypto currencies
1	1523032429	1	Only time it'll say yes is if govt asks whether it would like to suck Govt's cock 
0	1523032471	1	I can 100% understand not wanting to cover credit card transactions, because if you buy crypto, you may not get it back today back. Debit card, I think it's borderline. If the Bitcoin is stolen or you buy from a fake site, the bank is on the hook for it. 
1	1523032746	1	I have a question. When I buy crypto P2P from say local bitcoins/localethereum, how does the bank know I'm making a cryptopurchase? Given that they aren't considered illegal yet technically, how and to what extent am I or the trader liable?
2	1523033192	1	They don't. If you use bank transfer and DON'T mention "Bitcoin" anywhere then they don't know. Although sometimes they can figure it out if a particular person sells a lot of Bitcoin and the bank figures out. Then they know every person who sends him money buys Bitcoin..in reality, the worst case, the bank closes your account. And good riddance!
3	1523033591	1	This is absolutely plain dumb. This country just trumps itself everyfuckingtime. Good riddance indeed! How ironic that one cant apparently invest in nucleus vision, dent, power ledger etc, all of whom have legit Indian partnerships/affiliations. Have they even thought this through? 
0	1523013586	3	Whats bit coin?
0	1523006513	2	Buy as much btc as you can now and use them later for OTC trading. Profit.
0	1523007106	2	I am sorry about that bro the best you can do is buy a mining rig and mine it. Bitcoin is permisionless and trustless you don’t need anyone’s permission to use it just mine it or work for bitcoin. 
1	1523036719	1	>buy a mining rig and mine it.only if you want to add on to your losses. This piece of shit country is too fucking hot and humid and power loss is very common every day on top of expensive electricity cost.
0	1523014499	2	Don't hate the bank for that decision.  You should be happy.  The more banks do such things, the more people will realise that they can buy bitcoins without banks using decentralized methods.  The problem happens if banks allow you to buy bitcoin a because that way, they will be able to monitor you.
0	1523022002	2	Of all the things that are wrong with this country, this is what makes you "really hate" India you fucking dipshit?
1	1523026829	1	It depends on one's perspective, you dumbass!
0	1523010315	1	Can someone actually explain to me how is that the value has crashed here in India?Even if there are problems in anyway the trade of crypto seems to be going fine, shouldn't the value be almost similar to the actual value?
0	1523017985	1	Seems like we need two-way crypto ATMs with reasonable fees to end this in the interim before becoming a widely used currency. 
0	1523022464	1	Pretty much. That’s what I’ve done. 
0	1523023867	1	¯\_(ツ)_/¯ guess you all have to set up shop on local bitcoins 
0	1523024090	1	No Bank
0	1523029033	1	Its a fight... The goverments are fearing bitcoin. Because its taking control from them. No matter what they cant stop us. 
0	1523029216	1	I can understand why companies wouldn't want people using credit cards to buy cryptos but debit cards? Money the bank knows you have vs money the bank hopes you can pay back. One is a lot riskier than the other. Am I missing something? 
0	1523031829	1	Debit card purchases are protected by is theft laws.   So there is a liability for the bank
0	1523012472	0	I left India years ago. Though I love my country, I heave a sigh of relief when I read news from India. Rape, religion, scams, exam-cheating, touts for everything,caste-based reservation, nepotism, corruption...all the shit that can happen happens there.
0	1523006989	0	You know the old saying, "if you can't take a shit in the road, get out of India"
0	1523006954	0	Welcome to reality's. Indian is busy in Religious shit... You cant expect Crypto Currency success in india, god how you even imagined..These rapists just so better in drugs and rape things..
1	1523010681	3	You must be the special kid
0	1523021094	-1	Yeah that's right, keeping hating the country you live in. It only builds the roads and railways you use, the power grid for the electricity you use, your schools that educate you, the parks you walk through, the airport you use to fly anywhere else. Keep hating. Bitcoin dolts that believe they're not "free" because they can't buy bitcoin are beyond idiotic. Why should your country that you take for granted keep allowing you to hide money from them? You want to use all the benefits your country provides for you without contributing. Spoiled rotten. 
1	1523026497	1	You are in the wrong sub bro...
1	1523024600	1	It's not about hiding money. It's about our right to do whatever the fuck we want with our own money as long as it isn't criminal
1	1523034783	1	Listen here. It's not about not paying taxes. Everyone would want to pay tax if it was limited. Once you earn money and till you spetd it, you would be paying 30-60% of it in taxes. You do understand the problem here right? This is why people want to not pay taxes. Its blood sucking.Also, rich never had to pay much taxes. They always had means to skip tax payments. Now that middle class and poor also can do this is what government is worried about. What is hidden however is the secret tax levied which is called inflation. At a rate of 4-7% per year, it steals purchasing power from savers and retired people. In about 10-15 years, half your money is gone in terms of purchasing power. Bitcoin solves this. It provides a way out of this theft. Your money is yours and no one can secretly steal it. It is financial freedom and freedom to own asssets.Why we get upset is that India isn't the first country to start this policy of taking away financial rights of its citizens. Many have attempted before and every country has gone to the point of starvation. Check Venezuela, Greece, Cyprus etc. If government bans personal right to buy anything that we want, India is going to see a bad future. The rich and powerful always have the means to escape. The poor will be taken hostage where they'll have to eat cockroaches to survive. Because now what they believed in 'paper money' is worthless.I am an Indian and am truly worried about this. 
0	1523008157	0	I suspected something like this to happen, I convinced myself to sell off and come out of cryptos in Feb soon after financial budget was given by Jaitley and since then there have been only decline in prices of crypto currency particularly in Indian crypto exchange, today I see them drop by 22 - 30% even the courageous one has decide to sell and secure his investment.
0	1523015932	0	So this would be a good opportunity in India for some crypto companies to accept paper fiat in person in exchange for bitcoin (more bitcoin atms ?).  Then the Indian person could do as they please with it. Banks would have been convenient due to ach and wire, but they can’t stop you from doing what you please with you physical paper fiat.  Huge opportunity here if it’s marketed well. 
1	1523034183	1	It will be considered as money laundering. 
2	1523036525	1	Is buying gold money laundering?  Nope!
3	1523037362	1	Buying gold worth above 50000 rupees is money laundering if you don't provide a PAN card. 
4	1523038491	1	So?  Nobody said you didn’t have to pay your taxes. 
4	1523038551	1	So?  Nobody said you didn’t have to pay your taxes.   You’d just swipe your pan card when buying bitcoin at the atm. 
0	1523019825	0	Yes Bank.  The irony.This is exactly why we need bitcoin.
0	1523021850	0	Bit coins
0	1523028805	1	Damn, India does hate crypto a lot.
0	1523016141	-1	When you realize you aren’t free 
0	1523020924	-2	Plz get out of India.
0	1523016735	-3	🖕🏻 the banks. Pull out all your cash and see how their business works for them from that point on. Their days are numbered. It’s like watching a beached whale try to roll itself back into the ocean. Pathetic. 
1	1523021096	1	You say this as if it was easy to just pull all the money out of the bank accounts and live without one, lol
1	1523034870	1	Demonetization was to pump the money available to the failing banks. And it was a huge success. Don't think it's easy to take out the money from the banks. Also, crypto enthusiasts are very few. Banks won't even feel it if we remove our money from them. 
0	1523010471	-11	[removed]
1	1523010868	1	Not everyone is poor here, the 10% is holding 90% wealth 
2	1523018079	-9	hahaha you stupid piece of currystreetshitter, you dont get it?indians, as a whole, are a race, which does not contribute anything good to this planet.
