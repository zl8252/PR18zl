0	1523079739	995	So what you're saying is..pull all my money out of Bitcoin in put it straight into Pokemon go.
1	1523083128	226	Absolutely yes.
2	1523099255	66	I wonder how long it took **Cannabis** to get to 50 million users ?
3	1523104763	69	Basically when the world population hit 50 million people. 
4	1523118475	1	So the time it took depends on what again?* Time since Cannabis was around? (100,000,000a?)* Time since Humans were around? (1,000,000a?)* Time since first Human used Cannabis? (50,000a?)* Time since Humans cared about incomplete lists somebody on the internet put together? (20a?)
3	1523101727	28	Ten minutes. 
4	1523107366	1	Nine minutes longer than splinter free toilet paper
3	1523105192	9	Somewhere around 4000 BCE people in China were writing about it's medicinal benefits so... who knows?
4	1523112154	1	There are no 6000 year old writing systems, so this seems like bollocks. 
5	1523113097	1	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_signs_in_ChinaThis may not be writing in the traditional sense, maybe more like signs and symbols that eventually evolved into writing. That said, cuneiform was used 5000 years ago, not 6. 
6	1523113101	1	**Neolithic signs in China**Since the second half of the 20th century, inscriptions have been found on pottery in a variety of locations in China, such as Banpo near Xi'an, as well as on bone and bone marrows at Hualouzi, Chang'an County near Xi'an. These simple, often geometric, marks have been frequently compared to some of the earliest known Chinese characters appearing on the oracle bones, and some have taken them to mean that the history of Chinese writing extends back over six millennia. However, only isolated instances of these symbols have been found, and they show no indication of representing speech or of the non-pictorial processes that a writing system requires.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

6	1523113520	1	Yeah, but you can’t use a system like those to extol the benefits of weed..
7	1523113716	1	Cuneiform, sure you can. It’s just as sophisticated as any other writing system. I’m not saying they did, just they could’ve if they wanted to. 
8	1523115155	1	Yeah, but that’s 1000 years and several thousand miles away. And even then, the very earliest vestiges of cuneiform were beginning 5000 years ago. It was not a language at that point, more like a basic pictograph system. 4 vertical lines and a thing like an upside down A equals 4 cows. (Guess where our letter A came from!) And that was exactly how it was being used at that point. You’d send your shepherd boy off to deliver cows to the person you’d sold them to and give him a piece of burnt clay to take with him recording how many cows he should have when he arrived. Any Chinese system at this point was of a similar level of sophistication, and certainly wasn’t being used to write monologues on the medicinal properties of weed...
3	1523109387	1	I’m so excited for Canada to legalize it entirely!!!  
3	1523113595	1	Four hours and twenty minutes
2	1523109009	1	Fuck it, let's do it... Pokemon go coin ICO dropping shortly. Use the app to find it.
3	1523116150	1	distance walked = mined. 
3	1523116147	1	awesome, I am an investor.
1	1523093504	95	Nice just dropped 100k on Pokécoin
1	1523097061	27	I don't get it why OP's bullshit post is allowed and other more serious posts get removed...
2	1523106120	1	high shill / fluffly bunny factor
1	1523103863	3	I mine 50 pokecoins per day
2	1523109659	1	Not bad...I havent mined any yet, not sure why...GTX 1080 I CHOOSE YOU*throws GTX 1080 and it smashes on the floor*Damn!
2	1523108896	1	I mine Pokemon go very day, I mine Pokemon go!
1	1523095046	6	No we should organize society after Pokémons. 
2	1523098119	2	The society could be called Bitkemons
3	1523098830	0	and we will help each other money will be no object once we get enough people flipped over to using it we can do a coup and just have all kinds of stuff, and only trade with each other at those prices.
4	1523101852	1	tax breaks as well?
5	1523105805	-1	See this is how it works we ALL THROW OUR CHECKING ACCOUNTS INTO one big money cycling machine...... and anytime we want to buy something "reasonable" to what we used to buy ect, basically it would hope and depend on the super nice souls who contribute more than those who have less... tis a system that is anti greed.... you get a good feeling when you do something nice for someone so when theyre nice loans or whatever with ratings you can get pictures and information about where they used the money (it could be a heart warming thing) system abuse would be a reddit style thing you get up to a level and if you rip you get shammed, and by rip i mean going crazy just Lt tAMBO, YACHT, ect i mean it depends on your previous profile but we just want to remove the greed of money, this is a money where you use it like money but theres no reason to be greedylet me explain with bitcoin, i CAN be greedybut it is kind of hard... because  usually the market is pretty stable (not much as of late) but, I truly believe we can start by using our money freely with each other! like seriously what good is your money doing good in a checking account. I know my grandparents had 250k in the bank when he died, that money could have been working for him, starting some business... ect.. I feel like i have a million business ideas but not much capital, if i show progress on my idea maybe the investors could add more money if they see you making good progress... lending shouldnt be "i look at some FICO" number and hand you $5000.. no, show me receipts, show me work , show me progresss... the thing would need a central authority where during some point at a time if theres  a problem a random group of users help decide what to do, so theres no favortism among anyone... it has to be distrubed, this is so much like dogecoin but i want to call it REDDITASS because i would pay money (RA - REDDITASS -credits ect) on comments i want to downvote.... 
6	1523108820	1	> like seriously what good is your money doing good in a checking account. I know my grandparents had 250k in the bank when he died, that money could have been working for him, starting some business...So, what businesses are you running with bitcoin?

1	1523101275	5	Nintendo stock did fantastic after the games release until people realized that they had nothing to do with it lol. It's all Niantic.
1	1523106201	1	Pokemon-go to the polls!
1	1523102452	1	If you look at the price spike of the Nintendo stock after the Pokemon go release, yes you could ahve made a lot.
1	1523115373	1	pokemon already had a huge following, and they had phones. So it shouldnt even be in there.
1	1523120218	1	This seems like the wise course if action
1	1523080001	-7	[deleted]
2	1523094043	7	Well I did it anyway. Hope it works out for me!
3	1523095087	3	Good luck 🤞 
0	1523078478	151	So, we need to invest into Pokemon coin?
1	1523079282	43	POKÈ ico coming soon!
2	1523079700	6	The only ICO i actually would buy into. 
1	1523090032	14	Yes. Ive been waiting for Pokecoin.Why?I wanna be the very best. Like no-one ever was.Each Pokecoin to hodl hard, to trade them is my goal.Pokecoin, gotta hodl more.Etc etc.
0	1523085992	161	These numbers are made up. Computers took more than 14 years to become common household products. Internet was invented in the 70s. All the others aren’t technologies they are products. They don’t compare. 
1	1523087372	27	Plus, This is an entirely different time than when some of those products were introduced.      Everything new and promising will grow faster due to the internet's enormous reach.
2	1523106625	1	The only true statistic in that image is that 50 million was achieved faster and faster.... due to maybe.....POPULATION INCREASE ??A stupid image which shows how moronic most humans are.. that fact or logic matters little... let's look at pictures and let's look for some nonsensical patterns to make us all forget about reality and just suck on this fucken dummy which is really a cock!! for the rest of the time we sit here waiting for our shiny thing to be returned to us.....FCK HUMANS.. YOU DISGUST ME!
3	1523113566	1	*hug*I hope you feel better and have a wonderful day.
2	1523115611	1	Plus for every item on that list there are competitors /other products that don't follow the pattern .
1	1523100697	7	the www protocol was introduced around 1990 and the first graphical web browser came around 1993.You could also argue that cryptocurrencies were invented in 90s or even in the 80s as well. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency#History
2	1523111780	1	That would be the internet, which exists since 1981. 
3	1523112641	1	and cryptography existed since 2000 bc and cryptocurrency since 1983...
1	1523091946	10	The "Internet" in its modern form wasn't publicly available until the late 1980's / early 1990's. There's no point counting from the time it was available in some private research facility, right?Also, the first office computers really took off in the 1970's - 80's. Seeing the number of firms that quickly adopted it, especially in the financial sector - I wouldn't be surprised if 50 million workers alone used the computer by the mid 80's.
2	1523101151	5	Computers were invented in the 50s
3	1523109203	1	[1941 even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer\)).
4	1523109212	1	**Z3 (computer)**The Z3 was an electromechanical computer designed by Konrad Zuse. It was the world's first working programmable, fully automatic digital computer. The Z3 was built with 2,000 relays, implementing a 22-bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about 5–10 Hz. Program code and constant data were stored on punched film.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
3	1523105032	2	Oooh back in my day computers were the size of football fields and could only make noise. They didn't compute much because of how often we would run out of kerosene to power the fucking thing. At least it didn't have internet explorer though. And still it made me vote for Pat Buchanan. 
3	1523104557	1	Sure, the ones the size of rooms. Although that wasn't available to the common folk or firms. We're assuming that it took the computer 14 years from widespread availability to widespread adoption.
1	1523104107	0	C'mon household != Number of users.Internet was invented / actually became "the internet" in August 1991
0	1523092266	17	How many people currently use Bitcoin?
1	1523101102	18	7
2	1523113265	1	Damn were already on our way!
3	1523115170	1	Oh, hey /u/Hideouslyric didn't realise you were into bitcoin.That makes it 8.
2	1523104113	2	Hahaha
1	1523100170	12	Less than 100k
1	1523092798	6	There is no way to say how many people are using Bitcoin.
2	1523102597	0	You can see how many addresses with more than 0 balance
3	1523103763	8	>You can see how many addresses with more than 0 balanceThat says nothing.The only thing that counts as adoption is people using Bitcoin for the exchange of goods and services. (i.e. Spending it)
4	1523107925	1	Cross reference those addresses with yearly transactions
4	1523114590	1	That's just half of what it's good for. They should count as users once they _get_ the bitcoin, not just spend it.
5	1523114973	1	>That's just half of what it's good for.Do explain if you mean anything other than "store of value"."Store of value" is a meme conceived to get people to hoard bitcoin in an attempt to push the bubble higher. Bitcoin is completely useless as a store of value in practice.
4	1523106621	1	Well it's a maximum number of users. Likely inaccurate but still
5	1523110842	1	Not likely...absolutely 100% inaccurate
6	1523116988	1	Oh absolutely. But for these purposes if there's less than 50M addresses you can answer the question: not yet
7	1523117641	1	Fair enough
2	1523099748	-3	You can search that in Google.
1	1523110410	1	According to bitcoinmarketjournal.com (first result on google)> Currently, there are almost 28.5 million bitcoin wallets that hold more than 0.001 BTC according to data compiled by Bitinfocharts.com. However, most bitcoin users have several bitcoin wallets and use multiple wallet addresses to increase their financial privacy when transacting in bitcoin. Hence, the number of bitcoin users is likely less than 28.5 million.

2	1523116666	1	Bots aren't active? And that's still 320 million people. 
1	1523117139	1	not according to my twitter audit /s
0	1523087826	73	I hate to burst someone's bubble, but the internet from the early 1980s  preceded cell phones and took more than 15 years to reach  1  million users.
1	1523093984	7	I was about to say!Also, Bitcoin's nearly 10 years old now, so it would put us between imaginary internet and imaginary cell phone.
1	1523098940	20	The internet wasnt the internet til the 90s...prior to that it was arpanet.If by Internet we're referring to rudimentary TCP/IP then technically the internet goes back to the 60's.Also the image has nothing to do with inception. Its referring to user count.
2	1523108333	1	The *web* came out in the 90s, the Internet itself existed before that.  University networks were connected together which is what lead to the invention of the www and gopher.
3	1523113437	1	> University networks were connected together which is what lead to the invention of the www and gophergopher sounds like it would be a gay men's dating website. They always be digging in holes and packing mud. Gophers that is :)
2	1523106651	1	The EGP protocol was put into play in 1982,  and that was when the internet started --- when a default-free zone appeared with multiple separate networks represented by discrete autonomous systems were connected together,  and prior to 1990 it was no longer just Arpanet it was both Arpanet and NSFNet,   which was itself a combination of many networks.The chart is CLEARLY ordered by date of inception, as they're trying to show a progression that later technologies are adopted faster,  but  the progression might not be true...Also...  "Computers in 14 years"  is highly questionable,  since  Computers were around in the 60s and for more than   15 years there was no version of the computer inexpensive enough for home users to purchase.
3	1523109962	1	> The chart is CLEARLY ordered by date of inceptionWell, no. It clearly isn't. Electricity was discovered long before flight, and as were automobiles and telephones.
3	1523116524	1	Clearly ordered by date? So the car came after air travel?
4	1523118933	1	The first automobile was made in 1885,  but the first flight vehicle to carry a person through the air was in the late 1700s.
3	1523109023	1	It's ordered by time to inception not time of invention.   
3	1523108000	1	Technically, turing built the first computer during WWII. So 'the computer' was around for 40 years before the first PCs arrived.
4	1523108956	1	> turing built the first computer during WWII.Turing never built a computer.
4	1523111905	1	Turing's work _On Computable Numbers_ was instrumental to the invention of the first modern computer, or "Universal Computing Machine", but he wasn't the one that developed it. The first such computer was ENIAC, invented by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania, 1946. It was programmable and turing complete, which means that it could solve hypothetically any problem.But it depends on what you call a computer- if you stretch the definition a little, you can go further. Turing _did_ contribute to the design of Bletchley's Colossus Computers. They were programmable, but only within a strict set of parameters that related to cryptoanalysis- they weren't turing complete, hence they were not "Universal Computing Machines" and did not fulfil Turing's vision.Also worth mentioning is the Bombe, which which was an electro-mechanical computational device but not a computer and which _was_ inveted by Turing. It could solve specific mathematical problems in order to help crack the daily changes in the German Enigma codes, but it was not programmable and so not a computer as we know it today. Again, it depends on your definition but most today wouldn't tend to call anything that is not turing complete a computer, in modern parlance.There's also the Z3, the secret German computing device from 1941 destroyed in the bombing of Berlin. It beat the ENIAC to the punchline and was alledgedly turing complete, but only in theory and not so much in practice (for somewhta complicated reasons). A good summary is this quote by  Raúl Rojas, who studied the Z3 closely: "We can therefore say that, from an abstract theoretical perspective, the computing model of the Z3 is equivalent to the computing model of today's computers. From a practical perspective, and in the way the Z3 was really programmed, it was not equivalent to modern computers."Lastly, if you stretch the definition beyond just being turing complete, then the Bombe etc still aren't the first computers. If you did that, you'd have to include analogue computers in which case the winner would be Henry Babbage, who built a simplified version of (his father's) Charles Babbage's theoretical analytical engine's computing unit in 1888.^(N.B. This is the result of a wicked Wikipedia rabbit hole, feel free to correct me if I missed anything.)
1	1523108333	1	I'm guessing they meant "the web" instead of "the internet". The first web browser was released to the public in 1991 and I can easily imagine that it was up to 50m users by 1998.But yeah, the internet was around for at least 10 years before the web came along, depending on how you define it.
1	1523096844	2	It wasn't publicly available 'til early 90's though, so IMO we shouldn't count it as much. Same with half the stuff on there tho
2	1523103109	2	How early in the 90's? I'm an early 90's born kid and I always figured the internet was a thing from like '80
3	1523103700	1	The year that seems to have been the pinnacle of the '90's for some reason, 1994.
4	1523106373	1	'94 kids. Not too old to be disinterested in Pokemon and cartoon network, not too young to miss everything before it became too corporate.             
5	1523106582	1	I think he answered your question not guess your age
6	1523106904	1	ah
6	1523113779	1	Well, looks like it was a coincidence at the least :)  I was in the 4th grade in early 1994 and it seems a ton of stuff happened around that time.    
7	1523117825	1	Where I'm from it was the same but in our country it had a lot to do with the dissolution of the Soviet union, I'm assuming it affected the US a lot as well to be honest.
3	1523104045	0	August 91
4	1523106287	1	Damn, I'm nearly as old as the internet. That'll be cool to tell the grand kids.
2	1523099196	-3	lets start a bitcoin over and make it a coin that we own so were rich and tell people if they join us if we ever need to lean on each other we will. . youd have to have some kind of raiting system where you made micro loans person to person (think less than 100) for amount of time and then they get back a small token of however much tip back the person wants to give but should in a contract type chat be able to ask  for exteded time, but pay an interest or fee that the bower thinks is fair (not unreaonable) and then if they are a shithead over 100 REDDITASS coins then he will be downvoted, it wont take long before no one ever assist him. 
0	1523102647	7	2 glaring problems at first glance:1) survivorship bias 2)  this needs to be measured as a % of population. 50 million people meant a hell of a lot more 100 years ago than it does today. 
0	1523090034	10	Adoption rate should be a percentage of households not X million users, in order to get a more accurate view. If not, population growth will skew the results.
0	1523084096	15	Yep people seem to be adopting things with less value more quickly these days
1	1523104804	5	I don't think it's less valuable as much as more accessible. It doesn't cost several months salary to get on Pokemon go, while early fridges costed an arm and a leg.
0	1523094301	6	crap chart, shouldn't that be adjusted for relevant population?
0	1523106910	1	The global population reached 1 billion around 1800 and 2 billion around 1930.  Assuming a population of ~1.5 billion around the invention of cars, today's normalized equivalent is about 250 million.  Also, cars can cost a life's savings and Pokemon go is free.  This infographic is pretty much pointless.
0	1523095935	9	Doesn't really mean much. For one, population has increased and now that news and information travels instantly people are able to adopt to everything much quicker than ever before.

0	1523108192	1	[citation needed]
0	1523111525	1	Nobody stopped to consider the population numbers? For example, the Automobile was invented in 1885, world population was right about 1 billion. 50 million people today amounts to about 1% of the global population, this means that if 0.2% adopt bitcoin a year for 5 years you have your 50 million, not much of a big deal.

0	1523102661	2	So bitcoin is slower than cellphones and computers. Seems legit, considering the horrible transaction times

0	1523113523	1	So we should do a Bitcoin GO hard fork?
0	1523097815	2	Is anyone even playing Pokemon Go ?
1	1523116677	1	Fuck no, I remember when a strip of downtown was just full of people. They really fucked up on that game.

0	1523106602	1	What a stupid post. 
0	1523090756	3	There is no way to say how many people are using Bitcoin. 
0	1523102809	1	And some products won’t even get two users..
0	1523105650	1	Invest in Pikacoin! It supports the Lightning Network!
0	1523106606	1	Its as if at some point in the twentieth century there was a sudden drastic increase in the amount of people using things. Like a population spike or something. 
0	1523107491	1	I had no idea there were 50 million users of the ENIAC IIe back in 1960.
0	1523109788	1	It took a lot more than 7 years for the internet to become widely adopted and for significant layers to be built together to create what is currently perceived as the internet. They were using TCP/IP in Arpanet in the 60's .
0	1523111850	1	Wait...there aren’t 50 million people invested in bitcoin and crypto? 
0	1523114484	1	This is so stupid. Sure successful technology can take off very quickly now, however that does not mean bitcoin is going to be successful. 
0	1523117798	1	that pokemon go thing is bullshit they had years of pokemon branding and games prior
0	1523117856	1	In other words, cheaper things get adopted faster
0	1523117885	1	So buy Pokémon go 
0	1523120177	1	bitcoiners are so desperate.
0	1523120286	1	7 years to make an internet,  19 days to make pokemon go. I am so depressed right now.
0	1523093202	1	Bullshit I say. Computers have been around since early XX th century. Check IBM.
1	1523093548	-1	Yeah, but not a household computer. 
2	1523097038	2	It's still more of a memething than a statistic. There are many creative thoughts that could stem from it, (like "all these are inventions that improve communication and create a vivid global community", or "revolution in transport, information sharing, value transfer" or even "bitcoin spreads so fast thanks to evolving communication, it's an endless process we can be part of") but all we got is ambiguous "Bitcoin?" comment.Picture itself is not really related to bitcoin.
0	1523094834	1	Where's Myspace?
0	1523094986	1	This correlation rather than causation, not to mention that this a cropped jpeg with no citation.
0	1523097201	1	I think there are over 50 million downloads of a new IOS version within the first 24 hours. So any new app Apple bundles with an IOS version will reach that goal within less then a day.
0	1523102176	1	Is Pokémon go good after the recent updates or is it still a disaster 
1	1523109382	1	There's still no tracking.  There are raids,  where you fight one big (usually rare) pokemon at a gym and possibly get it.  But you need a group to bring them down, only have a few chances to get that pokemon. Oh and you have to buy raid passes to enter a raid,  which,  surprise, cost the in game currency. So you either have to save up all your coins you earn from having pokemon in gyms,  or spend real money to raid. Other than that they added weather based changes to pokemon,  so if it's raining or something in your area,  water type pokemon would have boosted stats when you catch them. Still no trading pokemon,  still no fighting other players,  still not a great game imo. I downloaded it this past week to just try it again and I've already deleted it. 
2	1523116782	1	Why am I not surprised. They haven't even fixed a launch issue.
0	1523110624	1	It's hard to put a timeline on full scale Bitcoin adoption imo because you are talking about fundamentally changing people's beliefs on what 'money' is.The thing is... people are extremely, extremely emotional about money.  Money, religion and romantic partners are probably the three things in life that most often cause people to absolutely lose their shit.Throw a lifelong viewpoint of let's say 50 years of believing something is a certain way, and it's easy to dismiss.  Which is why the young people I converse with have a much easier time accepting that Bitcoin is money and the older crowd likes to often claim scam, fake, play money, etc.I have no idea what full scale adoption looks like but I'm thinking 20-30 years after inception at this point simply because it's going to take an entirely new crowd/youthful people that haven't been programmed their entire life to believe that pieces of paper are more valuable than a resource with Bitcoin's properties.  Hopefully I'm wrong and it's sooner... but I see it taking another 10 years minimum.
