I have a mobile wallet that is in closed beta that is able to but it requires you to have sent btc from it first in order to fund the other side of the channel. This will all be way easier in the future with watcher nodes.

1	1523074942	3	Unlike in base bitcoin transactions, you must be online in order to receive Lightning transactions. For online merchants, this isn't a problem since they need to be online all time time anyway. For end users, who many go offline for days at a time, this is a problem. Receiving payments offline is not intended to be Lightning's strong point, and so Eclair's mobile wallet doesn't attempt to accommodate that use case at this time.In the not so near future, solutions will be devised to work around this protocol limitation, but there's unlikely to be any trustless solution to this within the next year. Maybe Eclair will implement the ability to receive payments when you are *online* within the next year or so. We'll see.

1	1523043312	7	Too sensitive to what?
