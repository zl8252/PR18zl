0	1523049373	256	That's shopped.  California license plates only allow 7 characters.
1	1523060038	117	You don't even have to count the letters. That plate is stretched out a mile long.
2	1523081312	44	Loooong loooong maaaann!!!!!
3	1523084896	7	This person references
4	1523095554	3	You didn’t even upvote him. Shame on you.
2	1523072428	22	There's special plates for Lambos.
3	1523073978	22	Fact. When I got my lambo it came with an extra wide plate. 
4	1523081985	2	It's the italian baseplate.
2	1523118085	1	He went long
2	1523118536	1	Californiaaaaaaaaaaa.
1	1523049818	10	Yes seems that you are right https://www.dmv.org/ca-california/special-license-plates.php
2	1523060928	33	also, you can tell by the way it is obviously shopped 
3	1523062645	13	Yes, I can tell from some of the pixels and from seeing quite a few shops in my time.
3	1523094961	0	And the fact that no one has made that much money
1	1523073430	2	The dimensions are fake, too
2	1523073632	2	Nope - you can get special shape ones for certain carsThose dimensions are typical for European cars, where we have longer, thinner number plates.Lamborghini doesn’t make a separate panel for the US market, so you have a choice of a more expensive plate, or your US plate looking silly on your $250k HyperCard... which do you choose?
3	1523074030	5	Neither, I can't afford a car
4	1523080242	5	Download one?
5	1523099955	1	You wouldn't download a car!
4	1523074109	2	It was a hypothetical question: clearly anyone with $250k to spend on a supercar is likely to spend the $200 for a plate that fits
5	1523075040	3	California does not let you make custom sized plates, they have [strict manufacturing requirements](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/?1dmy&urile=wcm:path:/dmv_content_en/dmv/pubs/plates/licenseplthistory). If you have a link that proves otherwise, you can share it.
6	1523082922	1	I just looked at arkansas, no speciality long plate here either.
1	1523075247	2	That's if you're poor. Money talks. :\^)
1	1523050658	1	My thoughts exactly. 
1	1523066645	1	Isn’t every state 7 characters?
2	1523087491	1	Some are 6 I think. 
2	1523096062	1	Florida is 6
2	1523107365	1	Iowa is 6
1	1523097727	1	KenM on license plates?
1	1523099147	1	Of course. The photoshopper didn't hodl so he still wishes that he could afford a Lamborghini.
1	1523104032	1	And some of those 7 characters can be “emojis”. Saw a car last week with a heart on the license plate.
0	1523064957	25	Lamborghini is getting so much business because of us! 
1	1523091329	5	Have you googled lambo sales in 2017? They hit a record in sales that year
1	1523076773	11	the people getting the most "business" from bitcoin investors is the welfare office
2	1523082192	6	yea, i am sure no one made any money off of an asset that went from under $1 to over $6,000. we all got rekt... 
3	1523082452	3	oh youre correctmy badi know a lot of people did make moneyi'm kinda a loser when it comes to making money, so i lost a bunch of money in buying bitcoinbut thats just my experienceyou are 100% correct, just cause i am a loser who failed, that doesnt mean that everyone isin fact, there are lots of success stories in the bitcoin community, just not me! (obviously)anyway, i do stand corrected. 
4	1523088359	3	the people who made a lot of money with little money to start with bought when bitcoin was down and hodled for many years. if you lost money because you bought 3-4 months(!) ago at ATH, what does it tell you?
4	1523083139	5	money comes and goes. just take it as a lesson. focus on your health, stay hungry, and work hard. you will succeed if you put in the time. don't be too hard on yourself.
4	1523104911	1	You did it wrong. You have to buy only what you can afford to lose on a regular basis for years.  You don't sell during dips. You buy more.  Right now is looking like an excellent time to buy.
1	1523075607	0	No they certainly aren't. 
0	1523050769	12	That doesn’t look like any license plate from any state I’ve ever seen. That and CA plates are 7 characters long. Nice photoshop though. 
1	1523050843	2	It's Friday humor :)
2	1523052435	3	Every Friday is April 1st on Reddit?
3	1523092958	3	>Every ~~Fri~~day is April 1st on Reddit~~?~~
0	1523067552	14	You can clearly see the mouse icon
1	1523090195	3	...and I scrolled up to look.
0	1523092459	3	Next : " DIDNT BUY" 
0	1523083886	4	Who cares if its not real? Its funny.
0	1523082098	2	The point of this post is not shopped or not. Just like how most people are ignoring the point of the market 
0	1523098073	2	shit post, no commentoriginal nonshopped image:https://mobile.twitter.com/TokyoCarGuy/status/917283318604992518/photo/1
0	1523100529	2	fake as my gf
0	1523112369	1	None of us bought a lambo, it’s an urban legend 
0	1523078721	2	Most likely Photoshopped by a European
0	1523050598	3	[deleted]
1	1523051306	11	No. Buy high sell low is how you do it 
2	1523051668	3	> Buy high sell low is how you do itlolyes, thats how I did itwhich is why i lost money on bitcoinand why i drive a toyotathis guy is driving a lambo, so he obviously did it the right way (NOT my way)Oh well.... I'm still a fool enough to HODL, but when bitcoin goes down to 1-2K by the end of the year, I'll be out EVEN MORE moneyoh well... for early adopters bitcoin was nice, for the rest of us, its just money down the toilet😭😭😭
3	1523058140	4	you sound like a friend of mine in 2013 just after the crash from 1000$ to 200$. he is still hodling and now doesn't have to complain about his losses anymore 
4	1523058982	3	i hope youre correctbut just because it rebounded in the past, doesnt mean it will againit might have peaked, and its all downhill from here.Oh well... you might be right (i HOPE you are!)For now, i just look at my bitcoin holdings, and weep when i see how much money i have lost.
5	1523096129	1	You are right, nothing is for sure but without the risk there are no gains. I hope everything works out for you like it did for me so far. Just keep strong and stop watching the price if possible. wish you all the best

3	1523064650	1	meh its a terrible car.  but awesome.
4	1523064782	3	yeah, i dont want a lambo myself, but i do wish that i hadn't lost so much in cryptobasically, investing in crypto (for me) has been about the same as flushing my hard earned money straight down the toilet!
5	1523065487	2	that sucks im sorry
6	1523065858	2	oh thanksnice of you to sayoh well...i knew it was a gamble when i went into it, although... i will admit, i was pretty sure i'd make money (not lose half of what i invested)oh well...live and learn, i guess.thanks for your kind words, though!
5	1523065867	2	I know how you feel, man. I was there in 2014. It wasn't fun. But, I'm so glad I held on and I only wish I had had the balls to buy more when it went to $200. So, yeah, if you believe in it, hang in there.
6	1523066023	0	i'm not sure i believe in it (not sure either way)but i already gambled and lost so much, might as well stick it out and hope for the bestthanks for the kind/supportive comment!
5	1523075725	2	What made you see it as an investment in the first place? You are essentially buying nothing. 
6	1523076634	2	oh, i did a lot of research, and all the "experts" were saying it would increase in value (even more so than stocks or other investments)so, i put money into buying BTC/ETH and LTCit did go up a bunch for a while (I started buying last november)but since end of December, its just gone down, down, downi lost half of my money that i put into cryptoif i had just burned half of that money that i put into bitcoin in the fireplace i would have at least gotten something from it (it would have warmed my house a little)as it is, i just lost a bunch of money, and everyone tells me to "hodl"oh course, its the same people who told me to "buy the dip" (which caused me to lose even more)anyway, i'm done with buying crypto (I have LOST way too much already)I will hodl onto what i have, but my guess is that I'll probably lose most of that remaining value this year (as I'm thinking that, most likely, bitcoin will go down to $1-2K)anyway... i'm not blaming anyone else, i was the IDIOT who thought i could invest wiselythe only thing i *succeeded* in doing, was losing a lot of money, very quickly, and getting nothing in return
7	1523077229	3	Do you realize that ZERO is the destination? Just a question of when. 
8	1523077550	2	no, i did not realize thati was thinking it would go up, not down to zerothen again, i obviously didnt know what i was doing, as i lost half my money (and got nothing in return)
9	1523077990	3	This Sub is pure entertainment for me.  I used to collect baseball cards as a kid thinking I'd get rich. Lots of money spent, zero profit. That is exactly what is happening here. Some people make money in promoting it, facilitating transactions, or pretending to be an expert, but most people will just lose whatever they put in. 
9	1523077810	2	You got bitcoins right?
0	1523050774	1	Smart people get to drive limited edition Lambos.Dumb internet memesters who fell for "le HoDL xD" get tears.As it should be.
1	1523076850	1	> Dumb internet memesters who fell for "le HoDL xD" get tears.hahaso true(i can confirm because i'm one of those idiots who bought bitcoin when the "experts" said it would go up in value)it didnti just lost half the money i put into it, and got nothing in return
0	1523053508	1	What Lamborghini is that

0	1523119215	1	Licence plate is real, Lambo is fake!
0	1523065288	1	Too many characters for a California special interest plate.https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/portal/ipp2/welcome
0	1523066612	1	Haters will say it's fake
1	1523071532	1	it IS fake
2	1523081759	2	or maybe YOU are just a hater
0	1523074011	1	I dont think we should be holding either.
0	1523107154	1	Not to mention the idiot spelled hold wrong.
1	1523111415	1	you are Bitcoinlandia here, we spell HODL.
