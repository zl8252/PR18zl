0	1523105115	0	How does a car get like this?
1	1523108221	1	It was driving on top of snow.  Then parked.  The snow melted everywhere but under the car, as it was shaded from the sun
1	1523114964	1	Air conditioner leak.
2	1523119428	1	Haha, parked the car with the a.c. on high and forgot about it...
1	1523109227	1	Obviously, the snow mound crept up on the car under it and then drew in a big breath of cold air to pump it up.
