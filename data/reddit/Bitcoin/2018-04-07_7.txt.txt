0	1523054636	16	The biggest news story is that Ben doesn't know the difference between a BMW and a Mercedes﻿
1	1523083155	9	Little Benny doesn't know the difference between his opponent's stance and a strawman.
0	1523055752	8	Who is this guy in the first place?
1	1523057320	4	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaeO5vkdj5xOQHp4UmIN6dw/videos
1	1523055887	3	Daddy.
2	1523055957	8	Aside from being (one of ?) your male parental units who is he why should we care?
3	1523056199	14	He's just a really popular conservative speaker and an incredibly well spoken and intelligent debater. 
4	1523056252	-7	Is he one of the pizza gaters?
5	1523056643	9	No. He's actually one of the few on the right who has been calling out all of that alt right conspiracy shit. Also he's a never-Trumper. I think. He speaks as if he is, at least.
6	1523066162	12	He didn't want Trump to be the pick. Now that Trump's in office, Ben will praise him when he does something good (upholding conservative values) and criticize him when he does something against those values (trade wars, etc.). 
7	1523076294	6	This is correct, and is what makes him more enjoyable to listen to.
8	1523076981	6	Agreed.
9	1523112337	1	His voice is like an amalgamation of twenty kids stuffed into a locker.
5	1523056489	1	Not that I know of?
3	1523066230	-3	Millennial Limbaugh of sorts? TBH i don't know him well, but of what i've seen I dislike him.
1	1523069917	-17	Some right wing troll/clown who spews conspiracy theories and fear mongering to stoke up views only one step above Alex Jones. 
2	1523082123	11	> Everybody I disagree with is a trollGrow up.
2	1523082249	6	wut?
2	1523071758	5	Basically, Ben Shapiro is the Vitalik vs CSW (who would be like alex jones in this scenario).Vitalik is actually very intelligent, like Ben Shapiro. And he will spin you in circles talking quickly and eloquently about vast topics (rich statefulness lol).Unlike CSW/Alex Jones, their arguments tend to make sense, or at the least sound logical and appealing.Im not a fan of Ben, but I respect that he puts a lot of thought into his positions and attempts to back them with data. Sometimes its misconstrued, but really who doesn't do this? Even scientists struggle with bias and they are formally trained to design around it.
3	1523072044	-13	> VitalikDon't even compare that clown Ben to someone whose actively created a billion dollar industry and a genius whose contributing positively to society. Ben is just a troll who get's off "Triggering" people and stoking fears and creating drama for youtube views. Sure he's more well educated than that hillbilly Alex Jones but that's not saying much. 
4	1523082388	6	You rotten stinking liar.
4	1523114733	1	> Don't even compare that clown Ben to someone whose actively created a billion dollar industry and a genius whose contributing positively to societyYeah? Well how was that positive contribution to society working out when he was scamming investors for a [quantum computer that he admitted was mathematically infeasible?](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/buterins-quantum-quest/)When you judge people you have to judge them based on their actions and not just their words and vitalik has a past history of shady actions. This is not to say that I'm not glad that he's working on ethereum he seems like an incredibly bright young guy and I'm glad that he's funneling his personal labor into something that is not scammy, and open source. Even though the ethereum ICO was kind of scammy.Vitalik has a issue with over expressing his confidence. One can reasonably argue that this emotional exuberance is beneficial because it allows him to hyper-focus on his projects. Maybe he really thought his pseudo quantum computer could be a reality and he wasn't purposely defrosting investors but one cannot argue that he didn't take money for something that was mathematically impossible, intentions aside.The reason I'm telling you this is to caution your over bounding confidence of the guy. He's good but he's not as good as you think he is. I don't dislike him but I'm not sucking his dick either.> is just a troll who get's off "Triggering" people and stoking fears and creating drama for youtube viewsI think that he can be in times because he's human but I think that most of the time he's not purposely trolling he's just defending a deeply entrenched ideological position. Trolling implies fucking with people for no reason other than fucking with people.
0	1523057605	7	looks like this was a sponsored video so not a direct endorsement but at least we know that Ben being a credible guy would not accept sponsorship from things he doesn't believe in so that at least means he somewhat supports bitcoin
1	1523066043	5	He's smart. Very. And I think (I mean, who knows) that he only has sponsors he believes in.

3	1523096310	1	My guess is you’re projecting. 
3	1523097782	1	You can disagree with a smart person’s political views and not need to attack their intelligence. 
0	1523073643	3	Wtf I hate bitcoin now?
1	1523075253	5	Totally ruined. 
1	1523098028	1	Hmmm yeah maybe get out. Bitcoin is very libertarian. Of which I’m ok with, but understandably some are not.
2	1523098153	0	Ben Shapiro is not a libertarian 
3	1523107563	1	He believes in small government though 
4	1523108200	1	But not in the case of personal freedom. Financially liberal but socially authoritarian
5	1523116295	1	As far as I’m aware he doesn’t think churches should be forced to accept gay marriages, and he thinks drugs legalisation should be decided by the states. While I may slightly disagree with him, that’s hardly “socially authoritarian”, especially when considered to the Alt Right and the Regressive Left.

2	1523083258	2	You can be against liberals (and especially neoliberals) *from the left.*
2	1523098488	1	Ben Shapiro is not a liberal lefty. Have you even heard of Ben Shapiro? 
3	1523099486	1	[deleted]
4	1523099914	0	Your post is as clear as mud. You said “you are against the liberal left like him” What does anti semitism have to do with anything you nutter. 
5	1523100013	0	[deleted]
6	1523100090	1	So your saying I’m an anti Semite because I don’t like Ben Shapiro? 
7	1523100194	0	[deleted]
8	1523100207	0	Lmao. Some trail, you’ll actually find there is one comment and it’s about a smear campaign, in which people who disagree with policy are not anti Semitic. The irony of this seems to be lost on you. 
2	1523088387	0	I’m sorry if your referring to my comment history then you clearly haven’t read it. 
3	1523099713	1	[deleted]
4	1523099997	1	I said criticising Israel does not make you anti Semitic. Is that not true?
5	1523100082	1	[deleted]
6	1523100165	1	I have never posted anything about terror. Your out of your mind. My posts can all be read so I don’t know why you’d claim that. Maybe up your prescription. 
2	1523084194	-2	From the little I have watched of him, he comes across to me as angry and aggressive. Regardless of his stated ideologies, I think his demeanor reflects poorly on him.
3	1523089137	3	He is also an illogical bullshitter. If this is who the American right hold up as their intellectual Titan it speaks volumes. In the land of the blind the one eyed man is king. 
3	1523089770	-1	[deleted]
4	1523098309	2	He’s really passionate about all sorts of things. Transgender rights he hates, abortion he passionately hates. Economically libertarian and socially authoritarian, otherwise known as retarded. 
5	1523112420	1	You're the hero we need, but not the hero we deserve
0	1523061782	1	So, some guy sitting on a bed gave a paid read for BitIRA, and kind of mentioned what bitcoin is...kind of. Cool.
