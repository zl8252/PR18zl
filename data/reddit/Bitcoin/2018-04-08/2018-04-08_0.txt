2	1523189304	19	ICO (Initial *Cow* Offering)Sounds like an offering to the Goddess of Crypto to bless us HODLers with a *bull* run! ;)
3	1523195027	2	cow run
3	1523194862	0	Love it! 
2	1523198554	1	Indecent children's offense?
2	1523202871	1	May I interest you in in some Goatsecoin? https://goatse.cx/ 
1	1523188907	17	also in jail but ayy
2	1523192641	8	when you go full Austin Powers and create your own network of spy-hookers, people tend not to like it... unless you are Cambridge Analytics and only if you don't brag about it! 
1	1523175055	67	I'd read it to my little man. "Dad, what does 'fuck them all mean?""Well I'm not sure, but Metallica said 'Kill Em All' so I suppose that's the way to go" *cocks shotgun*Sober edit: I was full whisky mode when I wrote this, I have NO idea what I meant. I'm leaving it though.
2	1523180936	22	Read that back a few times 
3	1523184819	16	I am still confused
3	1523194913	12	I'm not even sure what I meant myself. I'm just now waking up after a night of marinating my liver in whisky. I'm horrified people upvoted this.
4	1523201596	1	I'm jealous. When I drunk comment I tend to be an asshole, yours was beautiful 
2	1523185888	8	I don't get it 🐐
2	1523190426	3	What
3	1523207310	1	Yes.
2	1523188078	10	Sounds like something I'd come up with in middle school. Shotgun sounds and all. Doesn't need to make sense, as long as there's a shotgun and some swearings, my friends would laugh.
3	1523194836	1	Hah. I wrote that in the wee hours blackout drunk, and I'm just now waking up to the responses. What a shitshow.
4	1523201915	1	I enjoyed it.
1	1523190783	5	That's a tough sell for a murderer
1	1523192688	6	He likes to get shit on
2	1523195395	7	To be more accurate, he likes young girls to shit in his mouth (for anyone curious about this, watch the documentary, apologies about the spoiler).  
3	1523197032	1	Viewer discretion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5elAr2s6Gno
3	1523207102	1	He defn payed some piss poor locals to say whatever he wanted them to say. 
1	1523191866	1	More like a “how to life” tome. 
2	1523198618	1	Yeah, see... the part I don't like about it is all the sloppy seconds.
1	1523200377	1	"The really horny bull" will be one of the best selling children's books by 2020, I guarantee it
1	1523201314	1	He definitely got this from a Hallmark card.....
1	1523190520	1	My dad used to tell me this quote all the time when I was young.
1	1523197634	1	These are paid promotions and you idiots eat it up 😂😂 no wonder the sucide hotline has to be posted for you losers 
1	1523180819	-1	will never buy it for my children
0	1523168413	639	He won't be fucking too many cows post 2020.
1	1523171165	152	He said he would likely delegate the dick eating to a secretary and make it last several years
2	1523187539	25	Or get a hooker to shit on it before he goes to eat it. I heard he's into that. 
3	1523189716	16	>Sources familiar with McAfee's scat fetishes confirmed for us that he is into that
1	1523169431	56	He has fuc ked all of his followers cows. Now it’s time to find new cows. 
2	1523171923	41	He is **literally** going to eat his own dick.
3	1523177018	47	Anybody who thinks he will actually follow through is just delusional.
4	1523184160	10	Lab grown dick clone.
4	1523181361	2	A man can dream can’t he?
5	1523183908	7	It is speculated that he has a pet turkey named dick.
6	1523184634	4	I was guessing a chicken... Turkeys are rather large and would be a lot to eat on your own. 
7	1523186250	3	Would a chicken live that long though?
8	1523207189	1	I was wondering that myself actually... I Googled it and the average life span of a chicken is 7-8 years. There's about a 3-4 year span between when he said it and when the time line would be done so well within eating range. Incidentally, I saw something recently about how silicon valley's tech elite are all raising chickens so it kinda adds up. 
7	1523190145	2	So he's going to eat his cock?
8	1523206446	1	It would seem so 
5	1523189084	1	If that's your dream, you should see a therapist.
3	1523186376	2	He's going to suck it.
4	1523198767	1	Yeah, well, he did run a yoga retreat for a while... 
3	1523204444	1	What has to happen again for this to go down?
1	1523191087	7	Why is that? Honest question. 
2	1523191767	52	It's a joke. McAfee has famously made a bet to "eat his dick on national television” if bitcoin wasn't worth more than $1M per coin by the end of 2020.
3	1523191943	29	per fucking coin? He is either a) literally insane or b) didn't really mean it. 
4	1523192088	58	Hmmm if you read about his life up to this point, I'd lean heavily towards option a.
5	1523193637	29	That's how you know how bad things are here.  We are non-ironicallyposting fucking McAffee tweets about bull runs. 
5	1523193037	7	That's why I put it first.
5	1523195209	-3	That doesn't mean he's wrong.
4	1523196482	4	Literally the only way bitcoin could be worth a million per is if the US dollar inflated to Zimbabwe levels of worthlessness. 
5	1523197769	1	2020 will be the end of the Republican regime, so that is plausible.
4	1523195623	1	He's going to squirrel out of it. He's not below doing shit like, "here I bought 1 btc for $1MM (from his wife or a friend)". But in a more general sense, he's definitely on the a) camp.
4	1523201229	1	He's insane for a number of reasons, but a 100 fold increase in bitcoin's price over the next ~3 years wouldn't be the craziest thing that's ever happened.Of course, it could also drop down to $100 by the end of 2020.
4	1523199429	1	It's not going to happen by 2020, but I wouldn't say it's impossible at some point. I remember being amazed when the value of 1 bitcoin crossed the $1 mark. That was 7 years ago, and we're at $7000 today. A lot of people think bitcoin is over, but I think it's still early days. The last Bitcoin won't be mined until the year 2140, or 122 years from now. Only time will tell.
5	1523199728	1	Yeah, but by then, $1 mil in 2018 won't be worth $1 mil.
3	1523195221	1	the bet was referring to "bircoin", not "bitcoin".
4	1523196824	2	> bircoinThat was a typo. The context was clearly talking about bitcoin. He's clarified in subsequent tweets [like this one](https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/981589496431980544).
5	1523196831	2	[**@officialmcafee**](https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/)> [2018-04-04 17:49 +00:00](https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/981589496431980544)> @BobbyPegs I will not have to eat my dick. Please God, think about it for a while. $1 million is the absolute lower limit of Bitcoin's price possibility at the end of December 2020. More likely $3 mil. People are not factoring in the depreciation of Fiat as crypto moves in to replace.----^This ^message ^was ^created ^by ^a ^bot[^[Contact&#32;creator]](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=jasie3k&amp;subject=TweetsInCommentsBot)[^[Source&#32;code]](https://github.com/janpetryk/reddit-bot)[**^[Donate&#32;to&#32;keep&#32;this&#32;bot&#32;going]**](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/80YvGrbq35)[^[Read&#32;more&#32;about&#32;donation]](http://np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/7pwo2m/heres_an_interesting_one_league_source_says/dsmirtu/)
1	1523183116	12	It's a metaphor, the cows are his Twitter followers.
1	1523198698	1	Just like he said he didn't kill that guy in Belize, I'm sure he'll cut off his dick when that other thing doesn't happen.
1	1523178770	5	He will... he’ll be using a strap-on
1	1523176743	3	😂😂
1	1523188182	1	I've gotta follow this guy on Twitter
0	1523170610	250	Where's the part where cow had to eat it's own dick 
1	1523177592	30	Funny how he raised the bar from 500K to 1M. Should he do D O U B L E S U C C now?
2	1523191945	5	Even 500K was a stretch, all optimistic trend lines point to ~400K.
3	1523195504	11	> 400Kgood to have some realism 
4	1523200345	1	It's basic economics, take any useless shit that has a transferability feature, attach scarcity to it and it's price will grow over time in a predictable manner, bitcoin has followed it's trend line ever since 2010, don't see any reason for it to change in the next 3. It doesn't matter what the medium is, it could be post stamps, gold, paintings, runescape party hats, world of warcraft rares, they all follow the same economics.
5	1523211127	1	B A S I C E C O N O M I C S
3	1523195624	7	> ~400K. That's 126.85°C or 260.33°F.
1	1523182544	6	Uhh reference?
2	1523183750	23	John made some wildly retarded bet that he would eat his own penis. Made the bet on twitter about bitcoin, iirc. I bet you could find it on google.
3	1523185251	4	Here you go: https://cointelegraph.com/news/john-mcafee-doubles-down-predicts-1-mln-btc-bets-his-dk-on-it
3	1523185388	3	He made that bet about $10,000; and y'all acted this same damn way, and he was right.Then he bumped it up to a mill and now you're all forgetting that he's already won.
4	1523185753	13	Oh I got no dog in this fight (don’t even own Bitcoin I just love the tech and commodity trading aspect of it). Just saying that it was dumb to bet it will hit a mill, and obviously the whole dick cannibalism was a meme. I think Bitcoin will hit a pretty stable point in a few years, maybe even in a couple decades, but I don’t think it will be a mill, or even that close.I will say though, that if a Bitcoin is a mill in my lifetime, find me and I will eat both of my own legs.
5	1523193090	8	If bitcoin is worth a mill in my lifetime I'll eat my dick for 10 bitcoin
6	1523210953	1	I’ll eat *your* dick for 9 bitcoin and give you 3. Deal?
5	1523208505	1	One guy promissed to eat his dick if his prediction wont become truth; I saw the post where the second one promissed to eat one of his bowl (btw he hasn't did it as far as I know); now your statement that you will eat your legs, if... And all this "if" based on predictions of future rates of virtual currencies! What are u a cannibals??? LoL
4	1523188353	5	You sure? I thought it as half a mil and then he bumped it to a mil. 
2	1523191277	5	Currently 12% behind schedule:https://fnordprefekt.de/
1	1523191456	3	im sure i'm missing something... but cows don't have dicks. they are all girls.
2	1523199128	1	Cow can be used in place word cattle regardless of the sex of the cattle in question according to Websters.
3	1523205109	1	Sick fucks, Websters.
1	1523207610	1	Is the cow should eat a dick now if btc wont reach some point? Did I miss something? LOL
1	1523197128	1	Cows don't have dicks bruh
1	1523195446	0	>Where's the part where cow had to eat it's own dick  cow can eat own tit.bull can eat own dick.

1	1523193449	16	It was worth scrolling down the page for this comment alone!
2	1523199610	1	Ayy, I, too, watched Gringo. 
1	1523193780	25	m'nure.

0	1523170467	195	Film reference, quote from [Colors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUzip4dyOx4) ...**updated version**... The young troll says to the old troll -"Lets run down to Reddit and fork one of the coins." The old troll says -"Lets walk down and fork them all"
1	1523187807	17	Holy shit. Thanks for the blast from the past. 1988. God damn it I'm getting old. 
2	1523196377	4	What's crazy is the song used for that movie is Ice Tea, who also plays a cop on television.
3	1523199375	1	Special Victims Unit, where bagholders file complaints about their wah wah coins.
1	1523192698	15	Have never seen colors, but I know it was also said in the sopranos somewhere
2	1523195382	4	Colors is the best urban gang movie ever made. You should watch it when you have time. 
3	1523197129	1	One of the funniest things about Colors is that the ginger nerd in the movie “Can’t Buy Me Love” is a Crip in Colors... 😂 [You Shit On My House! ](https://youtu.be/7Czo_QT_8zc) 
2	1523195582	2	Season 1 episode 6 I believe. Tony says it to his uncle Junior to encourage him to spread the wealth.
1	1523194713	3	Sopranos omagehttps://youtu.be/zXYu7E8HHxo
1	1523193569	3	Thx, came to say the same. Killer soundtrack by Ice-T btw. 
1	1523195811	1	I'm old. I've heard this same saying since forever
1	1523200501	1	Also said in "Billions."
0	1523170556	44	Would have been funnier if he said "Patience Yong man"
1	1523173206	7	No you
1	1523184753	3	Patience grasshopper 
1	1523173313	5	Patience Young Padawan.
2	1523187911	3	This is outrageous, it’s unfair.
0	1523171112	93	...the old one says-"let's have them sit on a hammock and shit through a hole into our mouths".
1	1523177977	21	Yeah "Gringo" should be required watching for anyone even remotely interested in John.
2	1523179126	9	He's certainly eccentric... I did find his 'I don't fucking know how to uninstall the antivirus' YouTube video funny.
3	1523188166	4	I think he's a little bit beyond 'eccentric'.
2	1523191399	7	It was interesting until everyone in the video said they just made all that shit up for money 
1	1523188529	3	I'll bet his breath smells like shit
2	1523191379	-3	Says the guy with halitosis.
1	1523172453	2	Clashic
0	1523184766	229	Remember that time John McAfee murdered his neighbor?That was right around the time he fled prosecution for the underaged sex slaves he was keeping in the house where he cooked and sold drugs.Why the fuck are people still listening to this nutbag?
1	1523191266	58	What a character. Founded the McAfee Antivirus Program. Arrested in Belize for unlicensed drug manufacturing and owning an unlicensed weapon (didn't see anything about the sex slaves). Apparently he hired his security to kill the neighbor after he poisoned McAfee's security dogs. He then fled to Guatemala and pretended to have heart attacks so that his lawyer could get him deported to US instead of back to Belize. Belize then sold off his stuff and McAfee's house burned down "under suspicious circumstances". He also tried to run for president in the 2016 election as a Libertarian (He was born in England so I don't know if he would have qualified in the first place).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McAfee
2	1523192244	37	Also 3 out of 7 women he lived with tried to murder him.
2	1523199819	1	How can you give a run down of the movie Gringo without mentioning sitting under a hammock and having girls shit in your mouth through the holes?
2	1523201858	1	Natural born citizen just means you were born as an American, not that you were born in America.Since he was born on a US army base to an American father, it’s almost certain he is natural born.
3	1523205253	1	I see, must've misunderstood what it meant.
2	1523198790	1	There's some fucked up stuff there but I'd be happy to live a life half as interesting as his.
1	1523191138	206	Well... To be fair. 1. *He* didn't murder his neighbor. He paid one of his bodygaurds in Belize $5,000 to murder his neighbor, who was distracted and door left unlocked by another one of John's girlfriends who left the bar with the man. He wanted the neighbor dead for posioning his dogs, who were vicious and prevented the public from traversing the beach on John's property. The neighbor was fond of walking to the bar like a few hundered meters from his & John's homes down the beach. 2. The girls weren't underage (in Belieze, at his 'heart of darkness' property), but were prostituting themselves.All indicated John had no interest in traditional sex and had a hammock with a hole cut in it and was really into poop stuff. You can fill in the blanks...3. The GRU that raided his compound didn't find any drugs. They found what they believed to be an amphetimine but it did not test as such.Just months prior the lab on his property was being used for legitimate research. We know this because he drugged and raped the researcher who partnered with him when she quit. **Edit for further accuracy** - it didn't test as anything that could be *prosecuted as a drug in Belize*. It very well could have been an ananlouge or RC. There was DNA evidence left at the scene of his neighbor's murder. There isn't a single DNA lab in Belize, and they only recently had their first conviction partially reliant on fingerprint evidence. The bodygaurd implicated in the murder by both John's former caretaker & bottom bitch has since also fled the country after attempts on his life. 3. He fled the country (Belieze) before he could be questioned about the murder. EXIF data (lol) from photos that accompanied an article done by Vice led to his arrest in Guatemala for sneaking across the border.Per his admission he faked a heart attack to avoid the narrow window Belieze had to demand his extridition before it could be blocked by petition. He was then summarily tossed on a plane back to the US as Guatamala didn't want the headache of jailing him. -----So yeah, total piece of shit, but at least be accurate as to why. **Edit 1: additional context**It's scary to see how many people here defend the man. Cryptocurrencies are a great combo of the man's dual lifelong interests of making a quick buck off the technically ignorant & starting a cult. Don't forget before he went all Colonel Kurtz in Belize he spent a decade or so as a Yogi leading 'free' retreats at his former compound in Colorado... Where the locals claimed he was more or less trying to start a cult. ..and that before he was bought out his anti virus company was by all accounts a cult of personality that revolved around pleasing John & had an internal culture akin to that of like... Atari in the 70's. But yeah take the man's advice on stuff. He's clearly a straight shooter. No BS. Nope, not at all.  **Edit 2: TL:DR timeline of John**- McAfee Security, cult like sexually charged corporate atmosphere. Took buyout when he was deemed to be unfit to be part of expanding the company & going public.- Built massive yoga retreat in Colorado, locals claimed he was starting cult. Numerous failed social network startups  during this period. Wrote 5 books on meditation and acted as Yogi. Got bored, closed down and auctioned off after he lost (or perhaps not, depending on when asked) 90% of his worth 2008-2010.  - moves to expat island Paradise in Belize, builds beach compound. Gets bored. Partners with researcher. - buys large tract of land in inner Belize. Notes that he is only white Westerner in an area that is like 13% of country. Insanely high murder rate where 97% of cases are unsolved. Builds compound with lab. Cultivates harem of local women and a security force of the worst local toughs by purchasing loyality in an area of the world where poverty is endemic and life is cheap. Buys loyality and blind eye of local police. Security murders at least one other gang leader at his behest as John fears the man intends to attack him. Fleas that compound after being raided by national Gang Retaliation Unit, who is feared and seen as uncorruptable. - returns with entorage to peaceful expat island paradise compound. Entorage and bizzare paranoia prove unpopular here. Culminates in posioning of dogs and murder of also expat neighbor. - flees country like coward, concocts bizzare paranoid story of persecution. Using $, purchased influance, and a faked heart attack to get tossed back to US. - moves to middle of nowhere, again seems concerned with buying the blind eye of local sherrifs. Gets DUI while carrying several guns. - runs as libertarian cantidate. Loses to Johnson, begins to rehab image by commenting in the press on security issues, which inexplicably the press still affords him credibility on. - parlays this rehabed image into shilling crypto. Some of you guys take this fucking nut seriously. The cycle continues. 
2	1523194875	19	Wow he got boned by EXIF data? That's some rookie shit
3	1523195406	10	One of dozens of [sources] (https://www.wired.com/2012/12/oops-did-vice-just-give-away-john-mcafees-location-with-this-photo/) from the time. World class security expert caputured in *Guatamala* due to EXIF data from an iPhone 4. 
3	1523200822	1	Yeah, that's something Vice is not going to be able to live down anytime soon.
4	1523203892	1	It would be emberassing for like, The Intercept maybe, to out a whistleblower in such a stupid way. Vice isn't really a professional newsgathering/reporting service though... Moreso vloggers in weird and dangerous locales.Still think the most embarrassing bit is the cybersecurity expert not sending someone to pick up the journos, checking their gear, having them ship back trackable devices and giving them burner devices with physically removed/disabled GPS chips.This is a notoriously paranoid man who was at that point a fugitive. If not that the fact that he let them take pictures without thinking to say at the very least "hey, let me see that thing real quick and check the settings"Again this is a man that is considered an "authority" on security who publicly claimed he personally was able to circumvent the encryption of iOS duing the San Bernardino fiaso who either took at their word or didn't think to check the OpSec of fucking Vice Media. It's beyond embarrassing.  
2	1523195492	8	Huh...poop hole hammock...haven’t heard that one before.
2	1523196066	6	Love your comment. Thanks for that timeline. 
3	1523199774	1	No problem, thanks for reading!Before the showtime doc (now on netflix) I didn't take the guy seriously but found him amusing as a truely excenteic tech millionaire. Almost turned it off because the first few minutes started to feel like a hit-piece. It wasn't. In the least... Those who doubt my timeline presented are free to watch it and then check the sources from the time periods in question.The story it tells seems the closest we're ever going to get to the truth.  John refuted the charges levied against him in Belize as a corrupt government intent on nothing more than killing him, never addressed the actual claims. John refuted the document by claiming the producers were in league with a rival gang that wanted him dead. He said that showtime was free to just pay him $500 million to avoid litigation on it. To my knowledge he has yet to sue... Wonder why... All accounts in the doc come from people who were in his employ, given freely without coerscion or compensation. They directly implicate him of the following:1. The drugging and rape of a Harvard educated American researcher working in his Orange Walk compound's lab2. Ordering an assult on a rival gang leader that resulted in the man's death. 3. Paying for and arranging the circumstances of the execution of his neighbor in San Pedro, who was a retired American contractor.
2	1523202292	1	>It's scary to see how many people here defend the man.Cryptocurrencies attract a lot of people who believe that making money has nothing to do with morality.  They also, not coincidentally, attract a lot of people who recognize the pumps-and-dumps and the other forms of market manipulation that the crypto market is rife with, but believe that they're smart enough to ride the pump and get out before the dump.  I feel like a lot of McAfee's defenders are thinking 'yeah, this guy isn't credible, but I can make a bunch of money off McAfee's shitcoins if idiots buy his bullshit, so let's keep promoting him'.  It's a vicious cycle.
3	1523205353	1	100% agree with your points. McAfee admits freely to shilling for hire yet this shit is upvoted to the top of the BTC sub.Either everyone here thinks they're smarter than the markets or a lot of people take it seriously. Either way it doesn't look great to the general public nor does it help the long term legitimacy, and thus valuation, of BTC to so highly promote such a crass, stale, and oft used anecdote tweeted by such a dubious character. This is /r/wallstreetbets tier content. Though given the commonalities between the way they worshiped Skhrelli and many are adulating McAfee here I'm guessing there is more overlap there than would be... Desirable. 
2	1523209944	1	>We know this because he drugged and raped the researcher who partnered with him when she quit.Hm, I find that hard to believe, I heard from a reliable source recently that he had no interest in traditional sex and had a hammock with a hole cut in it. :)
2	1523199029	1	Obviously he HAD to be a libertarian. They're all closet McAffees
2	1523194533	0	I have no idea if that is accurate but if someone poisoned my dogs that would be a declaration of war.
3	1523195848	9	There is far more to the story... These weren't pets, they were trained attack animals and a component of his security countermeasures. The neighbor and others had filed numerous complaints with local police and government regarding them. They were a public nusiance. It was a case of 1 asshole who thought he was above the law vs a peaceful beachfront community.No action was ever taken by police or local government as John had donated thousands in equipment and donations to the local police. They turned a bind eye to his actions. There wasn't much recourse left for the neighbor or larger community, not justifying it, but it's not like John ran next door in killed the guy in an act of passionate revenge. He waited till the next day, paid 5k to one of his shooters, and enlisted one of his girls to lure the man into a trap. He paid for a hit and premeditated the trap to allow for the execution.  There is a huge difference there.
4	1523196461	3	Tough to say what really went down but Belize isn't a place where I would trust the court system.
5	1523197872	1	97% of murders go unsolved. The killer left DNA at the scene but Belize doesn't have a national crime lab with the ability to analyze such things. The story I recounted above comes directly from independent accounts given by the caretaker of his compound that transfered the money and places the killer at the scene at the time of the murder and John's main girlfriend who confirmed above along with adding the part about using the other girl as bait/ to set the stage for the execution. The killer himself gave a rather unconvincing denial. Claimed to have been at a wedding in a different part of the country that night despite multiple indepent sources placing him on the island, and himself has since fled Belize as well. It's a rather cut and dry affair really.  
6	1523198118	1	I mean John probably ordered the guy dead but what I'm saying is maybe his neighbor was a gangster and John felt the need to protect himself. Maybe John is gangster himself. Gangsters kill eachother. 
7	1523198915	1	When he lived in Orange Walk the guy he had his security staff "put a scare into" that they accidentally killed was indeed the leader of a rival gang. His neighbor he had executed in a peaceful expat island beach community of San Pedro was Gregory Faull,  a retired American contractor from Maimi in his 50's. He main gripe with McAfee was the attack dogs and literal gang members from Orange Walk Town McAffee brought back with him scaring the hell out of tourists and residents by you know, looming menacingly with high caliber rifles 24/7 on an otherwise normal peaceful beach...  Not exactly a criminal mastermind. Dude literally was just pissed that people couldn't walk on the beach anymore. 
8	1523199543	1	The human race is just a collection of gangs. 
2	1523196521	0	The saga continues, Wu Tang
2	1523194159	-14	So much for innocent until proven guilty. Has the man actually been convicted of any illegal acts? Has anything been proven without reasonable doubt?And furthermore his sexual fetishes/hangups are his own business. No one cares about your puritanical bullshit.
3	1523196588	6	In a western nation, yes. - The killer left DNA evidence at the scene. Belize has no DNA labs to test & use this to solve the case. - the caretaker and paymaster of his island compound transferred $5,000 to the account of the bodygaurd implicated in the murder the morning before it occurred. Furthermore the caretaker was called by the bodygaurd the pick him up near the murdered man's house and bring him back to John's compound between 3 and 4 am the night of the murder. Multiple girlfriends assert the bodygaurd being present at the home in the morning and not having been there the previous evening. - Johns main girlfriend attested to the facts of the above independently, and added the bit about the other girl being used to distract the man/ set the stage for the assaination. - the bodygaurd, when confronted when the above, was curious who had said such thing, smirked and gave a very unconvincing denial. He has since fled the country after claiming there had been several attempts on his life. His aliabi for the night of the murder was a wedding in a different part of the county, Despite numerous witnesses placing him at John's house the morning after the murder. - John fled the country never facing questioning. He bragged about this. His bragging got him caught. He never addressed the praticulars of the murder but instead concocted a story about the entire government of Belize wanting him dead due to his failure to bribe a key prominant national political party via donations. **Edit**I also don't give a shit about his fetishes. I do care very much that at least one very credible US citizen claims that he drugged and raped her. It also establishes a pattern of credibility in relation to those speaking of his actions & behaviour. That is a very odd & specific thing for all parties asked to mention.I don't give a fuck about what he and other consenting adults do with each other but woman after woman independently saying he had them shit in his mouth doesn't leave a lot of room to doubt the veracity of their accounts. It's a very unique and personally identifiable trait and therefore relevant when considering their statements and the truth about what happened in Belize. 
1	1523194624	9	Thank you.   I'm surprised this sub continously glorifies this person, who clearly has some fucked up moral values, just because he shares the same beliefs in crypto.   
2	1523201624	1	I don't really know anyone who glorifies this person? I've been a daily participant here for many years and the general consensus amongst bitcoiners as that this guy is a fucking psycho.Sure he might appeal to some of our economic theories on bitcoin but I think that most people are able to recognize the vast Insanity that this man deals with.
1	1523204394	1	Didn’t his negligence also result in the death of his nephew? 
1	1523189656	-3	Hey look a detective from the case 
2	1523193661	3	Yeah OP is a bit pompous but McAfees history is dubious at best
1	1523189551	-6	That's badass bro
1	1523200008	1	Because he's lived a much more interesting like than you have 
1	1523191420	-2	Same reason why youre here commenting.
2	1523192453	13	Because I saw it on /r/all and came here to remind people that McAfee is an insane piece of shit?
3	1523200229	1	What did he do to you?
4	1523202037	1	Nothing to me.But he did murder that guy.
5	1523202117	1	Friend of yours?
6	1523202375	1	Countryman of mine.
0	1523168602	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUzip4dyOx4
0	1523174572	77	At which point of the story does the old bull accept $100,000 to tell the young bull about all the different cows and their virtues? Mcafee is a fucking hack. 
1	1523182024	-3	You can be right about something and also be a scammer ya kno 
2	1523186510	12	That's OK then. As long as he's right about something whilst he scams people, we can turn a blind eye to that. 
3	1523191686	1	That doesn't mean it's okay, it only means that when the man talks some will listen for better or worse.Also, blind eye, really? Been a VERY long time since I last saw a thread about McAfee without someone pointing out his shady background.Everyone knows at this point, you aren't delivering breaking news nor an old tale everyone forgot about.
4	1523194644	2	Clearly a lot of people don't know about his antics, or we wouldn't still have weekly posts about this cunt giving him more and more exposure. 
5	1523195944	2	Yeah, because only people we admire get our attention usually, right? 
2	1523191892	2	Yes, but if I wanted people to believe it, I’d find some other source to quote.
2	1523193091	1	You can also be wrong too. Do you know that?
2	1523194164	1	McAfee may or may not be right on this but not because he actually knows what's going onAnalogies sound cool but mean nothing
2	1523198354	1	keep telling yourself that..
2	1523184790	0	True, it makes the scams much more effective 
1	1523188104	-4	> Mcafee is a fucking hacker. FTFY
0	1523178109	11	Mcafee knows all about fucking the cows :)
0	1523187311	7	Speaking of fuckingI don't need sex when my portfolio fucks me every morning 
1	1523201126	1	Lol “portfolio”
0	1523189890	5	The old bull says to the young bull: "I can't fuck cows because I ate my dick."
0	1523187874	10	God, why are we even listening to this guy?
0	1523175178	16	Let's walk down there and have all the cows shit in our mouths
0	1523175153	4	ELI5 the moral of the story ?
1	1523186733	3	Take your time and don't rush.
1	1523193858	2	John McAfee gets winded if he walks faster than a brisk pace but has a basement full of Viagra he bought on the darknet.
1	1523178537	3	Children need to stop running around, old people get tired doing more important things
0	1523183432	21	McAfee is a murderer who likes women to shit on him. That is all. 
1	1523207909	1	Who has he murdered?
0	1523193114	4	Just watched gringo: the dangerous life of John McAfee on netflix.. interesting stuff.
0	1523195657	3	John McAfee is a real piece of shit. Please for your own good, don't listen to this psychotic man.
0	1523168282	6	Ya buts it’s the bears that are the problem not the cows. Lol
0	1523183656	3	So romantical. 
0	1523189584	3	That’s a joke from the movie colors from the 80s
0	1523167985	10	lol wtf?
1	1523168533	7	Right? Anyone else like wtf with this? 
2	1523176881	13	I saw it on The Sopranos, the wise bull is saying don’t be so excited, if you take a calmer approach you can get far better results with less effort.
3	1523209235	1	Ah, thanks for clarifying.
0	1523169886	7	He missed off the end:"The young bull ignores the old bull's advice, runs down the field, and fucks all the cows before the old bull can catch up."
1	1523171995	3	The old bull then says "Thanks for warming them all up for me young fella"
2	1523206055	1	Then young bull then says, after the old bull lays them all to waste, "I have AIDS".
3	1523207981	1	The old bull then says "You too?, don't worry I am sure when we are at 360 degrees Fahrenheit nestled in an oven tray with potatoes and pumpkin, nobody will ever know"
2	1523172411	1	Sloppy seconds
3	1523172524	3	Saves on lube
4	1523172989	3	I wouldn't know.  I've never fucked a cow.I imagine you have to bend it double to feel the sides.
5	1523176302	-1	Here's an old joke to play on someone. Get the subject matter round to bestiality. Then say to your target, 'I knew this guy once who got off on fucking cows, and what he said to me that he used to sneak up to them in the paddock at night and get in behind their back legs, then you start doing the business to them" then you say to your target "and you know how the cow turns around and looks at you?" of course the natural reaction is for the poor sucker to nod his head. So you then go "ooooh yuk"
6	1523176578	1	Heh :)
0	1523179031	5	Mcafee talks a lot about nothing
0	1523189220	2	Don't take advice from murderers
1	1523208367	1	Why not?, you won't get much joy by trying to take advice from their victim.
0	1523189437	2	I'm in awe of his wisdom, my brain can only so much. Shakespeare would be impressedMind = shattered
0	1523189443	2	Then the bulls speculate on bitcoin and lose all their money.
0	1523192508	2	Colors. Robert Duvall tells this story to Sean Penn. 
0	1523192545	2	Sounds autobiographical. 
0	1523194582	2	$7,000 is the new norm.  Deal with it and start spending.
0	1523194764	2	Didn't this guy lose most of his money due to bad investments
0	1523195289	2	Colors was mentioned, here's the scene: https://youtu.be/LJQAKDbq0hI
0	1523196329	2	>Implying McAfee is worth listening to at allWew
0	1523198685	1	Didn’t he murder someone?
0	1523184872	2	John McAfee.How this man is not arrested I do not know. I watched a documentary about his life and honestly i’m dazed. He had his own private army in the island he lived in
0	1523193846	3	Remember, kids, John McAfee is batshit crazy.
1	1523194419	0	And I’d imagine he’s fucked a few bulls in his day so let’s listen to the man. 
0	1523188303	2	I wouldn't be taking any advice from that dude, he's fucking bonkers.
0	1523168443	0	The guy has a colorful past and has done all sorts of sketchy things. I think it is precisely these things that has made him wise. Crude, profane but profound.
1	1523173647	72	Nothing about McAfee strikes me as 'profound'. The dude says all kinds of stuff all the time and some of it sticks, the rest people just right off to him being 'crazy ol' John'. 
2	1523188490	7	If Donald Trump was pumping bitcoin, half these kids would be sucking his teet
1	1523187152	6	You want to trust him because you like him.The truth is that he is a paid shill who murders people.
2	1523204425	1	Did I use the word ‘trust’ anywhere? Someone I don’t agree with and dislike can still be profound. 
3	1523206034	1	"If Bitcoin isn't $1mil btly 2020 I'll eat my own dick"SO profund. He's basically confucious.
1	1523169054	-45	Exactly, that's why I trust him.
2	1523169669	58	no doubt he is awesome but NOT the kind of person to be trusted ever
3	1523169791	25	Yeah, don't trust the guy that installed straight up malware on millions of computers. I completely agree
4	1523174950	22	Also probably murdered a guy
4	1523173281	8	You do understand that he sold the company a long time ago and is helping people get rid of it as can be seen here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKgf5PaBzyg
3	1523169773	-25	He's very transparent actually, he disclosed how much he gets paid for promoting shitcoins. It's not like the guy is hiding his intentions.
4	1523170244	39	note that he is not doing it BEFOREHAND, he told u the truth after all the shitcoins are down and useless, and he has already made enough money out of that, exchanged all the shitcoins for btc or usd, seriously, i think everyone should be cautious to THIS KIND of people even if u chose to follow him, be prepared to leave before getting fuxked up so hard 
5	1523171097	-21	I only trust him when he has skin the game actually, ie when his dick is at stake
4	1523174550	4	The Dude killed his neighbour
2	1523171165	37	You trust John Mc......bwah hahahahahahaha holy fuck..... LOL LOL bwahahahaha ROFL ROFL.
3	1523176779	11	I'd trust Frank Abagnale before I trust McAfee
3	1523171880	2	Why are you laughing like that?
4	1523188257	4	He most likely murdered his neighbour, and he is guilty of *at least* sexual assault.Sounds like a great guy to trust.
4	1523172559	1	[deleted]
5	1523173010	1	I'd pay for different things, so what?
3	1523191557	0	Fucking hell you laugh like I would 10 years ago on Facebook

0	1523177801	1	Anyone noticed number of pro-McAfee and other similar figures posts recently? Someone is trying to shift public opinion about those who actively promote anti-bitcoin propaganda.
1	1523185476	4	The Illuminati?
2	1523187950	2	Most certainly.
0	1523181174	1	Sopranos anyone 😂😂😂
0	1523193830	1	I may be wrong but this analogy was spoken by Robert Duvall to Sean Penn on the movie "Colors"....30 yrs ago.
0	1523200960	1	That guy is a true POS. You really want to quote him?

0	1523168386	0	Where will be the  bears though amidst all the fucking...
0	1523171695	0	The old bull says - “ Stay here, they’ll come to us and we’ll fuck all of them.”
0	1523178892	0	I've heard that bull anecdote before, does it have an actual meaning or is it just a funny saying? 
1	1523184663	2	Well, the meaning is that by applying a bit of strategy you can accomplish more in the long run.
0	1523183885	0	So this is the 1-million-dollar-by-2020 guy? Oh my god. His bloatware also sucks big time.
0	1523184687	0	This guy eats shit
0	1523192673	0	John McAfee, a legend in the crypto world by now!!Hope the bull run starts soon and I can see some serious gains in IOStoken and Enigma. I guess the bear market is not done yet.
0	1523193653	0	does he eat the poop or just swish it around a bit?
0	1523193731	0	I guess I’m the only one that realizes that’s a Robert Duvall line in the movie Colors (1988). It’s what the old cop tells the rookie. 
0	1523194514	0	Since January? We still were in a bullrun, in January. Correction came mid January to now April. Pretty sure it's over, but it's exactly as Mcaffee said. The short-run is entirely irrelevant. If you're dependant on Bitcoin *running right fucking now* you did something wrong. 
0	1523196816	0	And he's black too. Black people are just amazing
0	1523201065	1	Fuck John McAfee
