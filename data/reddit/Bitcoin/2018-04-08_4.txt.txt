1	1523186466	11	Redditor thinks Bitcoin is stable because it didn't fluctuate for one day is so crypto.
2	1523207189	1	I day trade, dude, volatility is good for me. Regardless, BTC has been in the same +-$500 channel for more than a week now which, for Bitcoin, does mean it's become *slightly* more stable.
1	1523207089	1	But but, if no fluctuation from now on, no lambo for me ðŸ˜¢
2	1523210997	1	You never learnt to drive one first Hahah #flux

1	1523175912	10	More like a monster bull.
2	1523207278	1	Yeah, more likely. Sleeping BULL. And probably we'll see his another wild run  by the summer (imho :) )...

1	1523187734	4	That's what they said when we were dicking around at $700 range for the longest time.  A lot of people thought the price would never go apeshit ever again.... But it sure did!
2	1523191844	-3	You're right! It will only ever go up and will never ever stabilise! Ever! 
3	1523192837	3	Oh, is that what I said?It will not stabilize at this level of adoption and price, that would be absurd.  We're a long way off from a stable price.  $7,000 is not the stable endgame.
4	1523202369	1	All i said is that bitcoins stability increase might not be so bad. Didnt say its at this point or at any point for that matter... And markets WILL mature over time. As for this moment in time, we are just waiting for adoption...
0	1523191854	1	Just don't name it 
0	1523194720	1	BTC won't start moving yet. I think the bear markets continue. Right now, I am making gains trading IOST/BTC. In these markets it can make sense to trade I think.
0	1523211048	1	I miss the little roller coaster guy...
0	1523180069	1	Go down a little more so I can buy more! Thanks
