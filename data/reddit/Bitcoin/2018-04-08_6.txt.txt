0	1523157192	34	Welcome to the party!
1	1523192695	9	Best $1031 ever invested!
2	1523199913	1	better they invested that $1067 now than when it hit ATH at 19k
3	1523201813	1	Did you guys hear about that guy that just invest his $800? Pretty good use of $600 if you ask me.
4	1523209526	1	He couldâ€™ve gotten a PlayStation with that $300. But I guess itâ€™s for the future. Hopefully that $500 will double one day.
0	1523171101	14	Don't even look at the prices anymore bro, put on hardware wallet and come back in 1-2 years.
1	1523173600	24	you mean check the prices 3 times a day?
2	1523176212	16	You mean 3 times an hour?
3	1523184492	2	I stopped doing that at a certain point.
4	1523185943	2	Yeah, i use a liveticker, too.
5	1523188578	1	I started drawing lines on a chart
6	1523189592	1	Oh my... Oh... You started.... Oh my :( poor monkyyy0Once you start drawing lines, there is no coming back
4	1523201958	1	Wish I could, it's a fucking addiction at this point. Wake up, look at my phone "oh that cute girl hit me up..fuck that shit, what's Bitcoin doing" - I need therapy.
3	1523189783	1	You mean make a price checking bot that send you app notifications whenever it notices a drop starting?
1	1523198209	1	Do you think a paper wallet would be just as good?
2	1523200631	1	Sure. 
2	1523203661	1	If you keep it in a waterproof bag/container thatâ€™s inside a fireproof safe.    If you have a hardware wallet you can keep it anywhere, as long as your recovery key is inside of a waterproof bag/container inside a fireproof safe lol 
3	1523210956	1	It always comes back to paper in a safe
0	1523160028	10	it will knock till your ballz on the ground, welcome to hodler club
0	1523160923	14	Okay remember to hodl.
1	1523193994	7	Yeah just buy it and never spend it. Currency of the future.
2	1523195523	2	Spend it after it takes over.  
0	1523169848	19	Tip: Don't listen to any of the replies in this post.
1	1523176179	11	Especially this one
1	1523169932	3	Jesus loves you
2	1523195033	1	This I know
3	1523202108	1	For McAfee tells me so
2	1523188501	1	Satan has great advice 
0	1523166795	6	Great timing. Welcome!
0	1523172595	6	Had to keep re-reading this. Initially sounded like you just bought $1000 fiat with your bitcoin. I had a pitchfork and everything ready ;)
0	1523159164	9	Whatever you do, donâ€™t panic sell if/when you experience your first flash crash. 
0	1523189453	3	Now move to a cabin in the woods with no power or cell phone
0	1523195714	3	Well done. You'll be glad you did this. Don't freak out if the price drops, and don't sell if it doubles.  Send it to a paper wallet or hardware wallet and forget about it for a couple years.
0	1523172749	2	Hodl deez nuts
0	1523173981	2	.85 more to one bitcoin ðŸ‘Œ
0	1523176480	2	Better to buy now than in the mania a few months ago!
0	1523180178	2	If you're patient enough, you should get 10x out of this over the years I reckon, much better than having it sat in a bank account inflating away! Just don't sell out if we have a prolonged bear market.Welcome aboard.
1	1523184221	1	Reckon?? Oh boy , we are really in trouble 
0	1523161275	4	Good stuff.  You probably didn't get in at the bottom, but there's a reason they call it "trying to catch a falling knife". If you're good for holding for at least the next few years, at some point you will kicking yourself that you didn't buy more.
1	1523165053	7	Catching a falling knife only has meaning when you are trading on margin. If you open your position and the trade goes deeply against you will be required to add more margin or you get a margin call and lose money. In the OP's case, he will always have one sixth of a bitcoin, no matter what happens. He will win in the end I guarantee.
1	1523162280	2	No problem catching a falling knife with calloused hands.
1	1523165646	1	Can confirm.
1	1523195616	1	Those with the skills to catch a falling knife can easily stab the clumsy oafs who drop them in the heart.
0	1523163319	3	Probably a good time to do so. Good luck!
1	1523185048	2	Literally any time is a good time to buy bitcoin according to you people 
2	1523201531	1	20k would have been THE best time, it has more sentimental value the more you pay for it.
0	1523192753	2	You picked a very good time. Dipped over 60%, then buy? That's a pro right there.
0	1523157669	1	Correction, uptrend times
0	1523166082	1	What'd you get in at?
0	1523168138	1	Welcome to the club!
0	1523172268	1	The exchange might just tell you that 10% of your money has disappeared, soon
0	1523179365	1	Do your homework and be patient.  Read a lot and Goodluck!  :)
1	1523186078	0	Reading won't influence the price.
0	1523179430	1	Welcome to the team.
0	1523179435	1	Lol, it's just the beginning..... 
0	1523183889	1	Don't advertise on social media that you have bitcoin. You risk making yourself a target for hacking, burglars, etc.
1	1523185051	3	With $1000 invested ?  That goes down every 2 hours .Ya , burglars will be lining up Be very careful Lol... 
2	1523193780	1	Now imagine OP's post was written in 2011.We'll see if people are posting in 2025 about how they wished they had just dared to invest $1000 during the dip in 2018.
0	1523195207	1	Think of hodl as just a meme. 
0	1523195331	1	Welcome to the club ;) You will be addicted very soon.After I bought my first BTC, I soon bought my first altcoins like IOST. I think right now it might make more sense to just hold the Bitcoin, since the altcoins are going down. :)
0	1523203064	1	Best $857 you've ever spent!
1	1523204616	1	but what does this guy need with $1278.43 worth of bitcoins?!
0	1523209560	1	Now all we need to do is get back on the moon....
0	1523211236	1	You are legit stupid 
0	1523157575	1	Be patient, stay calm, do your own diligent work and maybe think about trading in downtrend times, just to accumulate more of the coins you are holding
0	1523169470	0	Welcome you're so cute
0	1523157139	-5	Cool story bro
0	1523157354	-4	You hodling anything other than Bitcoin?
1	1523157390	0	Should I be?
2	1523165413	3	no, not now at least
2	1523161377	4	no, BTC is the best and most secure right now.
2	1523157474	-2	Yes 
3	1523157742	2	What do you recommend?
4	1523188453	0	Play it safe. 35% - 45% BTC,  25% - 35% Monero, 20% Ether, and whatever you have left you can pump into like NEO or something.
4	1523170221	-5	Bitcoin Private is bound to get listed on a major exchange soon.
4	1523157790	-12	Litecoin and Veritaseum 
5	1523157840	0	Why Lit ? And why not ETh
6	1523159651	-8	Galactrum
7	1523167400	0	Garlic coin
5	1523162949	0	Trading alts is fine. but holding alts? Nah.
0	1523157840	-7	[removed]
1	1523157953	1	What alts do you recommend? 
2	1523163186	10	> se it to buy alts, most of the quality ones have hit bottom and are trading sidewaysMy Friend.   Don't give away your BTC for Shitcoins - its the fastest way to loose your initial investment.   JMHO
2	1523158292	12	For me personally bitcoin has performed the best, alt coins have been hit or miss. So I think you made a great investment! 
2	1523159800	-1	[removed]
3	1523163343	-1	They are all bullshit ponzi scheme. You can't morally tell people to buy into this ponzi things. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency. Rest are ponzi scheme a clever website and marketing then team. Eth is the only other cryptocurrency that has actual usecases.
4	1523186185	2	I'd add monero to the list. Otherwise i agree.
