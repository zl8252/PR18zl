0	1523223717	50	How much was the fee?
1	1523285816	1	Can't speak for him but at the ATM I usually buy from there is a $2 service fee regardless and the buy price is 10-15% over the actual market price
1	1523246949	-9	Who gives a shit? Youâ€™ve seen the tax liabilities. 
2	1523260528	11	It does matter when you want new adopters to try with small amounts.
0	1523230387	17	Yea. I looked at the one by the National Harbor and luckily it was out of order. I did some research after i left. That shit was like a 20% fee. Definitely not worth it. 
0	1523229350	32	The fee is horrendous. With $20 that u buy, BTC atm will charge u $9, leaving you only $11. 
1	1523230754	13	Is $9 the minimum charge, or is it $9 for every $20 purchased? How much would it cost at your ATM to purchase $100, $1,000 etc?
2	1523231894	2	I haven't tried the $100 or $1000. Too much for that amount with that fee
3	1523241698	14	But if it's a flat fee and OP bought one Bitcoin, it's like .3%. 
4	1523246129	13	Nobody is putting $6k of cash into a machine like this in one go
5	1523246815	5	Your certainty is almost an equal substitute for facts. Did OP say how much he bought? I think it'd be strange too but I don't quite understand these ATMs at all so anything's possible.
6	1523267613	2	It's in the title "1st bitcoin". Obviously OP didn't lie so he must have bought a whole one
7	1523277737	1	It was my assumption too but that could just as easily be referencing that he bought his first investment into Bitcoin. It's no different than the ATM saying "Buy Bitcoin here." There's no requirement to buy a whole one.
6	1523246937	-20	Your mother is almost a whore
7	1523251234	5	So this is one of those "Long time r/bitcoin contributors" that i have been hearing about.
7	1523246993	6	Got me. Almost.
8	1523279328	-1	Sorry I just fucked her. She is now full whore 
9	1523286634	1	So edgy.
5	1523278597	1	I would if the fee was only $9.Being able to purchase in cash has a lot of value to me.
1	1523246969	2	So buy more than $20
0	1523247317	7	You used $7000 cash?
1	1523280104	4	No. Op saw a good opportunity to get karma. 
1	1523294880	1	$6200 cash? why did he need $7600 cash for?
2	1523295458	1	at the time I posted,  btc was $7000
0	1523226618	6	Congratulations!
0	1523229291	4	9 steps?!? Average folks can handle 2-3 steps max. 
0	1523252720	6	NOT AN ATM
0	1523237568	4	I have kind of a "stupid" question. Can someone from out of state/country use these BTC ATM's?I live in Hawaii where exchanges like Coinbase are not allowed to do business. Will be traveling this summer and would love to hit up one of these machines.
1	1523239248	5	Yeah. the machines in Vegas are cheaper than coinbase. Also try bisq. It's a decentralized exchange. Could be cheaper than atms
2	1523251811	1	Thanks!
1	1523239415	2	You can check Bisq. One way around it is using Square Cash or PayPal to buy BTC from another user. It is very tech-savvy, not good for beginners or those who want to keep it easy.
2	1523251818	1	Thanks for the info.
2	1523283797	1	Why buy from another user? You can buy BTC directly from the Square Cash app. It's cheaper than coinbase.
1	1523247590	2	If you could find a Bitcoin ATM where cash is accepted. In that way, IRS or government wouldn't track your transactions. Google any btc atm in your destination. 
2	1523251834	2	Cool, thank you.
0	1523225467	8	It's just a PIN sent to phone number and done.Pretty cool.
0	1523238523	3	Where was that? Iâ€™m a couple minutes from Alexandria!
1	1523246273	5	It's at the Shell station at the corner of Little River Turnpike and Beauregard.
2	1523248553	2	Thanks! Next time Iâ€™m around Iâ€™m gunna check it out. Always wanted to see one. 
0	1523228668	7	You spent 6 K in cash at an ATM? Why?
1	1523233241	6	Came here to say this. Bitcoin ATMs are really not that reliable.
2	1523236040	4	Kinda nice it's not tracked by the government though?  Or does this one request ID and photo etc? 20% fee wtf
3	1523239332	2	That was my thought. It  may not be under similar regulations as an ATM because bitcoin, which may not require ID. However, the risk may be higher of being scammed.
4	1523251295	2	In the US at least, most Bitcoin machines register itself as vending machines. This is the main reason why you can only buy Bitcoin but not sell it.
5	1523270260	1	I sold Bitcoin to a machine like this in Austin a few weeks ago. It would have sold up to $10,000 it said. I only walked away with a few hundred though - high fees - %9. 
6	1523294819	1	yet that money didnt go through coinbase to your checking account where the IRS have a paper trail of your 40% tax liabilities.
3	1523247657	1	Zoom in on the ATM screen in the picture. It requests a phone number. 
4	1523247737	2	Some of the BTC ATM in 7-11 accepts cash. Not trackable by the government. 
5	1523280230	1	Why is everyone so concerned with, it's not traceable by the government? Who gives a shit? 
6	1523289439	1	Coz we do. It is called taxation. 
7	1523290163	1	So now the attitude is, use bitcoin to avoid paying taxes. Wtf..... this is absurd. 
8	1523290857	1	This is only with regards to using BTC ATM. If you can find atm accepting cash. 
9	1523290950	1	We are sticking to the topic here. Paying BTC with cash. Other than that, we are using cards in other exchanges. 
9	1523291496	1	Sounds like tax evasion to me. 
7	1523290016	1	So how do you expect infrastructure to be maintained? And the military? Schools? Lemme guess, blockchain will revolutionize all of this. Man, your attitude is not good for bitcoin. 
8	1523291069	1	Our attitude here is if we can buy BTC with cash. Don't fret. Don't blow this out of perspective.. stay on the topic. Read the main post. 
4	1523259702	2	Burner phone 
3	1523284390	1	Great way to launder money! 
1	1523243673	3	I mean, he SAID he did. In all likelihood, he saw the machine, took a picture a made up a title. Lets be real.
0	1523244300	5	diD YoU jUsT SaY BiTcOiN cAsH ??? 
0	1523238334	2	is there one of these that will give you cash for bitcoin?
1	1523246195	1	Iâ€™ve seen the honey badger ones and yes you can withdraw cash. However the fee is terrible, like 10%
0	1523239468	2	Curious if it goes from BTC to cash, that would be very useful.
0	1523250746	2	How many bitcoins came out
0	1523222948	8	I bet they cloned your card in the process :)
1	1523223280	14	 C A S H
2	1523229723	18	Fine.  They cloned his cash. 
3	1523242887	2	It's not Verge! Bam
4	1523245515	1	hashtag VergeBam
2	1523225275	1	Ah! My mistake.... I didn't noticed the slot to introduce the notes. 
1	1523223676	2	Boi
2	1523225306	0	?
3	1523228108	2	!
0	1523253814	3	Might want to be a little careful with these sort of photos, can almost make out your face in the bottom right of the machine via the reflection from the machine. 
0	1523226675	2	Great!
0	1523239793	2	Holy mother of fees
0	1523247014	2	fees.jpg
0	1523233874	1	very cool
0	1523243225	1	How much was the fee? You fed ovet 60 hundred dollar bills into an ATM? 
1	1523280297	2	No, it's a karma grab. This is just another crap post that is not good for bitcoin. 
0	1523245471	1	are these traceable? do you just give it cash and a wallet address or does it link to your bank card/phone number etc? also is there a camera mounted in it like with a real atm?
0	1523246423	1	On a convenience store? The future is today 
0	1523247601	1	~~You get some kind of code for a wallet or what???~~ Never mind, I blew the pic up and read it.
0	1523250724	1	You can manually type in addresses in the machine. Safest way!ðŸ™„
0	1523250937	1	I am searching for a machine in New York or NJ that gives you a paper wallet, and you don't have to sign up before hand. Like, stick cash in, and get bitcoin out.
0	1523254640	1	Where was this Bitcoin ATM?
0	1523260758	1	How much price do you want?
0	1523264069	1	Looks fine.
0	1523264442	1	i got one of these at home and everytime bitcoin goes down i kick it and bitcoin falls out of it.
0	1523266324	1	There were a few of those years ago in Vienna, Austria until the companies realized they were completely useless, to expensive and didn't bring in enough income.
0	1523272158	1	dump it
0	1523285930	1	Were you required to identify yourself in any way? ID scan? Anything?I see where you need to give a phone number for the text message. Is there any more info required?
0	1523285999	1	very expensive purchase, those machines usually charge like 10%+ for the purchase
0	1523287154	1	Love it
0	1523230646	0	It bothers me that they dont know how to use semicolons OR colons. 
0	1523247040	-1	Good job! Avoid those 50% or mor tax liabilities!
