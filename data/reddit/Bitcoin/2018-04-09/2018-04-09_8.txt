Go and withdraw in cash, all of you, in the same time, all the money you have in that bank. Buy BTC and never use that worthless goat shit fiat anymore.  By closing your bank accounts you hit them exactly like a dagger in the heart.  Making noise, you make it worst, you make them more nervous and will attack more. Be the first in hitting hard not counter attacking.  **Bitcoin is the Silent Revolution, dump the fiat!**

1	1523285264	1	I don't know of a single store that accepts crypto in chile. Last time I checked we have 3 active nodes... one is mine.
2	1523287649	1	Perhaps you or a business person you know could start a bitcoin general store.  Of course, there are legal concerns and you don't want to risk legal trouble, but unless someone takes the first step nothing will ever change.
3	1523288651	1	I know, It just happens that business and/or stores are very far away from my field and that also applies to the people close to me :(
4	1523295640	1	If you can find a small local business owner you can probably fix this. It's not the role for everyone, but I know tons of small business which have gotten their hands into bitcoin in different ways.If there is a small convenience store or grocery you shop at often, you may be able to talk the owner into getting involved.
