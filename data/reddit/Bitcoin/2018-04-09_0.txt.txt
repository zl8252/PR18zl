0	1523225440	40	I completely missed that.  I remember looking at the TL symbol on that guy's sign too but didn't bother reading the words lol.
0	1523217980	95	Another legend has been identified

0	1523243919	52	We're over the buy bitcoin we should be at use bitcoin. 
1	1523247124	17	Yes. 
1	1523275700	3	I use my bitcoin for purchases all the time ;)
1	1523284387	1	Saving and investing is a usage of bitcoin. Nothing wrong with that. Money has many use cases.
1	1523270721	-3	Wrong
1	1523281530	0	It would be nice if you could use bitcoin without having to worry about the ridiculous taxes that take place during transactions.
2	1523287776	1	You mean the 50 cent transaction fee? Wake up, it's not 2017 anymore
0	1523226775	25	Imagine if someone did this on every big event all over earth
1	1523227128	30	Many people already know what bitcoin is. Doesn't mean they will buy it.
2	1523235442	6	spoken like a true nocoiner
2	1523238065	4	No, they don't. Not yet.
3	1523241408	-2	Someone would have to live under a rock to not know what bitcoin is by now.
4	1523261179	3	A lot of people have *heard* of Bitcoin, but almost none of them know what it is. Firstly because its not very intuitive, even to technically minded/skilled people. Secondly because there is so much bad or mis- information out there. I'm a Solidity (Ethereum) developer, and whenever people ask me to explain what I do, even the ones who have heard of Bitcoin, generally I need to explain Blockchain and Bitcoin first. Most people just know Bitcoin as "that new internet money?".
5	1523281364	1	I’m not saying they know exactly what it is of course. That’s part of its UX problem; you really need a C.S. background to fully understand it, which is just another barrier to its adoption. People know it now as that new gambling fad that makes you lose money. 
5	1523267494	1	This. 95% of people have no more idea about Bitcoin than about AI/Machine learning/buzzword-of-the-moment.
4	1523242567	-1	Probably you didn't get the pun intended.
3	1523279977	0	breh ...
1	1523248543	2	In time Padawan, in time.
0	1523246047	18	if there is anything i learned from the last time a random guy holding a "buy bitcoin" sign was played on tv it is: now is the time to buy bitcoin.  
1	1523272612	1	This wasn't tv though
2	1523287420	1	They prolly pull more veiwers than most TV stations on that weekend
1	1523279567	1	My first thought was “OMG, it’s happening again, a Bitcoin Bull-run is coming, just like last time - right after a guy holding a sign “Buy Bitcoin” on TV.”
0	1523228131	5	Lmao nice
0	1523265651	9	Buy bitcoin please, PLEASE !! I beg you!
1	1523274426	3	Agree. The other buy bitcoin guy sounded like he was giving a friendly advice, this sounds like begging. Different scenarios, bad timing.
0	1523224102	2	Ez Money TL!
0	1523238585	5	We pulled it off on [day 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8auvlw/so_i_was_at_the_lcs_finals_in_miami_and_managed/) too :D
