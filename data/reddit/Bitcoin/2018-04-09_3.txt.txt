It would also get the name out there in front of businesses that otherwise wouldn’t have considered it.  Eventually businesses accepting btc through square would get hip to the fact that they can save money by accepting btc directly.  Hmmm...I just realized why square might not want to add btc...
1	1523243236	22	Square adding Bitcoin would be a great thing - you're right!  Because Jack Dorsey is such a strong believer in Bitcoin, I have no doubt they will follow through here.
2	1523249839	17	And Jack just made a sizeable investment into Lightning labs.Jack loves his Lightning.Thanks Jack, we love you too.. well most of us :)
3	1523277306	3	I love crypto. Fuck Jack.
3	1523264547	-3	and he blocked the scam Bitcoin account from Roger.
2	1523290311	1	Jack is in Saudis pocket, and Saudi Arabia princes have been responsible for the run-up in value in their flight for safety and protecting their assets.
1	1523251576	2	I recon it'll be similar to how QuickBooks does it?  Customers can pay their invoice with bitcoin, and it converts it on the fly OR gives us Bitcoin.Some businesses want to have the option of QuickBooks, without having to deal with the extra security / tax implications of Bitcoin.  
1	1523270146	3	The main reason for square not to add bitcoin is the unpredictability of the bitcoin price. There aren’t many currencies which drop 10% in a week. You can already see the uneducated businesses complaining they sold 10k worth of stuff and only have 9k worth of bitcoin in their account.Though I guess high legit usage of bitcoin would stabilise the price.How do businesses save money through bitcoin? You can get very low transaction fees with card payments. If bitcoin usage goes up the tax laws in various countries will update in no time. 
2	1523274930	3	>You can already see the uneducated businesses complaining they sold 10k worth of stuff and only have 9k worth of bitcoin in their account.Business aren't stupid, generally. It's extremely likely that they will convert to fiat on a regular basis, or even per transaction, just for the added exposure to additional methods of payment. It's like credit cards. Business have to pay a fee for every transaction, but it makes very little sense to be cash only in this day and age. 
3	1523280091	1	And there won't likely be mass adoption from small/medium sized businesses unless the IRS stops treating bitcoin as property.  As the regs sit currently, each and every transaction a business does using bitcoin is subject to capital gains/loss tracking.  A ROYAL pain.  If a small business did 10 transactions a day they would theoretically have to track and pay capital gains tax from the time they accept the payment until the time they convert to fiat currency. At least that is my understanding of how it works, I am no tax pro.  
4	1523284286	1	I know there are services than can convert to USD or whatever right at the time of purchase, but usually there's a slight lag so I'm not sure how that works and whether it causes capital gains/losses.  Also not sure how it would work with LN because if they accept a LN payment, can that also be converted to USD instantly?  I don't know of any LN exchanges, yet.
0	1523260465	25	Wake me up when a company makes it easy for people to buy bitcoins without having to send over their DNA, a Limb and a copy of their electric bill dating back to when they were born. Let's mature a bit and stop crying like babies when the fact is pointed out that for the average user (not you) getting bitcoins and keeping them safe is far from easy.I must add "this is great for bitcoin" or else some of you will have a heart attack 
0	1523280116	2	Won’t help Bitcoin unless they also settle with Bitcoin. 
0	1523239323	10	Nope, I will not think about this BS... Square will be another bloodsucker intermediary that Bitcoin is trying to avoid.  Reminder: [Satoshi's papers](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  **Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
1	1523250408	19	Calm down, whats the commotion all about? Yes, we all know what the white-paper says but it's just the primer. Satoshi's emails and forum posts are just as important, if not more so. Here is where reality comes into play, you cannot (at this stage) do away without a payment processor or some form of crypto to fiat conversion at the retail end. Square like any other payment processor is optional, you can use it or not.If you want to use Bitcoin and send it to your peers, do so, no one forces anyone how to use Bitcoin or any other crypto.
2	1523257474	3	exactly
2	1523262770	-5	Bitcoin doesn't need any "payment processor" because is itself the payment processor.
3	1523267425	9	When you want to spend your Bitcoin and you go to your local store to purchase the latest MacBook Pro how do you suppose that store will handle the 0.5 BTC you give them? Keep in mind they paid for the stock in $, pay their taxes in $ and need to pay their staff in $. At some point the BTC needs to turned into $. That will most likely be performed by a service like Bitpay or the likes of SquareSo that is the reality now. However at sometime in the future perhaps BTC will replace $, at that point BTC can be earned and spent natively.
4	1523267729	-5	No. Merchants that accept BTC should keep the BTC to pay the employees/suppliers in BTC. Otherwise there is no point in taking them, they can use fiat and visa like before.  I live only using BTC from 2015, I closed all my bank accounts. I am paid in BTC, I spend in BTC. No more fiat where I live.
5	1523271397	2	Your government accepts taxes in Bitcoin?  Why keep it a secret?  Just tell us where you live. 
6	1523287855	1	Cause he's a bs shill and not good for bitcoin. This is why people will never take it seriosly. He's doing all this grand crypto stuff, but won't say how or where.... look at his comments, it's lunacy. 
7	1523293938	1	He lives in a small city (probably Switzerland) where everything is a local independent business that can handle payments on their own. That's why he doesn't acknowledge that stores like Walmart need different approaches.
8	1523295104	1	He lives in portland. And is wishful think posting.
8	1523298027	1	**There is one question that he will never answer:*** where does he live?  If he answered that, people would check the viability of his claims and conclude that they are b.s.
5	1523274018	3	Food?  Taxes?  Utilities? Rent? Mortgage? Gas? Insurance? Pack of gum at the gas station?  Really?????  Lol.
6	1523295956	1	Just last week he wrote that when when needs to pay for goods or services (e.g. utilities) that do not take bitcoin, he gets his friends to change bitcoin into fiat for him.   So, he is  actually using his  friends as payment processors, and if he did not have willing friends he would have to use some third-party facility to do the job.   The idea that he lives only on bitcoin is therefore just an illusion that he has have contrived.    **There is one question that he will never answer:*** where does he live?  If he answered that, people would check the viability of his claims and conclude that they are b.s.
6	1523275723	-2	Yes, everything paid in BTC.
5	1523275950	3	"Merchants that accept BTC should keep BTC" The reality is very very few do. What you want merchants to do is a long way off. A very long way off into the future. Your use case is very rare, it's exceedingly hard for 95% of use to follow suit.The fact is if you had entered the Bitcoin world in December 2017 (and not 2015) the BTC savings from your salary would be worth less than half right now. That is not acceptable, a viable crypto-currency for the masses must be relatively price stable. You are lucky that Bitcoin has increased in value since 2015, it could have stalled and gone backwards.  Keep in mind for your employer to pay you, they must convert $ to BTC and for 90% of the merchants you deal with they also have to convert BTC to $. Whilst you can manage to use BTC for day to day spending there is always a $ - BTC - $ conversion going on in the background, therefore BTC is not being used natively. Like you I can also spend my BTC for day to day purchases, but unlike you I do so in a totally unrestricted manner, I can spend it anywhere and everywhere. But I convert BTC - $ and then charge up my debit card, I do this because I am resigned to the fact that at this point if I want to spend BTC there will always be a conversion going on, so I may as well perform that conversion. 
6	1523281159	2	For BTC to become stable, people have to start using it like cash. It's still in the adoption process, so a bunch of merchants have to sacrifice themselves with the price changes for some time. Remember when the internet had to be accessed on a 5600 baud modem over the phone? Now you can have 1gbps for dedicated residential connections. What happened?: Adoption and the needs that had to be solved because of the masification.
5	1523277586	1	There is a point.  More happy customers.  If a business didn't take credit cards for instance, they'd have less customers.  
6	1523277776	0	So that business have no intentions to do a good thing for his customers (by taking BTC and use them) and Bitcoin itself, but only looking into their own interest. That's why I will never use a merchant like that.
7	1523278045	2	Once it is their Bitcoin, the customer has nothing to do with anything .  You can do what you want with your coin.  They 're looking after the desires of their business.  Why would you feel they have some obligation to spend Bitcoin?
8	1523278139	0	Because that affect us all. We all want a better world but we do nothing about, even worse, we still keep using the same shit system when we already have a solution.
9	1523278632	2	That is not how you run a business.  When it makes business sense and isn't such a risk they will.
7	1523285717	1	Every business in the fucking world has 1 purpose: To make money. They could give a fuck about you.
5	1523285660	1	What's the over/under on the amount of times you've posted that you lived only on BTC from 2015? It's in every thread you post in.I'm guessing 10000
6	1523287287	1	And I will repeat it until every almost 800k readers of this sub will do the same.  r/LivingOnBitcoin is real even if you deny it.
5	1523296830	1	Just last week you wrote that when you need to pay for goods or services (e.g. utilities) that do not take bitcoin, you get your friends to change bitcoin into fiat for you.   So, you are actually using your friends as payment processors, and if you did not have willing friends you would have to use some third-party facility to do the job.   The idea that you live only on bitcoin is therefore just an illusion that you have contrived.     
6	1523296977	1	Nope, those friends are not leaking my personal info to 3rd parties or tracking/monitoring my addresses or wallets.
7	1523297430	1	Yes, but they are your payment processor.   Without them to change your BTC to fiat, you could not maintain the delusion that you are living on just BTC.  *That* is the point.  
8	1523297641	1	delusion is for you as a nocoiner.  They practically buy those BTC from and instead of giving me the fiat they pay my bills.
3	1523267485	2	Right, you say, as you download a wallet app.
3	1523275361	2	So how are we going to create stepping stones? I started out with coinbase myself. As I learned more I about bitcoin , I moved all my coins to wallets where I hold the keys.
4	1523275693	-1	First step: If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).  Bitcoin doesn't need to be fast adopted just to be adopted. Bitcoin needs the right adoption, otherwise we will fall again into banksters trap.
3	1523292119	1	Theoretically, but consider practical application and how a payment processor could assist.  
1	1523245487	21	Business owner and libertarian here.Bitcoin is going to have dozens of ways to pay. Square is an easy company to use. You can use whatever you want.
2	1523260446	2	If my payment is going through another company I might as well just use Paypal.
3	1523262811	3	exactly
3	1523273221	3	If you are paying a company to buy something, then you are already parting with you money. It matters not what system *that* company is using to accept your Bitcoin, as that is strictly up to them. If you can hold BTC, and pay for something using standard Bitcoin (or LN!) wallet, that is what is important here.You cannot use PayPal to send BTC, and you must have a PayPal account. PayPal will also collect your information. None of that applies if the merchant you are trying to pay uses square to accept BTC.
4	1523273884	2	No one collects you information if you pay in cash either - and it requires no tech or electricity and has a pretty standard valuation which can easily be converted via mutual negotiation between parties.
5	1523275060	1	Yeah, luckily buying large objects with cash is easy, carrying around massive sums in your wallet is easy, and you totally aren't at risk for being mugged. 
6	1523275687	2	Try buying a car with BC, paying for anything offline with BC, and how you recover when your wallet hardware fails.  
3	1523262833	0	PayPal only uses fiat though. I get that third parties doing our transactions isnt anything new but it is temporarily necessary. Bitcoin is far from done. It needs a lot more work to scale and be used properly and this could help us with scaling for a while. At first many don't fully grasp what makes bitcoin such special money but as time passes and the network scales, people won't be using 3rd parties but until then this will help adoption. 
1	1523259425	1	Square might sell business hardware and software to make using Bitcoin over lightning seamless for the customer and staff. This would keep them in business without adding fees to transactions
2	1523262742	0	Hardware - we already have plenty of HW wallets, we don't need another intermediary  Software - what's the point of having a custodial wallet, when I can have my own wallet that I control it 100%?
3	1523283234	1	Not wallets. POS machines and interfaces. (Point of sale)
4	1523283333	0	why do I need a POS for taking BTC? There is no need.
5	1523284335	1	Explain this to me because I assume the customer will need to have an address to spend to and the merchant and address to receive.
6	1523287085	1	Yes, your BTC wallet is your POS. You can use a watch only wallet, for not allowing your employees to spend those BTC, put the amount of fiat into request payment, your wallet will create a QR code and when the customer will scan that code will have the amount of BTC already, just push the payment into the blockchain and done.  This takes just few seconds. No need for developing/adapting/changing anything in your actual system. Is like taking cash but in a digital form.  Check Sentinel wallet from Samourai. You could have for you, as the owner/manager of the shop your Samourai wallet and using the xpub address from that wallet, imported into Sentinel (watch only) wallet for your employees.  Here is a video explanatory for Sentinel https://youtu.be/umQ2soiWAzQ
7	1523293109	1	Ok. That is fine, but there is no standardized terminal for customers to interact with. There needs to be a qr, NFC, text address blue tooth. Whatever in addition to a display that shows the Fiat amount and the crypto amount. So... Hardware. And software. Simple stuff but some company should standardize the customer facing component so that customers have a payment station that they are familiar with and makes the process as seamless as possible.
1	1523267304	1	a "violation"and yes, those are Dr Evil air quotes by the way :-)
1	1523242569	-23	>A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.This is why Bitcoin Cash (if successful) is more in line with the real definition of Bitcoin.
2	1523242932	14	Lol retarded shills never stop
3	1523247516	-7	Boi if you don't...
2	1523250670	3	Nonsense, it's no different, if you want to make purchase from a retailer they will most probably use a payment processor or convert the crypto to fiat him/herself. Besides hasn't CSW done a deal with SBI bits, a financial institution, one that owns banks and is currently getting involved in the BCH Giggleblock network and also mining BCH. IS that inline with the real definition of Bitcoin? No way Jose!
2	1523264105	4	Don't want to be rude, but the reason why Bitcoin Cash failed (and lets admit, it failed) is because it prioritized technically poor and temporary solution in the field of technical people. It's like seeing a building on fire and suggesting to build a couple more floors, because this way fire will take longer to engulf the entire building. Increasing block size would only last for a year or two at most, and then we'd have to increase it again and again and again, this approach is simply not sustainable. We can all admit that bitcoin failed to scale, and bitcoin has been failing to scale ever since it was released, every technology in high demand is under a permanent process of failing to scale, Tesla's production line is under constant process of failing to scale. Internet is under constant process of failing to scale. Bitcoin Cash was rejected not because it's suggestion was inherently wrong but because it would set a dangerou precedent for something that's not going to be welcomed in the future.
2	1523247715	2	😂😂😂
2	1523242884	3	Your opinion is wrong. 
3	1523243483	-8	On-chain scaling is more inline with the original white paper but I'm not trying to get into it with you right now.
4	1523244840	4	No it isn't. Btrash required a hard fork where bitcoin came to a consensus. Fuck out of here and get back on Roger's lap. 
5	1523245591	-2	What does that even mean? A hard fork was required*. Those who wanted to proceed in the direction that Bitcoin Cash had in mind did so, those who wanted to proceed in the direction of Bitcoin Core did so too. The consensus was formed on both sides.That last rude arse comment wasn't necessary, either.
6	1523255279	4	Doesn't help you had ''stars'' like Craig Wright, Vitalik Buterin, Emin Gun Sirer, Stolfi and ofnumbers on your side does it.
6	1523246150	10	"Bitcoin Core" isnt a thing. It's just Bitcoin. Try as hard as you can to justify btrash but its just not going to happen. Your lovable shit coin has the balls to upgrade to 32mb blocks when it fills a 5th of a mb on average because nobody uses it. 5% of BTCd hashrate. "Solving" scaling problems while having no scale. Make it more and more implausible for people to run full nodes and then claim its decentralized. You have swallowed the dick of Jihan and Roger. Straight. Up. Swallowed.  
7	1523248653	6	Damnnnn.
4	1523250807	1	Where does it say in the white-paper that Bitcoin must be restricted to on-chain scaling? Satoshi was open to off-chain solutions.
5	1523263416	0	He did suggest it in the whitepaper, although he also suggested chain/tree trimming techniques so that when the chain gets large enough average person can still download it in full. And as far as I'm aware due to some technical reasons this trimming was never implemented.
2	1523262576	1	Please get your shit elsewhere...
2	1523250573	0	Yep.  Which is also why Bloomberg Intelligence recently reported BTC is going to $900.  It was mean't to be a currency and is heading in the opposite direction.http://www.kitco.com/news/2018-04-04/Bitcoin-To-Tumble-To-900-Silver-To-Climb-30-Bloomberg-Intelligence.html
2	1523250606	-2	How is that purple veiny jihan wu penis tasting all up in your sockpuppet asshole?
0	1523263608	1	Maybe they need to explain more about crypto before to pursue.
0	1523267246	1	The US tax situation needs to change before this type of thing sees widespread adoption. Also, why do merchants need square to accept bitcoin? They can do that already.
0	1523273863	1	Square could allow 2,000,000 businesses to accept my shits, think about it!
0	1523274809	1	For discussions sake - Why would they enable such a feature? They make the majority of their money on cc processing fees. I’m having a hard time seeing where this would make business sense for them 
0	1523277128	1	Yes, think about it, and then buy their stock. I can't take this rollercoaster anymore...
0	1523277786	1	Isn't it great when you that regulation is put in second place and you can actually starting serving people?This would be huge. 
0	1523280580	1	I think the only way a BTC addition to Square would be feasible is if Square was willing to heighten their own risk profile by offering merchants a 'price guarantee' of some sort. If Square would get comfortable with the same sort of risk exposure that Overstock has, it could definitely work. They could simply establish a small risk management desk by hiring a couple seasoned futures traders to hedge their BTC positions. As adoption increases, it may help to smooth out some of BTC's volatility.
0	1523280860	1	Fck, Square... I already got banned last week for processing a Bitcoin Debit Card transaction.... 
0	1523281012	1	Extremely casual bitcoin observer here; can someone explain how bitcoin will ever be an everyday trading currency when its value has such gigantic jumps and sinks over such a short time. It doesn't seem stable enough.
1	1523289202	1	Its just really volatile because it is so new. If it actually achieved mass adoption eventually the price would stabilize.
0	1523290223	1	Y'all still fooling yourselves that bitcoin is used for commerce? Lol wake up 
0	1523291005	1	Stripe is huge and they did it for a while, but stopped.  Just because a payment processor will let you use bitcoin, doesn't mean the merchants will adopt it.  More importantly, there are lots of options for merchants to take bitcoin now without having Square process it, so if they want to, they could.
0	1523239326	0	What do you mean? Any business can accept bitcoin easily if they want 🤔🤔
1	1523239425	4	Instantly Square could enable Bitcoin acceptance on all of their existing customer POS systems... mind blown!
2	1523253802	1	you mean like cash or Visa ?? MIND FUCKING BLOWN
2	1523239918	1	Not really? Those same businesses can adopt Bitcoin right now? Like it's fucking peer to peer and permissionless. Generate a new wallet address from a watch only wallet like sentinel to let someone scan and pay with Bitcoin. They are using mobile apps anyways. And square won't get a cut.
3	1523253096	12	Accepting bitcoin isn’t the issue, there’s ways to do it. But how does a merchant integrate that sale, incl. the payment, the inventory, accounts, and many other aspects linked to an individual sale? This attitude of shouting down 3rd party systems is pushed throughout bitcoin related subreddits, and each one is almost completely uneducated to what being a ‘merchant’ means.It’s not just selling a product and accepting a payment. A good POS system integrates that sale for merchants - inventory adjustments, reporting, accounting, and usually an eCommerce platform. Expecting merchants to perform external adjustments to pre-exisiting systems is naive. It takes the technological advancement in merchant systems backwards.Any payment method, regardless of what it is, needs to exist within a POS for a merchant to use it efficiently.Not all merchants are Amazon level equipped with developers, and their own custom built systems (which technically makes a merchant its own 3rd party anyway?) - most merchants are small, and use existing systems to manage business, Square is one, there’s many others.Yes privacy and peer to peer are important factors to what makes bitcoin - but it’s detrimental to its development to put road blocks in place with blanket ideology if it makes no sense when you understand or recognise the specifics of merchant adoption.
4	1523263011	-7	For fuck sake, there are tons of ways to do it, easy way, no need for devs.  You keep your existing system, no need to change anything. Only instead of taking cash you take BTC by scanning a QR code, that's it. Use your brain!
5	1523275503	2	Do you mind listing an easy way to integrate what my current POS system does with BTC without using a third party? I'd love to accept bitcoin. >Only instead of taking cash you take BTC by scanning a QR code, that's it.For the record, this would not come even close to working, because my inventory is not valued in btc, I can not report in BTC, and I need to be able to report BTC sales in dollars for people that do not use BTC. By the way, are you the bitcoin-yoda on twitter tooo? I enjoy your tweets, if so. Keep it up. 
6	1523276729	-1	>because my inventory is not valued in btc,  No need to be, when you charge the product, you input the value in fiat and your wallet will show up the value in BTC. Why is so difficult to understand this simple process? There are tons of videos and solutions for POS systems with BTC if you really want to fully integrate your BTC wallet into your accounting apps. But is not really not necessary. When is about to take the money, just show up a watch only wallet, put the amount in fiat and then show to the customer the generated QR code that already includes the amount in BTC. Customer just scan&pay. Now you have recorded your sale as usual in your existing system, you pay taxes as usual for your sales. Bitcoin is just another payment method.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Keap3VFnc  https://youtu.be/Hhqo0AgfaB8  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUyK69pHtEE  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bitcoin+pos/r/Bitcoin/comments/1vaa2l/this_is_what_ive_been_working_on_for_the_past_few/  /r/Bitcoin/comments/856mj7/bitcoin_payment_solutions_for_merchants_that/  >By the way, are you the bitcoin-yoda on twitter tooo?  I have nothing to do with that tweeter account, I do not use any other social media than reddit.
7	1523277208	3	Zero of the links you posted can address what my current POS system does. Why is it so difficult to understand the basic concept that merchants will not make their lives harder to accept a payment option that offers few additional customers, and zero additional utility? 
8	1523277299	-2	Then don't accept it if is hard for you. Use fiat.
9	1523292641	1	*Woosh*
5	1523281606	1	You didn’t even read the comment. 
3	1523246415	4	Because this takes 0 effort and maintenance right? I think most businesses have better things to worry about than learning how to keep track of new numbers and wallets.Op is just saying that if square started to allow their customers to accept bitcoin it would open a huge market, allowing for much growth of bitcoin.But as someone else stated it's not too likely as people would start to learn how to use btc and this would lower squares profits. 
2	1523239821	3	Square doesn’t decide whether businesses want to accept bitcoin, businesses do. So, again, given how businesses can already easily just download a wallet and charge bitcoin, how is square going to increase bitcoin adoption? 🤔🤔
3	1523240243	9	Inertia. Any changes, no matter how good/beneficial, will face resistance because change takes effort. Businesses may be thinking about accepting bitcoin, but it would require them to 1. Learn about wallets and other technicals 2. Make the concious/work to implement 3. Mentally accept the 'risks' as they perceive it. Square implementing it accross their network could make it really easy to make the decision and accelerate adoption. Also a bigger entity condoning it would validates the tech for smaller entities.
4	1523240364	1	Fair enough 👍
