0	1523231336	12	>The first rumors began surfacing back in 2017 when Rothschild began purchasing cryptocurrency through GBTC. Buying into a major Bitcoin Trust is pretty significant, even for this family’s legacy.First, there were not "rumors", you could see the data openly. I don't have time to dig up the quarterly books (on the way to see ready player one!), but the most basic of reddit searching could have directed you to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6oxqw7/rothschild_bought_bitcoin_today_via_bitcoin/dklgwhj/)....> > This is false hype; It is actually pretty ridiculous that people are falling for this.> > 'Rothschild Investment Corp, IL' has NO RELATION to the Banking Family of 'Rothschilds'.> > http://www.rothschildinv.com/firm-history/> > "Rothschild & Company was founded in 1908 by Monroe Rothschild and his brother-in-law Samuel Karger."> http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/business/wall-street-playing-games-with-names.html?mcubz=0> > "Monroe Rothschild founded Rothschild Securities in 1905. He never claimed a tie to the banking family, said his nephew, Robert S. Karger, the firm's chairman.> "We're not trying to be deceptive with the name," Mr. Lieberman said. Since Rothschild Lieberman's business is with other broker firms, rather than retail customers, there is little likelihood clients would mistake it for a bank, he said."Very shoddy "journalism".Also, "entering the market" does not necessarily mean buying. For all we know these people are going to short the shit out of btc, causing massive panic, then buying at the bottom to control the supply. Thats what I would do if I had billions.
1	1523271183	2	You'd enter the market at this point to short something that's already down 70%? Rockefeller manage a VC arm, and they partnered with Coinfund to fund blockchain projects. I don't know what Soros is up to though.
2	1523278492	1	Why they should keep shorting ? Because they can do it. It’s as simple as that, they’re not young investors playing with 300$ from their school bench. They’re here to make the maximum profit. 
3	1523281764	1	Short, but how would they get bitcoin to drop. If they went long, all the while buying bitcoin, they could pump to $100k if they wanted and then short to $1k with their bitcoin.
4	1523290288	1	Lower it gets, easier the manipulation. 
4	1523290989	1	Because dropping the price to $3-4k to accumulate makes their future gains way bigger. Don't believe this BS anyway. They've been buying OTC for years. The only reason this is public info is because they're trying to make you think a certain way (that the price will go up). So almost certainly the opposite will happen. 
2	1523285050	1	Yes, this is the perfect time to enter and short.
2	1523288394	1	> You'd enter the market at this point to short something that's already down 70%?You mean up 700% YOY?Yes, I do think there's plenty of room to short. I can be wrong of course, but with enough money I could turn that wrong into a right.
1	1523271781	1	Thank you...I'm so weary of these bro-bloggers who have no interest in doing actual research. The Rothschild myth is particularly hard to dispel because it feeds so conveniently into the 'muh lamboz' narrative. Hey, anything for those clicks, right?
2	1523288350	1	> The Rothschild myth is particularly hard to dispel because it feeds so conveniently into the 'muh lamboz' narrative.I would say that the rothschild trash is aimed at culturing FOMO towards left leaning conspiracy theorists.
0	1523216398	19	This is the natural order of bitcoin: Enthusiasts>Black Market>Small high frequency Trading firms>Retail Speculation>Family Offices>Early Vendors>Insitutions>Retail investors>Late Vendors>Central Banks
1	1523231040	3	but if banks get in their making their own doom
2	1523239643	15	Not really. Banking will always exist because lending will always exist. Individuals don't have the resources to conduct credit analysis, and so its better for a bank to do it.But yeah banks will lose margin on money transmission probably.
3	1523246966	6	... Banks conduct credit analysis?  Could have fooled me
3	1523256018	3	> But yeah banks will lose margin on money transmission probably.At least where I live, money transmission is a cost center for banks. Profit is made with other services. Some regulations limit on how much bank can charge on money transfers.I agree that banking will always exist, but also for the reason that many people have a preference to make their money transfers via a service.
3	1523258010	1	they are giving more then they have right now so that will allso stop
3	1523265141	1	Actually like any other service there are many reasons to outsource dealing with finances to professionals, and banks will definitely find they niche. Let's face it - most people cannot be "their own bank" in terms of operational security alone. But bitcoin gives alternative for those who can, and this is good enough for me.
3	1523263684	0	Decentralised crowd loans 
2	1523239801	4	Like how telecom companies that adapted to and incorporated the internet made their own doom ..... no, the opposite is true.
2	1523272607	2	Businesses will always need financing and loans regardless of the currency. Bitcoin kills central banking, not banks.
0	1523242410	9	OMG, the conspirscy theories on this thread are hilariously ridiculous
1	1523256845	3	As is tradition when Rothschild is mentioned
1	1523244127	2	conspiracies happen all the time,check the history books
2	1523255612	2	one man's "price manipulation" is another man's BTFD and HODL
3	1523262974	2	I don't know if I would HODL with this guy. He usually pushes prices down in an effort to destroy something. Look what he has done to currency manipulation in poor countries. 
4	1523266075	1	Did u just inadvertently explain the last three months? /s
0	1523216923	32	Soros will short this thing sub 1k... not good news.
1	1523230946	29	Soros was able to build a massive position on the pound because it was easy to acquire quietly and anonymously.Obtaining enough bitcoin to massively corner the market is all but impossible.  He would have to acquire several million over the counter, or somehow without the market figuring it out (impossible).Bitcoin whale wallets are known, there owners are sometimes a mystery, but large sums of bitcoin rarely move without someone knowing about it.  The same cannot be said about the pound or any other currency Soros might have shorted in the past. Can he do it? Sure.  He'd have to acquire and maintain hundred of small wallets over the course of a few years, moving them in and out without drawing too much suspicion.  But so could any other person and the variables of bitcoin appreciation and depreciation are vastly different and wildly out of his control.If he's shorting bitcoin he's doing a piss poor job of it so far.  No massive spike and no massive dump.  Gradually picking away at the price of bitcoin over the course of several months is not Soros' MO.
2	1523238225	7	great perspective never thought about it this way
2	1523241038	6	trying to short a deflationary currency?, interesting, cant wait to see how it ends.
3	1523265247	1	It's pretty easy to do. there are always decent dips. 
4	1523276468	1	Always decent dips™
5	1523277070	1	Look at the history.
2	1523244223	5	Really? > Obtaining enough bitcoin to massively corner the market is all but impossible. He would have to acquire several million over the counter, or somehow without the market figuring it out (impossible).How can this be a rebuttal to OPDo you know how shorting works? Only like 1% of bitcoin moves the markets on a daily basis so all he would have to do is go to a couple pools and say "hey would you like to earn interest on all that 100 Billion worth of bitcoin you guys never move at any price?" and they would accept that and he would take that bitcoin and sell it on the open market.Shorting works by borrowing fungible assets, selling it ..... sitting on your hands ..... and then buying and identical asset back at a lower price, and giving it back to the person you borrowed it from. You just keep the difference in price.If Mt Gox can barely sell 7,000 Bitcoin without crashing the market, someone that borrows 500,000 bitcoin for the sole purpose of selling can easily make their profit.
3	1523245319	2	This works well in leveraged markets where long investors are forced to lend their assets because they have large debt positions too. BTC is a completely different market.
4	1523245928	0	EhhhhhhhhhhhhYou can increase your yield by lending bitcoin right nowIf you are in the 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin crowd and you just want cash flow to acquire more then you can accomplish that by lending it outSeveral institutional firms offer that, Genesis OTC desk was sending out announcement emails like 2 months ago
5	1523248271	0	So why would I exchange my highly deflationary BTC against counter party risk for a few percentage points of yield? That would be outright stupid. 
6	1523248779	2	Because the counterparties have gotten more professionalAnd greedYou honestly just described the entire bond and treasuries market
7	1523251479	0	Right, but this is not how Bitcoin works.
8	1523273049	3	This is how anyone with an investment mindset works, regardless of the underlying asset. And that's the first lesson of financial engineering (and yes, the biggest danger) - the actual thing being traded is reduced to an abstraction. Or, as they say, securitized.
3	1523247835	2	> someone that borrows 500,000 bitcoinGood luck hiding that transaction from the rest of us.
4	1523248660	1	Right yeah the days destroyed would be seen by everyone before any selling took placePoint is that a relatively tiny amount of bitcoin can sink the markets 10, 20 30% like with the mt gox trustee sells
2	1523277347	1	Could buy Satoshi's keys as well as other wallets OTC.
2	1523241851	0	...huh? It would be easy af to move tons. You just accumulate however much a day over a long period of time. You don't *have* to send it all to the same wallet address. For all you know, Soros could be responsible for all the buying pressure. We have no idea.
3	1523242557	3	...thats what I said.
4	1523243396	0	> Bitcoin whale wallets are known, there owners are sometimes a mystery, but ***large sums of bitcoin rarely move without someone knowing about it.*** The same cannot be said about the pound or any other currency Soros might have shorted in the past...no, *that's* what you said..
5	1523243531	1	> He'd have to acquire and maintain hundred of small wallets over the course of a few years, moving them in and out without drawing too much suspicion.I know what I said. Im literally agreeing with you.
6	1523244511	0	No you aren't because I think Soros could easily accumulate tons of coins and no one would know. You literally said > large sums of bitcoin rarely move without someone knowing about it. I think that happens constantly..You are saying he couldn't or it would be prohibitively difficult... what...
7	1523247655	2	rarely =/= neverIm not even sure why you are arguing at this point.
8	1523249343	1	By default in most wallets addresses are deterministic and each receive is new... not rarely..
1	1523220787	32	After that he will pump it to 150k. Just hodl
1	1523228953	7	Too stupid to short at 70% down from ATH. He's way better going long. The risk is now to the downside not the upside. They're not know for being precisely scalpers; they do 10 year bets.
2	1523278180	1	What do you think happened just hours ago? A natural drop in btc due to a change in underlying fundamentals?
3	1523288928	1	I don't care what just happened hours ago.  Did you not read my comments? I said Soros is NOT a scalper so I don't think he gives a shit that it just rotated down some dollars. He is thinking big. :-)
2	1523260472	1	Best comment so far in here. People don't seem to get that you have to be in the Bitcoin market to move the market. Right now is the ideal time to get in, I actually think the rebounds are being caused a lot by institutional investors and once they've built their positions the narratives in mainstream news will change and begin to pump crypto. Then at the point that the average person begins to enter they will all dump their positions into them and buy back in at the bottom. For all we know this is what happened on the run to 20k.
3	1523276473	2	Yeah it was a great time to buy at 17k, 14k, 11k, 9k, etc. True is you don't know how long the bear market will last.
4	1523291226	1	I'm sorry you bought at the wrong times but Soros is not you. You are not Soros or the investment world. This article is referring to what actual professional hedge fund managers are doing. That's it. I can't respond for well intended individual/retail market frustrations or even hopes.My only individual contribution really was that it seems now to be a good time to go long since typically 70% drops are more than enough to at least have a rally. I am more hopeful than not hopeful based on that risk profile. Of course, anything can happen and who knows for how long too ;-). 
5	1523292936	1	I'm not a bitcoin investor, but I can guarantee you Soros will make a killing by shorting the market.
6	1523293307	1	Think about it. You'd be competing against a Ton of money that already got in and he usually doesn't join late. He also owns crypto start-up stock so he'd hurt his own portfolio. You can't  make shit guarantees if you are not an investor. Again, stop thinking he thinks like you.
7	1523294539	1	No such thing as a guarantee, but it's actually ridiculous to suggest that you can't make an assessment about an asset if you're not invested in it. 
8	1523294832	1	Don't distort my words: I never said that you have to invest in IT but to *being* an investor of that sort. 
2	1523232255	0	We can go down to 1.3k and test the last bull run all time high, in fact that is what i think will happen.
3	1523234273	1	I said the risk is now to the downside (less resistance to go up at this point. No need to be dramatic. This is not armageddon but only a correction in the long run) ; not that it's impossible to go further down but So far behaving well..
4	1523236338	0	Look at the volume on every exchange for BTC then you will see this is already dead. #HODLgang #REKT
3	1523235063	0	You are watching too much Tone Vays.
4	1523269428	2	Look at the chart, this thing is about to die.
5	1523296652	1	Ok, then go short.
1	1523239509	4	He can't short if we hold our coins OFF exchanges! 
2	1523241665	2	Wut
3	1523243000	2	How shorting works is that an exchange lends people stock (or bitcoin) with the promise of getting it back later with interest. This stock (or bitcoin) comes from deposits. If we all keep our bitcoin off exchanges, it limits the amount that shorters have access to.
4	1523247998	1	> If we all keep our bitcoin off exchangesThat isnt what happens, nor would it ever happen.  
5	1523248784	1	Not true necessarily. If exchanges continue to be hacked itll be more important to keep bitcoin personally secured.
1	1523217954	3	Lets give him a try
2	1523231274	7	No, sorry. Not him.
1	1523224563	1	My sentiments exactly
1	1523224826	1	A bad news for he ahahaha
1	1523227458	1	i think the many will catch the few...they are likely to try...and earn a very bad reputation in the process
1	1523244102	1	He cannot borrow massive amounts of coins in order to short them. 
1	1523258063	1	Why would he push it to 1k when he could also push it to 100,000 and make more?  
1	1523222729	1	Assuming he owns a lot of bitcoin. If he doesn't, he can't short it.
2	1523234913	2	That's not how shorting works.>Shorting, or short-selling, is when an investor **borrows** shares and immediately sells them, hoping he or she can scoop them up later at a lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.
2	1523227088	-2	Big players buy Bitcoin OTC at a discount, only relatively small traders and plebs buy from exchanges.
3	1523230467	1	God, I'm getting so sick of these nonsensical OTC theories. As if these coins would grow on trees or so.
4	1523234144	1	I agree with you on most of these, but when the Gox seller is looking to sell enough coin to take us to $2k on any single exchange by selling just 1/12 of what he wants to sell, I think it's safe to say that an OTC buy trade might be very feasible for certain large holders right now.
3	1523230797	0	It’s not that easy to find sellers at this price for bulk btc even with btc farms (miners) it’s a process but not everyone is willing to sell at a discounted rate for bulk buyers 
4	1523232200	2	There is no lack of sellers what are you talking about.
5	1523260660	1	This is the most redundant sentence I've ever seen here.
6	1523264958	1	Did i hurt your feelings, are you a holder?
7	1523273240	1	>Did i hurt your feelingsNo I was just stating a fact. The volume of sellers or buyers is determined in the market and shown by rising or falling price *at that time*.
5	1523232396	0	I’m talking about sellers to sell in bulk for OTC all that is off market at a certain price fix, I’m just going by some that I tried setting up try to go out and see if someone will try to sell you 50k btc at a -6% rate and see if you can find someone that sells if you do let me know lol
6	1523232660	1	I mean, has anyone who thought Soros was the boogeyman figured out exactly how many bitcoins he'd have to buy OTC to short the market to oblivion?You can buy quite a bit on the OTC market if you know where to get it, but you cant buy that much and I highly doubt any person with a few hundred thousand bitcoin would give Soros or anyone remotely associated with him the time of day given his history.Yeah, you might make a quick $200million, but you'd be found out eventually and you'd be known as that one guy who sold his bitcoin to Soros.And no, miners arent going to sell to you, because if your MO was to short it to zero, itd really fuck up their business model.
7	1523235743	1	Now that i can agree with you on we can’t get beat by them if we make them earn it like we did lol but even then who knows 
8	1523236418	1	The great thing about bitcoin is that anyone can buy it, no matter their race, creed or nationality.The bad thing about bitcoin is that anyone can buy it, no matter their race, creed or nationality.  The fact of the matter is that someone with a couple million to burn can own a vast amount more bitcoin than either you nor I ever could.
7	1523238437	1	what a great point!  That's like me selling CD's to a distributor who goes and destroys them so that nobody hears my music.  
3	1523232558	-3	Lol 😂 your full of shit. You have no clue at all how otc works.
1	1523231259	1	Concur. That thing is a vile creature.
0	1523221972	7	With all the lost BTC there are what.. probably only 16 million BTC in existence at the moment? Go ahead and short Soros.. 
1	1523234895	16	You think only 1 million bitcoin are lost? Yea nup. It's going to be more like 3 to 4 million btc lost.
2	1523259452	2	At least.
3	1523264211	0	I'm making a personal call now - bitcoin will be the last great "treasure hunt."Going forward we will devise a method of retrieval for lost accounts.Until that time I propose a 100yr rule, where if a wallet lay dormant for 100years, with no activity to or fro, it is determined by the network to be deceased and thus redistributed to the miners in the next block.
4	1523286252	1	Until satoshis wallet is "deceased" then were really fucked. 
2	1523277503	1	Yea nup.. I meant after all BTC are mined.. 
0	1523227306	6	We are here to destroy the banks, and now the banks are spending money on bitcoin. They will be prepared to lose a lot of money to get rid of bitcoin when they perceive it as a threat. Widespread adoption is the only countermeasure. 
0	1523227989	11	My guess is that if these billionaires are telling us now they are getting in it means they are already in and possibly lost a lot and now are using this to get others going so they can get out. They are rich for a reason, they don't think and behave like the rest of us. IF they really are just getting in now you will see BTC rise significantly within weeks. However, I think the past rise was because they got in and some did not get out on time. They are lining up the sheep, something the rich investment bankers are masters at. We will see what happens, my personal opinion is that they are looking to get out, not in. 
1	1523234944	9	> and possibly lost a lot and now are using this to get others going so they can get out. this is where you lost me. That is the least likely scenario.
2	1523239544	3	Somebody sponsored the bull-run to 20k. If it was mainly Soros and friends, done in an attempt to make a quick profit, then exiting now, would certainly be at a loss.
3	1523240253	6	I know a lot of losers who got in around $19k.  But I doubt these guys go chasing parabolic markets.  Certainly it got their attention though, and it wouldn't surprise me if they had studied it and are now looking,waiting for an entry.
2	1523260552	2	Because you live on a planet that only feeds you the success of these people. They win more than they lose, but to think they don't lose is childish. 
1	1523236626	3	Maybe the got in shorting 4 months ago and now they start long. 
1	1523239557	2	Not necessarily. They could be already in and want to show it confidence. They do this with all their high profile investments too.
2	1523258220	1	Can be this, i think they are starting to talking about crypto as a whole, to give ppl confidence, and when we will get to 20k they will start to focus on a single cryptos they have invested in, to promote it for a huge profits. Its just like us, first it was bitcoin, now we are all shilling our portfolio alts
2	1523260604	0	Wishful thinking can be totally destructive for someones wealth, grow the hell up
3	1523281127	1	Leave troll
4	1523281237	0	Throwing childish tantrums again? 
1	1523228542	3	no,they will never get out...all they do is sell back and forth to each other driving the price down and grab more from the weak hands
2	1523288238	1	Except if it's worth nothing why own a bunch of it? Eventually they'll want value out of it, or they're just destroying it for incremental fiat gains.

1	1523245266	2	If you believe that, than you believe that the future is already written (which is bullshit), nobody can control anything in this world.  If anything, "they" want people to "think" they are in control when they are along for the ride like the rest of us. The earth is too big and way to powerful for any being to control.

4	1523249666	1	no man,this would be an entire industry of professionals that know all the tricks,have the best bots and in league with each other,that is 1 thing..but the other thing is they take orders from govs,which take orders from the mega,mega rich and powerful whoever they are...you think they like bitcoin?..no man they dont...they likely will set a price that says bitcoin should be worth 'x' and they know all the tricks to do that...and they could do this with any coin...im very interested to see if they can do this,an what price they try to keep it at...but i think bitcoin has the ability to fork them off worst case...but that would take some serious investigative work from the bitcoiners...lol which would likely push those financial elite to use underground methods to protect themselves from being forked off...so hopefully that will make them criminals and put them in jail lolol )) ...hold your coins im guessing within a year or 2 we will see forks trying to remove these forces and dividing the coins among those not connected to this type of manipulation...bitcoin is a different beast than what they used to...lets see what happens
0	1523245318	2	Misleading title, in 2 ways:1- (as said below) entering the market does not mean buying. They can short it too. (Even though I doubt they will short BTC)2- the article mentions “cryptocurrencies” and the author keeps calling BitcoinThere are strong chances that these guys will not even touch any BTC. They will invest in projects where they know the team and can buy otc deals, ie not on markets. More money will flow into alts (top coins 1st, for liquidity reasons) than in BTC, or even ETH or XMR. It’s crypto-VC we are witnessing.
1	1523258626	2	This, its just like Vechain, they have big investors but these investors didnt bought vechain from the market, they bought millions of them from the foundation OTC.

When you think about it, he probably doesn't even object to the idea: a borderless, trans-national currency. Same ideals as his Open Society organization.I wonder if he has access to Satoshi's real identity. I'm sure the NSA knows. Seeing as he's always in the news it's likely he takes orders from above, so he's probably not privvy to that info.

0	1523285180	1	That's funny, yesterday we see a blaring headline here:"Soros, Rothschild, and Big Institutional Investors are Entering Bitcoin Market" (with zero details).Today we see another r/bitcoin headline: "Bitcoin tanks beneath $7,000, down 6% out of two hours" So maybe the mythical big whales will buy into the dip and up BTC again goes?Or how about stop the hype and pumping? 
0	1523288380	1	It is so amazing how foaming at the mouth people get when you mention either of those two names.
0	1523213809	0	So soon we will have a lot of BTC going to burned address... Soros being greedy as fuck will go soon with his shitloads of BTC into his grave...  Guys, we will have less than 21 millions BTC in circulation.
1	1523222489	7	[Chainalysis estimates](http://fortune.com/2017/11/25/lost-bitcoins/) that over 4 million bitcoins are lost forever. They are forever out of circulation due to loss of keys, thrown away hard drives, etc. 
2	1523223034	-5	Goood! I hope Soros will lost another 4 millions...
1	1523223070	2	That only increases prices. 
0	1523222658	1	Ever heard of shorting the market?
1	1523245818	1	Exactly.Now, bc these guys announce that they are “going to” enter the market... they may have already bought weeks ago
0	1523226824	1	Do the opposite.  This means they are selling.  I wouldn't be too optimistic.  I am still waiting for the Chinese new years to end and all that tax return money to come pouring in.  
0	1523233356	1	What about a way to completely abandon ship and tank the value to nothing. Everyone moving to something new they (the banks) can’t control or access. Bitcoins bitcoin lolAlso sorry for my ignorance. I’m neither invested in crypto nor have the background in finance. Just sick of seeing those wealthy bastards win every time
