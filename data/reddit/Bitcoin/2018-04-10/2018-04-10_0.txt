1	1523371394	9	you are good bot, happy cake day
0	1523357172	113	Just be patient - this lull will likely go on until the halveningOnly 2 more years to go!
1	1523363693	36	I believe that this is the worst case scenario. Even if im wrong i know Bitcoin will recover long term. Honestly I like Bitcoin being down for a bit so I can buy more now.
2	1523380384	1	> I believe that this is the worst case scenarioWhy? I feel like a nice 2 year lull is the best case scenario. We need the time to make lightning mature, for btrash and other alts to die off, and for an overall improvement in the software ecosystem. And this is money we are talking about: longevity and stability of value are everything. Some appreciation is unavoidable because the dollar always drops over time; but racing ahead in bubbles is not better than crashes. slow steady growth is just far better.
3	1523385856	1	This...If bitcoin moons overnight it will mean our economy has shit the bed
4	1523387175	1	Which...don't count out.
2	1523372828	7	> Even if im wrong i know Bitcoin will recover long term. Nobody outside of the crypto community cares about Bitcoin any more.  The rest of the financial world is actively shunning it.  Stores are dropping their Bitcoin support, banks are one again disallowing transactions for buying crypto.It's becoming less useful, and something big is going to have to happen to turn that around.  It's reputation in the public's eye used to be "innovative, the future of money!", now it's "a scam / bubble that popped / technology to facilitate crime".Those trends are very difficult to reverse.
3	1523378642	1	You obviously don't read anything outside of this sub . . . because some of the biggest names in finance are busy setting up crypto funds. Here we have [George Soros](http://fortune.com/2018/04/06/george-soros-cryptocurrency-hedge-fund-bitcoin/) then we have [Novogratz](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/09/another-goldman-exec-dumps-wall-street-for-crypto-world.html) who hired a Goldman exec for a crypto fund.    Remind me again how mainstream finance is 'shunning' it? 
4	1523384449	1	Because anecdotes are better than your sources, duh.
4	1523384953	1	> technology to facilitate crimeI believe I mentioned this.
3	1523379282	1	A few credible source are saying that OTC bitcoin demand is like nothing before. Billion sized blocks.
3	1523379538	1	Are you in the crypto community? If not then why are you here? If so why are you in it?I'll wait
4	1523380721	1	I own bitcoin.  I bought in at $2500, so I'm still in the green.  I am not bullish on bitcoin, but I take a long position for the entertainment.
5	1523381265	1	are you u/midnitewarrior's alternate account?
6	1523383193	1	nope not me.
3	1523380057	1	Multiple futures available. Etf back on table. Countries not banning it. CNBC gives crypto a good amount of air time. Global politics worsening. The best time to invest is before the public herd follows.
3	1523374555	1	"Nobody outside of the crypto community cares about Bitcoin any more."False.  Some of the best and brightest minds in the world thinking about and/or working on Bitcoin."The rest of the financial world is actively shunning it."False again.  Shill score currently 2/10."Stores are dropping their Bitcoin support"Stores have never really supported it to begin with.  It has always been fringe, and mainstream adoption has not occurred yet.  Good thing too, because it wasn't ready yet, we needed to scale it properly first.  Shill score 3/10."banks are once again disallowing transactions for buying crypto"Banks had better be scared of Bitcoin, because eventually it will replace them.  Fuck banks with a rusty screw driver.  Your argument is vague, and ignores the fact that banks have been banning/unbanning crypto transactions since the beginning.  Shill score 4/10."It's becoming less useful, and something big is going to have to happen to turn that around."False, it is becoming more useful everyday.  Not only are new scaling solutions and capabilities being merged into the code over time, it is also becoming more secure.  Shill score 5/10."It's reputation in the public's eye used to be "innovative, the future of money!", now it's "a scam / bubble that popped / technology to facilitate crime"You are a shill, not just a normal Negative Nancy.  You are more than just a guy on Reddit who wants to take a shit on Bitcoin.
4	1523376938	1	The amount of Bitcoin ATM's in my city have gone up 1200% in 6 months. 
5	1523377297	1	So now there's 12?
6	1523379576	1	That's hilarious and probably true.
7	1523380068	1	And that would mean there would be at least 1 for every 5 - 10 minute drive in my city. That's not bad at all.
8	1523384336	1	That is about right. Also buying a flexepin voucher to get bitcoin from quadrigacx has been interesting...the stores keep hitting their limits. Lots of people buying crypto. 
6	1523384275	1	More than that. We almost have as many Bitcoin ATM's as bank branches. A couple local business people have been very aggressive. 
4	1523374827	1	Thank you for saving me the time to write that identical post. 98% of my thoughts were captured by you.
5	1523378893	1	Yeah, its like when Bitcoin went from $1 to $26 and crashed back down, and the time it went from $40 to $250 and crashed back down, or the time it went from $200 to $1200 and crashed back down.  Every time it was "dead".See a pattern?
6	1523379838	1	I remember the 1200-> 140 crash and thinking it was a bunch of silliness. Boy was I wrong.. 
4	1523375384	1	> "Nobody outside of the crypto community cares about Bitcoin any more."> False. Some of the best and brightest minds in the world thinking about and/or working on Bitcoin.https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoinChange to 5 year view and you will get an even bigger picture of how bitcoin has fallen out of favor.
5	1523378026	1	> Change to 5 year viewWhat are you talking about?  Interest in bitcoin is higher than it was than even the last bubble.
6	1523380266	1	Google disagrees, do you understand what Google Trends represents?
7	1523380549	1	I guess not.  Care to explain?
5	1523381477	1	That chart looks very similar to the price of bitcoin over the last 5 years. That being said, how does the amount of google search results determine that it is now out of favor? Because not as many people now are googling the term? It spiked in December from like $5,000 up to $20,000 so yeah, more people were inclined to see what all the fuss was about and your graph is now tapering off to pre-boom levels, which the price is also doing(who’d have thought one affected the other). Wait a year then run your google search result again and the chart will most likely look the same, steady for the last 4 years then a spike around December-January. Most people somewhat involved in crypto don’t google search bitcoin. Those google searches are for the people that have never heard about it and saw some fake internet money went 4x in a month and wanted to know what was up. You should check the trading volume to determine what is in and or if favor.lol 
6	1523384386	1	and the price spiked in correlation with the google searches #BRILLIANTNow that there is no interest, do not expect a public spike any time soon.This was the part of the thread in which all of this is irrelevant which you seem to forget:> Nobody outside of the crypto community cares about Bitcoin any more. [(loose) comparison](https://i.imgur.com/bjCoOjQ.png)
4	1523386871	1	Best part of the next big run up will be watching guys like the one you're responding to sputter and cry, "Bu... bu... bubble! Waaaa! I want magic Internet money too!" :))
3	1523380825	1	Lots of BS in this sub, but this takes the cake. Literally the opposite of the truth on virtually every count, except that the public perception is that it's a popped bubble.
3	1523381727	1	Lightning Network!
3	1523374600	1	There was a bubble with the internet? Same thing happened. Didn't disappear just because of that. 
3	1523373574	2	I hope you didn't get downvoted because objectively your comment is spot on.  I hope the devs keep developing to allow more scalability.  Because we truly need another fiat crisis like Cyprus to get people back in.  However, we have never seen how btc performs in an actual crisis situation.  
3	1523378433	1	"something big is going to have to happen to turn that around" And we know what it will be: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sIYG2PA1PY
3	1523380418	1	Lol. No. 
3	1523380898	1	I hope you realize people have been saying this for years, and yet 19k still happened....
3	1523380661	1	> Nobody outside of the crypto community cares about Bitcoin any more.so true, I just came here to day to see if the same spin 'good for bitcoin....' was going around.It is.
2	1523372696	0	I hope we'll soon break below the February low and start an actual downtrend. Prices in the 1500-2000 range would be nice. 
1	1523369299	8	I'm more optimistic , i think we will be closer or above 100k by the next halving.  
2	1523373595	18	Being that it took everyone and their grandmother to get BTC to $20K, what will it take to get BTC to $100K?
3	1523376900	1	Everyone? US, while being one of the most saturated BTC markets, only reached 5% saturation and that's optimistic. Most of these people also weren't fully aware of what they're getting into.
3	1523375648	1	see i disagree that everybody invested on the ride to 20k.  Out of lets say 100ppl i told about Crypto over last summer, i can only count 4 ppl who bought.  And a lot of them sold once their money doubled, cause they just speculated on it and never understood it.  I think once the price clearly stabilizes and creeps back up to lets say 15k, we could have the next biggest FOMO, but it won't necessarily be your next door neighbor. More like the infamous institutional money
3	1523374606	1	Everyone and their grandmother *bought* at 20k.
4	1523382266	1	How is this true when the most user-friendly ways to buy, Coinbase, was backed up in December. Gemini, too, wasn't up-to-speed in signing new people up during the run up and only now is able to process new accounts. I'm not sure grandmothers were out there buying up bitcoin at 20k...trying to, maybe....
3	1523385513	1	Great grandmothers
2	1523377850	1	I bet my entire portfolio with will be between the current price and $100k by then.
1	1523361333	2	Halvening?
2	1523376472	1	http://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/
2	1523370604	0	When supply cuts in half 
3	1523373856	1	Supply doesn't get cut in half, it's the block reward for miners that will get cut in half.
4	1523376664	1	I should say, Inflation will cut in half 
5	1523377330	1	Try again
6	1523378277	1	I don't have to 
7	1523384546	1	One more time c'mon 
8	1523385073	1	> Inflation will cut in half 
1	1523373036	1	Although expect the the halving to be front run and the bull run to start about 9 months in advance.  So you only have to wait a little over a year.
1	1523380613	1	I love how a crypto "lull" can still yield 40-50% returns each month.. 
1	1523387154	1	oh good call!
1	1523363709	1	What is the halvening?
2	1523364837	11	An event is about to take place on the Bitcoin network that only happens roughly every four years. The amount of new bitcoin created and earned by miners with each new block of transactions is about to be cut in half. ... When these sorts of changes in bitcoin's inflation rate take place, it's known as a halving eventEdit: I copied and pasted from google. Sue me. Next halving event ETA May 30th 2020
3	1523365095	2	Interesting! One question, for miners isn't this bad and might make people move away from mining?
4	1523366771	15	If people move away from mining, it becomes more profitable for those who continue. 
5	1523367564	2	More profitable in the form of higher net work fees as well right? Less miners = less transaction speed = higher fees, am I correct in assuming that? Sorry.
6	1523374278	1	If people move away, there's less total hashpower and miners that stay in now have a higher percentage of total hashpower, so they're more likely to get the block rewards.&nbsp;Also, with less miners/hashpower, the difficulty will adjust downwards further increasing the effectiveness of rigs that stay online.
6	1523375831	1	The number of miners has nothing to do with the transaction speed. The algorithm self adjusts based on the total hash power(I.e. number of miners) so that blocks come in on an average time of 10min per block and each block is a fixed size. Fees are based on usage. Because block size and time is fixed, if more people want to use the network then the network can process those people have to start out bidding each other to get their transactions chosen for processing. 
6	1523367936	0	I'm not sure. The fees would probably stay the same as long as the mempool was empty. 
4	1523369108	4	At the first two halving price increased more than 2x so even hashrate increased.
4	1523368194	3	Mining is part of the equilibrium between the exchange rate, and the block reward, and the difficulty.So, to answer your question: yes, but if people stop mining, generally others would show up to take their place, because bitcoin's still valuable.
4	1523372980	3	Depends. The "Market" will see bitcoin as becoming more scarce (supply down, demand up) therefore price will go up. Making up the difference for the miners to keep mining even tho they get half the amount of bitcoins, they will be worth twice as much. Then one might say, if the price does not go up.. most miners will stop mining. When this happens, the bitcoin network difficulty will adjust automatically.. making it easier to mine, thus drawing miners back! It's beautiful how self-perpetuating it is. :)
4	1523369894	2	Yes. We would expect to see an immediate decrease in mining at that point. But not cut in half or anything, because the ASICs are specialized equipment and fees aren't getting cut in half. I also wouldn't expect the price of bitcoin to change a bunch because of it. People know it is coming up so it should be baked into the price.Edit: On second thought, about the reduction in mining: I am not sure now. I don't know what the reward elasticity (or whatever the heck you'd call it) would be. My gut tells me it would be less than unitary but my experience as a student of econ makes me not trust my gut.
5	1523376644	1	I don't know why you would think the next halving, which is two years away, is baked into the price.
6	1523377016	1	We know it's coming and we know when.
7	1523377615	1	By that logic, you could argue the next halving in 2024 is also baked into the price, and the one after that, and the one after that. It's estimated in 2036 99% of the bitcoins will be mined. Is that also baked into the price? Why or why not?There's probably some algorithm and terminology to explain this, but in my experience time period to said future event/move plays a factor in valuation. I could see if maybe the next halving was six months away, maybe even up to a year but that's pushing it, IMO.
8	1523378334	1	>Is that also baked into the price? Why or why not?Yes. Because we know it is going to happen and we know when. If you thought that it wasn't baked into the price, then you'd be able to profitably arbitrage until it was.
9	1523379577	1	If you're using future events to determine current valuation, time is definitely a factor. Not sure why you're ignoring that part of my discussion. You can see this best when comparing stock price to option valuation. Options often have expected earnings price moves baked-in to the price, which can make Iron Condors a good play, etc.Also, not sure on your definition of arbitrage...
4	1523370564	2	Less supply increases demand. 
4	1523372170	2	Its assumed a lower supply = higher price i.e. supply & demand, thats also assuming adoption continues to grow which is likely... halving will spark a new bull wave for sure, if we stay in this bear market until 6-12 months before the next halving the bull run will probably be massive.  Tho I'm expecting weekly RSI to get oversold at some point before the next real bull run begins, so until then we should all be just quick flipping crypto, using stop losses if ur long to protect capital.
3	1523367238	1	"About to take place".  In two years.
4	1523372157	1	Ya... i just copy/pasted what google showed me. This question has come up so many time i gave up actually trying.
3	1523368028	1	Deflation*
3	1523372125	1	“About to take place”Check halvening website: http://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/May 30th, 2020???
3	1523368007	-4	Stuff like this makes it so obvious that bitcoin will never be any kind of currency.  I mean you expect (and many are hoping for) the value of the currency to jump because of a completely predictable and internal function of it.  That's not something that's tolerable in a currency.
4	1523373578	7	Because random massive debasement for political reasons is just so much more tolerable than a predictable internal function. GTFO.
5	1523376203	1	Burned 
2	1523386365	1	I love halva dessert.
0	1523373910	1	Sometimes I feel like everyone in this sub bought at the all time high
1	1523378013	1	I did. Fortunately it was only $200.
1	1523379190	1	I'm think most people can only handle this place for about a year.
0	1523364530	44	This sub is becoming delusional. You guys must get down to earth and sooner the better. 
1	1523370772	26	Seriously. Will it go back up? Maybe. Maybe not. But I’m tired of hearing people hate on sellers, and yelling “REEE bull run incoming boys!” Like anyone knows what’s happening. Confirmation bias at its best, I guess.
1	1523379876	1	You're talking about the top comment that says it might take as long as the next halvening, right?
1	1523376056	1	Yep - I feel sorry for people who still have money tied into cryptocurrencies. I sold half at the double, so I'm in for a free ride, but honestly - I can't see it going back up to what it was. The bubble's burst but people are too busy telling themselves a bullrun is incoming to accept it.
2	1523376989	1	You don't trade just the company/fundamentals, you also trade the perception. Has perception changed on crypto to the point where nobody wants to buy it? No. Are people looking for investment alternatives? Yes.So honestly, tell me, why is it that you "can't see it going back up to what it was"?
3	1523385619	1	It was high, now it’s low, there’s no going back up, go up once, and if it doesn’t keep going up, then it’ll never go up again.Easy stuffThis has never happened in the history of bitcoin before, we’ve never hit an all time high and crashed the recovered, once it starts falling, it just keeps goingFree fallingExcept that time we hit $1300 then had a 2 year bear market which eventually turned into the most recent all time high run.But outside of that the trend line only goes down
4	1523385956	1	Your word salad is full of nonsense and you don't understand trend lines.

0	1523354010	12	See you guys on the moon
0	1523377746	1	whenever in my life I made money, it was when everyone was saying it was not the time to buy. whether it was a real estate, or some kind of stock. 
0	1523356362	3	Made me chuckle
0	1523362637	3	*sigh* have an upvote.
0	1523352658	4	Ha ha brilliant will there be room for me too
0	1523360524	2	Why do you assume there will be one?
1	1523380848	1	Look at a long term Bitcoin chart since 2011. (A log one)
1	1523360686	-3	While I'm no crypto enthusiast, markets and history always repeat themselves.
2	1523360890	11	still waiting for the next dot-com bubble.*edit* Not saying that bitcoin wont go up, but it could be really, really muted and drawn out over years compared to previous runs.
3	1523367249	7	it happened, just under the moniker of the app-startup bubble.
3	1523375416	1	When the dot-com bubble popped, the internet didn't disappear.
3	1523371916	5	>still waiting for the next dot-com bubble.This is hilarious. The world now literally revolves around the internet.
3	1523366387	1	you are? look at a chart of the DJIA, don't you see the QE bubble?
2	1523377479	1	That's the dumbest thing I've heard. Yeah markets always repeat themselves, blackberries totally going to go back up again. 
2	1523362106	7	If this was the case, we would all be rich as fuck because everyone would just buy after the bubble, knowing that there would be another run up.It's not. 
3	1523366524	14	when the dotcom bubble burst, i knew a small number of people who bought after the crash and they are doing well.when the housing market collapsed and took everything with it, i knew a small number of people who bought after the crash and they are doing well.when the next bubble collapses, i will also know a small number of people who have liquid assets that will invest again.the key here is having investable assets. Most people do not have investable assets, therefore, everyone wont ever be "rich as fuck" because hardly anyone is ever in a position to take advantage during a down market.
3	1523363126	1	Then if you made profits, sell and enjoy?I was lucky enough to sell everything two days before ATH in december (18k-ish).I'm waiting for the moment to re enter the market and I do believe that very long term we may beat december's highs but I doubt we hit the bottom yet.
2	1523377591	1	They will repeat, until they don't...
1	1523366466	-4	It’s a bull run already if you own verge. 🚀🚀

0	1523378209	1	I wish the bull run would hurry up
0	1523378762	1	It's extremely satisfying, but never changes anything. Either they're already kicking themselves and don't need you to rub it in, or they're still completely delusional and aren't swayed by real-life results. You were lucky! You successfully hyped it! Another lotto winner here, folks.
0	1523379497	1	Don't let the FUD catch you.
0	1523379850	1	Without having looked at the sub, as someone who's subscribed to r/spain I thought to myself "I thought they closed the streets to cars during the run"
0	1523380501	1	Holy shit, am I still in the same sub as before? Is this still the same /r/bitcoin that posted the bollywood movie gif and moon memes all the time when we went up? What the hell happened to you people? Why are you upvoting comments that say Bitcoin is over and may never get back up? Is someone using bought accounts to keep the mood down because they want to buy cheaper, or what?
1	1523382316	1	yes.

2	1523386031	1	Amazons adoption blew up. I order at least 10 items a month and its part of my daily life. its valuation is clear from a profitable standpoint, it could be overvalued but that is another argument.I dont particularly use bitcoin other than buy coins or sell it for more fiat. Non of the places I want to use it for accepts it and the fees made it unusable. Price is not equal to adoption. Till i see bitcoin actually being used for what it is, its a bust.
