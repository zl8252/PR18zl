0	1523373731	9	Always like me some popcorn and coffee together. Yum!
1	1523383735	1	Get that cappuccino flavored popcorn
0	1523364068	16	Emm...are they watching themselfs? It's more like "This is fine" on fire) 
1	1523371672	3	That's hodling for ya.
0	1523371440	6	Am I a horrible person if only invested what I afford to loose, made a shitton of money and now enjoy the drama of the "crash" drinking noob tears from a wine glass?I think I going to burn in hell...Hold, always hold!
1	1523382723	1	Yes, you are
0	1523361318	6	Heh.  That meme is exactly me.
0	1523372863	5	According to these subs, nobody has ever lost a dime in crypto. Everyone is a winner on the interwebs.
1	1523374571	1	You don't lose if you sell...or was if you don't lose if you buy? Well I guess no matter what, you don't lose!
1	1523378256	1	I mean obvously lots of people have lost money but i would imagine a bitcoin subreddit would have lots of early adopters. Also, wouldnt most people in crypto have made money.
1	1523382584	1	Sellers lose. This is a very long term revolution. Hodl some and then spend your time and effort to help the community become better.
1	1523382235	1	Everyone is a winner until they aren't, then they shutup about it.
0	1523369743	2	And sometimes I feel like I'm the one on TV...
0	1523365556	3	Exactly. This also describes me. I have a quite a nice of amount of my assets in crypto (which would be life changing  for some), but even if I lose it all I'm ok.
1	1523372930	1	Nobody, and I mean absolutely nobody is ok losing it all. Lose it all, then tell us if youâ€™re ok with it.
2	1523379056	1	You're biased towards your own perspective and experience. Just because you have never met someone who's ok losing money, doesn't mean they don't exist.
0	1523378644	1	I drew this a while back, glad to see it pop up again! :) 
0	1523379133	1	And I'm sitting here impatiently waiting for my next paycheck to buy the guacamole.
0	1523380922	1	Canâ€™t decide if I wanna buy myself an iMac or hodl. This might finally be my time, after a few good years.
0	1523384108	1	Sad, the titties are sideways.
0	1523352052	2	What are 'Hodlers'?
1	1523352145	16	Hodlers are the kind of people who will be rich in 10 years.
2	1523353256	5	So everyone who bought in December is not a Hodler?
3	1523367666	3	No we are the ones that bought through September 2015
4	1523385120	1	Yes, yes we are.
3	1523353427	6	ðŸ¤« means do not sell, hold it in bad times.ðŸ™‚
3	1523356623	5	Splendid...
2	1523360348	3	you either a: be a real hodl'er and forget that you have bitcoin for 5 years at least and don't waste your time checking up on the price all the time and write hodl hodl hodl. or b: If you see a big trend developing you just get out for a while and buy back in on the way down. I have already twice the amount of btc as I had in dec without spending any extra fiat. 
3	1523365244	5	For every person that accrues btc while trading, there's an equal and opposite group of people who bought high and sold low. Point being: it's random. Be careful.
4	1523365490	3	yep, or there is 1 dude acquiring and 10 idiots selling low.
5	1523368420	1	well don't be an idiot then. Now it is too late to sell ofc. I agree that if you never traded in your life and don't understand risk management or don't even know what Dollar cost averaging is better hodl but claiming that hodling is the best thing you can do when BTC goes down 70% is a joke. 
2	1523375244	1	In this unstable world of crypto, where everything can change instantly and there is no certainty in the future, you can be damn sure of only one thing: hodlers gonna hodl.Also haters gonna hate.
2	1523359725	-3	Holders are the people that will watch the price fall to 0 and think "this is fine". Keep it up with the memes, even though you're playing with your life savings.
3	1523373623	3	The trick is, you shouldnâ€™t be playing with your life savings. 
2	1523362240	0	*poor
1	1523352150	1	Hodlers.
1	1523379634	1	Welcome to /r/bitcoin, it's always nice to see new faces.
0	1523355129	1	Hold on for dear life
1	1523359384	7	it is not an acronym.. it's just a meme born from a typo
2	1523359423	7	I know, but it is very appropriate.
3	1523359746	-14	Quit being a parrot. HODL is a typo...not a goddamn acronym.Fucking newbs.
4	1523359804	12	Fuck off you tit.
4	1523374301	1	Exactly. Hodl was a typo for hold which is an acronym for Hold or lose dummy.
5	1523383942	1	Yep. Does no one even remember the old days?
1	1523364316	1	Noob
2	1523366492	1	Yawn.
1	1523362230	-4	It's funny as a joke but the fact that people take it seriously and are actually hanging onto something rapidly declining in value is very concerning. 
2	1523366943	2	Wayyyy too serious, lighten up.
2	1523372491	1	I think it's pretty sad, yes. I mean, all these huge losses so many people are making (not me, I know how to trade) could have been avoided by a little basic Dow theory. 
2	1523376984	1	> rapidly declining in valueLooks like a beloved ATH buyer.
3	1523379569	1	I bought at 1140$ the biggest part of my btc and yes btc is rapidly declining in value in the last 3 month. Just because something increased insanely fast in value doesn't mean a 70% drop in 3 month is not fast.
0	1523365879	0	I love it.
