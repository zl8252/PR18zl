0	1523314095	15	tl;dr    Early cryptocurrency investor Mike Novogratz hired Richard Kim from Goldman Sachs as the new COO of his crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital, says a person familiar with the matter.    Kim is the latest of a handful of Goldman Sachs executives to leave Wall Street for crypto start-ups.    Bitcoin's march to near $20,000 last year has attracted Wall Street traders and hedge funds to the space.
1	1523314787	12	I don't see how attracting wall street traders and hedge funds could be a good thing. Those are the worst kind of people... They lie, cheat and will sell their own mother for a profit...It's because of those kind of people that the world is in the shit...
2	1523318556	12	its inevitable.
3	1523386784	1	Exactly, whether or not it's going to be totally positive it was bound to happen sooner or later
2	1523335390	3	I expect they won't fare as well in an environment where no one is too big to fail.
2	1523362849	2	Nobody here gives a shit about that. They preach it, but in the end they just want the institutional money to flood the price so they can get rich. 
2	1523371526	2	Actually, crypto is already filled with people that lie and cheat. Have you seen the amount to fake news associated with crypto? Or all the blogs that claim to know the future and charge  people absurd amounts of money to get that info? Or... BITCONNEEEEEEECT!!!!!!
2	1523327623	1	Its not a good thing, but we as a communitt have to learn how to deal with it. For example not using products from them, like their exchanges and tokens. We must fight fir eberything decentralized.
2	1523330248	1	This is an unwarranted characterization. Traders and hedge funds are an unavoidable, necessary, and beneficial part of the financial ecosystem. They cause destruction only in so far as they are granted special privileges by the state and can get away with mayhem without the cruel and unforgiving judgement of the market place to burn through the dead wood.
3	1523337576	1	Seriously. You guys want moon but just with certain people you approve of?
2	1523317967	1	Sadly we kind of see that in our space now the further we go up the more greedy some people get. Positive thing tho their still our good people leading in this space and I think there will still be once the institution money arrives

0	1523319374	3	I à the only one that become sad when I see a rich man joining bitcoin? 
1	1523330293	7	For bitcoin to take over the world, everyone must get involved. 
1	1523341709	3	Everyone is here to make money? We're certainly not here to lose it. 
1	1523327980	5	You have company. These fuckers won’t get my bitcoin. That’s all. 
2	1523359488	2	The only way you can ensure that is to never spend your Bitcoin...just hodl forever.
1	1523328924	1	You're not alone. 
1	1523366154	1	Well, for him to buy in, the price will rise for everybody.  His wealth gets shared with the rest of us.
1	1523327494	-1	Nope, youre not alone. I grow with un-ease when anyone related, or connected to Goldman, Morgan, Chase, Soros, Roths, or any other major centralized player steps into the arena. This is the domain of Freedom, and in come the Puppet and Circus Masters, and they're not here for coockies, thats for sure. 
0	1523345460	1	Galaxy Digital have a website? Trying to find more info but not much information out there.
0	1523348861	1	I don't know if I should cry or laugh
0	1523364814	1	Good and bad news... Fresh investment but market manipulation will take place..big money will be arriving soon
1	1523379962	1	Oh yes as opposed to the manipulation that hasnt been going on by whales. LOL
0	1523351684	1	We need actual adoption, not these wall street figures.For example, when can i top off my paypal account with bitcoin (i dont care if its converted to dollars)? Thats adoption :)
0	1523312808	0	the future is bright
0	1523324883	-1	GOODBYE CRUEL WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
