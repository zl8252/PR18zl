0	1523327654	10	I'd like to buy a few from you.Would also be my first Bitcoin transaction.
0	1523361842	5	I'm not surprised at all that the longest running Bitcoin meetup is in NH. "Live Free or Die"
0	1523327448	4	Portsmouth? Free State Shoppe?
1	1523330148	2	The meet up was in Manchester. I just got the stickers this week so they aren't in any stores yet.
2	1523342264	1	Do you sell them online? I love those stickers!
2	1523373567	1	When is the next meetup, or where can I go to find out information about it?
3	1523379772	1	It is usually Sunday 6pm at Strange Brew in Manchester, NH in the backroom. This past one was at Murphy's because it was expected to be larger. Just ask the hostess where the Bitcoin people are, and then introduce yourself.
0	1523327574	3	They look great! Go Bitcoin!
1	1523330169	2	Thanks. I think they are really fun!

0	1523329965	2	You would have got an upvote from me if you arranged them the other way...
1	1523330222	6	Oops. Soon enough! Going down is half the fun because we'll be going up after that.

0	1523357888	1	Where can I buy?
0	1523359495	1	When did you guys start your meetup? (Source?)
1	1523374126	1	I didn't start it, but some of my friends did. Looks like the person who created the Facebook event was Josh from [Lamassu BTC ATM](https://lamassu.is/). This event was from before they were even building those. The first weekly meetup was on June 30, 2012. It has been happening ever since. [The Facebook Event from the first one.](https://www.facebook.com/events/345108722234334/)
2	1523375705	1	Looks like the Berlin meetup beat you then. We've been gathering continuously (monthly) since July 2011. See here: https://bitcointalk.to/index.php?topic=27191.0
0	1523360079	1	Anymore info on this meetup? I'd like to attend the next one.

2	1523386419	1	I missed the weekly bit, thats awesome. What are the turn out numbers typically like?
0	1523369991	1	Not to be a dick, but who is the original artist who made this design? See everybody using it, but unless he released it under creative commons, you are breaking copyright rules--edit: https://twitter.com/MarcusConnorNH
1	1523373651	2	Haha, thanks. I am the original artist and creator. You can see my name matches [my website name](http://www.brainlesstales.com/bitcoin-roller-coaster) where I host a history and sell some other items. :)
0	1523376520	1	Weekly? Sounds a little frequent (at least from a position of ignorance). What do you do there?
0	1523383819	1	Those are the best. I'd buy those from you, too.
0	1523332385	1	If you sold them then how do you still have them?
1	1523332929	13	The beauty of photography is that once you produce an image of something, you will always have it unless you lose or destroy it. 
2	1523333787	3	This is true. I took the photo prior to the meet up. But I still have more and they look just like these. :)
3	1523333944	2	Want to sell a few more? How much? 
0	1523362149	-1	Wow .. very proud of you .What are you going to do with your $3 ?
