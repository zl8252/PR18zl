0	1523347491	3	A solution to the chronic hyperinflation of the Zimbabwean dollar several years ago was to switch to the US Dollar, how the tides are turning. 
1	1523358695	-1	The USD is deflationary in Zimbabwe and its causing huge problems in the economy as a result because of rampant hoarding.
2	1523361452	6	Now thats a knee-jerk comment if i ever saw one. You would need to look deeper into what is causing economic problems. Hoarding is most likely just a symptom, and probably not even causing any problems.. Just a scape goat.
3	1523363021	-2	I didn't say all economic problems in zimbabwe are down to deflation, I said deflation is causing significant problems in the economy, problems you didn't attempt to address before dismissing as "probably not even causing any problems".Have you looked at all into the effects USD deflation has had in Zimbabwe before commenting? Or is this just a "knee-jerk comment"?https://www.ft.com/content/9eb1c2d8-c341-11e5-b3b1-7b2481276e45https://www.theindependent.co.zw/2015/10/23/deflation-a-major-threat-to-economy/
4	1523374185	1	> declining consumer prices â€” associated with the strength of the US dollar against the South African rand as well as slack domestic demandSeems the currency is trying to be blamed, but looks like there might be other underlying issues such as:> Zimbabwean companies...are having a tough time competing with cheaper imports from South Africa despite protectionist measures helping them.Just a cursory look, but it seems likely that there's other reason people aren't spending money besides "hoarding".If people are "hoarding", give them good, safe, *trusted* investment options. If they don't want to spend the money, many will save rather than lose out to inflation. Invested money gets pumped back into the economy through businesses that produce new goods or services.The problem is one of trust.
5	1523377768	1	From one of the comments:> I am sure nobody would want to swap the US$ cost for what went on before. Prices doubling every couple of hours caused the disappearance of just about everything from the shops into the black market.>>But other than abandoning the Zimbabwe $ (actually they just stopped making the use of the US$ illegal), the Mugabe Government has continued with business as usual. His dreadlock wearing nephew is in charge of "indigenisation"- that is the planned confiscation of a majority stake in all white or foreign owned non farm businesses, following on from the successful farm invasions that destroyed a very advanced agricultural sector. The law defines those who are exempt as the members of diasadvantaged races at independence. It has been clarified officially that the Chinese were one of the diasadvantaged races.>>Not surprisingly, almost all investment has withered with these sorts of policies in place. Not surprisingly, the Zimbabwe Government continues its warm ties of friendship with North Korea.Foreign investors have targets painted on their backs, and then investment slows down?That seems a more likely explanation than deflation.
6	1523382252	1	Why are you bringing up problems not caused by deflation and then trying to use that as proof that deflation isn't causing any problems?
5	1523381853	1	Did you just skim through the article for any problems that looked unrelated to deflation to try to use that as proof deflation isn't causing any problems?Perhaps I need to say again that I'm not claiming all problems in the Zimbabwean economy are caused by deflation. I'm specifically talking about the problems caused by deflation which you don't dispute by focusing on problems not caused by deflation.>Just a cursory look, but it seems likely that there's other reason people aren't spending moneyThe passage you quoted specifically said that Zimbabwean firms have a tough time competing with foreign imports because the dollar is much stronger than the currencies imports are priced in, like the Rand. If they weren't reliant on a foreign currency that is in too short supply, then Zimbabwean companies would be able to compete much better, but the strength of the dollar makes importing from South Africa a better deal than buying from Zimbabwe even with Zimbabwean producers lowering prices to compete.> If people are "hoarding", give them good, safe, trusted investment options"good, safe, trusted investment options" can't beat 3% returns a month> If they don't want to spend the money, many will save rather than lose out to inflation. Invested money gets pumped back into the economy through businesses that produce new goods or services.How do you think a safe, low interest loan works at 3% monthly deflation?
4	1523366339	1	That was a knee-jerk reaction.   The fellow did not carefully read what you wrote.
