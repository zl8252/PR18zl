0	1523457146	358	I have never seen the hypocrisy that I laugh at every day here summed up so well in one image.  Bravo. 
1	1523459590	1	I get down voted when I say this lol. 
2	1523459933	1	It's not a popular opinion here. Everyone screams hold and moon, but doesn't aknowledge there is no value in a currency if it's not utilized for actual transactions.  Trader a paying trader b does nothing but feed speculation.  A consumer paying a vendor in currency (and a consistent amount of it) time and time again establishes actual value. People love to preach about world changing technology and "breaking the system", but it really feels like a thinly veiled prayer for their get rich quick dreams. 
3	1523463883	1	Really well said. Anyone who screams hodl just thinks bitcoin is a get rich quick scream. I’d actually respect the community a lot more if people just owned it. But sadly they don’t. 
4	1523471083	1	Just imagine how much bitcoin would depreciate if weed will be legalized all over the world. 
3	1523465247	1	Agreed!  I keep telling people in my circle/area “an economy works best when everyone has a little money and it changes hands frequently and often” but they seem to be focused on moon/lambo or their version of it. What has to change is the perception of Bitcoin as a stock or real estate: it’s really the currency of the global economy current stakeholders/gatekeepers have been using as an excuse for years to drain our wealth to their pockets with their fiat. 
3	1523466702	1	Prior to lightning network it was impractical to spend. It still needs a lower barrier in order to achieve widespread adoption. 
3	1523463116	1	I've said this before and I will again. As a rational human, I don't want to be doing what everyone else is. If everyone is using it as a currency and the price increases, I want to be holding. If everyone is holding and the price is stagnating/falling, I want to spend/sell. There's a reason people will call on everyone else to spend their coins without doing so themself; it's just the smart thing to do. 
4	1523469787	1	But the point of Bitcoin was that it was supposed to be  a stable source of value to prevent Governments from destroying wealth through currency manipulation. Bitcoin will work when it is like gold, valuable yes but not volatile. 
3	1523460779	1	Why wouldn't I hold when I get paid in ethereum for a job and the next month it crashes so much that it's essentially a risk to cash out? And I mean cash out because I can't pay rent or taxes with eth

5	1523465469	1	sed ‘s_rs_rs/_’
4	1523464346	1	The amount of people who lurk and comment around here, yet are not interested in holding Bitcoin is miles above any other subreddit. I wonder why.It's like me going to Tesla subreddit just to make up negative things about the car, constantly, every day.Makes no sense to me unless I gain something for it.
5	1523468949	1	Why do you have to be interested in holding bitcoin to be interested in bitcoin. You can think it's a shitty investment and a cool technology at the same time.  
3	1523466582	1	Everyone here wants to get rich. We get it, we all do. But people are delusional to the point where they are literally spouting shit they don't believe about adoption and usage but at the same time think that the result of that would be 1mil/coin and they can retire. 
3	1523462338	1	We're taking about currency. Why is that no one will trash talk someone saving in fiat but crypto needs to be spent. I get we need circulation to make a crypto work but it seems like reddit forgets that whole purpose is to do whatever you want with your crypto because you own your keys.Personally, I use crypto as a savings but I always try to use crypto instead of fiat when possible (really just on the internet because I live in ny). If we really want a crypto/decentralized economy, why wouldn't the disscution be about how to spend crypto over fiat instead of how hodl vs spedl. Mass adoption is key for cryptocurrencies and everyone involved knows this. I can't find an argument for why fiat is overall better than crypto. This is a time where the facts should be understood. Anyone who wants to trade back into fiat just needs to be informed (and everyone who only uses fiat for that matter).  Informing rational people will have a better results in expanding the crypto economy. Once the greater majority of the human race converts away from fiat, whether someone wants to spend or save will be a non problem.
4	1523463020	1	No one talks trash when someone saves in Fiat because it's already achieved the mass circulation and utility that you refer to. 
5	1523467053	1	Also unless you’re storing cash under your mattress, saving in fiat is not the same as saving Bitcoin. Savings in a bank are lent out and continue to circulate. 
6	1523467566	1	Which means there is almost always a currency supply deficit that depends on inflation to keep the circulation going.  This is what everyone continues to forget.  As soon as deflation picks up or credit markets freeze, that deficit requires injections and depressed interest rates from central banks for that vital inflationary pressure.  Cycle after cycle after cycle after cycle...HODL gold.  HODL crypto.  Over time, fiat and the fractional reserve banking system will dance themselves into exhaustion.  It’s not going to collapse dramatically like some people think.  The important thing is to *teach* people that an *alternative* exists so they can *transition*.
7	1523470329	1	> vital inflationary pressure. Cycle after cycle after cycle after cycle...> > Over time, fiat and the fractional reserve banking system will dance themselves into exhaustion.The former ensures that the latter never happens. Small, slow inflationary pressure is what keeps fiat going forever because it incentivizes circulation over hoarding. One penny in 1800 equates to somewhere around $2.35 today according to inflation calculators -- but nobody is panicking about that huge change because it happened over the course of a couple hundred years. The same will be true a couple of hundred years from now when someone does the same comparison. The real danger to fiat is the collapse of the backing entity's power (which absolutely could happen during the next couple hundred years), not inflation. Slow, steady inflation is fiat currency's friend.
8	1523471175	1	> *Slow,* *steady* inflation is fiat currency's friend.Glad I hit refresh before replying, since slow and steady weren’t in the original comment.I agree.  Slow and steady is the stated agenda.  But my point is that slow and steady isn’t always possible politically during a sharp, sudden contraction.Also, as wage growth slows and efficiency increases, it becomes harder and harder to get it to and keep it at the Fed’s benchmark rate.Look at Europe.  Are there even *hints* of the ECB raising rates?  Not that I know of...
4	1523467372	1	The issue isn't savings crypto vs fiat. If you buy crypto with 0 expectations that it is going to go up, you're saving in crypto. But, everyone here saying hodl is doing it with the expectation that the price will go up. No one says HODL fiat as an investment. If you want to "Invest", you do it in Stock or bonds. You can buy both just fine with Crypto. The price is simply listed in FIAT.  >I can't find an argument for why fiat is overall better than crypto.Well, it's stable. The price doesn't go up or down 10% in a day. Today, no one is going to put a sticker on a car and set a 3 btc price. Anyone who accepts payment in btc today, just does it as a means transferring fiat. Until the price is listed in btc, it's still not a currency.  
5	1523467709	1	> Until the price is listed in btc, it's still not a currency.Well then it already is a currency. Prices of alts on all exchanges are listed in BTC.
6	1523468049	1	Again you're treating crypto like the product and not the medium. 
6	1523470181	1	Let me clarify. If someone is willing to accept "X" btc for a product today, and is willing to keep that price stable for weeks and months, it's a currency. Altcoin price is a spot price, not a product price.  
4	1523466882	1	Saving is not the same as hoarding. People are actively not spending bitcoin so it will moon, people aren't hoarding dollars thinking the value is gonna skyrocket, they save so they can have money for bills, vacations, etc...later on. 
3	1523464743	1	There is no point in using it for actual transactions, when I could just as easily use my debit card. 
4	1523469100	1	Sometimes I don't even have the patience for that anymore. I'll go to target to get some bs that I may need/want, then see a long line and I'll just leave my cart. Then go home and order on amazon.  
3	1523468539	1	It's because it's a stupid opinion.
3	1523471090	1	We're still at a stage where we're figuring out how to do payments best. To my knowledge, at this moment, no current blockchain would be able to handle  the amount of transactions needed to replace centralized payment services. So, for now, we invest, to attract developers, and then the rest can come later. 
3	1523472134	1	It's tough though, it costs me money to turn my fiat into crypto, and then if I buy things with crypto it's valued according to what it trades for fiat so I just lose out on turning my money into crypto. Unless I was paid in crypto and could spend all my crypto for living expenses it doesn't make sense to use it for regular purchases :/
3	1523461753	1	And this is a real danger.  If you treat crypto as an investment the SEC will eventually get involved and regulate the very thing people don’t want regulatedRegulatory risk is the single biggest risk to crypto.    All it takes is the United Stated government to get involved in the regulation and we are screwed. 
4	1523461974	1	Naw it needs some kind of government oversight for it to become mainstream.
5	1523462026	1	Banking regulation but not securities regulation.   I stated that poorly.  
2	1523462726	1	You shouldn't. I met a guy in bar who gave me about 30 USD worth of Litecoins for an older model iPod I was selling. I don't know about all of you, but I actually am using it as a currency.
3	1523470021	1	I sold yeezys for LTC.
2	1523467370	1	Well you don't build cool motorcycles. 
2	1523464698	1	Spending is not the same thing as selling.  Spending props up the price of *goods and services* at the expense of bitcoin, whereas selling props up the price of *fiat* at the expense of bitcoin.Buy low. Spend high. *NEVER SELL*.
3	1523466186	1	> al danger. If you treat crypto as an investment the SEC will eventually get involved and regulate the very thing people don’t want regulated> > Regulatory risk is the single biggest risk to crypto. All it takes is the United Stated government to get involved in the regulation and we are screwed.But in most cases, aren't businesses just instantly transacting crypto to fiat directly using a third party processor? So what you spend in crypto is immediately being sold and thus, lowering the price. 
4	1523469896	1	"Regulatory risk" is not supposed to be a challenge for crypto.  Crypto is ideally anonymous.  If it turns out that it does pose a challenge, then privacy technology/best practices will improve until it is no longer a challenge.
1	1523470873	1	Meanwhile this is the most upvoted comment. Most people don't hodl no matter what. You got a wrong picture from a few hodl trolls.
1	1523466996	1	Why would you spend crypto if you’re trying to convert dollars into crypto? Spending dollars is the same exact thing as spending crypto and then immediately buying crypto. That’s why I don’t care that people are holding it instead of using it as a currency today. 
2	1523467575	1	Crypto isn't going to establish value in a vacuum. It needs utility in the real world for that to happen. 
3	1523468651	1	In the case of ether it has intrinsic value in a vacuum in its ability to pay for deployment and execution of smart contracts. Besides that, I would prefer to spend crypto when buying high value items in person rather than carrying a large amount of money. 
1	1523468318	1	It’s so simple. Use and replace, don’t Hodl.
1	1523470685	1	There is nothing hypocritical in the hodl mentality, people who promote spending for spending's sake do not understand where value comes from. The progression is novelty -> store of value -> means of exchange -> unit of account.Value is a function of desirability and scarcity. Ignoring the more advanced things that are possible, bitcoin is desirable because it can be securely stored and moved without 3rd party permission, and because it is scarce. Spending bitcoin does not increase its value. Spending for spending's sake may increase the liquidity of bitcoin - but generally it just increases the supply of people selling bitcoin in relation to the people buying which drives the price down. Bitcoin becomes more valuable when people produce things that others want and need and then are only willing to exchange those things for bitcoin. In that case any increased spending of bitcoin is driven by the creation of new value that pulls people into the bitcoin economy.It makes very little sense to promote bitcoin by encouraging people to spend. A smart person would teach creative and productive people about the value of bitcoin as a savings and investment vehicle, and encourage them to accept bitcoin in exchange for their products and services.
2	1523471552	1	You can take that standpoint, but my opinion is that it has no value until it has mass utility.  It's just a string of code hanging out in the ether until then. 
1	1523470719	1	Both are important, we have plenty of hodl, now we need to increase the SPEDN.
1	1523471277	1	hypocrisy?Commodity money is adopted in 4 phases. First as a collectible. Then as a store of value (we are here). Then as a medium of exchange ("crypto should be a currency"). Then finally as unit of account.It's going to take a few more bubbles until store of value is established enough for medium of exchange to really take off. And the price will have to basically totally stabilize before it's used as a unit of account like a lot of people expect from money.
0	1523454813	110	This actually describes this sub pretty well. On the one hand we want bitcoin / cryptos to become a mainstream way to pay for goods and services but we don't want to spend them because we are afraid we will lose out on gains. At one point will the hodlers be satisfied with the price and start using them as currencies?
1	1523458886	1	Bingo.  Crypto is interesting if it can be used like a currency.  If it's just Beanie Babies going up because they are going up in price... well then Crypto is a Beanie Baby.  It is actually hurting itself.When I can see a price for a product, in crypto, and next week buy it for the same price, then it is useful to me.  We are far from that today.
2	1523467407	1	It will be possible with a second generation cryptos wich will not be tradable on exchange UNLESS they have real world use. Their nominal value will be stabilized to the products values. For now, coins prices are a cross_speculatives values, and the whole refer to the big cap ones.
3	1523471460	1	Care to explain what a second generation coin will be?
2	1523464076	1	that's why I'm only hodling for now. In the future price will go up as more and more people start buying crypto, for that I believe we need a crisis... a big one, somewhere. I'm talking about what happend in Argentina few years ago, or Venezuela now (though Venezuela's situation is different). Or an even bigger crisis like in 2008. All these crisis make things happen, like people questioning about their government/banks, inflation, people tend to spread awareness about how the system works as a whole (I've seen this myself during the crisis in Spain). Bitcoin will represent an alternative when the next big crisis comes, we didn't have it last time.As for now, I'm buying as much as I can.
3	1523464423	1	You want an economic crisis ? 
3	1523464941	1	It's important you buy as much as you can, because the first thing that will happen when the stock market crashes, is that people will sell their investments, including those in bitcoin. Bitcoin itself will crash too, and nobody will have any money. It doesn't help to have a bitcoin to cash atm, because the FIRST thing that goes is USD's in ATM's. What good is bitcoin if almost no grocery store takes it and you gotta feed your kids? You will want to cash it out into dollars, and assuming you can, by that point there won't be any cash in atm's or banks.
4	1523466790	1	Good point kind sir 
1	1523459709	1	Once the price stabilizes for a long period of time
2	1523469614	1	So never?
1	1523459789	1	This is the problem with a currency that rises in value year after year. An inflationary currency encourages spending, which in turn boosts the economy by creating more revenue, more jobs, and a lot more. Holding onto money without having an incentive to spend doesn’t make sense in the long run.   At no point will hodlers be satisfied with the price because they’ll expect more, and then new ones will FOMO in wanting even more. And so on.  The spending and replacing method works only because we have a currency like the dollar around. It is much like jewellers maintaining a steady 1 KG (random number) of gold supply by replenishing what they use that very day.   Sometimes I swear reading through this sub feels like watching teenagers trying to redefine sound economic logic with a lengthy post about why you should all be ‘hodling.’ Crazy. 
2	1523467011	1	It's self delusion. They literally convinced themselves that it will moon and they will get rich. There are people here who 100% believe it will hit 100k/1mil. It's pretty mindblowing how adamant they are about it. 
3	1523471192	1	This is how every speculative investment becomes an honest-to-goodness investment. All is revealed with time.
2	1523469421	1	>This is the problem with a currency that rises in value year after yearOnly if there are no alternatives.  No one says "The problem with real estate is that it rises in value year over year" or "The problem with stocks is that it rises in value year over year" or "The problem with X commodity that is not fiat rises in value year over year".  We have a pretty solid medium of exchange in the USD and the Euro and the Yen and other major currencies.  What we NEEDED was an alternative to these things.Bitcoin is a medium of exchange and a store of value.If the value of a commodity drops over time \(say, by inflating supply\), that commodity is not a good store of value. USD is not a good store of value.  It has been designed to only be a medium of exchange.  The inflation rate is *designed* to increase its velocity so as to bolster its value as a medium of exchange, at the expense of its utility as a store of value.  This is designed to get people out of the USD and into other commodities, which increases the velocity and stimulates growth. Bitcoin is not so compelled.  It is not a tool to increase the productivity of the country who issues it.  It is literally designed to be a store of value that is also easy to exchange.  That's the precise reason the protocol caps the supply.
3	1523469599	1	Exactly. I'm not debating that at all. I'm talking about the muppets who think they're replacing the currency system with Bitcoin and truly believe that it's a good idea. I can't take a barrel of oil to a shopkeeper expecting groceries in return. What if oil is valued more tomorrow? What if I can get more stuff tomorrow. There's a reason why assets/commodities are not used as regular currency. 
4	1523471460	1	Yea, I don't ever think it will replace USD or the Euro or Yen or any other government-issued currency (except for really small or super unstable governments, maybe).  This is not because of the "transactability" of bitcoin but because of the control of the money supply gives the government lots of power.
2	1523467650	1	Buying pointless shit isn't a net gain for humanity. More jobs != higher quality of society. 
3	1523467974	1	Define pointless. Anything can be pointless shit for someone, a luxury for some others, and a necessity for someone else. Pointless for whom? It’s very relative.   And also, tell me the alternative too. Lesser jobs? Okay. So how do you earn money? Or do you want to get rid of humanity’s motivation to work completely?    
4	1523468704	1	LmaoWork will always exist. Play with your imagination. 
1	1523459065	1	The description is even better, in that the argument is irrelevant, (and possibly staged by the shows producers) and we're all on the same team.A mix of both would be best.  Spend SOME od your holdings and increase the utility, which increases value.  Buy back as you can.
2	1523465025	1	The grocery store don't take Bitcoin, the laundromat don't take bitcoin, the gas station don't take bitcoin, the barber and tire store, no bitcoin. The only guy who takes it is Amazon I think, and I don't get groceries from them, haircuts, tires, or do laundry with Amazon.
1	1523460732	1	>At one point will the hodlers be satisfied with the price and start using them as currencies?When they think the price isn't going to go up much further.
1	1523460846	1	It's not an on-off-scenario. I am a hodler but also have spent a small share and continue to do so regardless of price. 
1	1523455765	5	> we don't want to spend them because we are afraid we will lose out on gainsIf someone can't figure out spend and replace, they probably couldn't figure out how to get their coins of an exchange in the first place. At some point, a fomo wave will result in merchants wanting it or offering discounts for it. That's how hyperbitcoinziation starts. 
2	1523456643	6	Why spend and replace if spend fiat and save crypto instead is clearly the cheaper option? At least for now it is, so until that changes that's what I'm doing.
3	1523456885	3	Crypto is the cheaper option.And if you're holding fiat to spend, you're a legacy person. 
4	1523457750	10	why would I use something that I don't get paid in, can't access from my bank card, can't physically carry with me, 99% of merchants in the world don't accept, and buying power can radically vary from one day to the next? 
5	1523458462	1	So that you contribute to adoption. Like an active participant so to say. As long as you spend & replace, you're all good. Of course you can also be calm about things and acknowledge that the issue is really not that big. Crypto will grow with or without your participation and it will grow even if it's mostly used to speculate and store of value. But eventually we want to transition from using Crypto to pay for things also. By contributing now, even if just a little, you help doing that faster. See, there's no pressure attached. If you think we should use more crypto as pay, as it currently is, then you should want to help out in that regard too and it literally costs nothing to do. Not being able to pay is a flat lie. Various phone apps, secure enough for a little dinner amount of Bitcoin to store - you know - good enough security for small amounts of money. Pay with it, if you feel like it, and of course like you said, if you can. No pressure. Maybe use it for fun sometime? I mean sure, not all stores offer stuff in Bitcoin, but *some* do right? Also not advocating that doing either or is better, because it goes back to what I originally said, that it grows anyways. So no hard feelings if you decide not to. Personally think it's just cool, so when given the opportunity for small purchases to pay in Bitcoin, I do and of course I also replace. That's the real hassle if anything. You really want to replace it immediately afterwards, lol. 
6	1523468287	1	So your reason for him is “So you contribute to adoption” lol. Bitcoin will only ever be used as a novelty. There are no real benefits to the average consumer in using crypto on a day to day basis.  “crypto will grow with or without your participation” is what all the (bag)hodlers say when people criticize bitcoin, when the reality is you need all the people you can get. Crypto has been declining in user base, adoption, and price since Jan. 
7	1523469698	1	> Crypto has been declining in user base, adoption, and price since Jan.Yea so what? Draw your own conclusions, as I've drawn mine. Chill out, it's going to run again eventually. I have all the time in the world too. 
4	1523460583	1	I don't care what you call me lol. I spend fiat and I buy and hold BTC. Sue me.
3	1523456984	5	Automatic recurring replace buys at Coinbase for ~2% fee. If you somehow rationalize this being as a burdensome cost you've gone too far turn back
4	1523463289	1	But my spending with crypto or not has no noticeable impact on the price (and thus the benefit to me). That 2% fee is a very real cost to me. Why would I want to take on a 2% cost for no benefit? 
5	1523467677	1	Or negative benefit, as you lose the spending/fraud protections that cards provide in addition to paying an extra 2% for your trouble.
6	1523468122	1	Yeah, I get to delay paying for a month with no fee, 1% cash back, and the backing of a giant financial institution vs. paying now with a 2% fee. If people want to make that choice, I respect it, and it's a noble thing to do to support a technology you believe in, but it's clearly the wrong choice if only the economics matter to you.
3	1523461678	1	That's an economic problem called the 'free rider' problem. Personally I'm happy to spend my bitcoins even if it is ever so slightly more effort. 
4	1523470732	1	That's fine for you. But if you expect the majority of people to act against their economic self interest to support btc for a moral good, you're going to be disappointed. The solution would be to create a crypto (or fix bitcoin) so it becomes a more efficient means of money exchange than paypal / venmo / credit card. At that point, people will start adopting it, and by default, start holding their savings in bitcoin. At that point, you have a currency. But, at this point, btc is just a libertarian dream of a post fiat world. 
1	1523459543	1	Bitcoin can become a mainstream way to pay for goods and services without being massively devalued, because it is so easily divisible.  The idea that mainstream adoption must necessarily come at the cost of value is fallacious.
2	1523468470	1	Because it’s so divisible?? The dollar is as divisible as it needs to be and it doesn’t come with the problems of volatility, lack of insurance, transaction fees, difficulty of use.. I could go on. Bitcoin can never become a mainstream way to pay for goods and services period. 
1	1523463663	1	> At one point will the hodlers be satisfied with the price and start using them as currencies?I think most are less concerned about using it as currency and more concerned about making gains. 
1	1523467241	1	Never. Like with flat, there will be ALWAYS speculation. But the usuability of crypto will be more boosted gradually, when speculators effects are less than ppl who push cryptos to that path. 
1	1523469173	1	Not if they bought in Dec or Jan. If that coin gets spent, it's a financial loss. 
1	1523469378	1	When we run out of fiat? Buy with fiat. But more crypto with fiat. Hodl Bitcoin. Repeat until fiat depletes.
1	1523469785	1	The hodlers will be satisfied when the price stabilizes. When it appears there is no longer any gain to be had. At that point, it no longer makes sense to hodl, anymore than it makes sense to stash FIAT into your mattress. In theory, that could be any price from $1 to $1,000,000 a coin. The bottom floor on bitcoin at that point would be caused by ensuring there are enough coins in circulation to handle the transactions needed. Today's there's about $1T in US FIAT to support our $18T economy. So by that measure, the market cap for bitcoin would simply need to be about 1/10 to 1/20 the total volume of bitcoin transactions in a day. On the other end, there is another interesting limit. A coin can only be split to 8 decimal places. A coin value over $1,000,000 would mean you can no longer represent a penny. So, while that's probably OK, there is going to be a theoretical limit. For example, we can't just say, the smallest transaction allowed is $10.  
1	1523470963	1	The problem, in my opinion, is viewing crypto as currency. While this may have been the inteded goal for Bitcoin - as Satoshi outlined in the white paper - this is certainly not the only use case for most crypto. It has evolved beyond ONE utility and instead encompasses many use cases accross multiple unassociated industries.So in essence, crypto can be stock, money, and a decentralized database all at once. Seeing it as only having ONE use case is a very miopic way to look at things. However, if you believe that it only has ONE use case - to be used as money - then, it's perfectly valid to tell people to spend it. But even then, fiat money is only worth spending because it devalues over time. Crypto, if we assume limited supply, is bound to rise in prices due to contrained supply. This is a big reason people spend fiat money in stock; to protect against inflation. And the reason a lot of people have also adapted the same mentality torward crypto; again, to protect against inflation.
1	1523470993	1	This comment describes this sub really well, not realizing that spending USD is losing out on potential crypto gains too.

1	1523459768	1	Separate issue. Pathological hodling will ruin industry 
2	1523467978	1	> Pathological hodling will ruin industryThis assumes that everyone who owns Bitcoin has this philosophy. Since that is not the case and will never be the case this scenario can never be true therefore it is pointless speculation.Also basic economic theory rationalizes that there is an equilibrium to be found and that this threshold is variable for different people meaning that different people will spend their Bitcoin and no longer hold it at different price points. This will lead to Holders becoming Spenders and Bitcoin being used more frequently as a currency beyond the scope of this particular group.
3	1523469973	1	This is especially true as the rise in price starts to plateau as mass adoption happens. People will start to find the present value of other goods higher than the future value of the relative bitcoin. As far as spend/buy back the philosophy is the same regardless. Either you spend bitcoin to pay for goods and the merchants convert to local currencies or you sell bitcoin for local currency and spend. This is true regardless of how much bitcoin you own. Merchants already have methods of payment that work well for the majority currencies that people hold. They're not going to convert or add a new method of payment to accept bitcoin just because a few people ask for it. Once bitcoin is widely used as a store of value it will then start to be accepted more by merchants through efficient methods of payment like lightning network at which point bitcoin becomes a better medium of exchange.
2	1523469579	1	Holding will ruin the industry?  If people are incentivized to hold (aka the price is increasing), then more people will want it.When people want a unit of exchange, they offer goods and services in return for it.
1	1523463993	1	If you spend at places that do accept it, and those places see increased business for it, it will encourage their competition to accept it.
2	1523464789	1	>and those places see increased business for it, it will encourage their competition to accept it.That assumes that the amount of crypto sales is public knowledge, which it won't be if it gives those businesses that accept it an advantage, because their competition accepting would nullify that advantage.

2	1523461429	1	2% extra on every purchase? Lolololol
3	1523461736	1	no when you replenish your crypto not on every tx

4	1523467251	1	Do you not get how percentages work? 2% fee replenishing on every purchase is the exact same as a 2% fee when you replenish monthly (or yearly or weekly). 2% is 2%

5	1523462337	1	you can do it every week or month. similar to how most people get a paycheck not every time they spend money from the last paycheck
6	1523462785	1	Irrelevant. Ifyou replenish X amount of crypto after spending X amount of crypto, you spent 2% of X to use Bitcoin for those purchases instead of fiat.In fact, 2% guaranteed in fees will be the least of your worries if you do it the way you just described. Volatility will be much more of a concern. Imagine if you had done this through all of 2017. You would have lost a shit ton of value just because the price kept going up before you rebought. You would have regretted every purchase you made with Bitcoin.
7	1523462888	1	- why does the price go up?- why do people want to use it?
8	1523463388	1	>why does the price go up?Well I'll start by saying it doesn't go up because people love trading it away for goods. Maybe in the future, but we aren't there yet.The price goes up because more and more people prefer to store their value in Bitcoin as opposed to fiat or other investment vehicles. You gonna hold Bitcoin, capped at 21m supply, or are you gonna hold the ever inflating fiat?>why do people want to use it?To store their value and protect their wealth in a post 2008 crisis world. People are waking up to how central banking has been robbing them of their wealth for decades.Also because it is pseudo anonymous and permission-less. The best applications for Bitcoin purchases and transactions are ones in which fiat does not work. Darkweb, internet gambling, moving value from one website or exchange to another, etc..It's not because "cheap and fast!", that's for damn sure. It's not cheaper. It's not faster. It certainly could be one day though! The world had no shortage of cheap and fast payment mechanisms back before Bitcoin was invented. If you think Satoshi created Bitcoin to compete with 2% merchant-side credit card fees.... well you missed what makes bitcoin revolutionary my friend.Want proof that Bitcoin's value has almost no relation to the number of merchants accepting it and the number of people using it to buy legal goods and services? Well merchant adoption and legal goods purchasing with bitcoin peaked in 2014-2015. What more proof do you need?
9	1523464061	1	would gold have become a store of value if no one accepted it?
2	1523461239	1	Why would I pay an extra 2% when I could just use my damn fiat and buy the dips instead.
2	1523460551	1	I'll add that 2% is on par with credit card fees (which some businesses sometimes discount back to you when you buy with bitcoin) and much less than the daily volatility.
3	1523461487	1	Merchant  picks up credit card fees. Not the same. Not yet.
4	1523464347	1	> Merchant picks up credit card fees.No, merchants *pass those fees* onto their customers.
5	1523467143	1	They absolutely do, but it’s not like they reduce the price if you buy with crypto or cash. You’re paying an extra 2% on top of the inflated price the merchant sets for the “convenience” of spending crypto. 
6	1523467318	1	>it’s not like they reduce the price if you buy with crypto or cashSome do.
6	1523468132	1	I see signs on businesses every single day that offer cash discounts. What world are you living in?
5	1523464388	1	Then when they are passing the bitcoin savings onto customers, we can compare the two. 
3	1523466583	1	Bitcoin does not compete with credit cards. In return for their fees, those offer extra features such as buyer protection and, of course, "credit". Bitcoin does not offer credit or protection, and competes with debit cards, mobile payments, etc. which charge a fraction of a percent.
0	1523457776	2	To all the hodlers out there....you are willing to take the risk getting crypto, holding crypto, and waiting in uncertain regulatory environment....but somehow 5 min of your time and 2% fee is unbearable?

2	1523462840	1	how do you walk around with that small brain of yours?I bought Bitcoin a few years ago. A few days ago I used it to buy an amazon card. You can't conceive an asset like this because you have a small brain. But it exists.
3	1523462940	1	it's cool I have large brain cell blocks
2	1523456420	4	He didn't write that, more accurate would be ''save money and spend it wisely''. Saving should not be looked down upon, it's very important.

4	1523465094	1	"If it flies, floats, or fucks... you're better off renting it."
3	1523460601	1	That is what the meme says to do
3	1523461190	1	> Saving should not be looked down upon, it's very important.Why?
4	1523461526	1	Delayed time preference makes you wealthy when you're not forced to use inflationary fiat currencies.
5	1523465293	1	If you're interested in becoming wealthy then spending wealth to make more wealth is a better option than just sitting on wealth and waiting for things to become cheaper.Saving itself cannot generate any wealth, unless its a form of investment (i.e. a savings account that lends money to businesses that create wealth and repay the loan with interest)
4	1523463036	1	Should this really require an explanation? I guess it does for people who are used to living on debt. Saving is very important for your personal freedom, security and safety. It allows you to weather bad times, and also you are able to invest your saved-up money into worthwhile things or to start up a business without going into debt. It's too bad our current debt based paradigm has taught so many people wrong ways to handle money.
5	1523467956	1	>also you are able to invest your saved-up money into worthwhile things or to start up a business without going into debtThat's an argument for investing money in generating wealth, not saving it. Those are two separate things.Using money to generate wealth is always a better option than just holding onto wealth and hoping it can last long enough.It's too bad the current bitcoin paradigm has taught people that you can only spend money on frivolous things, and that the dream is to get rich by hoarding a deflationary asset rather than to get rich by generating wealth.
6	1523470998	1	That is not what Bitcoin has taught me. Bitcoin has taught me how to save and not to spend money on frivolous things. I am thankful for its lessons. Generating wealth can be done in many ways and becomes much easier if you have learned to save your money and spend it wisely first.
7	1523471428	1	>Generating wealth can be done in many waysIt can't be done by just sitting on money and waiting for it to go up in value, which is what most people are doing with bitcoin.If people were actually using bitcoin to invest in businesses and wealth generation then "hodl" wouldn't be a meme, people wouldn't talk about buying a lambo when bitcoin hits 100k because they would have already invested their bitcoin in something.

3	1523460688	1	>  Dollars are not and cannot an investment, unless one is into currency tradingOkay so according to you, dollars are both an investment and not an investment at the same time, depending on if the person sees them as an investment or not.
1	1523457260	0	It's not an investment. It has no intrinsic value. It's a speculative currency. 
2	1523461417	1	A speculative currency that just happens to have better qualities than gold for store of value.Intrinsic value argument is nonsense, it's "intrinsic" value comes from it's properties. 
3	1523461585	1	How does it have better stores of value than a physical object?  What properties?  It's a bit of code stored on hard drives.

2	1523461555	1	>  It has no intrinsic valueAfter all these years, you still say this?There is no value in having a non-forgeable valued signature that can be sent across the world without a third party involved?This is why some people still don't understand bitcoin, yet they easily make comments like they are experts.
3	1523463298	1	Bitcoin isnt the only crypto that can do this. Theres no intrinsic value, thr value comes from the market
4	1523463437	1	It's the safest and the most widely accepted, thus it has intrinsic value. What's the matter, did you buy into another crypto?
5	1523463629	1	I agree that its the most widely accepted and safest. Thats not what intrinsic means. Value coming from being widely accepted isn't intrinsic. Do you not understand?
6	1523463858	1	You are the one not understanding.I said the intrinsic value comes from the trustless nature of passing valued signatures.You then came with another non-related argument
7	1523463922	1	That's an intrinsic feature not value. What gives that value? How do you quantify that value?
8	1523464210	1	So now you want to escape the argument by calling it a feature?Features are what give things value.Like Gold has a feature of being a metal, shiny and conductive. Those things give it value.
9	1523464291	1	Value and features are not the same . a lot of things are shiny and metallic. They do not have same value which is determined by what market decides.
2	1523461720	1	Bitcoin is the world's most secure time stamp. That's its intrinsic value.

You fundamentally do not understand money.  Money has an opportunity cost, unlike social networks.  A person can have a myspace account while also having a facebook account.  A person cannot own Bitcoin and also dollars in the sense that they are mutually exclusive.  That is for every dollar or bitcoin a person owns, he must necessarily own less of the other.  You are also misunderstanding what it means to use money.  A person does not use money when they buy something; that is when they STOP using money.  Money is a ledger that accounts for deferred consumption.  A person begins using money when he accepts it and continues using it while holding.  The moment he buys something he exits that ledger and is no longer using money.

7	1523462180	1	dude look at the mental gymnastics you have to pull off
8	1523463282	1	google quantity theory of money you troglodyte 
9	1523470757	1	Quantity Theory of Money (for anyone not familiar) boils down to    MV = PT    M = Money Supply    V = Velocity of Money    P = Price Levels    T = Total Value of all transactionsMoney Supply in bitcoin is constant, so you posit that velocity must increase for total spending to increase.  However, with bitcoin, this will hold if price goes down as total aggregate value goes up.  Therefore, the quantity theory of money works fine for Bitcoin if you don't mind declining prices as aggregate value increases. I make the following assumptions:* Both the bitcoin world and major governments want T to increase.  * Governments have the additional constraint that prices should remain stable.  Therefore they can only really twiddle with either M or V to increase T.  * Bitcoin cannot twiddle with M, therefore only V and P are available to it.  You contend that we must increase V to increase T.  I contend that letting P fall is perfectly acceptable.

4	1523464541	1	> Spending crypto increases the market of crypto increasing the price of cryptoI'd like to see some actual evidence that this is true. Most merchants sell the crypto as soon as they get it (or never even touch it, using Bitpay or the like). What is the *precise* mechanism that me sending bitcoin to a merchant, who sells it on an exchange to a buyer, increases the price of bitcoin? Wouldn't that be a net *decrease* in price, as it's increasing the supply of bitcoin for sale on the market?
3	1523464265	1	But people aren't going to stop accepting dollars/euros unless there's a viable alternative that's being adopted, so when you say "spend your fiat, hold your crypto", you're (perhaps unintentionally) stating that Bitcoin will never be a viable currency, and is just a speculative investment scheme.
4	1523469877	1	No you want to get rid of your worse currency before the better one. If youre so eager to get rid of Bitcoin then the person accepting it will wonder why do you want to get rid of something you thought was good
5	1523471108	1	> No you want to get rid of your worse currency before the better one.I get that, but Bitcoin won't be a better currency if everyone's just hoarding it instead of transacting with it. Being technically superior doesn't matter in the end if people can only spend it on 1% of stores, and that percentage isn't going to go up if no one's driving up demand.Spend and replace is the only approach that ensures cryptos become actual widespread currencies. Yes, you may lose a small amount to conversion fees, but so what? If you're not willing to accept that tiny loss, you're just hoping someone else will, and everyone thinks like you, this currency will never take off.
2	1523460455	1	2% is no small potatoes 
1	1523460438	1	If no one spends it, it will lose its value (I still cannot comprehend why its value has not suffered more after the high fees started).
2	1523461719	1	> If no one spends it, it will lose its value (I still cannot comprehend why its value has not suffered more after the high fees started).Okay so we have a situation where your expected outcome is not matching up with actual results.  Perhaps you should check your underlying premise that "If no one spends it, it will lose value".I would suggest to you that if people STOP spending it, it will gain value even more rapidly than it is.  Money does NOT get value from how often people spend it.  That is absurdly ignorant.
3	1523470713	1	If people stopped spending bitcoin, the less demand it will have for people to buy bitcoins. The less demand, the less value. It basically just turns into those special minted collector's coins.Currently, bitcoin is mostly valued in speculation - that is value is based on the speculation that it *might* be more valuable later *if* it becomes more widely adopted. Unfortunately that adoption won't happen if people don't use it as a currency.Basically, if the majority of bitcoin adopters only hodl, the less bitcoin has in value. Hodling only becomes profitable if done in the minority while the majority spends and uses it as a currency increasing adoption of it as a currency and deflating it's value. 
3	1523463696	1	I would say it is more of how _many_ people spend (accept) it.A part of my expectations not being met is that the price is mostly driven by speculation - understanding why others want to own bitcoin is hard (e.g. if everyone understood how useful it could be, many more people would buy in now).
4	1523464459	1	That's closer to correct.  It isn't how many people are willing to accept it but how much people are willing to hold it.  The only reason people accept a currency is because someone is willing to hold it.Intent ultimately does not matter.  A person buying bitcoin for wrong assumptions is economically the same as if he correctly understands it is going to take over the world

2	1523462219	1	I dont care about semantic arguments.  They are pointless.  As I would define currency, Bitcoin is the best currency and we can know it will one day be the ONLY currency accepted in the global economy
3	1523470946	1	It will not (nor should it be) the ONLY currency.  I contend that it will be the global SETTLEMENT currency, but governments will never want to give up complete control of their monetary base.
3	1523463209	1	How do we " know " this or do you mean hope for it
3	1523465099	1	If Bitcoin is the best currency, then I'm severely disappointed in our ability to make currencies.
4	1523469981	1	How come?
3	1523467099	1	> we can know it will one day be the ONLY currency accepted in the global economyOh god this fucking delusion holy shit.
1	1523469642	1	Exactly, [Gresham's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law)
2	1523469649	1	**Gresham's law**In economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that "bad money drives out good". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.The law was named in 1860 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), who was an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
1	1523471265	1	Doesn't make any sense. If crypto is too valueable you're batshit insane to hold on to spare USD in the first place. Because every spare USD is potential lost profit just the same. And if you don't have spare USD your only choice is to spend crypto.

0	1523459567	1	It's a currency with which you can buy stuff, but because it's relatively really new, its worth is very volatile and therefore can be used as an investment if one believes many people will buy stuff with it, arrrr!!!!
1	1523459730	1	Yes there is risk and that’s why big return ...

0	1523460103	1	Guess I'm going back to buying drugs.
0	1523460694	1	I don't mind spedning cryptos, but most shops don't accept it yet...
0	1523461027	1	I have an even better solution than the last panel. Instead of spending crypto, and then buying it back with dollars and incurring fees in the process, you just spend dollars directly and that way you still get to buy the goods and services you want, but you don't have to lose any additional purchasing power on extra fees, and you still get to keep exactly the same number of bitcoins as before. There's no chance of the price of bitcoin going up so then you can't buy back as many bitcoins as you had before.
1	1523461598	1	this might come as a shock but users are part of the crypto economy and your actions effect the price.
0	1523461313	1	I honestly cant see myself spending crypto on goods and services in the US til tax laws change. Just finished my 2017 taxes and not trying to make it harder on myself mext year. Not to mention - credit cards still make much more sense for most spending needs. CC rewards > taxable events and transaction fees
0	1523461417	1	It's not that simple. Taxes alone make the practice of spending bitcoin entirety impractical. 
0	1523461456	1	Reminder that most merchants who accept Bitcoin immediately convert it back to fiat.
0	1523462149	1	The fact that this is a constant point of debate illustrates why deflationary cryptocurrencies are impossible to bootstrap in a working economy IMO.  You can’t swim upstream against economic incentives.  Every exponential price movement only discourages use.
1	1523462289	1	your central banking boomerist financial paradigm is wrong...stop complaining just deal with it 
2	1523462774	1	My “paradigm” doesn’t need memes to make people spend their money.  
3	1523462837	1	red flag = this guy doubts the power of memes
4	1523464781	1	Yeah, I mean look at the last US election, bruh!
1	1523471133	1	I personally don't feel like we need to "encourage use".  Price increases will encourage people to demand bitcoin, which causes the price to further increase as demand increases.We don't care much about USE since that is an organic thing that naturally grows with DEMAND.
0	1523462370	1	You can do both you know
0	1523463380	1	Fuck this just enlighten me so much. Thanks
0	1523463715	1	hodl and use some. 
0	1523463814	1	Hodl = not-selling.spending ≠ selling.
0	1523464314	1	Shut out to each dividend/share exchange program.
0	1523464941	1	It's all true. Spend and replace > HODL.HODL will convince nobody over the value of this new technology. It's when you actually do a Bitcoin transaction that you realize this shit is gonna change the world.
0	1523465273	1	Amen.
0	1523465999	1	So... SPODL?
0	1523466047	1	I totally agree with the both of you. You HODL when there is bleeding and SPEDN after PUMPING. You Sell to SPEDN during bleeding when you have a lean pocket. So vis a viz for the both of your reasons. Currency is meant for spedning and hodling

0	1523466369	1	This completely shuffles so many peoples beliefs and practices. Everyone wants to hodl. There aren't shops accepting the currency. As a matter of fact we as individuals need to start accepting to get adoption faster I believe

0	1523470664	1	Thanks op if we can get away from this investment talk and more into this replacement of fiat talk then people wont freak and get out of crypto once it dips. But alas people don’t care about the point of crypto they are just told to throw money into it
0	1523470728	1	Bitcoin is cryptogold/diamond not cryptocurrency since they are limited and need to mine.There I said that.
1	1523471858	1	.0000000_
0	1523470737	1	Doesn't make any sense whatsoever.Hodl just means you don't daytrade, don't try to time the market because you know you are a bad trader and you are just gambling.It doesn't mean don't spend and replace or don't take profit.
0	1523471228	1	I've tried to explain the concept of using my VTC to buy stuff and then just buy more VTC. Then I'm not losing the "value" of my spent VTC, but I am using it and adding to the crypto-economy. Of course now I can't do that and I have to HODL like my life depends on it because the value lost about 50% and I would have been better off hodling my cash.    Shit, I just talked myself out of spending my crypto. New argument! Fiat to crypto takes too long to be able to negate the volatility of the market! We need faster fiat to crypto exchanges. Not like coinbase where it takes a week to credit your account. 
0	1523471951	1	FIFO taxes suck. I would go broke have to pay the accountant.
0	1523472099	1	HahaFinally, this meme reached the crypto!
0	1523472224	1	Lmaoooo
0	1523456689	0	HODL isn't about not spending your crypto. It's about not daytrading.  Because there are people whose job it is to daytrade, their job is to program the bots that can outsmart you. They will outsmart you, and they will take your valuable crypto.  If you think you're a good day trader go ahead and daytrade, but if not, you will most likely end up losing money (even if you win some times).https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0But yeah, spend it if you can, just don't try to trade it unless you absolutely know what you're doing.
1	1523459621	1	Totally agree 
0	1523456635	1	“Crypto”, the latest attack on Bitcoin.
0	1523461463	1	I actually enjoyed spending Bitcoin when I had it. The minute people started to 'hodl' and community split between lightning vs bigger blocks, I sold it. Call me stupid but I actually believed and used the technology prior to this bullshit. I don't want to 'hodl' anything, I want to go out and spend my Bitcoin the way it was meant to be. So far the 'hodlers' are the biggest hypocrites because they want to cash in on the profit like it's a stock. "To the moon on my Lambo herp derp", via selling Bitcoin for dollars...
1	1523464210	1	I don't understand how hodlers impact people who want to spend bitcoin.  Care to explain?
0	1523456195	1	If it became a common currency prices would skyrocket as more people bought the limited supply.
0	1523459387	1	This is a bad meme
0	1523460822	1	Jesus I love this meme
0	1523462462	1	Three words: capital gains tax.Crypto isn't currently usable as currency in the US due to it being classified as property.
0	1523456467	-2	Awesome post I hope mods won't delete this 🙏 
0	1523461690	1	The proper way to answer this is to first consider the possible uses of bitcoins.   They appear to be good for criminal activities.    But they are mostly useless for purchasing goods and services, because hardly anybody will take them for that purpose; and most of the world will not change the fiat to use for that purpose.Nevertheless bitcoins seem to be very good for gambling: buy BTC at one price, with the hope (gamble) of later dumping it at a higher price (i.e. real money) on some late-arrival sucker.     Considering the above, hodling appears to be the only sensible option.  That is, until one gets to the point we are not at now, of BTC going to the dogs (i.e. its real value of zero).   So, at the present, there are actually three options to be considered: spend, hodl, dump.   Only the last is sensible.With that clear, smart, and succinct but comprehensive answer, I have clearly settled this dubious debate.  We may now close the thread. 
1	1523461914	1	You were so brave to post that bravo

0	1523462070	1	I used to spend more, but paying capital gains tax on crypto purchases on top of paying regular sales tax is ridiculous.
0	1523464973	1	Who HODLs any USD! Put it ALL in BTC FFS.
0	1523465129	1	If I trade crypto for other crypto is that considered spending?
0	1523465283	1	Big wallets must spend in order to create value by commercial use. We who posess the small amount have no other option than HODL!!!
0	1523466597	1	Bitcoin is not really a currency though, if anything its a commodity closer related to stocks than currencies.
0	1523467006	1	The heart of this debate is that crypto-austrians believe that the value of Bitcoin is in it's financial sovereignty, aka it's ability to act as a store of value, protected by from the state. These are usually security maximalists, often called small blockers or decentralists.Crypto-keynesians believe that the value of Bitcoin is derived from it's ability to fluidly transact, e.g as a medium of exchange. This group is usually referred to as big blockers, and put the ability to transact cheaply as higher priority than maximal security.The meme has a valid point. You can be a crypto-austrian, spend, and then rebuy. It presents increased tax complications, extra time/labor, both of which can be rationalized if you are an avid Bitcoin supporter.Jimmy Song [wrote a great article on the subject](https://medium.com/@jimmysong/segwit2x-post-mortem-divorce-of-crypto-austrians-and-crypto-keynesians-87960b11ce4c), and I think at the least we can walk away better educated and try to understand that both sides have the valid perspectives based on Modern economic theories.I personally think that the entire debate is a false equivalency because Bitcoin with lightning network will be able to serve as both a store of value and a fluid medium of exchange, making those who argue for the crypto-keynesians side seem narrow on vision.Why have one or the other when you can have both?
1	1523467501	1	Samson and Song are completely wrong in trying to create a Austrian economics analogy. Using this terminology is completely backwards. When using the real definition of "Austrian Economics", the people ascribing to the point of view would want both store of value and medium of exchange. Read Mises.
