0	1523410776	57	This bias article from "tokenenthusiast" has sources for just five individuals who left their current fintech job to work at a blockchain-related company. Almost all Coinbase...
1	1523423971	16	Yeah, as if they aren't making any money at Coinbase. A Silicon Valley fintech company...
2	1523428094	12	Which is quite a big company already with hundred(s) of employees. Many would classify it as a corporation.
3	1523460451	1	Not to mention they started off with a huge bank anyway...
1	1523421287	6	The article actually mentions 8 people who shifted to bitcoin/crypto companies and 3 / 8 of these people went to Coinbase, not almost all of them. You can call it bias, but it is not untrue or overly sensational. I thought it was interesting.
2	1523428874	12	>but it is not untrue or overly sensational.It definitely is overly sensational. Untill it provides a proper source for the claim in the title.0.001% of banking and tech executives changing their work place is not "BRAIN DRAIN". Also the article would need to have figures of how many people make the reverse career choice. It doesnt, therefore its garbage tier journalism.After reading the article, I have absolutely know no more of an answer to the question "is the crypto industry having a negative effect for the availability of tech and banking executives?"
3	1523446000	3	>0.001800.000 executives?
4	1523449742	1	Yeah I think its a fair assumption that there are +800 000 banking/tech executives in this world
3	1523428900	2	You probably meant ***DEFINITELY***  -not *'definetly'*  --------------------------------------- ^^^Beep *^^boop. ^^^I ^^^am ^^a* ^^bot ^^whose ^^^mission ^^is ^^to ^^^correct ^^your ^^^spelling. ^^This ^^^action ^^was ^^^performed ^^automatically. ^^Contact ^^^me ^^^if ^^I ^^^made ^^^A ^^mistake ^^or ^^^just ^^downvote   ^^^^^^please ^^^^^don't
4	1523429199	3	thanks
3	1523467801	1	>It definitely is overly sensational. Untill it provides a proper source for the claim in the title.The title is "Bitcoin industry steals top talent from banks and tech companies." It doesn't say anything about stealing any significant amount of talent. Maybe you think OP's title is wrong. Either way, the article itself is fine. 
4	1523468554	1	OK. New headline. 8 people working in different companies got a new job.Article:What implications does this have? Nothing./articleI just did a superior job with the story than what the original writer did.
1	1523414533	1	Its still just a few, but its becoming a trend. People are starting to realize blockchain is the path the internet will follow for, at least, the next 10 years.
0	1523410076	21	When most of the top talent already has money, it is hard to 'bribe' them with unfulfilling mundane jobs.When they could be part of something which actually leads to potentially long-lasting change, we are only now beginning to scratch the surface imho. Give it another decade...
1	1523424097	3	ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›
1	1523437558	7	These people are motivated by a common purpose, using cutting edge tech which has the potential to drastically change the world for the better.  It's a passion, not a job.
1	1523438839	1	> it is hard to 'bribe' them with unfulfilling mundane jobs.Roger Ver tried that with a couple of bitcoin devs back in the day.
0	1523417095	5	My company has 4 people who went the other direction...
0	1523415589	12	Bullshit it's not about the money.They've seen all their friends go and buy lambos and they want part of the pie.They know that being on the inside of an industry that's taking massive profits is far more profitable than negotiating a hefty wage.
1	1523423965	1	^this.You will never get rich/independent if you work for others all the time.. 
2	1523428325	3	> You will never get rich/independent if you work for others all the time..Well I know a lot of people who have invested to stocks etc along the years they have been working, and are able to retire (if they want) after a while. Also recently I have seen a lot of people who have just got rich with buying some crypto and holding it for a couple of years. All while having a normal day-to-day job.
3	1523433717	3	I agree. Being an enterpreneur nowdays is far overrated when you can own Bitcoin or some great tech stocks (like TSLA or NVDA or GOOG that were far underrated a few years ago).
1	1523461412	1	True ... but with Bitcoin you can get both: profit while also working on bettering society.
0	1523421202	5	Friday was my last day working at a Fortune 500. I'm going 100% Blockchain. Couldn't be happier
0	1523418256	9	"Greater purpose over money" what a crock full of BS!! LMAO.
1	1523439546	-1	Pretty much every one of the hundreds of bitcoin developers strongly feel this way, and bitcoin wouldn't survive it if they didn't.
2	1523450974	1	the biggest motivator is power and money.... People are not self sacrificing martyrs.
2	1523450619	0	Pretty sure most devs in crypto (myself included) are here for the money.That being said, it would be a waste of our lives to spend all this time trying to make money with something *we didn't believe in*.
0	1523431034	5	Jesus Christ. these bla bla articles are getting to me. this is not proper journalism. it's a mixture between clickbait and cycle jerk. 
0	1523414125	5	Yes.  That or there is even bigger and *easier* money to be made in crypto.    
0	1523425975	2	Isn't this the latest episode of Silicon Valley?
0	1523426365	2	Let's be serious the pay isn't bad either. 
0	1523427730	2	Top talent drives lambos
0	1523428015	2	"Smart, innovative people choosing greater purpose over money and corporations"This is a pretty weird statement, considering that many crypto businesses can be financially ridiculously lucrative compared to traditional businesses.
0	1523439040	2	I have a friend that is graduating a lawyer and wants to work for free for local NGO that help the city and the citizens. The idea attracts people who are on the vibration.
0	1523407157	4	Also the super smart kids know that crypto is the future and they can get far richer building systems for crypto vs building bank software 
0	1523413607	4	This has always been a big factor in my confidence of bitcoin ultimately succeeding.  
0	1523421421	2	Very bight future indeed!
0	1523426184	1	It sounds like banks do not want to implement a blockchain into their work for some reason, but i guess that's not quite true. Just maybe  in areas like this profit from innovations comes with a larger delay
1	1523436179	4	A blockchain offers nothing to the current financial system that a database can't do like 100x faster.
0	1523441343	1	Wait. There were smart people in banks?
0	1523443270	1	Because they knew they will have a brighter future with crypto than banks :) 
0	1523444319	1	Interesting article.  Maybe half true and half not but the more important thing here is that crypto is gaining so much popularity that whether we like it or not it's something that's to stay.
0	1523446704	1	overall, it's their own choices which i have no rant for it.
0	1523450349	1	They choose those positions mainly because of the money
0	1523453972	1	People have no faith in crypto. 
0	1523457316	1	Maybe they see crypto and bitcoin is a greener pasture and they see this community as a future so they want to be on the trends before its gone
0	1523463261	1	You people are really delusional. Using a website called "token enthusiast" as a source for claiming some movement like a "brain drain" is occurring, and even the source itself could only muster up 5 anecdotal cases of the thing they claim is happening. To top it all off, 4 of the 5 departures are related to one another....
0	1523452685	1	Theranos pulled in "top talent" too.
