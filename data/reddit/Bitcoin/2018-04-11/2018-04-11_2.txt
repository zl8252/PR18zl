1	1523411649	20	As the old adage says, “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it”. The financial system is broken however. 
1	1523411669	2	You're right. 
1	1523416311	1	And they always will be
1	1523445886	1	The question is whether 30 years ago you could have ear buds that fit in your pocket if you wanted (I actually don't know) But, otherwise you're missing the whole point and could nit almost every item there. A paper book is still a paper book etc.
2	1523446766	0	I nit picked the over ear headphones because he's also wearing a smaller set of headphones. Good catch on the book. A Kindle is relatively the same size as a paperback, and thus doesn't fit in your pocket any better. 
3	1523447148	1	But you *can* read an ebook on a smartphone, so the example still applies
4	1523447793	0	Maybe you can. But I can't. My eyes hurt after a few minutes stairing at a cellphone screen. 
5	1523457097	1	But it is possible.
3	1523447357	1	I'm not sure if those would fit in his pocket either but its weird that they gave him two. I actually never used the kindle and would read on my phone on the subway because it fit in my pocket even though the e-ink is nicer.
3	1523449101	1	>  A Kindle is relatively the same size as a paperbackNot necessarily.  I use the Kindle app on my  phone.   If you  WANT  the version that doesn't fit in your pocket for  comfort reasons:  that's a different story.There are headphones that can fit in your pocket,  but  the larger options are still available,  and the larger versions of some products still have some advantages  at least for some people  --- you take the one that doesn't fit in your pocket because you value some other quality above portability.I want certain ergonomics from my gaming PC,  plus a lot of computing power,   that's why I chose a tower and not a laptop or an iPad,   for that purpose,  for example.
1	1523460534	1	wow get fukn rekt OP
1	1523430348	-2	But you rarely see anyone wearing those in public anymore. Now, it’s mostly just earphones or AirPod-like wireless earphones
2	1523446882	3	Over ear headphones weren't seen much in public in the past either. They were designed to listen to music at home when you couldn't use your big speaker system. 
2	1523460383	1	You must not spend very much time in airports.
3	1523460520	1	I drop off and pick up my mom twice a week, if that counts
4	1523460597	1	Well if you see me I'll be wearing my Sony WH-1000XM2s or Bose QC 35s. I have airpods but they don't cut it on an airplane.EDIT: Beats headphones are garbage. Stop buying them.
2	1523451643	0	What? I see them all the time. Shit, one of the most popular headphones (beats) are over-the-ear.
3	1523452298	-1	Beats are definitely not the most popular headphones..
4	1523452396	0	>**one** of the most popular headphones
5	1523453111	-1	Sorry, Hitler. Let me FTFY:> Beats are definitely not one of the most popular headphones..
6	1523453633	1	There's a big difference between **the** most popular and **one** of the most popular.I'm not saying beats are the  best, or even one of the best. I'm not saying they're worth their price. But beats are most definitely one of the most popular headphones today. 
7	1523454384	-2	And I’m saying that they’re definitely not. I haven’t seen anyone wearing them in well over half a year now. Everyone either wears apple headphones (not Beats lol) or cheap dollar store headphones
8	1523455172	2	Well these articles/statistics show otherwise:https://9to5mac.com/2017/01/11/apples-airpods-and-wireless-beats-take-40-of-all-recent-bluetooth-headphone-sales/https://www.statista.com/statistics/697001/headphone-ownership-by-brand-in-the-us/https://www.statista.com/chart/7993/headphone-market-share/http://fortune.com/2017/01/11/wireless-headphone-sales-soared-apple-airpods/https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2017/its-the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year-for-headphone-sales/https://www.statisticbrain.com/headphone-industry-market-share-statistics/Also, I see them all the time. Your relying too much on your perception bias. 
9	1523455490	-1	Literally every single one of those is Apple/Beats, not just Beats. Which means that it includes the insanely popular AirPods and (for the stats that weren’t about wireless only) Apple earphones. I don’t know what you’re trying to prove here. I never said that Apple earphones weren’t popular. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. I was only saying that Beats aren’t as popular.
0	1523409032	48	Where's the million other products that failed miserably?Survivor bias is fun. 
1	1523413760	14	Isn't that a betamax player right in the front?
2	1523421903	11	yeah and now you can fit your betamax player in your pocket.
3	1523429996	3	I don't think I can fit a betamax player in my pocket.  
4	1523430166	6	i think you're missing the point of the post.they make *really* big pockets these days. get with the times man.
5	1523435627	2	I thought we've eliminated pockets now?We haven't come up with a better way to carry things, we just got rid of the things made to carry them.
3	1523445938	1	I was pointing out that it was a failed product, VHS dominated the videocassette industry. I can't think of a shitcoin to compare it to though.
4	1523446904	1	verge?
5	1523448421	1	Perfect
1	1523418217	4	Well this comment just seems misplaced, all of those things have been upgraded. Unless you're describing what is going to replace the pocket, and in that case shut up and take my money
1	1523411590	4	We all know most of the altcoins will die off. But those that survive will change the world. 
2	1523412958	8	You calling the Sony Walkman an altcoin?
3	1523416297	1	Haha I hope not
3	1523442558	1	The Talkboy was a soft fork of the Sony Walkman
2	1523413757	3	Unless all of them die off
1	1523454185	2	Lindy effect; the longer something nonperishable survives, the longer it is likely to stay around
2	1523463859	1	The tech isn't going anywhere, you're right. Doesn't mean these coins will survive. 
0	1523414885	32	Last I checked I don't have a little guy from the 80s in my pocket. 
1	1523424024	20	No little guy in your pants?
2	1523434404	8	Perhaps OP lost a bet on Reddit and had to eat him.
1	1523429925	2	Last I checked, I still can't fit a VCR, Boombox, oldschool camcorder, and bunch of other retro electronics all in my pocket.
2	1523430830	5	So what you're saying is, in another 30 years, they'll invent bigger pockets.
3	1523437290	5	Remember the 90's?
4	1523447181	2	JNCOs are coming back.
5	1523454847	1	Haha, you knew exactly what I was talking about.
1	1523437259	1	He's hiding under your underwear.
0	1523424293	7	I Swiss Bank also fits in your pocket.
0	1523407069	5	Many new cars still come with CD players
1	1523408076	13	My 2007 Hyundai had a tape deck. I mean come on. Really? :)
2	1523410176	3	LOL
2	1523416327	1	Hey that's cool, I would love a tape deck
3	1523451915	1	It's real cool, go to goodwill and find a couple greatest hits and you're set.  Bought my last car Bob Marley, Queen, and Jimi Hendrix cassettes for a dollar each.  Waiting for FF & RW is a nostalgia hit
1	1523410527	2	Do they really?
2	1523416344	2	CDs are nowhere near a dead format
1	1523411794	1	They should still come with CD. As well as should come with a USB for flash drives. I started using flash drives in my cars in 2006 or 2007. I don't think it's time to start phasing out CD to the point that we can't use our music CDs.Honestly wouldn't complain if there was also a tape deck too. Just in case.
0	1523413878	4	What magazine did this advertisement come out of. 
0	1523411741	3	You can fit a VHS player in your pocket? :P
1	1523416357	3	If you're wearing JNCO jeans
0	1523420022	3	Wires have been the same since then :(
1	1523420106	2	IoT will change that. 
0	1523415590	8	Your phone isn't yours. Everything you do on it, everything except bitcoin, belongs to someone else. Prove me wrong by using blockchain proof. Protip: you can't. 
1	1523465867	1	Something not being provable with the blockchain doesn't imply that its converse is true.
1	1523416271	0	I absolutely agree. All cellular devices are finely tuned instruments of surveillance built to know and record your every move. This technology gives us the ability to do amazing things but most people don’t recognize the danger inherent to owning these devices. I do believe that the advent of blockchain technology will give us the ability to monetize our personal statistical data. Thus providing a physical support to the concept of universal basic income. 
2	1523421503	2	Could you explain how we would be able to "monetize our personal statistical data" using blockchain technology? 
3	1523446245	1	Bitcoin has always been about money for nothing.It's easy to just sit there thinking about making money. And that's why /r/bitcoin does it -- just sitting there, rocking back and forth, thinking about making all that money.
3	1523422071	1	Through the tokenization of user interaction we will be able to effectively make standard income just by living and interacting with society. We already have Steemit and we will have social media’s like on the blockchain that will allow for said usability. 
4	1523422191	1	Thanks, I wasn't sure if you were referencing something similar to Steemit or something new I've never heard of.
5	1523422854	1	Once medical surveying accessories improve the daily routine will make you money as it provides data for just living. It’s not that the blockchain will save us. It’s the combination of many different advancements made in the last decade. 
4	1523442873	1	What if the users won't give a damn about tokenizing their interactions and just want to...you know, interact?
5	1523447431	1	What if the users of the current system don’t want to work and just want to hunt, farm, camp, and live off the land?
6	1523452021	2	You can do these things you know. Not that everyone is interested in them. What does it have to do with a service already used by billions of people?Let me put it this way. Let's take Wolf of Wall Street "sell me this pen" type of scene and remake it into "sell me this social media platform" except you have to sell it to the average Joes who already are on facebook along with their friends and family. Not some neckbeard tech enthusiasts who migrate to other platforms because they see some interesting features, regular people who are rooted like plants.How do you convince enough of them to switch to another platform with a sales pitch about monetizing their data when they clearly don't care about it since they use free services that already do everything they want? You said it yourself in previous post, most people don't realize the implications of using things that collect their personal data in the first place.Google tried to beat facebook and failed horribly. Just offering better/more insteresting features is not enough. The network effect of Facebook is tremendous. And you want to beat it with a sales pitch about collecting your personal data ( nobody cares) and some shitty tokens? Sorry, that's not how you will win over the normies. Now if everyone care about their personal data as much as more aware, tech savvy consumers, then maybe it would be a different story.
7	1523466265	1	Exactly.
0	1523421228	2	Moore’s Law!
0	1523422357	2	Yep. Add your wallet, a swiss bank and a bunch of bars of gold to that collection.
0	1523424791	2	Anyone seen my mini-discs?
1	1523429237	1	omg I loved my mini discs
1	1523434487	1	Not from the 80's, dude.
0	1523431412	2	Still can't play vhs on my phone
0	1523421876	1	a cassette player already fit in your pocket
0	1523425017	1	You must have big pockets. 
0	1523426497	1	>via 9gag.com
0	1523432785	1	Why does this look like zweback?
0	1523433318	1	my phone has no printer yet!
0	1523437475	1	There's a massive flaw with this man's logic here. All those items are now obsolete and worthless.So he's basically saying, 30 years from now, Bitcoin will be a worthless meme that everyone makes fun of. Because Bitcoin will have been replaced by crypto currencies that will fit in your pocket.
1	1523447600	1	No, it’s like saying that in 30 years, version 0.16 of Bitcoin, or whatever we’re on, will be obselete. Of course it will, but it will have been upgraded to better technology.
2	1523454578	1	And I'd like to agree with you. But Bitcoin is not innovating anymore. Hell, it's barely able to scale. We're alright for now, and lightning was a good move. But look at that whole mess it took to get us here. 
0	1523437524	1	Give it another 30 years and a phone will simply be a hologram in your pocket.. 
0	1523437668	1	Ah, so now I fit the Bank in my pocket, with Bitcoin. Clever!
0	1523442430	1	Can you fit an HD-DVD player in your pocket? Nope because it failed. Not all technologies are adopted.
1	1523447653	2	That’s because Blu-ray had a cooler and more recognizable name and HD-DVDs were dumb and required more discs for the same amount of storage.The tech progressed though. Stop being all autistically literal. Can you watch an HD movie on your phone? Then you don’t need to fit an HD-DVD player in your pocket. The tech progressed beyond even needing a disc.The way you’re thinking is the way people are thinking about bitcoin. That they should be able to fit the entire brick and mortar bank in their pocket, literally.In today’s world, the format war between Blu-ray and HD-DVD doesn’t matter. It was just a stepping stone. Neither were meant to be a standard forever.
2	1523448089	1	You're missing my point. I get the point of the post. I was just implying that not all technologies make it. Some die before they're ever adopted on a global scale. This post makes great use of the survivorship bias

0	1523446846	1	but the headphone/earphone never changeeee
1	1523448157	1	But they also aren’t really required to listen to music on a phone like they were with walkmans.
0	1523447283	1	Please someone make a pic of multiple large skyscrapers with banks names all over them, and caption it "in 20 years, all of these will fit in your pocket -->" pointing to a hardware wallet.Then collage it with this meme and title it "history repeating".
0	1523447603	1	I hate to say this but this is a bcash argument. In my experience people who are working on Schnorr signatures, compact blocks, lightning network, etc. hate it when someone mentions Moore's law on Twitter as if to say that we can scale by just waiting for exponential improvement in bandwidth, storage, etc.
0	1523448042	1	where is the zune?

0	1523448869	1	Thanks to greed.  
0	1523450094	1	Just think of all that media could be paid for on demand and instantly with a Tron Token. Haters are going to hate but it's the truth.  Guys TRON is no joke  it has to be Marketed 24/7 because it's has to reach the masses. Unlike Etherium or Icon That only need to reach B2B. TRON is a big.  It's run by the foundation that is well connected. That timesquare advertising stunt was to show that they have the reach and influence.  That particular add spot has a year long waiting list. To get to cut in line shows they have influence. You guys don't Know that because your a bunch of Investors who don't think. So pull your head out of the crowd think and open your eyes. Or guys like me will end up eating your lunch.
0	1523450145	1	Interesting though if you think about how this image relates to bitcoin from a different perspective-one that sees bitcoin as one of these tech dinosaurs in the block chain space that becomes completely outdated 
0	1523455042	1	This needs to include another guy off to the side with a microphone and headphones listening to what this guy is doing.
0	1523456822	1	Guardians of the Galaxy traveled across the universe. Still using cassette player. Checkmate.
0	1523459047	1	Nope, I'm still unable to get a VHS in my pocket
0	1523460091	1	Yet nobody uses them.
1	1523461860	1	The point is that smart phones now do what all these things did: stream movies, play music, take video.  New technology, same purpose(s).
0	1523401559	-1	That's simply not true. 1. A phone sensor and lens can take snapshots and home video. But it can't provide the whole range of optical features that a professional video camera, or even a $1000 DSLR can. It's a matter of sensor size and light physics. 2. Phone speakers have neither produce the range of sounds, nor the volume that large speakers in boom boxes can. (That's why external speakers are sold) Want to listen to music while playing basketball, that boombox would work, your phone not so much. Again, a matter of physics. 3. You can't compare typing on a phone screen to that of a full size keyboard.Products still exists to provide the full range of functionality, none of which fit in your pocket. Beyond that, it's a false equivalency comparing the miniaturization of microprocessors and storage technology with the problems that bitcoin faces. Many of the bitcoin problems are inherit to the technology. You can't make blockchain transactions faster or consume less energy, they are intentionally throttled. So, it will always cost as much in energy to mine bitcoin as the market will support. Faster more efficient computers just yield harder hash problems to compensate. 
1	1523411060	4	I mean, you point out all of these things but not the full sized person?
1	1523408072	3	We will run out of oil in 50 years! 
1	1523409563	2	> Faster more efficient computers just yield harder hash problems to compensate.And so the difficulty was raised again.
1	1523411526	1	As the technology progresses the consumption of energy will become irrelevant as we progress to renewables. The transition from silicon to carbon will also nullify the processing problem. I recognize that the evolution of a certain tech isn’t a good representation but my point was the convergence of all these technologies will bring forth the future. 
2	1523412709	3	It's not that simple. How many bitcoin transactions that are processed isn't a matter of raw power. If 1/2 the miners quit tomorrow, the hash difficulty would go down, the block rate would be restored, and the number of transactions processed per second would stay the same. On the flip side, if power becomes cheaper, we'll get more miners and the difficulty will go up. If processing power increases, we'll get increases in the hash rate, which will cause the difficulty to go up. The power consumption problems STAYS.The only solution is technologies like lightning. But, these aren't really bitcoin, nor do they have the same benefits of having your transactions written to the distributed ledger. So, having Visa / Mastercoin as lightning nodes doesn't really sounds like technology saving bitcoin to me. It sounds like a corporate takeover. 
3	1523420365	2	I believe we are arguing the same point but with different timeframes.  
1	1523459448	1	Can smartphones pick up radio and TV transmissions?
2	1523460866	1	For Radio, [Yes and No](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/fm-radio-in-smartphones/)
0	1523443676	0	And that little thing that holds all of those costs more and more a little every year.
