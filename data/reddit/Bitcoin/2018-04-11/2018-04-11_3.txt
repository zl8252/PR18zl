0	1523448465	25	10nm? Whats Bitmain's again?
1	1523449482	9	[S9 is 16nm](https://shop.bitmain.com/antminer_s9_asic_bitcoin_miner.htm)
2	1523451789	16	Wow. Am I understanding this correctly then, HalongMining have actually stepped firmly in front of Bitmain in terms of mining efficiency/technology?!
3	1523453303	18	I read an article saying that actual hash/joule ratios are similar in both, marginally better for Halong. Something is odd. Halong has asicboost AND 10nm tech and is only marginally better than antminers?One possible answer is that algorithm and ASIC design are subpar but I'm not sure how much can you gain, provided that SHA256^2 algorithms are extensively known and ASIC optimization design decisions are usually made by algorithms (wild guess on my side) Any electronics engineers in the room?
4	1523454689	18	First generation miners from a company being marginally better than previous state of the art. I'm still surprised(and glad) they hit it, and wouldn't be surprised if there were more efficiencies to squeeze out.
5	1523455414	6	I agree that it's an accomplishment in its own right.  Surely a 10nm fab is more expensive than 16nm though.  Regardless, competition in this space is a very welcome thing. 
6	1523459785	1	Competition is probably why the increase in efficiency is marginal. I wouldn't be surprised if Halong is already capable of a significant increase in efficiency with the 10nm circuits, but it's throttled so as not to hit the ceiling with their first product on the market.
5	1523458667	1	I'm glad there is competition on the mining chips, I was getting tired of hiding my head in the sand.But my understanding is that the relative simplicity of SHA256^2 make the implementation on ASICs simple, as in: no too much room for improvement, maybe 10-20%.So even a mediocre implementation of both 10nm && AsicBoost should have been way better. I'm open for answers because I know I can be wrong.Maybe the AsicBoost part was poorly implemented, I noticed there were no more asicboost blocks since 4/5 , this of course can be variance, but not very likely.
4	1523464014	1	The Antminer S3 had an efficiency of 0.77 J/GH on a 28 nm process. The Antminer S7 had an efficiency of 0.25 J/GH on a 28 nm process.Manufacturing process matters, but it's not the most important factor. ASICBOOST gives a 20% to 30% boost in efficiency, but you can get larger benefits from good layout and design, low threshold voltage transistors, and all of the other trade secrets that a good design firm with a few years' experience with SHA256d design would have.HalongMining was able to get their first product to be slightly superior in efficiency to Bitmain's 5th-generation product. This is somewhat impressive. However, they did so using a manufacturing process that is about 2 years newer than Bitmain's 5th-gen product, and that is likely responsible for most of the delta.
5	1523466408	1	I thought SegWit eliminated covert asicboost?  Is 'open' asicboost still implementable?
6	1523467208	1	SegWit eliminates one ([c2](https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2017/04/10/the-relation-between-segwit-and-asicboost-covert-and-overt/)) of several forms of covert ASICBoost. It does not prevent the other covert methods as nor overt ASICBoost.
7	1523467219	1	It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users. I will extend those so they're easier for our sausage fingers to click![Here is link number 1](https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2017/04/10/the-relation-between-segwit-and-asicboost-covert-and-overt/) - Previous text "c2"----^Please ^PM ^/u/eganwall ^with ^issues ^or ^feedback! ^| ^[Delete](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=FatFingerHelperBot&subject=delete&message=delete%20dx708iv)
4	1523464905	1	It seems to me that shrinking the die to 10mm is the hard part. They can more easily iterate on their circuit designs than Bitmain can shrink their dies.
4	1523469381	1	What's happening is asic optimization is already near it's tail end. There's only so much room on a chip for heat. Keep packing it smaller and smaller and they have to get more creative, spread everything out father and father.  But even that has its limits. Within a few years it'll be easy to aquire an asic within 10% of the fastest commercial stuff for as much as a decent gpu, without fear of a 10x replacement coming out next month.
4	1523456788	1	This is speculation on my part but this kind of process (chip design) is incremental to begin with, therefor why not put out a batch as soon as you have something marketable? Not like you would stop your R&D effort anyways, so might as well lock in some revenue, right? It's one of those "perfect gets in the way of progress" situations imo.
5	1523458830	1	I would expect a 10-20% improvement on a second iteration, but Asicboost alone should give you 18.5% and on top of that you have the 10nm efficiencies.  I can be wrong.
3	1523463406	1	It means that HalongMining has partnered with a manufacturer who has a more modern manufacturing process, and that their current advantage in performance and efficiency is most likely due to manufacturing technology rather than design quality. Once Bitmain's manufacturer (TSMC) catches up, this performance gap should disappear or reverse.
3	1523458715	1	Hopefully they keep their prices competitive!
2	1523456098	-3	bitmain can just die shrink their current s9 chips to 10nm and it would probably beat out halong dragonmint shitty chipsLUL
3	1523456540	9	Not necessarily. Thermal limitations come into play at these sizes. We're near an awkward threshold for computing right now.
3	1523457731	3	Still the cost to do this are immense. Also a sha256 design is not rocket science. Every chip designer can come up with a 10nm ASIC if he is willing to spend the money.
4	1523457962	1	ok then what went wrong with dragonmint, the stats are just garbo 
5	1523467408	1	We don't have verifiable numbers yet, but many things can go "wrong" with a bleeding edge process. One explanation could be low yield, which still results in usable chips but at lower performance. Fabs need iterations to adjust a new process to optimum, it is never perfect from start. Mining ASICs are a good test vehicle for that, because they are produced at high volume and are usable with defects (because defect cores can be disabled or ignored). When the fab has brought up their process to optimum, the 10nm ASICs should show a significant improvement in both, power efficiency and manufacturing cost over 16nm chips. 
6	1523470699	1	Nobody uses mining for the claimed "test purposes".   E.g the industry (Samsung etc)  is already at 7nm and wlll shortly  rolling out that on mobile phones etc. without any "mining" tests involved.  If anything, the mining ASICs are actually behind.
5	1523464253	1	maybe lack of startup capital, wanting miners to market quicker to turn profit etc. Since this clearly is "good enough" they might have settled and now working on improvements.
5	1523465358	1	Maybe they are more overclockable/stable and produce less heat? Or maybe there are gains to be made with firmware upgrades alone? And also at some point the % jump in mining gains from gen to gen are going to slow down anyway, like the CPU market (correct me if I am wrong)
0	1523458921	1	Aaaaaand bitmain announces “new” 10nm ASIC that they have been mining on for 3 months in 3...2...
0	1523462093	1	now Cobra and some other sockpuppets have to tell us why this is vaporware again ;)
1	1523464966	1	Are they shipping to actual customers yet? It's vaporware until they start.
2	1523467034	1	Lots of folks got their orders last week.
3	1523467295	1	Source? I'd think I would have heard about it here if that were the case.
4	1523469642	1	Dragonmint has certainly been shipping its Blake miners. They're real.
5	1523469965	1	HalongMining is the manufacturer. Dragonmint T1 is the SHA256 (Bitcoin) miner. Blake256 (Siacoin) or Blake2b (Decred)? Those are two completely different algorithms. In short, I don't believe you understand what you're talking about.
4	1523469711	1	Follow Brian Hoffman, Francis Pouliot, Alphonse Pace, Chiefy on Twitter, they have been posting pics
4	1523469893	1	You must not be on twitter. Tons of well known and respected people in the Bitcoin community have confirmed that they've received their T1s. You can scroll through Halong Minings twitter account: https://twitter.com/HalongMining. They've retweeted a lot of pictures and videos/livestreams of happy customers. This is like two weeks old "news" at this point.
4	1523467336	1	There's ads and pictures all over craigslist in my area.
0	1523452983	7	So then why are they no more efficient? (Maybe minimally more efficient but not what I was anticipating for the next gen chip)
1	1523453581	2	that is what I'm asking... can't be algorithm suboptimal design, we know SHA256 too well now .ASIC overall design can not be so crappy that it offsets asicboost gains. Something is odd.
2	1523455173	3	This does sound very strange, a better chip alone should be significantly better....but with ASIC boost it should blow the Antminer totally out of the water. Can someone else comment on this? Is there really a 10nm chip in there at all?
3	1523455922	6	Well the most obvious answer is that they're somehow being hobbled off the top. If you blow the doors off of an already efficient product out of the gate, you make it quite hard to make a followup.IMHO, when you a machine that literally creates money, you give the plebs the 'starter' pack while you're running the unleashed (or whatever) version for yourself.
4	1523456125	4	This does make sense. As long as it is a bit better and a bit cheaper its an obvious choice.
3	1523458865	1	Asicboost blocks stopped coming on April 5, something is odd. This does not make any sense. did miners disable asicboost because it was not well programmed?  what is the story with those nibbles 0xF instead of using individual bits?
2	1523467590	1	Low yield of a bleeding edge process, nothing odd. 
0	1523448650	7	Hey Samsung I want a phone with a dragonmint chip to mine during the night... :)
1	1523451305	3	They fab them. They aren't the designers, owners or sellers. For all we know, the designer/owner/seller is Bitmain.The company appears to be Halong Mining, however. 
2	1523452276	4	Who fabs bitmains miners?
3	1523452441	6	TSMC 
2	1523453481	2	Halong can still be a sybill attack by Bitmain. They mine BCH and BTC, so they have enough money to spread their bets.Bitmain uses a different foundry so that makes this reasoning is a little less likely or not. I guess we'll never know.  We'll never know who controls Bitmain either.
3	1523459319	1	> Halong can still be a sybill attack by BitmainYou think btcdrak is working with bitmain? That's a lol
4	1523460337	1	I'm not so involved with all this. Will research Drak, I kind of remember some of his posts in theymos website. Anyway, don't trust, verify.
5	1523460573	1	He's a Bitcoin core developer. Considering his lifetime of discussion on the topic there is a greater chance of winning the lottery the same day that you're struck by lightning thrice in the same spot, then there is him working withBitmain.
6	1523462076	1	yes, i checked his background and he is clean :)hopes.renew();
1	1523458006	1	I want one built-in in each USB key, motherboard, washing machine, TV etc.
2	1523459266	1	LOL
0	1523459422	1	ITT - A lot of bitmain shills and ignorance. 
0	1523454665	7	This is false advertisement. These Asics started being advertised as the most efficient without accounting for the Asicboost. If you use Asicboost on a Bitmain Asic you get about the same efficiency. Somehow this DragonMinge gets no efficiency improvement even though they've supposedly went to 10nm compared to 16nm from Bitmain? How did they manage that?Oh, and have they actually delivered yet, proven with a teardown of an actual product by an independent customer?
1	1523457210	5	Asicboost can only be used to mine blocks that don't contain Segwit transactions, though.[Judge for yourself where that trend is headed.](http://segwit.party/charts/#)
2	1523465232	1	**Covert** Asicboost can only be used to mine blocks that don't contain SegWit transactions. Halong uses **overt** Asicboost, which as far as I'm aware, Bitmain doesn't have a license for. In order to acquire a license, they would have to open up their patent portfolio.
3	1523467578	1	Why is Asicboost OK all of the sudden? I know we are talking about overt and with no political agenda (like stopping SegWit) now BUT - doesnt Asicboost still criple the block content? E.g. ommiting certain txs or even mining empty blocks sometimes? 
4	1523468969	1	>Why is Asicboost OK all of the sudden?There was never anything wrong with overt ASICBoost. People just confused the two, didn't know the difference, or just used ASCIBoost as shorthand for "covert ASICBoost" because that's all that was in use at the time.>doesnt Asicboost still criple the block content? E.g. ommiting certain txs or even mining empty blocks sometimes?No, only *covert* ASICBoost has that result because they grind on the coinbase scriptsig, which is now used as witness merkle root. Overt ASICBoost uses some of the version bits in the block header, which has only one negative effect: it decreases the number of simultaneous BIP9 soft forks. Which IMO isn't a huge deal as I don't think we'll be using BIP9 in the future (just look at what happened when we used it for SegWit).
5	1523470585	1	Thanks for clarification! So Im wondering why would anybody use covert version when overt is overall better?
6	1523470741	1	Because ASICBoost is patented*, and covert ASICBoost is impossible to definitively detect.\* That may seem bad, but in order to obtain a license, all you need to do is comply with the [Blockchain Defensive Patent License](https://blockchaindpl.org/).
2	1523458487	1	_If that were true_, Halong would be dead in the water - DragonMint can only mine 4Th/s without ASICBoost. Covert ASICBoost, achieved by finding merkle root collisions is nigh unusable with Segwit, but there is no technical reason Bitmain systems couldn't support overt ASICBoost through version rolling.
3	1523464801	1	> DragonMint can only mine 4Th/s without ASICBoostThis is not accurate. When running with a pool that does not support ASICBoost, the DragonMint still mines at 16 TH/s, but 75% of the hashes that it performs use a block version that the pool is not expecting, so the pool only sees 4 TH/s of valid hashrate.
4	1523468568	1	Wait, it can't be turned off?? I assumed that you could just turn Asicboost off and mine at about the same hashrate as an S9 (was it about 13.5Th/s).
3	1523458858	1	If they did, the block headers would make it apparent, right? That's why it's called "overt", after all.If so, it is accurate to say, as I did, in the present tense:> Asicboost can only be used to mine blocks that don't contain Segwit transactionsExpecting me to append "Shit can happen" to all my posts seems unreasonable.
4	1523458911	1	That's why it's called overt. So what if it was made apparent?
3	1523459221	1	> If that were true, Halong would be dead in the water - DragonMint can only mine 4Th/s without ASICBoost.And where are you getting this info from? AB only provides a small advantage....nothing to the tune of 400%, which is what it would need to be for your statement to be true considering the t1 is 16TH/s with AB.>but there is no technical reason Bitmain systems couldn't support overt ASICBoost through version rolling.I suppose bitmain could alter their hw logic to support VR AB for BTC and covert for BCH, but the economic reason would be they would have to create a miner that supports both chains. This adds complexity, therefore time and money, though arguably something bitmain has plenty of.
4	1523459846	1	> And where are you getting this info from?[From the guy who wrote the driver for it.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2443327.msg31805440#msg31805440)> Yes, only with asicboost. The driver will not try to mine on pools that don't support it. It can work in a crippled manner with non-asicboost pools, but only produces 1/4 the hashrate..         > I suppose bitmain could alter their hw logic to support VR AB for BTC and covert for BCH, but the economic reason would be they would have to create a miner that supports both chains.This is almost certainly a software change, not hardware.
5	1523460411	1	> It can work in a crippled manner with non-asicboost **pools**, but only produces 1/4 the hashrate.This is an important distinction that you appear to have taken out of context. This feature creates an economic incentive for pools to support version rolling Asic boost.I see this is a non-issue and the scenario that you have presented is unlikely to ever be a reality.
6	1523460507	1	What did I take out of context? Without ASICBoost, Dragonmint operates at 1/4 output, 4Th/s.
7	1523460714	1	Without an AB **pool**, it operates at 1/4th. Which means you can mine solo at full speed, or use slush, or any of the other pools that will make VR AB compatible in the very near future now that dragonmint is live.Once you understand the facts here one can reasonably conclude that you are simply fear-mongering about a non-issue.This is literally the same argument that was used with segwit adoption. Blah blah segwit will never be a reality because no one will adopt it vaporware blah blah. Ignoring the context of reality does not prove your point it just makes it obvious that you lack vision.
8	1523460913	1	If you're mining solo, you'll still need to use ASICBoost to achieve 16Th/s on the Dragonmint.How am I fear-mongering? I was demonstrating that **it is possible** to use ASICBoost with Segwit.
7	1523464936	1	No. Without pool-side ASICBoost support, 75% of the hashes that DragonMint performs use a block version that the poolserver is not expecting, so only 25% of the hashes are considered valid.
8	1523465594	1	Can version rolling not be disabled? Would it more accurate to say that DragonMint cannot mine without ASICBoost _at all_?
9	1523466173	1	As I understand the way it works, it cannot. However, I do not have one, so I could be wrong.
0	1523458051	1	Doesn't an S9 put out 14TH whilst using 300W less? AKA this board is less efficient whilst being on a smaller node?
1	1523463517	1	An S9 draws 1340W of power for 14TH, that's an efficiency of 95.7 J/TH. [Source](https://shop.bitmain.com/specifications.htm?name=antminer_s9_asic_bitcoin_miner)Whereas a Dragonmint T1 draws 1480W for 16TH, so 92.5 J/TH efficiency, a 3.3% improvement compared to the S9. [Source](https://halongmining.com/shop/dragonmint-16t-miner/)
2	1523463605	1	So fuck all real world gain despite being on a node less than half the size.
3	1523464855	1	maybe a reduction in heat and more overclockablity with its smaller die size? Also maybe at some point the % jump from each gen is going to be huge? Like watching the CPU market the last 5 years or so. The die gets smaller and things get faster, but not like the huge jumps of 2000-2010
0	1523458231	1	I'm grateful to see more competition in mining.But I'm even more grateful that enterprise is investing so much time and money into the mining sector.The invested capital in mining is becoming more of a useful metric to predict Bitcoins value.
0	1523458886	1	I was searching what size they used yesterday and today I got the answer without searching. But I really think halong should provide that information on the product page.
0	1523460942	1	I think this means more babies will die.
0	1523459739	1	is it too late for bitcoin to be asic resistant? 
1	1523468896	1	[It's never been a good idea](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/asic-faq.pdf). The best course of action hasn't changed - tough it out until either Bitmain _forces_ us to PoW fork with a 51% attack, or ASICs [commoditize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commoditization).
