0	1523446781	20	So, POW is still the only reliable chain selection mechanism - meaning everybody arguing that POS is the answer to the energy requirements of crypto hasn't done their research?
1	1523447780	3	what if producing a coin is like 100usd, and you only sell 10% of the mined coins to make the price soar?, and then sell all your coins to have a dip?, and build cheap to start all over?.Bitcoin high cost production is like a tax, force miners to sell their coins.
2	1523448289	5	PoW is just more fair, anything buying selling mining etc. is speculation, but the distributed PoW is the most secure and fair distribution method.
3	1523448618	2	Sadly the best thing for Bitcoin was having users forced to buy Bitcoin. Just imagine that anyone can produce a Bitcoin at home, then the value would be so low now. But today miners area forced to sell thanks to electricity bills(tax) and users forced to buy to keep alive the market. While in ether you turn on you computer and produce money, sorry but money don't work that way. 
4	1523448997	3	It's an interesting system computers are using their power to secure the chain.  It would be best if everyone had the latest nm sized ASIC at home.  People are rewarded .00003 or whatever doesn't make the value low.  Everything with electricity price and selling is speculation.  It's nice having buyers who value this secure blockchain system providing market liquidity.  
5	1523449785	2	Yes. But crypto today is too small. Nvidia could be making billions with VGA for minning crypto. But they don't do it, why?, Avoid bad press and any kind of troubles. When Bitcoin become more mainstream than today, we will see big companies minning and the end of current centralization. Patience guys. 
6	1523450297	2	I hope so.  It looks like intel and samsung are entering the mining game this year.  
7	1523450661	-1	Today still crypto is about money laundry, silk road and don't forget "Bitcoin value is 0". But thanks to pow(compromise with the coin), when that kind of money and companies comes into play, they aren't leaving any time soon and the price and trust will soar. 
2	1523456745	1	This assumes demand exists for 100% of production - what if producing a coin is like 100usd and no one wants any?  How does limiting the distribution of an item with a value of $0 increase its value?
1	1523458889	1	Hybrid PoW/PoS can be the best of both worlds.
0	1523435001	9	Highly recommended piece.
1	1523446703	3	Thanks 
1	1523459158	1	I don't think it's very good. No mention of any of the projects experimenting with PoS after PeerCoin. Seems like an Ethereum shill piece.
2	1523461017	1	So no mention of Nxt? Still what I consider the industry standard for POS. Nxt had most of Eth features years ago, but was before it's time and not well distributed during their ICO. 
0	1523444081	28	I don't like the idea.  Ethereum wasn't fairly distributed  (12,000,000 went to developer and 60,000,000 was a token presale). PoS gives these people too much power to decide what happens on chain in the future.  If you look at some ethereum developers tweets they say they will do everything in their power to make certain apps winners and losers and apps they don't like should fork off their network.  This goes against what blockchain is imo.
1	1523457421	5	eth is a security
2	1523460014	1	To The Jail! ┗(°0°)┛
3	1523463361	1	Escape to Mother Russia !
1	1523449279	-6	I agree. But at the same time, we gotta figure out a way to reduce energy costs of the network if we ever want blockchain to replace fiat currencies. It's a catch 22
2	1523449762	16	No we don't. Energy costs are what secure the network.
3	1523467403	1	Bingo!  I've been mining with 100% nuclear/hydro/wind generated power for 7 years now.  The reaction of "ERMERGERD, BHUT TEH ENERGER!" is very misguided.  The nature of mining seeks out cheap energy.  Where do you find cheap energy?  Near abundant sources which tend to be renewable, or places where the "waste" heat is actually considered a FEATURE!
2	1523450748	10	There is no reason to worry about energy costs with POW. If anything it’s driving miners to seek out cheaper and cheaper energy to obtain an advantage over other miners. This is pushing clean energy costs down. 
2	1523455575	2	The energy that gets used is wherever miners can find large quantities of surplus electrical power.That overcapacity is going to tend to be in rural places who overbuilt, and who made the mistake of thinking megawatts = jobs and a tax base.What the bureaucrats are going to find out is that their little schemes will be revealed as crypto mining uncovers these places.And the ones that are truly business friendly will come and stay and pay pretty well for power.
2	1523452592	3	I'm under the impression that the "energy cost" of the network are just underpriced local spare capacities.Until someone out there deliberately builts new power plants to mine bitcoin, I'm not too worried about our environmental impact.
2	1523449890	3	I see it as a network equivalent of gold vs fiat.  With PoS you have major nodes calling the shots similarly to how central authority figures call the shots in fiat.  With PoW you it's all fair game and anyone can support the network's security and get a piece of the rewards.  People who mine and secure gold could also be providing a service instead, but look at what is money and what's most secure.A lot of the articles on energy costs are skewed too.  Bitcoin is using the most efficient miners in the most efficient areas.  Most major miners are stationed near power plants and get a discount on surplus electricity.  It isn't like they're taking electricity from a town that needs it or using diesel generators.  
3	1523456930	2	BC is incredibly inefficient -  5,000 times more energy intensive per transaction than Visa.  That is a HUGE problem that limits scaling.https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/policy/the-ridiculous-amount-of-energy-it-takes-to-run-bitcoin
4	1523461947	1	visa doesn't secure the USD, I can argue the visa is more energy intensive than the lightning network 
2	1523459874	1	The energy cost of obtaining bitcoin is what separates it from Chuck E Cheese tokens.
2	1523453144	1	If everybody stops using fiat money and switch to bitcoin, the consumption of energy will be the same by miners, but the consumption per transaction will be much lower.
1	1523444364	-3	These are some tweets from an ethereum developer https://www.trustnodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gupta-censorship-ethereum-gab-nazi-communists.png
2	1523455371	7	Just going to point out that while that link is to a picture showing legitimate tweets, that website is the opposite of trustworthy and has a history of disinformation articles.
0	1523453366	3	Proof of Work is a reliable chain selection mechanism when there is no disagreement about what the validity rules are.When there is disagreement about what chain is *valid*, Bitcoin uses the market to allocate hashrate to different subchains.So in this situation, Bitcoin actually uses something that is  similar to Proof of Stake.[Elaboration Here](https://medium.com/@agent_scruples/proof-of-work-for-proving-stake-1eac8a0b1879)
1	1523453851	3	Cool read. Makes sense to me. Bitmain having 99% of the hash rate (obv exaggeration) doesn't change the protocol of the full node I am running. 
0	1523463959	1	The Bitmex research team is consistently the best educated commentary on the ecosystem available. They are unbiased, thorough, and skeptical of fantastic claims. They do the entire community a great service through these research projects.I would love to see some capable writers do some relevant reporting on these articles. I assume they are too in-depth for most of the speculators on the market.
0	1523456445	2	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones"The extrinsic (perceived) value of a specific stone is based not only on its size and craftsmanship, but also on its history. If many people—or no one at all—died when the specific stone was transported, or a famous sailor brought it in, the value of the rai stone increases by reason of its anecdotal heft."i dont think that "life" will be part of the production of this kind of money /s
1	1523456459	2	**Rai stones**Rai, or stone money (Yapese: raay), are large, circular stone disks carved out of limestone formed from aragonite and calcite crystals. Rai stones were quarried on several of the Micronesian islands, mainly Palau, but briefly on Guam as well, and transported for use as money to the island of Yap. They have been used in trade by the Yapese as a form of currency. The monetary system of Yap relies on an oral history of ownership.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
0	1523456734	2	These are complex systems who's trade-offs I cannot claim to fully understand to the point of positively predicting outcomes.But this particular quote does not feel fully honest....>the problem may be slightly overstated, due to the incentive to use lower cost or otherwise failed energy projects as a source of powerRight now there is extremely cheap coal power in lowly regulated countries. No one can deny that there is an abundance of Chinese farms running on coal based power. So why hasn't this philosophy applied to them?  If there is cheaper power, why are they still using coal? If the price continues to accelerate, then this gives even less reason to move. So the price and supply greatly influences the decisions of miners and cannot be ignored.If the price will sustain high margins, there will always be those willing to make less and not move the farm to a hydropower area.This is something that should be discussed and not ignored. Bitcoin, as awesome as it is, is turning into quite the little heat generator for the planet and that topic effects the entire population. Not that other things also do not, this is not an isolated attack but a request for acknowledgement so we can seek to improve.
0	1523446750	1	im a bit off for the idea, not that groundbreaking, not that lame either. but a yes maybe.

0	1523458377	1	I fail to see how *randao* can solve the grinding problem, /u/BitMEXResearch Grinder needs to censor all the hash publications that are not hers, so that she controls the secret preimages.
0	1523452271	1	There is a fundamental point to remember - WORK != VALUE.  Just because something requires "proof of work" (defined in whatever consumption you want: time, electricity, raw materials) that does not translate into value, nor does lack of "proof of work" translate into lack of value.  This is a fundamental error that far too many players in Crypto make.  Edit: downvote all you want, does not make it any less true.
1	1523453738	9	work provides security.  security provides value.
1	1523452675	1	> This is a fundamental error that far too many players in Crypto make.such as who?
2	1523452997	2	Such as this entire thread.  POW has nothing to do with establishing value, yet it is constantly cited as a fundamental feature of Crypto that does just that.  Scarcity falls into this same error type.
3	1523453222	2	All value is subjective so all the traits establishing value are also subjective.
3	1523454364	1	yes, is related.Because if anyone can produce a coin A, and just a few people can produce a coin B, because, you know, production cost.then value of coin B always be higher than cost of coin A.
4	1523455787	2	Yes andnif A is POS coins, you can have as much of that as you create. But if B is POW coins the electrical costs made it so that if you mine one you mine less of another. It helps force your support 
4	1523454974	1	Value has only one arbiter and that is what item "Z" someone will give you for item "A".  A 15 second pencil sketch by Picasso will have far higher value than a 40 hour sketch by John Doe.  This is critical to understand - just because something requires more "work" does not make it have higher value.  In fact, just because something requires a lot of work does not mean it has any value at all.  
5	1523456295	1	you said it, how many average joe are there?, how many picasso are out there?.how much cost to produce a piccaso(artist)?,probably millions of babies, and years of wait, how much cost to produce an average joe?people will accept anything as money, even sand, but now everyone will accept sand as money.
1	1523456302	1	I agree 100% with you.If someone digs a hole, did he create value? what if he fills the hole again? did that create value?PoW has a huge cost. And this cost has to be carried by the market, if we did not have this cost (not saying this is possible), the price would be much higher.
1	1523454221	0	people value things that cost a lot of work to produce.just imagine a seed as money, a seed hard to collect, maybe even cost your life because just grow in a dangerous mountain. And also you have a seed that grow in any house, just take the seed and wait 1 month, voilà, money.People will say "why use a money so dangerous, isnt better a money that can be produces in any house?, after all if just a few people produce that money isnt fair".Just search how much cost to run a bitcoin mining operation, if ethereum guys think that their coin, produced in their garages can have a higher value than a coin that take millions to dollars to create are delusional.
2	1523455092	1	This is a great example of how fundamental this error is.  Production cost has zero relationship to value.  Danger of acquisition has zero relationship to value.  Value is set ONLY by a shared belief among individuals - nothing else.
3	1523455735	2	you are wrong, production cost = trust(or value).what coin do you value more?, a coin backed for millions of dollars in infrastructure, jobs, machines valued in thousands, or another country just created by guys in their houses?, while they live with mom and dad?.just show an investor a bitcoin mine and ask him about "acquisition risk".
4	1523456580	1	I understand this is a difficult concept - which is why it is so fundamentally ingrained in the community - but you must understand this if you are ever going to successfully invest in anything (crypto or otherwise).  The value of an item is only the exchange rate for something YOU value held by another.  It has nothing to do with production costs, scarcity, security or anything else.  This fact is precisely why we have markets and exchanges, and why understanding this is how you make (or lose) money from arbitrage.
5	1523457188	2	POS = Proof of shit = no security
6	1523457307	1	POS is actually part of the problem:[Why BC is not cash](https://youtu.be/p9HH_dFcoLc)
3	1523455895	1	A POW coin makes you pay something. If you mine and use a lotnof electricity on bitcoin, you can reuse the electrons to mine Litecoin. You have to choose a ratio.If its POS coins, you could spin up thousands of them and own 10% of each with little effort
4	1523456701	1	anyone that start a bitcoin mining operation must be compromised with the coin, because if something goes wrong you lost millions in "real wold".you wanna trust?, look for the guy that invest more money, even here we are happy when money enters, because thats mean trust, and trust let you think that bitcoin isnt just a trend.
0	1523448079	1	ethereum full PoS not before 4 or 5 years, or maybe never, looks more feasible a hybrid system.
1	1523459252	1	Ethereum will probably end up copying the Decred system
2	1523464160	1	Just about everything surrounding Ethereum and it's future is ambiguous. Jesus, they still don't even know whether they are a currency or not. Unless Vitalik makes a firm stance it will just blow with the wind in any direction it wants.
1	1523466732	1	A hybrid is even way more complex. I don't see that working out of they're already struggling.
1	1523451831	-1	Look into Tezos, they are the next heavyweight project joining the game in Q2, starting with POS from the bat with investors like Tim Draper and Polychain Capital. People say it’s a real Ethereum competitor. 
2	1523452457	5	First i wanna see tezos running a full PoS system, then we can talk.
2	1523460797	1	lol, yeah, as soon as they settle everything in court, they will be the greatest crypto ever!! /s
0	1523461345	1	Why is NXT and Ardor never talked about in these PoS articles? Their consensus has been running smoothly for years and you can run a node on one of the new raspberry pis
0	1523452506	0	With the massive investment in Ethereum Asics it appears less and less likely they will ever switch. Probably the smart money has voted already it seems. 
0	1523460969	1	I don't get why the first full implementation of POS is never mentioned (in a "complete guide" nonetheless) - especially since the Ether proposal is inspired by it. NXT runs without any hitch for nearly 5 years (and since 3 months as scalable version as ARDOR).Additionally there are old tropes that just annoy me. 'The rich get richer' just makes no sense whatsoever... and any mathematician/engineer should see that instantly: you get earnings in percentage of your stake. So unless some other system is used, everyone gets rewards exactly equally. ... Similarly with "nothing at stake" ... I guess this one needs more than high school math, but anyways, it is even in theory next to impossible because of high costs and risks, and has not succeeded in the real world (again, there are hundreds of millions for the taking since 5 years).   I don't think the attack makes much sense anyways - you would have to trick most of the major stake holders, so that they hand over old keys in a short amount of time. Maybe possible if they're all dumb or don't care to lose.
