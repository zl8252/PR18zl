2	1523471633	1	Same goes for bitcoin and its current price points. Perspective matters. I saw in another thread someone was analyzing the last 3 months of all wallets and found that the larger wallets just continue to accumulate while the smaller, newer wallets were dumping. Newer users selling because they fear the loss, older wallets hodling cause they know something is up?Maybe its just mining wallets mining and newer wallets were temp for a purpose, either way, interesting stuff.
