0	1523833885	102	What game is this from ? 
1	1523834474	156	FF3, and the sleeping chick is Celes
2	1523834554	93	You sir are the winner, playing through the world of ruin as I write thisTechnically it could also be final fantasy VI, but it was called 3 for SNES and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m playing it on ðŸ˜„
3	1523834895	20	My favorite game as well. 
4	1523890046	1	FFII was my fave
5	1523890603	1	We're in the minority on this one, but its my favorite too.  
4	1523853669	4	VII was pretty good too - I canâ€™t decide between either as far as fav goes
5	1523855415	-1	VII didn't age well IMO. Hardly any of the 1st gen 3D games did.
6	1523871349	9	Iâ€™ve played 7 like 5 times. Totally still playable.
7	1523875589	4	The story and the system is great, for sure! But I'm totally shallow so if it doesn't look nice, it's not 100% enjoyable. We're making 8 and 16 bit inspired games in 2018, but I can't imagine anyone making PS1 inspired polygon games any time soon. The remake looks insane though.
8	1523880238	4	[Teleglitch](https://youtu.be/iEnS4wPRETw) looks like a PS1 game.
9	1523883205	5	Damn Internet, there's always someone that proves me wrong.
8	1523882526	1	I'm the opposite. The super nice graphics take most of the fun out of gaming for me. 
7	1523878831	1	Didnt i hear something about them remaking ff7?
8	1523884008	1	Yup: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_Remakehttps://youtu.be/Kznek1uNVsg
9	1523884013	1	**Final Fantasy VII Remake**Final Fantasy VII Remake is an upcoming action role-playing game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 4. It is a remake of the 1997 PlayStation game Final Fantasy VII, retelling the original story following mercenary Cloud Strife as he and eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE battle against the corrupt Shinra megacorporation, and the rogue former Shinra soldier Sephiroth. Gameplay is planned to be a fusion of real-time action similar to Dissidia Final Fantasy, and strategic elements, and the game will be released as a multipart series.Rumors and demands for a remake of VII existed for many years, but multiple reasons were given for why the project was not being developed.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
6	1523855545	7	I spent hours throwing basketballs in the baccarat casino... you might be right though. Iâ€™ve played FF3 4 times through, and FF7 only twice. 
6	1523859565	3	Yeah but i think IX did it pretty well, the FMV's still look good unlike VII. The characters models just need some smoothing since the backgrounds were amazingly drawn. But yeah the models off vii are just horrid, even 1-6 aged better. Its usually games that tried to realistic that aged bad. If a game had a unique style they usually aged better.
7	1523860951	2	FFIX did age pretty well and in my opinion is the best of the first gen 3d games (VII, VIII, and IX). VI is the GOAT though. Kefka is a very good villain, the Colosseum near end game was a really creative/tough way to get the best end game gear, and the whole cast was really well developed. It was hard to pick a second favorite character; I say second because Locke. 
8	1523861332	2	Yeah i like both, vi is my number 1 classic FF for sure. IX is my favourite ps1 era. VI was also just so unique, so many weird and unique stuff. It felt like everyone was the main character. IX actually took alot from VI, with characters havingg their own arcs seperate from each other at the same time. Kefka(actually win) and Kuja are also the only guys to destroy a planet. :P Although VIII was pretty screwed up too.
6	1523880088	2	I agree, this is why Iâ€™m excited for the remake of ffVII. IMO it is the best FF, that I have played. 
4	1523861022	1	First time I ever got Mog, and I almost forgot to save Shadow
3	1523876175	3	III/VI are amongst the best games ever.
3	1523841753	8	It was actually called VI on SNES, but just in Japan.
4	1523848162	10	it was called Super Famicom in Japan, not SNES.
5	1523848353	5	Yeah but only in Final Fantasy 3
6	1523849362	2	VI in Japan
7	1523880237	2	I've never played any of those old school ones but been meaning to, however these number changes confuse me... Which ones are people saying are the best here 3 and 6? Or are 3 and 6 the same game so that's why people are saying those two
8	1523880951	5	final fantasy 1 us = final fantasy 1 jpfinal fantasy 2 us = final fantasy 4 jpfinal fantasy 3 us = final fantasy 6 jpfinal fantasy 2,3,5 (jp) were not initially released in the states
5	1523886962	1	Got eeeem
3	1523884957	1	It was equally as the best game ever on GBA
3	1523887462	1	Check out the Brave New World mod! It's an amazing overhaul of the game mechanics made by incredibly passionate fans of the game. 
3	1523889188	1	Are you guys playing Final Fantasy Record Keeper? The nostalgia is real./r/finalfantasyrecordkeeper 
3	1523872522	0	Love this game so much!  Just finished a play-through again last month and Iâ€™m doing FFVII on iOS now too.  Just finished disc 1 and Iâ€™m hunting Cloud.Side note: Evoland 2 scratched my RPG itch quite well when I finished FF6 and didnâ€™t know FF7 was on iOS yet.  Thoroughly enjoyed the mix of genres and parodies of Chrono Trigger/Final Fantasy/Tactics/Zelda/Mario/GOT/Ghibli/Dragon Ball/multiple other pop culture nods + gamer/nerd/otaku nods mixed in.  Pretty well done and a good 25 hours of solid gameplay.Edit: grammar/spelling
2	1523888152	1	man one of my favorite games as a kid.
2	1523900828	1	At first... I thought it's Pokemon. My bad.
2	1523871826	1	Does she have any nudes?
2	1523838947	-6	Celeste*FTFY
3	1523846003	5	Maria*FTFY
4	1523847744	11	*O, Maria* *Though I call you from afar,* *Will this message reach your heart?* *Oh how I long to be with you.* 
5	1523853895	11	Bwah bwah bwaaaaah bwaaaaah, bwah bwah bwah bwaaaaah- bwah bwah bwaaaaaahhhh bwah bwaaaaaah bwaaaaaah bwaaaaaaaaaah!Bwah bwaaaah bwah bwah bwaaaaaah,Bwah bwaaaaah bwah bwah bwaaaaaaah,Bwah bwah bwaaaaaah, bwah bwaaaaah bwah bwah bwaaaaaaahhhh
5	1523854659	2	[High quality version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGl4FqUeFS0) of the [original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BR6v9UZDaY#t=1h55m36s).
5	1523890131	1	The opera is one of the greatest moments in the history of video games.
1	1523833944	3	I would like to see if anyone else knows before I say it :)
2	1523848003	7	Celes Chere, in cidâ€™s house after the floating continent.  You slept for a year.  Probably played through this game 5-10 times in my life so far.
3	1523849174	3	Yeah, I always thought that an odd plot point. The logistics of that are... questionable. Also I know it's like just a storytelling point but like, weeks would have been perfectly adequate for like 99%(?) of the events that happened but falling asleep for a YEAR!?  Or like, at least say she was asleep for a few days and then a year later have some wood wash on shore or something lol
4	1523868521	5	She was in a coma. Which is okay, because she was also with the world's most capable medical professional. He may not have had a lot to work with, but keeping her alive checks out.
5	1523878494	5	She was also magic infused, so I mean, the first time I played this and made it to this part I was like 10-12 years old and I didnâ€™t ask this question lol.  Also, I had to call my brother who was away at college to help me figure out what to do next.  So I saw the depressing scene, and grew emotionally more attached to Celes.  Also played on snes where she gets beat in the cell, which made me already feel for her.I love this game
6	1523879118	4	Yeah, the full SNES version was definitely superior for having the full interrogation scene.And as for Cid, his dying is definitely the stronger scene. And hell, as much as he did for Celes, he kind of deserved it... literally the whole game is his fault. His Magitek research propelled the Empire into worldwide warfare, inspired the Emperor to genocide the Espers, and if that wasn't enough... Cid personally created Kefka. The Magitek Knight procedure may have been perfected by Leo and Celes, but Kefka... we don't even know what he was like before Cid "augmented" him. Maybe he was already a little shit... but look at Leo & Celes. Shockingly upstanding individuals, very honourable. Wouldn't it make sense that the first Magitek Knight was likely a similar individual? Cid may have single-handedly created the God of Destruction.I love this game *so fucking much.*
2	1523854749	1	It was pretty obvious.  This is the exact middle of the game.
2	1523834481	1	A final fantasy or maybe CHRONO trigger would be my guess
1	1523877956	1	Maybe  sathoshi developed this game himself ;-) ;-b
0	1523842051	46	"15 years experience in bitcoin required."
0	1523845931	26	Blasphemy! Bitcoin has always existed. It was just unknown until very recently when it was discovered in an abandoned mine from the gold rush days. That became the first ever bitcoin mine. Know the history of what youâ€™re getting into.
1	1523848677	20	All the possible number blocks already exist, the trick is just finding them.
1	1523860664	4	There was actually instructions for Bitcoin saved in the Library of Alexandria.
1	1523871512	5	The entire sequence of 1s and 0s that create the backbone of bitcoin always existed, it just took some idiot to discover it
0	1523843688	120	Bitcoin = GilGil is the currency of the worlds in the FF universe. Bitcoin confirmed to be universal currency. Accepted anywhere in the universe, through time and space.Also... is Ver = Kefka?
1	1523845422	41	Can we call something Gil please? Like 1000 Satoshis? 
2	1523849584	20	Omg Yes, lets do this. Lets make this happen 
3	1523850081	10	I actually see no harm! If we spread the word within the community it will take no time to get recognized. I'll be honest that Gil isn't the coolest name but creating a new denomination within the current system has always been benificial.
4	1523851407	6	Just like the dollar coins in Canada now are named loonies.
4	1523853537	3	Its better than zenny, that's for sure.
3	1523850024	13	Don't worry guys, I'm on it.
2	1523850677	7	I already dislike "Satoshis", it's too long!I'd rather say like "1000 Satos" but anything else than Satoshis is okay for me.
3	1523851240	8	In face to face conversation my friends and I say "sat".
4	1523854615	6	Or sats for plural. 
4	1523851383	1	Even better than Satos for sure lol
5	1523853261	3	How many S's for that vintage Nintendo console???? 
6	1523890467	1	What are you, a snake?
6	1523870461	1	Definitely easier to say Sats than S's imo
7	1523878440	3	What about toshis?
1	1523859099	0	Yeah I am gilioner in ff14 ;) used to play a lot online. Not any more. I think there is no connection between gill and bitcoin. Or if you play ff14 probably could buy some gill via crypto. I know the mechanics. 
0	1523845533	13	i absolutely loved FF3 on SNES!!! Some of my best memories growing up. Then i went on to FFII, secret of mana and chrono trigger, secret of evermore, super mario rpg, earthbound (never finished it tho unfortunately)
1	1523869280	7	Earthbound is worth going back and replaying somehow. It gets continually weirder all the way to the end, in the best ways.
1	1523866020	-7	Best memories? Did you try 'outside'? 
2	1523866153	6	K dude thx for the positive comment 
3	1523868384	5	Donâ€™t feed the trolls, especially after midnight
2	1523892921	1	> Best memories? Did you try 'outside'?Some of my best memories were playing Zelda (nes), SMB/SMW and Street Fighter II.Yes, I went outside, played sports (I compete professionally now) and had a normal life.But is that supposed to mean that I shouldn't cherish those memories?
0	1523852693	17	That looks like bitcoin cash to me
1	1523857585	-1	No wonder he's a loser. 
0	1523841110	9	I distinctly remember that emblem and wondering what it stood for. 
1	1523855121	11	I'm guessing it stands for [bed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed).
0	1523860030	7	Indeed, best game ever.
0	1523849603	14	I see green background.. is it bcash?
1	1523850940	1	Nope. There is no poop emoji next to it. 
1	1523878008	1	brb gonna get some easy karma on r/btc 
0	1523848447	12	[removed]
1	1523849711	11	Careful with that kind of talk
1	1523857410	3	Lol...I know...dang it
1	1523859205	2	Oh shit....
1	1523855208	-4	> Hmm. Green... That looks more like **Bcash** to me.FTFY
0	1523860388	3	I'm pretty sure you're at the point in the game where she jumps off a cliff. Also, kinda like Bitcoin ;)Edit: If you like SNES, a game most people probably never played was Rudra no Hihou. It's probably the Square game with the best story, graphics, and music ever made for SNES, but it was released right before FF7 came out on PS1, so it was overlooked and never translated. There are fan translations now, though, and its deeeeefinitely worth a play-through.
1	1523867735	1	bitches don't know bout my pebefamegami
0	1523844914	11	Not that I have a dog in this fight, but wouldn't this technically be bitcoin cash with the green logo and all? Not to mention store of value vs built for spending? Just sayin. p.s. my second favorite game of all time next to FF2 for SNES just due to nostalgia.
1	1523902697	1	You would be correct in both instances. 
1	1523849703	1	No.
2	1523853251	9	Right? FF2 is nowhere near as good as FF3.
0	1523847611	4	You have found Satoshi Nakamura
0	1523861267	2	Looks like BCash logo
0	1523861677	5	Thats green. Bcash lol
0	1523851394	2	Wow I have never noticed this before, now I must know what the developers really meant with that B!
0	1523852467	2	Who were the devs. I think we found Satoshi.
0	1523855303	3	Shigeru Myamoto is Satoshi! How did I not see this!
0	1523849789	4	CHRONOTRIGGERISBETTER
1	1523850012	10	HEY.  FUCK YOU
1	1523853558	4	Listen here you little shit.
0	1523852163	2	Keep in mind that the world of Final Fantasy VI already starts as an authoritarian dystopia and eventually becomes a *post-apocalyptic* dystopia. Seems like bitcoins turn worlds into shitholes. Hopefully you guys will gain at least a glimmer of self-awareness from this knowledge. I doubt it, though. :(
1	1523857435	2	Bitcoin cash is green
2	1523857613	1	Oh, no wonder he sucks so much. 
0	1523834465	1	:-O
0	1523845438	1	Yes! I just started replaying this on my retropi
0	1523845696	1	I almost guessed Ultima VII, but I would have been wrong. 
0	1523849290	1	Itâ€™s weird seeing how many pixels on your screen make up a â€˜pixelâ€™ in game. Also, FF3/6 as others have already guessed :)
0	1523853697	1	Favorite game for sure!
0	1523855084	1	what bitcoin help me how to invest
0	1523863228	1	good game)))
0	1523869743	1	This is why I think BTC was created by a super AI in the future that sends information into the past via quantum entanglement. This kind of stuff.
0	1523877022	1	I love this game. Born in 90, but thanks to my brother's SNES... I've put hundreds of hours into it. Thanks for reminding me of it:)
0	1523881438	1	2 pixels on the photo, one for every eye
0	1523882611	1	And what does the symbol means in the in-game culture?
0	1523883927	1	Interesting, I never thought about what kefka was like before being infused with magic.  I also didnâ€™t know he was the first of the three of them.  I just assumed he was always a power hungry bastard like gestahl
0	1523884237	1	Maybe it was Sathoshi's first dev work... :-)
0	1523885596	1	I am so yang) I don't know this game((( 
0	1523886512	1	Cool Bitcoin's Bed!
0	1523887049	1	Imagine having the opportunity to be part of the internet revolution in the 1990s. It was a perfect opportunity for you to acquire a vast amount of wealth and more importantly, bragging rights. The rights exclusive only to the initial investors and backers of the revolutionary technology, and that which could serve as your lifetime legacy. That recognition goes beyond material wealth and it really is currently at your fingertips. How many can claim the rights of being the few that took part in the development of a revolutionary part of human evolution? Very few. Cryptocurrencies are the gateway to that legacy.Such crypto as NEO, EOS, CREDITS, BTC etc...The cryptocurrency market has been growing at an exponential pace and making a number of people very rich. But is it all about making money? The technology underlying cryptocurrencies â€“ called Blockchain technology â€“ has the potential to change our lives for the better. 
0	1523887511	1	We've come to using this for memes now? *sigh*...*unzips*
0	1523889546	1	Literally sleeping on Bitcoin.
0	1523890127	1	Wohoo.. i missed that. There were many predictions on Simpson too :) 
0	1523892545	1	Green logo tho
0	1523892613	1	If only all the time I spent grinding FF3 in real life produced bitcoins.
0	1523895947	1	Gotta be BCH
0	1523900030	1	Final Fantasy!
0	1523900140	1	Maybe it's a conspiracy theory or something that the creators of FF3 are actually the founders of Bitcoin...
0	1523853350	0	Oooh those 8 bits are making me more myopic! 
0	1523883693	0	Upvote 4 upvote
0	1523884307	0	Actually its BCH
0	1523864908	-3	Why so bitcoin can drop another 70% what a scam this whole bitcoin bonanza was people going broke left and right yeah sure was s good idea to invest in somthing that drops 70% in four months 
1	1523881632	2	Oops.. someone forgot to short from 20k to make sure they didnâ€™t lose anything.
1	1523880409	1	Youâ€™re REALLY in the wrong sub. Youâ€™ll be eating these words in years to come.
