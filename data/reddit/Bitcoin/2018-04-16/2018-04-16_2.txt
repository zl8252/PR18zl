1	1523840000	5	Nit picking but I prefer the more King James: "Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's"
0	1523825402	14	https://www.arisebitcoin.com/ not sure I see anything about Bitcoin on the advertised website but cool ad
1	1523825746	8	Jesus reunited with.. vacuum cleaners ðŸ¤¨
2	1523825983	7	Something about the term Bitcoin Jesus makes me feel a little uncomfortable, but moving swiftly on ;)
1	1523848387	3	Clickbait lol
1	1523849071	3	"To sell a carpet cleaner is as simple as walking into the store." Hmm, technically correct? ðŸ¤”
1	1523850425	2	This might actually be genius, this guy probably got the advertisers on his website to pay for the advertisement for Bitcoin on the board.
1	1523851800	1	Billywitchdoctordotcom work... mostly... in chicken. Arise, chicken!
1	1523842649	1	Someone wasted ad money
2	1523885018	1	I think they post it just to have a twist on their propaganda and make a talk not only of the town but also in the social media
0	1523822660	10	Amen
0	1523848174	7	I stand with Jesus! And bitcoin! But not the anti-christ who calls himself Bitcoinjesus!

0	1523855751	5	Arise chicken, arise
0	1523832910	6	One requires complete faith, the other is trustless. Strange juxtaposition 
1	1523840180	2	I was thinking the same thing. 
1	1523885577	1	You're trusting in math and economics, even when the end outcome is counterintuitive.
0	1523853067	2	The revolutionâ€™s imminent. What do you stall for?If you stand for nothing, Burr, whatâ€™ll you fall for?
0	1523850877	2	I believe in Bitcoin more than I do in God
0	1523832736	4	I love Jesus and Bitcoin.  Glad Jesus is first, that is the way it should be.  :)

0	1523845927	1	CBS not making a lot of money here I am thinking..... free advertising ..... anyone .... anyone ....
0	1523858937	1	Do people ever send bitcoin to the wallets on billboards?Like whats the point of putting your wallet address up there?
0	1523870019	1	A bit blasphemous, but funny, really ...
0	1523878060	1	This was a fun project from around 2013....  We spent about $8k in btc at the time to place around 30 billboards around the San Francisco Bay area. Ultimately it was a bust and we could not continue as we only received around 1.5 bitcoin in donations to fund the second project, worth less than $1k at the time. It was a fun ride while it lasted though. Fun fact, several "legacy" bitcoin folks reached out to us were looking for ways to incorporate their business to make money, such as adds on our website, not get the word out or support to the project. Most of those guys support bcash now. Kinda obvious what their agenda really is. bcash is trash.
1	1523903841	1	What was this second project? I'm curious what you were hoping to achieve.

0	1523830483	-10	Two lies in one picture. 
1	1523847763	-2	One lie. The other a revolutionary invention!
