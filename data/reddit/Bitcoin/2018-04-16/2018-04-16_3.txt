0	1523901906	1	yes, but there needs to be a huge mental overhaul in people's heads before bitcoin gets to shine in its full capacity. 99% of people are not even holding their own keys to their coins, let alone understand the importance of individual freedoms.
0	1523876034	39	Hummm, isn't the wealth distribution in bitcoin holdings worse than the wealth distribution of North Korea?
1	1523879040	24	exactly, early adopters would just be the new oligarch
2	1523888640	10	The problem with the current system, based on debt and inflation, is not only the cash distribution but also the cash flow. It always flows to the top, which creates bigger gaps over time.On a deflationary economy such as the utopian bitcoin one, there may be a initial concentration of wealth but the cash flow and dynamics should be very different because you are in possesion of your own money and it keeps it's value overtime. I don't know if it would be better or worst, but I'm pretty sure it would be different
3	1523894827	1	Inflation actually erodes generational wealth unless you productively invest it.
4	1523898606	1	This is what I mean, in an inflationary economy, you must spend and invest thus creating the cash flow to the top that I was talking about. It does erode generational wealth, but at a much faster pace for the lower classes with acess to less resources/knowledge and time because they are led to the belief that they must work to keep up. In the other hand, the generational wealth of the richest keeps snowballing. (I'm basically describing a pyramide)
5	1523900585	1	The same happens with Bitcoin.You need to eat and drink to live, so you would still have to spend. If your paycheck is barely enough to pay for your daily needs, then you won't be able to save for difficult times, which will inevitably come.With the bitcoin deflationary system, the paycheck of a worker will inevitably fall over time. If the worker paycheck deflates quicker than the value of Bitcoin, the worker will be at a loss and the employer will be at a win. Bitcoin will be stuck in a deflationary cycle, were the workers will continuously receive less and less for their work, and the employers will be able to keep and save more and more. Rich will be richer, the poorest will become even more poorer.This is not a problem of having an inflationary or a deflationary system. This is a problem created by the wealth distribution and by the control over the access to knowledge, which has been limited through the privatization of schools and the continuously degradation and destruction of the fabrics of the society, by TV Shows from the likes of Alex Jones and Fox News, who spread mass panic through those who never had access to a quality school system.
4	1523896246	1	Which so far is the case to all western economies...
2	1523879634	26	It's not the wealth itself that makes them oligarchs.  It's the *control* of the wealth (by control of the monetary system in which that wealth is measured).Bitcoin changes the story.  No longer can those with wealth simply create more of it out of nothing at all.  They have no more ability to define the rules of the system than any other actor within it.
3	1523879767	13	Inflation is no why there are oligarchs. Its the old money and power gets you more money and power.
3	1523888054	3	I mean....I guess that is why control of monetary policy is generally kept as an independent entity, the central bank, as free from political pressures as well as the whims of influential private individuals as possible. 
3	1523882538	6	> No longer can those with wealth simply create more of it out of nothing at all.... That's not how seigniorage works. The profits end up with governments. Not wealthy citizens.
4	1523898607	1	what? how's that we're in a multi-trillion dollar federal deficit in the us, while wage-gap grows and wealth further concentrates at the top? seems the opposite of what you describe.thanks for that vocab word though, hadn't heard of that specific concept. am genuinely interested in your explanation.
5	1523899318	1	> seems the opposite of what you describe.Consider how the government would make up the difference in earnings if income from seigniorage would get removed.Hint: A tax. And they ain't going to tax the rich if they're not already.
3	1523879722	1	Oh ok, that makes sense I guess.There could still be an issue if a single entity owned like 5%+ of the entire wealth of bitcoins though.
4	1523887422	4	Satoshi has 1 million bitcoins in his account. That’s 8.33% of all bitcoins. 
5	1523890346	1	Still waiting for him to either destroy a big chunk of his stash or open a pineapple fund style charity.Maybe "Pine" is Satoshi and that was just a relatively small scale test run. 
6	1523892678	1	They haven’t been touched in years. I think if they did move and showed that satoshi is alive and active, it would cause a mass exit. The market currently list those coins as lost for supply purposes in models investors use. 
7	1523894933	1	I personally think he put them in a wallet and threw away the key. If he wants his final goal to be realized he must have known touching those coins would put it in jeopardy 
8	1523900634	1	Plus they act as a canary to any hacks, being the biggest pot to target and run off with.
8	1523901371	1	So, he/she/it really set BTC to only ever be 20mil coins in circulation. The extra 1mil is just on display at the blockchain museum.
4	1523891489	1	I'm OK with that because early adopters took an incredible risk, saw the vision of Bitcoin, and their reward should reflect their ability to make the right calculations/decisions.It beats accumulation of wealth via wars and theft, which has been the case for the vast majority of history.
5	1523897659	1	> early adopters took an incredible riskBy compiling and running some code on their core 2 duo laptop in 2009?
6	1523898059	1	Sounds unimpressive, but you wouldn't have been someone who did that in 2009 because most of us didn't have the foresight to understand why it matters, or the long term value of doing so. I know I overlooked Bitcoin the first time I read about it.The people who recognised the value early and dedicated time for it should be rewarded.
7	1523898304	1	Not arguing that they shouldn't be rewarded for their foresight, just that they weren't really taking much risk. Buying BTC right now is far more risky than mining was at any time before it required asics.
7	1523902034	1	You're assuming they had some foresight and didn't just get lucky jumping on the right bubble.
6	1523901088	1	No, but having the discipline to hodl something as volatile as bitcoin for many years and not get spooked is why one should be rewarded.  Being right is one thing, but being right and sitting tight is not a common trait.  
2	1523896336	1	That's not technically true. Agreed early adopters saw the value in it early, thus more rewarded. However they cannot change the rules of the game. That's the power of being a immutable ledger. Overtime the distribution of value would become fair because the rules don't change. Vs. The current monetary system, the rules change constantly to favour the rich.
2	1523897455	1	Well, the ones that held.Right now you have Bitcoin being quietly scooped up by the old guard.The entire marketcap of Crypto is currently $321 Billion... from a high of ~$750 Billion.How much would you pay to completely own a new, unregulated emerging market? Let alone, legally-- if unethically-- double your already vast fortune?A lot of the new oligarchs sold out for lambos that are already degrading while the old guard is quietly counting coins.It takes money to make money and the smart ones are going balls deep. *Waves to Goldman and friends*
2	1523882112	2	I think that's how the games being played off. Early Innovators and early adopters (Sometimes we called them early birds), face the biggest risk when a project starts and when it was a success they will benefit from that but if it falls they are the one with the biggest losses. The bigger the risk, the bigger the gains or lost
3	1523897766	1	not sure where the risk of early adopters is, to be honest. I mean buying a hundred bitcoins back in the day could have been done with a couple of bucks
2	1523902913	1	I said this in another thread concerning the same quote. I got downvoted to oblivion. Apparently people don't understand accumulation of wealth. The wealth ones in fiat will start to buy en masse when they see it as a profitable source. The ones who were early miners and hodlers will just join the small number of oligarchs who were wealthy in fiat. Essentially, nothing has changed.
1	1523894556	1	Yes, and, the first thing Oligarchs will do is have their countries' internet ban any crypto exchanges, or tax the crap out of them. I think of the United States, where Trump could just make it illegal to buy or sell anything legal with bitcoin as it's seen as a threat to our dollar and sales tax. That's all he has to say, and it is dead in the water.
1	1523876234	3	It benefits earlier adopters who overthrow current system to be free of debt. Just pay your loans and prepare for future.
1	1523887553	5	>Hummm, isn't the wealth distribution in bitcoin holdings worse than the wealth distribution of North Korea?Yes, but to reference one of Andreas Antonopolous's responses to this question:I'd rather have wealth concentrated in those that saw benefits of decentralized technology as opposed to wealth concentrated in those whose grandfathers had the most slaves, killed the most people, or cornered the right section of the weapons market.
2	1523891009	1	great quote.  when i first got involved his videos helped me immensely 
1	1523900582	1	It didn't start out that way, and anybody could have bought \(or even mined\) bitcoins in the early days. It is only the increase in savings that has created an uneven distribution of wealth. The point everybody has had a fairly even chance to accumulate bitcoins over the years. There were even faucets that gave out a whole bitcoin for those who couldn't afford to buy any or figure out how to mine them.Compare this to fiat currency that is only given out to those in power or with connections. Cryptocurrency is much more fair.
1	1523879612	-3	Yes, people should of bought some earlier :) but they didnt and those who did, took the greatest risk and got the highest reward. Ppl can also make their own coins and try to change the distribution if they wish... no1 is forced to use btc whereas youre forced to use fiat..
0	1523881475	10	Naval is cool but the article is garbage.

0	1523901468	1	Sure - because nothing says "freedom from oligarchs" like an unregulated virtual currency market sustained by daily pump and dumps with transactions cleared by privately owned multi-million$$ mining operations.
0	1523874745	3	As much as I enjoy Naval's tweets, this article gave me a brown nose.
1	1523876038	0	I couldnt get thru it
0	1523885538	3	maybe cryptocurrency, bitcoin is creating a new breed of oligarchs.
0	1523900090	1	Bitcoin is going to create a whole new bunch of oligarchs.
0	1523887918	1	I'm all for the small guy! (Investors need to be worth 1mil net).....
0	1523892397	1	Ah! I was not aware that there will be a bitcoin airdrop that will equalize btc holdings for all humans on earth. It was indeed a bit unequally distributed, which hampered widespread buy in. What a good development!!
0	1523894430	1	He is absolutely right, unlike Oil bitcoin can't be easily controlled 
0	1523902167	1	...and transferring the power to the technocrats.
0	1523873559	1	I only realized the value of Bitcoin when I was having a discussion with my cab driver, he told me he had only one bank account which was blocked by the bank for some stupid reason, and when that account was blocked for 3 weeks - he ended up taking a loan to pay for his expenses. 
1	1523879320	4	>for some stupid reason...Hmmm... stupid reason or legitimate reason?
2	1523886783	-1	If it's his account and his money there is no such thing as a legitimate reason. So did he steal the money in his account, or did the bank steal it from him?This is the failure of trust systems.
3	1523887826	3	There is such a thing as legitimate reasons. Economic sanctions, garnished wages, suspected terrorist funding, suspicion of certain forms of criminal activity, the reasons are wide ranging. Governments of any meaningfully large civilization have always had the power to seize assets, or even detain a person themselves, under certain circumstances. Coercive power is one of the key powers of government. The problem isn't that there are reasons, the problem is that the system is highly subjective and often poorly executed.

0	1523895918	1	Don't fear the early adopters as they will not be the new oligarchs. Early adopters can only be an influence so long as they part with coins.  Once an early adopters parts with their coins they have to do something to get them back and it get exponentially harder to get the same hodlings back as time passes.
1	1523900305	1	Why would anyone part with coins if not to make them more coins?Let’s say the winklevoss twins want to spend 1 bitcoin. I bet anything they would spend 100 bitcoin to return 105 coins.Hoarding is easy when you can leverage other humans to work for only partial returns on their efforts.Automation will hopefully bring fairness by dropping cost and increasing quality of life.
0	1523886386	-1	CRYPTOCURRENCIES ARE NOT ONLY BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM. It is also other great projects, on which I would like people to pay more attention, for example CREDITS, EOS, NEO. Bitcoin and Ethereum may be the biggest coins now, but there are hundreds of coins which can achieve similar or even better rates of return. Each coin has a specific purpose or solves a particular issue. For example CREDITS solve the problem of speed transactions as their speed is about 1mln tps. However, a word of caution: Make sure sufficient due diligence is undertaken before investing. Cryptos can be highly volatile and they are at the stage of infancy; there’s a possibility that many coins may fail or are downright scams. The crypto world is extremely intimidating, due to the complexities in understanding the technology. The use of technical computing terms can confuse and deter outsiders. This is the main reason why many stay away from Cryptos.
1	1523893300	1	I ve sold my house and bought credits! Now gonna buy 2 houses!
0	1523898205	1	Your Crazy As Hell! It is a Way of the Oligarchs to Take Complete Control with all the Real Money they stole all digitized so they cannot be caught as everything paper \(evidence is burned\)  Cashless Society is a Controlled Society...
1	1523903733	1	What?
0	1523898896	1	None of this Money is Real...  It is More Fake Fiat Money System... The Banks and Wealthy are shoveling small amounts of their wealth to get us small people into a cashless society then bankrupt us all... Wake Up... They have been doing this a long time and now the Crypto or Criminal Currency is here...
