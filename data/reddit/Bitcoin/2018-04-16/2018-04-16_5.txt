1	1523839219	12	Prostitution, deal drugs, rob a bank... all of these are better examples of applying sound financial/investing knowledge to make money quickly.And, they are all legal in Australia. Tsk, tsk, tsk.
2	1523844108	4	...Wait.. What? oO
3	1523844502	11	Hey, it's the internet so I'm exaggerating.But prostitution *is* legal in Australia, and in a lot of states marijuana is decriminalised. So about half of what I said is actually true. And robbing a bank is just a part of growing up. Exploring boundaries.
4	1523877108	3	" and in a lot of states marijuana is decriminalised" And what states would they be....
5	1523877701	3	None of them.Edit: Not sure why I'm being downvoted, there's not a single Australian state or territory where drug use has been decriminalized.
4	1523848431	4	> And robbing a bank is just a part of growing up. Exploring boundaries.As an American I don't understand how anyone can reach adulthood without robbing a bank. That's like saying you've never [committed arson](https://youtu.be/uK92NYwBMts?t=3m46s). 
5	1523870997	2	Not only i didn't commit arson but i also say hello to my neighbours. Can you imagine?
6	1523876967	1	Oh, you won't last long. Can't you see nowadays you have to be an asshole to do something with your life or to be funny on the internet /s
5	1523855751	1	ðŸŽ‰ It's national Burn Down an Applebees Day ðŸŽ‰
4	1523851268	2	A little bit harsher in the UK, my friend's brother once had to do jail time for accidentally robbing a bank with a water pistol in a drunken prank that went wrong (or right depending on how you look at it).  He immediately called the police from a phonebox to let them know what had happened, but they didn't really see the funny side.Back in the day, they would have no doubt sent him to Australia with all the other drunken English convicts exploring boundaries :p
5	1523877296	2	Thank god times have changed, we don't want any more of your lot here.
4	1523846551	1	TIL
2	1523884993	1	there was a time where doing one of those things would get you free ticket there *and* honorary citizenship
1	1523858801	5	I think itâ€™s implied that theyâ€™re naming things that people do because they THINK itâ€™ll make them money.  Everyone knows the lottery isnâ€™t actually an effective way of making money.
1	1523879659	3	so like 90% of people on this sub then :P
1	1523845572	4	You Are a fellow Bitcoin billionaire I see 
1	1523863812	2	...said the bitcoiner, with no hint of self awareness.
1	1523863507	0	They need to learn English first before they can be educated.These half-wits think Bitcoin is a verb.
2	1523881829	3	Wellllllll...... technically Bitcoin is a process of keeping track of numbers (math), so it's sort of a verb, far moreso than it is a physical object.
3	1523882744	0	mining is a verb. validating is a verb. buying is a verb. These are things you can do in relation to bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a verb. Miners do not bitcoin, they mine Bitcoin. Node operators do not bitcoin, they operate nodes. Buyers do not bitcoin, they buy Bitcoin.And I reject your implication that the two types of words are verbs and physical objects. That's pretty lazy.
4	1523883642	1	You clearly are taking life way too seriously.  You'll never get out of this alive with that attitude. :P
0	1523840802	7	Lotto...............oh man.
0	1523857370	6	lotto > work lmao
0	1523836767	13	The way I look at it is, you don't *make* money with bitcoin you are saving yourself from losing bitcoins in the future when they cost 20x more. The goal is to acquire as much as possible before they go super mainstream. 
0	1523871877	5	I am rather disappointed that the top answer is something that is almost guaranteed to lose you money.....
0	1523839429	7	3% adoption!
0	1523873650	3	4 of those are bitcoin
0	1523880303	2	What are 5 and 6? Just curious...
0	1523882606	2	'Work' Genius. Or 'Sell things'
0	1523847436	2	There is so much naivety with bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general in Australia. Not saying itâ€™s the only place but god, crypto Facebook pages are absolutely cringe worthy.
1	1523848962	2	As an Australian who grew up in Australia and lives in Australia... Australia is absolutely cringe worthy.
2	1523856182	1	As a non Australian who grew up in Ireland and lived in Australia...Australia is absolutely cringe worthy.
0	1523853620	2	Lol, I like how lotto and gambling are considered different.  Also, working and babysitting.
1	1523854758	1	Hey this is Australia, play nice
0	1523851539	1	Glad to see the "bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme" line has worked its way down under ;)
0	1523857825	1	How the fuck is work only at 7%?! Thats the most obvious way to gain money! 
0	1523871957	0	Smuggle drugs.
1	1523897781	1	druggle smugs.
