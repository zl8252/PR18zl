1	1523829390	20	Obviously photoshopped no one in their right mind could resist peeling it. 
2	1523860950	2	You make the mistake of assuming u/DesignerAccount is in their right mind. üòò
1	1523875108	1	People put cases on phones so why not put plastic on a Trezor? 
1	1523849376	1	You gotta cut that strip and pretend like the film was never there üòè
1	1523835808	-1	Should be top comment.
0	1523818157	12	A good answer for that post about a Bitcoin bank.
0	1523821784	10	I would not be able to resist the urge of peeling off this protective film üò¨
0	1523830645	6	Look how dirty the usb cable is.  I can't stand it!!!!
1	1523830793	6	The whole damn thing is gross. [Found a pic of OP](http://3.images.southparkstudios.com/images/shows/south-park/clip-thumbnails/season-10/1008/south-park-s10e08c05-the-slaughter-16x9.jpg?quality=0.8)
2	1523830860	3	OMG :)
2	1523851117	1	Worth a click!
0	1523836897	2	Well played sir
0	1523825559	1	LTC bank as well from the looks of it. How do you like the OpenDime? 
0	1523835550	1	Pfff. Not even a Model T.
0	1523846394	1	I raise you one turkey sandwich 
0	1523831812	-4	Stop with this. It's not a bank, doesn't offer traditional bank services and it's an additional alternative, not a replacement.
1	1523833142	7	Well, I give it money and it stays safe until I need it back. Seems traditional to me. 
1	1523849153	5	You're right, your Trezor would never decide with whom you could transact with, no way this is a bank! 
1	1523836175	2	"Services" as in using loans to create money out of thin air?
1	1523835565	3	You're right, it is much better than a bank.
1	1523902951	1	Ok Goldman Sachs nice try
1	1523839110	1	Ben Bernanke is that you? 
0	1523841814	0	This guy/gal gets it.But it saddens me that this post has such little upvotes.
0	1523844571	0	ur bank aint insured though
1	1523881977	1	how isnt it? the cryptographic seed is the ultimate insurance if you secure it correctly. 
0	1523862177	0	Do you know that you have exposed enough of your fingerprints to be able to identify you if you are on a law enforcement database.  [Identified](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-43711477)
