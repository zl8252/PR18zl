0	1523877900	104	> fewer than 100 people out of 250,000 who claimed to have holdings in crypto reported capital gainsMy question is: how many actually realized any gains? If you buy $10K in Bitcoin and never sold, there is nothing to tell the IRS. If you lost money, there is also nothing to tell the IRS since capital losses are not deductible (up to $3K, which is less than the standard deduction). A lot of people bought at $16-$20K and are either holding or sold to cut their losses. Also, a lot of people bought Bitcoin < $5K and never sold.
1	1523878695	36	Correct.Information that Coinbase (Fedbase) is freely giving the IRS anyway.
2	1523880104	9	I think Coinbase accounts for only 20K users. Not crypto all us bought/sold from them
3	1523882515	7	No. >"As modified, the IRS now seeks information regarding accounts “with at least the equivalent of $20,000 in any one transaction type (buy, sell, send, or receive) in any one year during the 2013-2015 period.” https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2924446https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/kb_article_attachments/128798/original.pdf?1519274657
4	1523884023	5	Why 2013-2015? If it wasnt marked a security then how can they back peddle like that? Just seems odd. You didnt avoid a tax if it never existed?
5	1523885432	8	Bitcoin and other crypto at the time was marked as an asset, and taxes were due accordingly according to guidance issued in early 2014 (before 2013 taxes were due).
5	1523890068	1	Gross income is all income from any source derived unless excluded
5	1523887972	8	The tax has always existed. The Internal Revenue Code was written to broadly apply to anything that yields a person a capital gain. Just because something isn't mentioned by name in the IRC doesn't mean taxation doesn't apply. 
5	1523890295	1	They’re probably still trying to find the BitCoin Wallet cache that one of the Fed’s stole after the SilkRoad bust, it fits the year timeframe.
2	1523900260	1	Right, but how else would the [cesspit of a publication like Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/just-about-everyone-with-bitcoin-is-lying-to-the-irs-1825275308)  paint a bad picture of Bitcoin users?Pseudo-journalists
2	1523879809	-8	Good, people should be paying their taxes lul, it's the law (preparing for the horde of downvotes)
3	1523883486	17	The United States federal government is guilty of a lot of crimes I can't, in good faith, contribute to. If they didn't threaten me with force to continue funding their torture program, their illegal wars, etc. I would gladly defund them in any way I could. Sure, they do some good stuff too, but so does the catholic church, and I'm not paying them either.
4	1523883971	16	Thoreau went to jail (albeit for one day) when he asserted his principles about not funding the Mexican American war. you can do the same thing to."Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison" - thoreau
5	1523884796	4	Or I can see them for what they are but not allow them one iota more control over me than I have to. I'm sure slaves adopt a similar approach. I pay taxes to avoid escalation, but I don't pretend that it's voluntary or take any pride in it, nor do I espouse any patriotism. I'd flip on them in a minute if they lost the upper hand and their successor had any more appeal. Change your government like your underwear. This one's stale and shit-stained. I don't want them strip searching my kids when they want to get on a plane, or secretly (until Snowden came along) eavesdropping on their private communications. I wanted them to put locks on the cockpit doors after 9/11 so we could all just move on and forget about it.I don't even want yet another war that was started simply because the president was being dragged through the mud. Syria used chemical weapons so we're bombing them? Why aren't we bombing [Israel](https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/03/25/israel-white-phosphorus-use-evidence-war-crimes)? It's because Trump was about to go down for conspiring with his lawyer over Stormy Daniels.
4	1523889941	1	If you get audited, and have been found to underreport, then you will have consequences that seem disproportionate to your actions.  They do not mess around.  
5	1523892492	1	The last time I got audited they ended up mailing me a check for the $600 they owed me, plus interest. I never said I don't pay my taxes. I just said if given the opportunity not to participate in their system, It would be a no-brainer.
6	1523898978	1	You have that opportunity.  Just live off the grid and don't use any government services like... you know... roads.
7	1523900569	1	Oh my gosh! I never thought about that. The government builds roads and power poles?!Let me ask you something: If we had never built the interstate highway system, and instead sunk that money into microprocessor R&D (like we did privately anyway), how much faster would we have skipped all the bullshit with government contracts, etc. and just had drones and flying cars, thus not needing the fucking roads?
8	1523902610	1	You should know that the interstate highway system also serves a defensive purpose in terms of war. If the USA were ever to be invaded by the Soviets, ggwp if you can't mobilize by way of dirt roads and forest paths. 
6	1523898036	1	You better pay Trump his Tax money, he needs it!
7	1523901663	1	HAHAHAHAHAA YOU MADE A TRUMP REFERENCE! HAHAHHAHHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA YOU ARE SO WITTY!!! HAHAHAHAHAHHHAAAAAHAAAHHAAH CLEVER! 5/5 I'm going to steal this joke.JUST LIKE TRUMP STOLE THE ELECTION AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA
5	1523902715	1	> They do not mess around.Nor do columbian drug lords, so what is your point?And have you heard the saying "In for the penny, in for the pound! This is what burns empires to the ground."?
4	1523891547	1	I bet you also take for granted the roads you drive on to work, the public schools you can send your kids to, the social security program that is helping millions, Medicare and Medicaid, Veteran Benefits, All of the government programs that help regular important industries (FDA, NSF, USDA, NIH, etc.).  Yes, there are spending problems and not all of my tax dollars go to things I agree with, but I can in good faith continue paying into a system that is a hell of a lot better than what many other counties have. I would hate to have everything privatized. I don't want to watch an ad to be able to drive to work, or have to subscribe to certain roads. Get to work 5 minutes faster when you are an Platinum Ultra member. Get a fast pass past 5 stoplights a month! There are plenty of things that are much better under government control.
5	1523894915	1	The roads that are full of potholes for months on end? The abysmal public school system that couldn't afford printer paper or real food? The antiquated social security program that is headed towards failure? The Medicaid that everyone got kicked off of that exists to cover the high cost of pharmaceutical cronyism?In response to demands for a more socially democratic system like the Scandinavian countries, the response is always "do you really want the government to tax 50% of your money hurr durr durr?" You bet your ass I would be okay with that as long as I actually received the benefits. It beats the hell out of wasting my money on propping up a hawkish, military-industrial complex.
6	1523895113	1	I 100% agree that the money could be used better. My argument wasn't that government is perfect, it was that taxation is not blatant "theft" and is necessary for a modern functioning society. Having the current systems in place, even if they aren't great in many cases, beats not having them at all. Hopefully one day it'll get better, but until then I'll support the current system by paying my taxes and being vocal about wanting change.
7	1523897834	1	How is it not theft? Can I opt out of taxes if I don't agree with where the money is spent?
8	1523898484	1	Having an obligation is not theft if you don't want to meet that obligation.If I sell something to you, then use that money to fund isis, that doesn't mean I stop the money from you just because you don't like how I spent it.
9	1523900565	1	That doesn't answer the question. Where's the obligation? Because some people put words on paper 200 years before my birth? >If I sell something to you, then use that money to fund isis, that doesn't mean I stop the money from you just because you don't like how I spent it.I think you meant "stole" the money. But what did you sell me? I never had a choice in the case of taxation, I was never "sold" anything, I was instead forced to buy it, at the threat of imprisonment.
5	1523897763	1	Roads in my area are full of potholes. Companies are popping up to fix the roads, because the government can't even do that right!Social security is a joke, the greedy politicians raided it just a few years after its inception. It's the definition of a ponzi scheme.I'm for solving veterans programs by not going to war, we can support the current vets and then just not go to war, problem solved.All those agencies you mentioned do more harm than good. We can do better with free market alternatives that don't involve theft (stealing your money via taxation).Most of your taxes go towards building bombs that kill many innocent people. Most of your taxes are squandered on things like the so-called war on drugs.The rest we could easily handle without the middleman of corrupt politicians.
5	1523892294	1	>There are plenty of things that are much better under government control.The older I get, the less I agree with you. Most of the problems they solve are self-inflicted.
6	1523892645	1	Sure, it's not a perfect system, but I wouldn't bet on a corporation to be fair either or not solve problems they inflicted themselves. Thinking that a corporation or a privatized industry will always do better than a government run system seem naive. Without any oversight, it would be like a million mini-governments competing for as much control as possible.
5	1523894708	1	>I don't want to watch an ad to be able to drive to work, or have to subscribe to certain roads. Get to work 5 minutes faster when you are an Platinum Ultra member. Get a fast pass past 5 stoplights a month! That's biased bullshit. You don't know how things would work.
6	1523894746	1	Neither do you. What's your point? You are clearly biased as well towards the opposite viewpoint.
7	1523894980	1	Sorry? did I say anything? No. No one can know beforehand how we the people would organize to provide services. But you assume things would go bad based on your biased viewpoint.
8	1523895287	1	My statement was clearly a hyperbole. Look it up if you are confused. It was in jest based on how every other major corporation functions. Most, you would agree, don't act in the best interest of the public unless it is also the most profitable for them.  So yea, I assumed it would be bad because the largest corporations haven't shown me anything that would make me believe otherwise. They provide great products that I love, but I wouldn't trust them to manage roads, police, fire departments, etc.
9	1523896905	1	>Most, you would agree, don't act in the best interest of the public unless it is also the most profitable for them. Do you act in the best interest of the people? Think about it. Do you think the bakery near your house is there to serve you? No. It's there to make a living for the owner, and doing so it also serves you. That's the magic of the market economy: you can't make money if you don't offer something valuable to the people.>So yea, I assumed it would be bad because the largest corporations haven't shown me anything that would make me believe otherwise.You assumed it would be bad because you probably live in a capitalist country with an easy life where everything is at hand and is always easy to criticize everything.If you lived in a country where the government have to provide you clothes, food, water, a house, electricity, gas... you would miss your beloved large corporations.
4	1523890360	1	Sounds like you should move to another country.
5	1523892393	1	Sounds like you should. I was born here. I'm just addressing the problems of my community the way I see fit.
6	1523893452	1	If you don't like the way things are run, then move. You don't get to leech off everyone else's taxes and then claim the moral high ground when you're asked to pay your fair share.Go move to a country that has values in line with your own.
7	1523894746	1	>If you don't like the way things are run, then move. You don't get to leech off everyone else's taxes and then claim the moral high ground when you're asked to pay your fair share.I don't leech jack shit. I've probably put way more money into this government than you could ever dream. Maybe that's why I'm so disgusted with what I've spent my money on and you're not.
7	1523896457	1	> Go move to a country that has values in line with your own.Are you going to pay his exit fee? It's not like you're free to just move to another country and not pay taxes. In fact, the US is the only developed economy that requires its citizens to pay income taxes even if that income was made in another country. The only way to not pay income taxes to the US is to renounce one's citizenship. And guess what?  There's a tax to do that and it ain't cheap. 
7	1523894713	1	I hear Malta’s lovely this time of the year.
7	1523894894	1	"Here are some ways to make the system more fair.""The system was always unfair! If you don't respect our unfair system, you should move!"Seriously, this argument immediately results in loss of all respect in a debate. Arguing from history is lazy and ridiculous.
8	1523900872	1	I don't see any suggestions on how to make the system better, just wining about having to pay taxes from profits, like everyone else. Can't take advantage of the benefits of taxes and then refuse to pay them when your asked to participate.
8	1523902124	1	I do not know the name of the fallacy but it is basically "We have always done it this way thence we should always continue to it this way."
4	1523890114	1	When the IRS wants to hear your opinion they will ask you for it
5	1523892356	1	I'm not talking to them. I'm talking to you (collectively).
3	1523884346	5	People should pay robbers?
1	1523886986	5	The stat from credit karma is not that accurate. I think people with crypto gain probably don't use credit karma to file tax. They either use a tax accountant since many are new and confused about capital taxes or if they traded alot they uses other tax software that let you import your trades data which credit karma taxes don't offer.
2	1523888431	6	I just hate that some articles show that stat to make it look like some tiny fraction are reporting gains. No doubt people are dodging taxes, but not to that extreme.Personally I had a hard time finding a decent CPA to do my crypto taxes. Most that I contacted were clueless. I imagine Credit Karma would be just as clueless.
3	1523901173	1	I used turbo tax and signed up for audit protection. I made all my answers in good faith so if I did screw up at worst I expect I'll be told I owe a little more plus interest.
1	1523892890	1	I realized gains. Paid capital gains. Was not pleasant doing the math, but I came out okay. 
2	1523896782	1	If it was short-term capital gains, sorry. It was long-term capital gains, then it's not so bad.
3	1523898315	1	Very long term capital gains ;) 
3	1523901256	1	You're right 30%~ isn't too bad. I was a little disappointed to realize the 15% number everyone throws around is just for federal but some states have their own.
4	1523902813	1	My home state is 6% I believe. Low, but still :(
1	1523893127	1	2017 bitcoin actually scored big. Plenty of people sold. 
2	1523896953	1	Yep, a lot of old-timers sold. Maybe not everything but enough to enjoy the rewards of hodling. We all knew deep down inside that > $15K wasn't sustainable for long. It will come back, and likely hit $20K again by the end of this year... but collect what gains you can and buy back in cheap... or buy that Lambo ;)
1	1523879425	8	The thing is, according to most "experts" (blogs and resources like cointracking.info), the bcash ~~airdrop~~ fork should be counted as income. *Even if you did nothing*.And of course I sold my bch, but even so I don't understand how this is "income", and not long-term capital gain. I bought those coins years ago. Hhhrgn.
2	1523880413	9	> The thing is, according to most "experts" (blogs and resources like cointracking.info), the bcash airdrop should be counted as income. Even if you did nothing.Not really. A lot of actual tax experts (CPAs) within the Crypto community have made a stance that the cost basis for airdrops is $0. So the "free" BCH is taxed like any other capital gains only when you realize them. Can be short or long depending on if you waitmore than a year or not to sell them.The reasons are complex, but it's the general consensus. Even the guy doing my crypto taxes has stated the same.
3	1523895725	1	My opinion:You really have two options. If you sell the BCH, you can claim a cost basis of zero, but then 100% of the gain is taxable.Alternatively, you can claim the BCH as income @ $266 per coin on August 1st. After that, If you ever go to sell BCH, your cost basis is now $266. IMO airdrop coins technically are income because you now have an "accession to wealth".Another good example for the zero argument is a second generation farm animal. You own a cow, the cow has a baby. As a farmer, that baby is worth *something*, but not until you sell it one day. In this case, you'd likely put your cost basis as zero.
4	1523897738	1	As for airdrops, I probably mixed up terms unintentionally. Forked coins != airdrops. Like, Bitcoin Cash you received as part of the fork are not the same as Byteball coins or others that airdropped. I imagine that airdrops are taxable at market rate depending on how many you received and if you want to stake your claim on them. Personally, I don't bother with airdrops.One reason the $0 cost basis makes sense to me is that not everyone owning Bitcoin asked for it.  Sure we could just "not claim" them but what if we change our mind 10 years from now? Must we go back and amend taxes from 10 years ago?Another reason is that it also becomes a problem of selling some off to pay taxes. The moment the forked coins become available on an exchange, a massive sell-off would occur just to pay taxes. This drives the price down and you may end up with a handfull of people unable to pay taxes on BCH simply because the price dropped too low to cover the tax bill.The baby cow analogy is a good one, actually. I mean, the baby cow wasn't bought so it cost $0. Same with BCH and other coins. Paid nothing for them.
3	1523883036	1	I'd be ok with the cost base, but whether or not it's long- term or short- term gain is up in the air. I do see some articles that support the events being long-term gains, like with a corporate spinoff.
4	1523888237	4	It is short term if you realize with a year. Long otherwise. That is what my tax guy said. For tax purposes, BCH and others are considered "new" on the date of the fork.
3	1523892771	1	But is the “buy” date (for long/short gains) when the fork happened or when you originally bought the BTC? 
4	1523895946	1	My opinion: Your "accession to wealth" likely occurred on August 1st, or whenever you first had access to the coins.
4	1523896689	1	Date the fork happened with a cost basis of $0. That is what my tax guy said and that's what he's putting on my taxes. I read other CPAs that understand cryptocurrencies are doing the exact same thing.I wouldn't put that you acquired BCH on the date you bought the Bitcoin. That's a political argument among Bitcoin folk. To the IRS, they don't care about our problems with blocksize scaling debates.
2	1523883324	14	No, there is no precedent that an anonymous third party can create a tax event for you without any action on your part simply by running code which you can't opt out of.. Don't spread this nonsense. 
3	1523900867	1	Exactly. Stock splits aren't taxable events. Neither are forks. *Selling* a forked coin *is absolutely* a taxable event.
4	1523903672	1	Stock splits aren't even a great comparison, share holders vote on stock splits typically don't they? Additionally, not anyone random can trigger a stock split an infinite amount of times by running code. 
3	1523884248	-9	No, there is no precedent that anyone can tax you.***FTFY**Bring on tha downies lemmings.              .{{{}}.     .'                  `.             {{{}}}}}}   |   COME ON!

4	1523885707	3	woah, hey, big fan of your artwork!
5	1523886032	2	Not enough ASCII 'round these parts. 
6	1523886474	2	Needs more jpeg haha
2	1523897812	1	Kewl, by that logic I can manifacture an unbounded tax liability on someone by 'airdropping' some alt coin I made up and premined.
3	1523900893	1	I made a mistake by labeling bcash as airdrops. Corrected. It's all about access: if you can trade it (or ask to get it) it might be taxable. That seems to be some CPA's stance.However, very gray area, with no guidance from the IRS. Bloody infuriating, borderline making threats, then staying mute :[
3	1523901080	1	Exactly. I feel confident that if I did get called into a courtroom over this I wouldn't be charged with a crime. There's simply too many unknowns for me to treat a fork any differently than a stock split. If it is indeed a taxable event the IRS needs to define what is a valid fork so that I don't find myself legally obligated to sign up for your sketchy exchange since its the only place where I can convert your questionable alt coin to USD.
1	1523879317	3	capital losses are deductible. why would you be taxed on capital gains, but nothing happens for losses?
2	1523896006	1	You should always file losses, because you can use them to offset gains, even in future years with a carryover.
2	1523880173	3	The losses can only be used to offset other gains. If I made $100K last year abd invested all of it into a shitcoin that went to $0, do you really think the IRS would let me deduct $100K from my income to pay no taxes?From the [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/reporting-capital-gains):> While all capital gains are taxable and must be reported on your tax return, only capital losses on investment or business property are deductible. **Losses on sales of personalproperty are not deductible.**
3	1523880542	2	Wow, our tax law is overcomplicated, but yours really sucks. I partially understand why people won't report gains then.
4	1523880820	6	Americans could have it easier, but there is too much political interest in creating self-serving tax laws, keeping tax preparers in business, and manipulating macroeconomic behavior.
5	1523896612	1	[Here's Intuit's (maker of TurboTax) campaign contributions and lobbying spending.  ](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000026667)They're 233rd in the rankings for 2018 with $2.4M in lobbying spending.[Here's H&R Block.](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000022016&year=2017)  $3.7M spent on lobbying in 2017.The fuckers are actively working to make taxes as complicated as possible.  They have prevented initiatives to simplify the process/filing/code in the US since e-filing became a thing in 1986.
3	1523888431	2	Capital losses are deductible, but only up to 3k before triggering a carry forward. If you invested every penny in a shit coin you would have 97k of taxable income (100-3), and would be able to  take a loss carry forward.See its notice 14-21 Q-6, which explicitly states losses are allowed. The instruction you are quoting pertains to property such as houses and cars.
4	1523894551	1	Accounting tax scenario.Can one use use capital losses built up from previous years from a 2016 married joint filing return and apply those losses to gains from 2017 if they are married but now filing separately in 2017?If one is in a lower income tax bracket when filing separately then long term capital gains are less so that is one of the reasons to file separately for 2017 and possibly going forward.  The spouse files their own return and they do not use any of the carryforward losses from the joint 2016 return on their individual 2017 return as you are claiming those.  
4	1523888981	0	The IRS has stated that cryptos are treated as property 
5	1523889461	2	Yeahup, and they have also stated that you realize a gain and loss on it.Q-6: Does a taxpayer have gain or loss upon an exchange of virtual currency for other property? A-6: Yes. If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency exceeds the taxpayer’s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxablegain. The taxpayer has a loss if the fair market value of the property received is lessthan the adjusted basis of the virtual currency.https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf
6	1523890020	1	I don't see why you'd downvote me for stating a fact. Bitcoin is property to the IRS. Like all property, you realize a gain or loss between the purchase date and sale date.I actually agree with you...
3	1523889260	1	>only capital losses on investment or business property are deductibleSo why not have a shell company?
4	1523889493	1	What, launder money to a shell company only when you have losses?
5	1523896440	1	No, just trade through a company so you can deduct losses? 
1	1523888196	3	1.) That is assuming you didn’t buy any altcoins as well. If you only bought Bitcoin and Bitcoin only and didn’t sell, you are correct. Using Bitcoin to buy an Alt is considered a taxable event and a selling event. You still have to report that you own it though. 2.) You are totally wrong. If you sold at a loss, you absolutely can claim any amount of losses on your taxes up to a total of $3K. Which is awesome if you owe taxes anyways outside of crypto. Now this is all assuming you are in the U.S Source: Just finished my taxes. Woot! 
2	1523888897	3	No where on tax forms is there a place to state how many altcoins you own. They see what you sold and when you bought them. If I have 100 ETH and sell 50 ETH, they don't know I still have 50 ETH. In fact they don't know I bought 100 ETH to begin with.Sure I guess you can deduct $3K, but I was quoting the IRS. Anyway to some, $3K isn't much.  For most people that amounts to saving less than $1K on taxes. A standard deduction would save you more.
3	1523889431	3	But the fact you sold is reason to report if that was a real example. 
4	1523889746	1	Yeah you report what you sold, how much you sold, when you purchased it, and when you sold it. I mean, the IRS doesn't ask you to list your bank balances, cars, etc. Inventory doesn't concern them here. They only care about your inventory if they suspect you're dodging taxes and ask how you could afford that Lambo.
3	1523893021	1	You can claim 3k capital losses, not the same as itemizing deductions from income. It’s unrelated to standard deduction. 
4	1523903713	1	It’s more like a liability credit. It does not reduce your taxable income. On top of that it is roll over able year after year. 
2	1523901120	1	So you just, so they can kill more people in Middle East, please be more proud of yourself !
1	1523880385	2	Are you insinuating only ~100 people realized gains? How many people *do* you think we’re profitable with investing and then selling BTC? 
2	1523880743	4	When did I suggest that only ~100 persons have realized gains? I'm sure many more than that had gains.
3	1523902321	1	The premise of the article is that people who profited off of BTC aren't paying taxes on the gains. Correct me if I'm wrong, but your prior comment:>My question is: how many actually realized any gains? If you buy $10K in Bitcoin and never sold, there is nothing to tell the IRS. If you lost money, there is also nothing to tell the IRS since capital losses are not deductible (up to $3K, which is less than the standard deduction). A lot of people bought at $16-$20K and are either holding or sold to cut their losses. Also, a lot of people bought Bitcoin < $5K and never sold.seems to try and explain why people haven't been paying on their profits (less than 100 out of 250,000 reporting holdings). If not, then I suppose I'm missing the intent of your comment. 
4	1523902936	1	So I saw that stat a few days ago in another article. What that article said was that out of 250K filers, only 100 reported crypto. It never said that 250K filers *owned* any crypto in 2017. That like saying that out of 250K households, only 100 stated they own a Lambo. Is the conclusion that the other 249,900 are hiding their Lambos? Or they never owned one...? Or it's just an incorrect conclusion?
1	1523887124	2	The issue for most is the drop happened after the start of the new year. To me the idea that if you trade on coinbase and buy $10 in btc and $10 of eth you owe nothing, but if you buy $20 in btc then $10 of eth with btc you will now owe a tax is completely ridiculous and asinine.A better example is if you pay $100 to a friend in cash for .1 btc and then trade only on binnance with it you are expected to pay USD tax on something that you had no access to convert to USD. They are giving it an assumed value in USD but in reality is worth $0.
1	1523893392	1	Actually you don’t have to itemize (go over the standard deduction) to get benefits from the up to $3k in losses. It comes off your income immediately. At least for stock sales. 
1	1523894450	1	Yup.I actually did jump through the hoops to calculate capital gains using very minimal guidance from my country's revenue services and an excel sheet, and declared capital gains back in 2014. I've held since, and dread having to figure all that BS out again.You almost need to hire an accountant for this, and there are multiple ways to calculate capital gains when trading and you need to know what your options are (if you have any).
1	1523896663	1	I can assume it's a large amount, as I bought in at 3k btc price, diversified my portfolio and now I hodl. Fuck off irs....  if(HODL == true({ IRS.fuckRightOff(); })
1	1523897217	1	> Also, a lot of people bought Bitcoin < $5K and never sold.A lot of people bought < $5k (and even < $1k)  did sell... Despite the HODL meme this sub loves so much most people who "invest" in bitcoin are in it for fiat profits not to HODL coins and simply let them sit in a wallet. 
2	1523898051	1	Yep. Been hearing from some that a lot of the "HODL" guys that are popular among the community are secretly reaching out to private bankers and overseas investors about cashing out some of their gains.There are some legit HODLers out there, but anyone would be a fool not to cash out and enjoy life some.
1	1523897862	1	Capital losses offset taxable income (assuming no gains elsewhere). Doesn’t matter what the standard deduction is. 
2	1523898134	1	Where does it say that on the IRS website? I hear (and read) conflicting information.
3	1523898460	1	https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/ten-important-facts-about-capital-gains-and-lossesNumber 8 on this list. I don’t know if this was changed with the new tax law but that’s not a concern until the 2019 tax filing deadline (unless the carryover rules have been changed). 
1	1523901624	1	> A lot of people bought at $16-$20K and are either holding or sold to cut their losses.Or sold at a profit.
1	1523903389	1	This should not be the top answer as it has incorrect information regarding taxes and losses.
1	1523895537	1	It's first in first out so if you bought BTC and exchanged for another coin a month later, you have to pay capital gains. I ended up buying at$3400 and selling at $5600 and buying back in at $5700. I had to pay the gains on $2200 from the buy back. Talk to your tax accountant. Last thing I need is to be audited and have to pay back taxes.
1	1523881453	-8	This is incorrect according to the IRS. You pay tax on what you bought if you never sell it. In this case you pay tax on the $10k . They now consider it an asset no different from buying a car and saying I think I’ll wait until I sell it to pay any tax
2	1523882199	3	What are you talking about?If you buy $10K worth of Bitcoin, *the assumption I made is you already paid taxes on the $10K* (income tax from your job, for example). If you hold it forever and never realize anything (from date of purchase to death), then there is nothing to ever tell the IRS. If you sold it < $10K, there is nothing to tell the IRS. If you sell it for > $10K then you have to report  only what you sold and when you initially bought the coins that you sold. You can offset gains with losses, too. That's it. I've done my taxes for this year. That is how it works.
2	1523882400	5	Your conflating income tax and sales tax. Let the adults speak. 
0	1523880791	17	So FYI, this is according to people filing with CreditKarma, which is a relatively new way of filing your taxes. They only started filing returns last year, so an argument could be made that people who trade in crypto just aren't using CreditKarma.  I think there's a STRONG argument to be made with this, since last year, their first year, CreditKarma didn't even support large amounts of tax forms that people need, so why even give them a shot this year. Which is why I didn't use them.    So their reporting could be interpreted as, people who trade crypto just don't want to use them.
1	1523887521	2	This exactly. I started on credit karma but then realized they didn't have what I needed so I ended up using a different tax software. Also many people who invested in crypto never heard or understand capital taxes so they probably have an accountant do the taxes
1	1523903034	1	Agree on this. Title could be "crypto traders avoiding credit karma's platform to avoid committing mistakes unknowingly"
0	1523884198	11	Why is this even being brought up? The IRS hasn’t even had an opportunity to review all the tax information from the population. 
1	1523901002	1	the deadline isn't even until tomorrow. this is just horseshit
1	1523898279	1	FUD lies
1	1523901439	1	Gotta push the narrative that we're all dirty criminals.
0	1523883202	27	Not I, call me a sucker but I reported every last dime and cut a huge freakin check. I can't get in such trouble or I risk my job. The tax situation with crypto is the biggest problem. 
1	1523886460	20	You'll be glad you did when a few years from now people will be whining that IRS is back-fucking them over previous tax years
1	1523890359	1	Whats sad is now that they know, they might decide you owe more.  As opposed to those people who hid and got away with it.I used to collect taxes and sadly it happens
2	1523891044	1	If you aren't driving around in an unexplainable Lambo I wouldn't worry.
3	1523891312	1	Also avoid home office deductions
4	1523896572	1	Any deduction makes it more likely you get audited.. that's because they are easy to lie about. I don't even bother with them anymore since they don't save me a whole lot and the little I do save won't be worth it if I get audited anyway.
3	1523897204	1	If you can afford a lambo, just leave that fucking shithole and buy citizenship somewhere else.
4	1523897854	1	I could as I have dual citizenship and residency visa options in another. But, I don't want to.
1	1523887733	5	Same here, the only thing I did not report was my DOGE back from college. I was unaware at the time and I spent maybe 100$ of it back then. I reported it most recently since I did have an event that was taxable with it, DOGE > BTC, but since that is long-term capital gains, it did not matter.
1	1523890638	1	Same, I even reported crypto/crypto trades so I could establish a cost basis for BTC that I have now.
1	1523891277	1	Ditto - reported and paid big ass taxes. Everything is all downloaded and calculated and reportable.  Includes BCH and BTG sales when forks happened and random idiotic attempts at day trading (never again!)
1	1523889899	1	I reported by bch and btc sells for this past year.  You aren't alone. 
1	1523895721	1	Ditto.I had a 5 figure tax liability this year.....FML.But rather pay now, maybe even over-report given the incomplete guidance, than go through an audit later and owe penalties, interest, and back taxes.
1	1523892741	1	Me too bud.  Paid em an arm and a leg this year for sure
1	1523893146	1	Me too. Made a chunk of change (sold between 11-17k bwhhahahah), so Uncle Sam gets a cut. 
1	1523895183	1	Yup, I have to pay mine today and it's a nice chunk of change...
1	1523897102	1	Good democ rat.
0	1523877040	7	is IRS doing random check or checking all individuals?
1	1523889693	6	Its definitely not "ALL" but its definitely not completely random either. 
1	1523890461	1	Certain events trigger it.  Large jumps in income, high income individuals, large self employment deductions, eic fraud, etc all are more likely to be reviewedThe average Joe making 60k every year has very low audit risk
2	1523890637	1	how about profit like 500 to a thousand USD, will IRS be interested to look?
3	1523890905	1	Not if your income just goes up by 1kHowever they have more sophisticated methods than we probably know about.  They generally wont access your bank records hardly ever.  But if it bothers you and you did realize the gain, I’d probably report it.They operate on a cost/benefit basis just like you and me.I’m also a CPA so if I get caught lying to a tax agency its a big deal.  Also there was no crypto in the exam so I could be way off base
4	1523890948	1	cheers
1	1523896660	1	Likely they have already set algorithms to set off red flags. 
0	1523878526	27	Lying to the American people is very popular with the IRS.Lois Lerner's waterfall of lies and deception during sworn testimony to the U.S. Congress was most enlightening.Clearly they can't be trusted with personal information at this time, but later, after extensive reforms and a period of rebuilding trust, we can revisit the issue.
1	1523879855	4	Nice whataboutism
2	1523880789	11	Were her crimes punished? Even investigated? Were steps taken to ensure such criminal activities don't happen again? No.in fact, she's enjoying retirement with full pension and benefits (ironically enough, courtesy of the very people she lied to). And it isn't just Lois Lerner, the entire top echelon of the regime is corrupt.Your glib reply aside, interacting with this agency prior to reforms being enacted and the guilty punished defies common sense.
3	1523881336	-4	We'll change our ways Russia. Promise.
1	1523895510	1	She investigated every PAC that was set up because that kind of campaign finance reform was illegal under McCain-Feingold which got overturned by Citizens United.  It has nothing to do with individual income taxes.The GOP shaped that narrative so you overlooked the biggest part of the story:  That type of campaign financing had been illegal and her job was to verify every single PAC was legally created in the middle of an election.  Instead, you complained she didnt rubber stamp these groups spending billions in anonymous cash on elections fast enough.
1	1523890256	1	And when the day comes, the IRS will ask for our opinion.But until that day we have to follow their rules or risk the consequences
2	1523892614	1	Thank you for sharing the Bolshevik perspective.
0	1523898952	1	Because FUCK the IRS
0	1523890291	1	Taxing crypto trades up to 40% is theft and a crime there's nothing else to call it
0	1523890388	1	Instead of blaming it on the investors, IRS should regularize with norms that make sense. Crypto is a new type of asset, therefore it requires new rules, the old rules cannot and should not be applied.
1	1523891956	1	What exactly is the reasoning that there should be new rules?
0	1523897516	1	Scenario: You've got a gun to your head. Thug says "Give me half of your wealth or I'll shoot!"Do you think lying about how much you own is acceptable in this case?
0	1523879375	5	Nice try IRS 
0	1523876518	3	Is anyone really suprised?
1	1523877665	6	Not really, but this does mean the IRS will target more crypto investors to make examples out of them for the rest.

3	1523888419	4	Dont forget that a giant part of your yearly donations are used to keep stately pyramidscemes afloat. I dont know exactly how pensions work in the usa but for europe its textbook pyramid scemes.
4	1523889981	1	Same in US, there are Trillions in unfunded pension promises. The only exception is a 401k account you fund yourself.
3	1523890765	1	Uh -- The IRS is a shakedown organization.  They take money, and if you are in jail you can't pay them.  You sound like a little child who has never known anyone with tax issues.  You'll be fucked to death many times before they send you to a jail.  They will take every sliver of money owed to them one way or another, don't be so arrogant. 
2	1523879656	-2	And how many IRS agents will be made examples of by sic-ing the hounds of narc on them?
3	1523880573	2	I don't understand?
4	1523890562	1	How hard do you think it will be to let it look like that an IRS agent is selling drugs on the side?
5	1523896356	1	Why would we want to do that, though? You should remember that IRS agents are humans as well. They have familes, kids, etc.
6	1523903550	1	Because people that get 'audited' do also have families and those IRS agents do not care one iota even when agents actions destroy their lives.As said elsewhere in the comments to this link: the IRS is a shakedown organization, no ifs buts or whataboutism around that.
0	1523877134	4	It's not the**IRS**
0	1523884536	5	I'm paying my taxes, begrudgingly.. But for some reason I don't feel that crypto should be taxed. It just doesn't connect in the same way that an investment in a company exists. I feel like this is beyond the realm of governments and borders. It's like trying to tax the oxygen that's in the airspace within the US borders.Regardless of how silly the laws try to classify it.For example, You "must" file an FBAR aka FinCen form 114 if you have had at least $10k worth of any asset or financial instrument in a foreign account at any given time in 2017 ( even if only for a minute ). So they are using this to say if you have transferred $10,001 worth of BTC from coinbase (USA) to binance (China) you are to report.However, the problem is that bitcoin does not exist in the physical realm. There is no location for Bitcoin. It is  within a digital network and kept track of on ledgers across the globe. Therefore, there is no "foreign account" Btw, you "must" file a FATCA aka form 8938 if you had $50,000 in transactions on a "foreign account"Both of these things have extremely harsh penalties and I haven't heard anyone winning against the gov.Penalties include: $10,000 fine if you failed to report because you didn't not know you had to $100,000 fine or 50% account value (whichever is greater) if you knowingly failed to reportThings to note:FBAR is simply a report to notify the gov financial crimes department (FINCEN) and there are no taxes on these reportsFATCA is reported to the IRS 
1	1523890669	1	You buy crypto with after-tax money and its essentially like buying a foreign currency.  Nobody reports if they go to Europe, take out 10k in cash to get Euros, and incidentally has a foreign currency gain.But the IRS considers any income to be agi unless excluded.  I don’t agree with it but I have fewer guns than they do
1	1523889969	1	There was a decent article about how Facebook is bigger than nations, same could be said of bitcoin
0	1523889665	5	Well, I’ve lost money, so fuck all of you lol.

0	1523880095	6	You don't tell a robber where the safe is or children are hiding. It's only lying if you are misrepresenting reality to honest people. P.S. Taxation is theft. 
1	1523880838	10	I'm getting a lot in return for the tax I pay, but I'm not living in the US, we're not throwing half of our money at arms manufacturers.
2	1523881738	3	Battered wife syndrome 
3	1523884444	2	To be fair, they could be living in a tiny, homogeneous community where they actually do see benefits. One of the only instances I can see taxation as actually being honest. 
4	1523886680	2	Germany. Here tax isn't allowed to be ring-fenced by definition, and when you do the math, especially if you have children, paying tax pays out for you. If we reduced our military budget further even more, nobody knows what we're spending it on anyway as almost none of our equipment is functional.

2	1523891370	1	What a stupid question. This is like asking who will pay for your lunch. The people who use the roads will pay for the roads. The people who want to eat the lunch will pay for the lunch. There is no reason, under normal circumstances, to ask other people to pay for your roads or to pay for your lunch.
2	1523890288	1	Only a very tiny fraction of tax money is used for roads.If giving up half my paycheck, my life, and my freedom is the price I have to pay for a road, I'll walk, thank you.
3	1523891990	1	Who pays for education, social security, healthcare (medicare and medicaid), national defense (yes, you need some even if you disagree with wars), veteran benefits, transportation, police officers, firefighters, etc. The list goes on.  People hate taxes, but I bet if there house was on fire they feel a little differently.
4	1523893220	1	In the U.S. the Federal personal income tax didn't exist until 1913... how did we manage to get along before this?  The national debt is over 20 trillion dollars... with the personal income tax, is it working? 
5	1523893560	1	Yes, this was enacted to help make up for the lost revenue due to decreasing tariffs. It wasn't enacted as a means to additional revenue.This isn't the same world as it was in 1913. My question still stands. Show me a modern developed country that doesn't tax it's citizens.  I can show you some that don't, and they probably look like 1913 America in the year 2018.

That is slavery.

I 100% agree that there needs to be better control of the taxes and how the money is spent, but I feel there are 100s of things we take for granted each day that taxes made possible.

2	1523891049	1	"federal income tax is theft"
3	1523899409	1	All taxation you didn't consent to is theft, regardless of whether or not you benefit from it.You can try to argue that it's necessary, but in all honesty that's just an argument from ignorance and desire to control other people.
1	1523891209	1	It's not theft if the politicians you elected to represent your consent decided that it was something you agreed to fund for the well being of the <city, county, state, country>. It'd be theft if they misused those funds (which some, likely most, do), but even that is not something that not paying taxes would solve.If you personally don't take political action, you cannot complain. And maybe you do, but tax avoidance is not the solution. Whatever wars or goals you don't want to support, WILL get first priority for funding, they'll just take it out of the education budget if you don't pay.
2	1523892373	1	Rights come before the democratic vote. You can not vote a persons property or life away.
3	1523894141	1	I agree that rights should not be voted away. However, the property is not being voted away, it's being converted into goods and services. Generally these should be those that you would greatly benefit from and want or need, but wouldn't be able to afford otherwise. Kind of like a Kickstarter, except any profits would benefit you.If you don't like the goods and services you're receiving, that's a problem with the politicians and the exchanges they're making, not the system of taxes itself.EDIT: In other words, taxes are not the problem, it's the corrupt system and its politicians. Taxes have produced amazing results all over the world so I think their value should not be discarded.
4	1523895291	1	The "conversion" or theft as an honest man would put it is the rights violation. The law is wrong. The people who vote for this kind of law are immoral.  You are trying to evade the facts by word games. Please don't evade for your own sake. 
5	1523897272	1	I'm not evading. Taxation isn't a law, it's simply a requirement of government. How would you propose that a country fund the public programs that the people wanted to fund? Obviously it can't be through opting in, since then people like you would just take advantage of the benefits without contributing. What exactly are you promoting here? No public programs? Leave it up to the the individual to look out for themself? A government is one of the systems that the public chose to pay for and it can't exist without taxes, so maybe anarchy? As soon as a people decide to create a government, they agree to pay taxes to fund that government, no?
6	1523900753	1	Concent based funding, fees for conflict resolution. Inflation based funding on an opt-in currency. I am promoting Capitalism. A system where the only purpose of government is to protect rights. Funded by an opt-in/ fee-based system. I would pay as I love law and order. The funding list would be public so you can choose to boycott people that don't pay a fair share. 
7	1523903937	1	How would you be able to enforce boycotting people who don't pay a fair share though? What about those that can't afford the very services they need most?Also, everything benefits everyone in the end. You may never have kids or even go to school, but public education helps the nation as a whole be more educated, which helps nearly every aspect of life for everyone. You may never get sick or need emergency assistance, but maybe your friend or his family will.
0	1523877243	4	Not a lot of people are being honest with them because they haven't been getting much profits lately.
1	1523889719	1	lately doesn't matter, 2017 matters.
0	1523881823	5	Just more reason to never cash out. Fuck that Shit I’m hodling until we are classified as a currency. 
0	1523876731	1	This is funny
0	1523890412	1	So, what you're saying is to sell your Bitcoin for cash using local bitcoins? 
0	1523888249	2	Income taxes are a failed concept from the beginning.Bloated with rules that the average person cannot navigate - leaving it only full of opportunities to those who can pay for someone to exploit it for them.OK - a bit off topic.
0	1523884487	1	I had gains very briefly, for the one set of crypto I sold at a high point.  The rest I have held, so I can't report that until it is sold.  So I reported that gain.
0	1523889590	1	>“I want to reassure people that it’s not as complex as it may seem at first glance and that Credit Karma Tax has a number of resources about how to approach bitcoin and taxes.”It's not that complicated if you only bought and sold at the same exchange... It gets complicated quickly if you were doing anything more interesting. 
0	1523891867	1	>Lying to IRS very popular ~~among crypto investors~~: Almost everyone is underreporting
0	1523892491	1	Well, duh. Though I think I've been over-reporting. I'm one of those 100 people no doubt.
0	1523896493	1	I wonder how many people are going to wait for a half decent bull run to be able to more easily afford the tax bill, albeit with a late penalty. 
0	1523896909	1	How are you supposed to report? Is it per transaction? Or do you average all of your assets and see if there is a net gain? Do you only report once you sell? Soooooo complicated 
0	1523897076	1	shocker
0	1523899730	1	To be fair it's pretty confusing, and in Canada there's been a fair bit of conflicting reports of how to report the gains, especially if you traded it for other crypto.
0	1523900923	1	Taxes aren't even due until tomorrow because the 15th fell on a weekend and today is a D.C. holiday.ie, "very popular" and "almost everyone" is complete fabrication.So hey there, fuck this FUD post bullshit!
0	1523901964	1	If the government allowed people to pay taxes once they exchange for fiat or buy an item with crypto (instead of every single crypto to crypto transaction)  maybe people will feel like they can actually determine their loss/gain and include it with their taxes.
0	1523902657	1	I just hodl at least 1 year and then it's tax free for me. :P
0	1523903174	1	And what about the crypto holders who don't know what works they have.
0	1523903593	1	"According to reports from Credit Karma tax platform, revealed by CNBC, fewer than 100 people out of 250,000 who claimed to have holdings in crypto reported capital gains on their crypto investments to IRS. That is a staggering 0,0004 percent!"US Government agencies (FBI; CIA; etc.) frequently lie and this is not exception.Two tax professionals whose practices specialize in crypto have both stated that each of them alone had more than that number declare crypto in past years at their practice alone.But if the IRS exaggerates, it helps them win their case (which they did) to get Coinbase to turn over records.
0	1523903939	1	People trying to avoid reporting taxes is exactly the thing that will get bitcoin outlawed. If uncle Sam doesn't get his, you won't get yours because bitcoin will become illegal. Guess what? Bye bye high bitcoin price...
0	1523904088	1	lol, audit me. I'll be the one getting a check at the end.
0	1523880238	0	Hodl and never tell irs 
1	1523883502	8	If you only Hodl you don't have to tell the IRS. The problem is that some people actually want to use it sometimes. 
2	1523902322	1	If a crypto is a currency, than you should use it, do you pay the same taxes when you use USD ? Nope, you don't have to tell them unless you accept your slave masters rules.
2	1523884628	1	Hold until there are crypto specific taxes. Or move to a country that is crypto friendly.
3	1523887359	4	I live on the internet, it's super crypto friendly ;) 
4	1523889974	1	I don't know how to say this. Show me your ways
0	1523884201	1	Firstly, I'm not a US citizen, but our local authorities have recently published information about how they intend on enforcing regulations around cryptocurrencies. Been having some thoughts around the disclosure of crypto holdings to the authorities as a huge consumer protection risk. Neither them, any government, bank or company have been able to protect citizens from identity theft, a fundamental inherent problem of the legacy system, and one of the reasons such information is not required when using bitcoin by design (assuming you avoid custodial services and exchanges, but then you're not really using bitcoin). A further concern is the future breaches which might become more prevalent following the instantiation of the Automatic Exchange of Information (FATCA AND CRS), which has lead to the sharing of personally identifiable information between 50+ participating countries. Exposing such information could lead to personal liabilities and security risks if not secured and authorities held accountable for the protection thereof. The amount of information automatically exchanged is frightening, and adding personal crypto assets would expose one to further risk of such information falling into the wrong hands. 
0	1523886598	1	Sold a bit less than 1000 dollars worth of BTC last year. FIFO, so coins were bought in 2013 -  long term investment. Capital gains = 0.Reported. I think a lot of that is going on. 
1	1523887374	2	Capital gains =/= 0% in the USA. If you bought it for less than you sold it for then you will have capital gains 
2	1523889368	1	long term capital gains rate is 0% if your income falls under a certain bracket.  
3	1523889557	1	Ahh. I see.
4	1523890964	1	If you made less than like 21k then it's actually pretty fine.  I'm a pretty poor person and my standard deduction covered well over my gains and the cost to do all the prep.  I feel fine about it.
1	1523888769	1	If you are using FIFO to figure out your capital gains, you're doing it wrong.  You need to keep a running average price ("Adjusted Cost Base") that changes every time you make a buy. Your capital gains are  ((ACB * coins sold) - (Value of the trade - reasonable fees associated with the trade)).I *wish* FIFO worked, particularly given that I can identify what coins were purchased when, based on the wallet addresses. 
2	1523889332	1	LIFO is perfectly fine.
3	1523889653	1	Maybe in determining if it's a long term or short term gain.  But not for the calculation of the gain itself 
4	1523891199	1	in america, it is.
5	1523896724	1	Fair enough.  Just did a deep dive into posting about US tax guidance, and came across this -- https://bravenewcoin.com/news/capital-gains-on-cryptocurrency-fifo-lifo-or-specific-identification/  FIFO seems to be recommended, with LIFO and specific identification being flagged as risky.Canadian rules seem a little more well defined.  (But still kinda vague.  :)  )
6	1523903452	1	"IRS’s guidance is that FIFO and specific identification may both be used for stocks and bonds"
0	1523896894	1	> Almost everyone is underreportingSo what? None of your business. Get cancer you cuck!
0	1523897677	1	IRS is a constitutional crime
0	1523883107	0	Yeah pay your taxes so your gov could bomb the hell out a country that never attacked US.... $224mln without your approval!  Shame on you all of those who just paid their taxes! You just throw a bomb with your money! **224 fucking millions!**
1	1523891287	1	I paid my taxes so that social security checks would clear, the people at the VA would get medical care, the people on Medicaid could get care, so the streets were pretty safe and the vast majority of my fellow citizens were warm and safe.
2	1523892629	1	nah bro you bombed Syria straight up, every penny you give the IRS is a penny dropped on the head of a child in Damascus. see you at The Hague you sick fuck

0	1523893796	1	Good for them, this is the tax equal to holding currency ? and did you vote for this tax ? If these are both no that you don't live in a democracy. If you choose to live in a country that does not have democracy, well good for you if not, you should not pay for this theft !
1	1523897993	1	Democracy doesn’t mean you get what *you* vote for. 
2	1523901724	1	Yes it does, if you don't get it is a fake democrazy
