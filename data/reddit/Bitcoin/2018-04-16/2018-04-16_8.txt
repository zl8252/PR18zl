0	1523884832	3	This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://dollardestruction.com/2018/04/15/coinsource-installs-20-bitcoin-atm-machines-around-washington-dc/) reduced by 69%. (I'm a bot)*****> Buying cryptocurrency has just become easier for all residents of the US capital, as the American bitcoin ATM network, Coinsource, has now expanded into the Washington DC metropolitan area.> Coinsource, Texas-based bitcoin ATM network, has announced its first entry into the American capital.> CMO of Coinsource, Bobby Sharp, said, &quot;We are expanding the Bitcoin ATM market further than it&#039;s ever been in D.C., offering the lowest rates, exclusive remote enrollment and allowing for at-home account registration. This installment is especially significant to Coinsource, as the philosophy behind decentralized currency is and has always been about giving freedom back to the people. As a company I feel that we have been able to provide financial freedom to the underbanked and unbanked, and I am happy to bring our services to D.C.&quot;.*****[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/8cnght/20_more_bitcoin_atms_get_installed_around/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ "Version 2.00, ~311185 tl;drs so far.") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr "PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.") | *Top* *keywords*: **machines**^#1 **Coinsource**^#2 **DC**^#3 **bitcoin**^#4 **Washington**^#5
0	1523880072	4	That's because there's more Bitcoin machines in the Hood than anywhere else. Quickest way to launder money. I live in Stockton California not one of the nicer towns anyways we have four or five of them here and I think three Wells Fargo ATMs. You want to have some fun jump on Google Maps or just Google Bitcoin ATMs in Detroit East Saint Louis Oakland New Orleans get the idea you'd be amazed how many machines they have. The funny thing about these machines for some odd reason all the machines in the hood only allow you to purchase Bitcoin. Whereas in The City or San Jose or I even saw in Austin Texas that they have much fewer machines but you can both buy Bitcoin from them as well as cash out, they don't worry about that in the hood..Quick edit according to Google at this moment there is 23 Bitcoin machines in Detroit Michigan
1	1523897082	1	You can cash out and get cash? Or is it like a direct deposit? Or some sort of loaded Visa card?

0	1523894358	1	This is very good, the integration of cryptocurrencies into the masses continues)
0	1523897079	1	I've never seen a bank ATM that was deposit-only.
0	1523901934	1	Maybe its a sign its going through congress-your average intelligent person here
0	1523902184	1	Why does anybody need an ATM. What we need is merchants accepting Bitcoin. 
0	1523890412	1	20 ATM's around Washington DC. Yes, whole Washington DC xDThat's impressive as fuck. Lol.
