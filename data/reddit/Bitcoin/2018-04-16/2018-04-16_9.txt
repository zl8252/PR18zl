Inflation robs the common man of purchasing power and distorts market forces. It sends the wrong signals to businesses when the cost of money is artificially low and creates all sorts of havoc. Not to mention, the bill gets passed on to generations that aren't even born yet. Lunacy

0	1523895377	1	Wow, just wow. This guy deserve a medal.﻿
0	1523889546	17	Love this
1	1523889679	15	Finally a politician with balls
2	1523901919	1	We only see this level of candor when they're not up for reelection
0	1523892412	1	this guy gets it
1	1523902911	1	This guy fucks
1	1523899430	1	So curious, what is your background, that makes you qualified to judge that 'this guy gets it'?    Or is he simply reinforcing a belief you hold?
2	1523899784	1	This isnt a belief...this is actually happening.  Did you watch the video?
3	1523901714	1	oi if youre not a federal banker you don't "Get it" man!
3	1523902903	1	I know how the system works, I actually studied it, and work in it, and also happen to be critical of it (I do not support fractional reserve banking). I also believe we should follow Friedman's idea of the k%  money growth rule (an idea taken forward in some form by most crypto currencies). But then you get into the whole velocity of money issue, not to mention potential pitfalls of endless deflation (see Japan).     But my question was, if the OP who wrote the comment, has any clue what they're talking about? They agreed? Ok. Are they informed enough to agree?    Or just a sheep nodding his head? Because that is my impression of 80% of the people in this sub - the closest they have come to studying economics, is looking up the definition in the dictionary.
4	1523903873	1	r/iamverysmart
5	1523903947	1	You see . . . none of the losers in the sub have a clue.  You mention 1st year Econ work, and you get tagged r/iamverysmart  But then you all circle jerk about how the system is broken, but don't have a clue WTF you are all talking about. 
2	1523901478	1	Well, what is your background making you qualified to question the other guys comment? Or are you simply reinforcing your own belief in appeals to authority?
3	1523902499	1	Studied economics, worked at an Econ dept in a commercial bank, and am now at a central bank.    I am pro-crypto, and critical of a lot in mainstream Econ, but don't spout shit from a place of uninformed opinion.  
4	1523903461	1	So what's your opinion on that video?. We all know what they do is legal, but what can we do about it, besides opt-in for bitcoin? Just look and wait until we pay the bill?
5	1523903743	1	I have stated MANY times, that:    1. I am pro-crypto   2. Disagree with fractional reserve banking    But the people "running" the system, are not doing it to "scam" people. It is a system which has developed, which they (wrongly) believe is the right system. Believe it or not, I  know many economists, who deeply want to make the world better, and in actual fact, despite their efforts being misguided, spend most of their working life to improve the system.    Remind me, what do you do? Ah yes, call all economists and bankers frauds, and buy bitcoin.     Ooohhhh you rebel you! Massive contribution there.     Tell you what, when you can understand why you cannot forecast non-linear dynamical systems, then come back to me with your critiques of modern finance.    Until then, shut the fuck up you ignorant loser.  
4	1523903908	1	Well I have a PHD in bullshit detection, wrote several papers on larping neckbeards, and I'm now a consultant in the field of making-shit-up-just-to-win-arguments.My bullshit detector says that you live in some dark space, at the bottom of some stairs somewhere.Remember to take out the garbage tonight, your sister done it last night.
4	1523903118	1	Well, I studied economics longer. Worked at an Econ dept in a commercial bank with more succes, and am now at a more well regarded central bank. With my better expertise, I will let you know that you are wrong.That just means youre biased on the issue because you dont wanna admit to yourself that youre working in an industri that scams people. Like me ofc.
5	1523903413	1	Weak mind . . . herd mentality. 
6	1523903589	1	Excatly that type of high quality reply I would imagine from a fellow expert. 
7	1523903868	1	Say something intelligent, and I will reply with something intelligent.  What you wrote was garbage.    GIGO. 
8	1523904125	1	Tbh. I just think you lack the experience and expertise to understand the complexities of what I wrote. You will get there some day, son.
4	1523903172	1	You work at a central bank and you have enough time to come on here and post?  Get me a job.  I have a Masters in Economics.
5	1523903340	1	It is 8pm at night where I am . . . we all decompress in our own way. 
2	1523900910	1	You just need to look into when money is printed and where the amount to print is pulled from.
3	1523902720	1	Oh is that all? Ok . . . gotcha! /s
3	1523902271	1	That wasn't my point . . . a PhD quantum physicist may make a point about quantum entanglement, and I say "I agree" but am I qualified to agree?    Lay people never venture into fields like engineering, or physics, or medicine, to offer their opinions, yet somehow, everyone has a PhD in economics suddenly.    And for the record, one can both be educated in economics, and agree the system is broken. But then at least, you are doing it from a basis of fact.
4	1523902799	1	Good thing we don't have a system where common ordinary people are elected as representatives to make huge decisions that impact hundreds of millions of people on an extremely diverse set of issues where they might not even be very well educated on even one of them. That would be preposterous.So whats the solution here? Create a voting system where people who are properly educated in a certain domain get to vote on which solutions to problems in that domain should be implemented? And then make education for any field free to the public? That doesn't sound too bad actually as long as the pools of people actively working and voting on issues are large enough to increase the cost of corruption.
5	1523903287	1	Straw man argument.  AND I never got a response to my initial question.    Let me put it to you another way:    If we're going to debate the risk of running a particle accelerator, should we let Joe from down the road, with a 5th grade education, decide if it is safe or not?    Or I know, the neurosurgeon won't decide if it is safe to operate or not, no no, we'll ask the husband who is a CPA, if the doctor should open the wife's head up.      You know, because of all the stuff you said . . .   Great logic there . . . 
6	1523903932	1	Dude the entire internet is based off people who have zero ground to back up what their saying. Unless you link me your degrees, you're just another cynical troll sputing out non sense about your experience. How do any of us know? That is literally the theme of the internet, get over it. No one knows what anyone else is qualified for but everyone has a damn opinion.Now obviously I don't think you're a liar and I am in economics as well, but I think a qualified opinion and an opinion are two distinctions we should sort out. Everyone can have an opinion and have the right to post it on Reddit or wherever. Does it make it qualified? No. Will you ever know if they're qualified? Maybe in a few hours of conversation.TLDR: get over the fact that you'll never know what a qualified opinion is. Move on. And prepare your arguments well and you should excel. 
6	1523904043	1	No, I agree with your points there - I went on a side tangent about how this sentiment is not at all reflected in the real world especially in government. And then I began wondering what is the actual solution to a government structure that falls in line with the concept of specialization, because we can't just elect people and expect them to be experts in problems across all domains, and always make the right decisions whether it comes to farm legislation or international politics. I did not mean to straw man you.
4	1523903388	1	Physics are a bit more complicated than understanding how currency works, almost everyone has purchasing power, so they can understand how the dollar works, when people in large banks basically break the rules of what the common man can do with the dollar, then it is egregious. 
5	1523903475	1	So that is ALL of economics then? how currency works, purchasing power?    Wow, what a pity I wasted so many years studying and working in the field. You could have saved me so much time! 
6	1523903599	1	It isn't as complicated as you make it seem, large corporations gambling away the money of the common man is pretty simple to understand, good to know you're an apologist though.
7	1523903826	1	None so blind, as those who will not see . . .     You're no better than many of the economists. You have an ideology, and will beat everyone else to death with it.    No room for rational, intelligent thought.   You're just less educated, and on the other extreme of the spectrum. 
8	1523903904	1	wtf are you talking about, you are the one defending banks gambling away peoples money
2	1523903535	1	He's a bank investigator. Working for the international crypto special investigations unit.Nob'ed
0	1523900217	1	What was funny was no one stood up and said he was a liar, as he’s telling the truth and they all know it.Good job.
0	1523893991	1	UKIP? seriously? They would easily voten favour of big corporations and banks but pretend to have an antiestablishment, no bullshit platform. Theyre actually a party of people dissillusioned about politics (fairly enough) but manipulate that and people poor education to blam3 everything n immigrants and the establishment. Hypocrites. 
1	1523896335	1	Idc about british politics. Both Corbyn and May seems sucky imo. BUUUUT ... Atleast UKIP is speaking up on this issue, which I think is a very important issue. Maybe theyre hypocrites, but its better than not being a hypocrite by being purely bad and silent. Why not commend UKIP by doing good for a change even if you dont like them?
1	1523901755	1	where is labour on this issue, sweetie? ooh that's right, they take big banker money to stay in power.
0	1523898358	1	This guy has balls. YouTube suggests other videos of him, one in which he was escorted out of the parliament. 
0	1523903013	1	Please do not connect Bitcoin with UKIP. That's an insult.
0	1523903115	1	Daily reminder that there's nothing wrong with fractional reserve banking, and fractional reserve banking is possible with bitcoin too.
1	1523903730	1	Not true. No one can lend bitcoin they don't actually possess.
2	1523903996	1	They create demand deposits like banks do with paper currency or used to do with gold, i.e. a contract that says you can withdrawal 1 bitcoin from our bank whenever you want.As long as you don't make it illegal to transact in bitcoin demand deposits then there's no difference from how we used to transact in gold demand deposits or currently transact in fiat demand deposits.
0	1523899195	1	Hey hey heyyyyyy
0	1523901366	1	chicanery, haven't heard that word in a long time 
0	1523895551	1	'No no, it says right here in this textbook on Keynesian economics that like, inflation is fine as long as we rob you so slowly you don't notice, and like, printing $90 billion a month for years is like totally fine, trust us. Please go back to being ~~debt slaves~~ obedient citizens.' 
0	1523896129	1	Brilliant, the Brits can still kick you in the bollocks when you least expect it. 
1	1523903207	1	UKIP are clowns
0	1523900931	1	What a savage
0	1523903696	1	This is just utter stupidity. Fractional banking isn't perfect, but by and large, it works and it works extremely well. You cannot sustain the type of growth the world has seen over the past 500 years without it. The growth and progress of humanity under this system far outstrips what would have been if we didn't, even after accounting for all the crashes and depressions and bank runs. And guess what enables modern economies to adjust for the imperfections of fractional banking? Modern monetary policy! Meanwhile, central banks are literally the people who are empowered to print money. It's part of their job, their mandate, and a critical part of stabilizing modern economies. It's not counterfeiting if it's the actual people who are supposed to be doing it. If I start printing Domino's Pizza boxes and open up a shop to sell my own pizzas with Domino's signage without a franchise agreement or following their guidelines, that's counterfeiting Domino's Pizza. If Domino's starts making Domino's Pizza...I mean that's why they exist, that's why people buy their pizzas. That's not counterfeiting. The same goes for interest rates. Without the ability to adjust interest rates, a modern central bank is entirely ineffective at managing and stabilizing an economy. Nothing is perfect, and when central banks really fuck up, it's at an astronomical scale. But that doesn't mean that it's not the best option we have. If you can design a large, stable, and growing economy without these tools, please, tell the world how. Generations of policy makers, economists, and other academics have studied this and don't have a viable alternative. Any random politician can go and spout BS on TV, but that doesn't make it right. There are plenty of adjustments, reforms that can be made, but none of them involve stopping fractional reserve banking or taking away the core tenants of monetary policy. 
0	1523897135	1	No, it's not. You may not like the system, like you may not like Coca-Cola, but that doesn't make it a scam.
1	1523901836	1	Apples and oranges. They print money out of nothing, making sweet old ladies savings less valuable. Thats a scam imo. A pyramid-scheme is also a system that works until it doesnt. Its still a scam.
2	1523903183	1	it's not a scam. Just exchange your FIAT to assets and inflation can suck a dick. FIAT is not a longterm store of value.  That being said, I still don't like FIAT. ;)
3	1523903441	1	Tell that to all the sweet old ladies who trusts these people to have their best interests at heart. Its fine if you dont wanna call it a scam. I do wanna call it a scam. Because I see them scamming people. If you wanna argue what a "scam" is excatly, thats just silly wordgames. They are cheating people. I am calling that a scam.
4	1523903945	1	yeah like life a god damn scam. you get born just to decay slowly and die. what a joke this is. ;)  and bitcoin is also a scam. It appreciates without people doing anything. scam!  /s
4	1523904113	1	Terrorists and "sweet old ladies" always make a good argument. The former against Bitcoin, the latter against banks.
1	1523900098	1	It’s just all the fees that’s the problem 
0	1523901448	1	Heavy Metal
0	1523901503	1	Although. The more times an organisation has freedom/people/democratic in its name the more chance it's bullshit.
0	1523901888	1	It’s a house of cards for sure yet monetary and fiscal policy manipulation is what helps stabilize the economy and are the few tools governments have to pull out a recession or slow down inflation. These questions have plagued economists for years. This guy ranting about it doesn’t actually provide a solution does it? So how does this relate to bit coin? How can bit coin solve this? 
1	1523903816	1	By removing the power to create fake money out of thin air.
0	1523901920	1	Response from the man himself from year 2013. :)[Link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1eyyuj/response_from_godfrey_bloom_regarding_bitcoin_if/)
0	1523902078	1	Godfrey Bloom?  Is this where we are at in this sub?  This guy is the UK's Joe Arpaio... an anti-semetic, sexist, conspiracy nut-job.  He got fired from UKIP for being a racist asshole, which is really fucking saying something.
0	1523903126	1	The system isn't the scam.  It's its creators, proponents and employees.  Mostly every single one of us.
0	1523903337	1	Also to add that fractional reserve banking contributes to inflation (essentially borrowing causes currency to appear out of nowhere), such that every loan made robs every currency holder a fraction of their purchasing power. At 3% inflation rate, any currency stored in a bank account has its purchasing power reduced by 27% in a decade, and again in 20 years. These banks are not only making money out of thin air, charging you interest on it, robbing you of your purchasing power, but they have the fucking gall to tell you where you can and cannot spend your money. IT YOURS - at least what's left of it.They also knowingly bank for cartels and crime syndicates, and prop up some of the worst organizations and corruption on this planet.Oh, then there was the 2009 heist.FUCK THE BANKS!
