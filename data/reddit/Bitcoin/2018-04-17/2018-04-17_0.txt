0	1523958824	334	Time to find a lawyer 
1	1523974808	125	Lawyers at Silver Miller are considering a class action against HitBTC.  I've contacted them as I have had major problems with HitBTC, too.  They were helpful telling me what my options are.
2	1523976363	1	your lawyers will ditch you again, once a fool always a fool
3	1523980346	1	For anyone wondering about this guy... look at his comment history.
4	1523980499	1	Thanks. He's clearly a HitBTC shill.
4	1523981586	1	Holy shit, I've seen some shills... then there is this a guy. He might as well be a neon billboard on Times Square for HitBTC.Edit* definitely a stolen or sold account. Seemed to be a big T_D type user and disappeared for 8 months to come back in past few weeks doing nothing but promoting HitBTC in every single comment.
3	1523980776	1	No, they did not ditch me. But they did confirm that hitbtc is more difficult to sue than the vast majority of other exchanges because hitbtc intentionally hides the owners, country where incorporated, address, etc. Another good reason to avoid using hitbtc if at all possible. 
4	1523981642	1	Check that guys comment history, he HAS to be working for HitBTC
4	1523988681	1	You may have considered doing some basic fucking homework before sending forty THOUSAND DOLLARS!Holy shit, pure greed is fueling all kinds of idiotic behavior in this community.
1	1523985907	1	Cryptos can be a bitch
0	1523960516	89	I have been owed what is now around 15k USD for over 5 months of affiliate earnings..zero response from support...stay away
1	1523965020	-75	>affiliate earningsIs another term for ponzi/pyramid scheme, you are aware of that?
2	1523966812	65	Plenty of legit businesses have affiliate earnings. That's how many bloggers make money....
2	1523975713	1	Affiliate programs have nothing to do with ponzi schemes.
2	1523976458	1	Almost every single successful website or business has at some point had affiliated marketing involved.Are you dumb or just /r/iamverysmart?
2	1523970310	29	You’re either stupid AF or just misinformed and trying to sound smart. Not nearly the same thing as a ponzi/pyramid.
3	1523982162	1	Also, ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes have quite a few differences from one another. MLM schemes like Herbalife can be a pyramid scheme, but rarely are they ponzi schemes. Madoff investments had no pyramid scheme, but was clearly a ponzi scheme.
3	1523972503	-3	They’re regularly mentioned together and if you haven’t done any research, it could be easy to associate it as some bs get rich scheme. 
4	1523983958	1	Being affiliated with a company and helping them increase their sales by promoting their product and getting a % out of the earnings you provide them with is hardly similar to a ponzi or a pyramid scheme. It's is just smart marketing. In ponzis & pyramids you usually have to spend your own money before even being able to earn anything, and you'll have to actively find new promoters below you instead of actual customers. The focus is no longer on the product itself, and it's merely an excuse to run the scam. Ponzis and pyramids can't last forever as you'll eventually run out of money to pay off the older promoters/investors, and the whole thing comes crashing down.
2	1523974742	2	Where are all the retards coming from?
2	1523975831	1	Affiliate earnings are earnings by someone that is affiliated such as if you signed up for YouTube's Affiliate program and you were making money through adsense you would have affiliate earnings from YouTube. 
2	1523985760	1	No it's not.  Do some research 
2	1523973367	-14	The whole crypto space is nothing but a ponzi scheme
3	1523974727	3	Your mom's vag is a Ponzi scheme.
4	1523975030	1	More like trickle-down economics.
5	1523983367	1	Haha, that's pretty nasty!
3	1523974044	2	Brace for downvotes!
4	1523974436	-1	I don't care about that, but if you think about it you will see its true: the ones who benefit the most are the creators/devs, then the first miners, then the buyers, then the bagholders, etc.Literally a pyramid scheme
5	1523977204	1	I've heard people say this, but I don't really see it. Couldn't you say the same thing about any new creation/discovery that turns out to be profitable and desired by a lot of people? 
5	1523978186	1	No, not "literally" a pyramid scheme. In a pyramid scheme, members are encouraged (coerced?) into recruiting *more* members with the promise of increased payouts and or benefits. This goes up as the number of further members enrolled increases. No one cares if you or anyone else buys bitcoin and no one is trying to encourage you to do so. In fact, I would much rather you didn't. 
6	1523980454	1	Yeah that's exactly what you do when you shill your coin to other peopleThe value of your coins increase when someone else buy, that's why shills existWhy do everyone in crypto seek 'mass adoption'? Because they want more people buying in and pumping the price of their coins
7	1523981396	1	Do you believe all traded assets, stocks and commodities are pyramid schemes? Their values increase when people purchase them. 
8	1523981779	1	It's not that simple: A stocks value is based on the percieved value of the company and their products/services, not how much people buy it. On the other side, a bitcoins value is based on how much you think it will go up in the future so you need a lot of new people thinking the same as you and buying in everyday to keep the price up.That's pure speculative growth, and not actual value.
9	1523982160	1	>It's not that simple: A stocks value is based on the percieved value of the company and their products/services, not how much people buy it. Do you not think that a decentralised, borderless, immutable, instantly-traded, digital currency with low fees and the facility for microtransactions has value?
5	1523976320	1	it's the same with literally any business... that's life. early bird gets the worm. early investors in google do better than those investing now. common sense kid.
6	1523980400	1	Not really, since the person who holds the stock holds ownership in a physical company and most of them pay dividends 
7	1523982547	1	crypto works differently. no one said they are stocks
8	1523984096	1	You made the comparison not me, man
9	1523988128	1	i was comparing the undeniable fact that in business, being early gains you an advantage. i was not comparing the financial structure of crypto/stocks. nice try tho
5	1523983502	1	So how should it work? Premine? Giving it to banks? Who decides? Mining is the way it worked 5,000 y ago and still is. Your comment is childish.
5	1523986995	1	in a pyramid scheme you need exponential growth of people, joining the system, to keep it stable. There were/are some coins that have this scheme. Bitconnect was one of those. In Bitcoin you only need as much new money/people as the inflationrate, that is defined by the new coins that are created. if more people join than the inflation, the price goes up. it the count of people is not increasing the price will slowly decrease beause of the new created coins. the inflation is decreasing by protocol as time goes by. 
5	1523974815	2	So is capitalism if you really think about, but still mostly your mom's vag.
6	1523975030	1	>so is capitalismNo, not really 
7	1523983468	1	Yeah it kinda is, sorry to burst your bubble. Open your mind for once, lol.
5	1523975123	1	I mostly agree, but I have to wonder when Satoshi will cash in because I believe time is getting short if that's that goal.
6	1523976005	1	Satoshi is dead
7	1523976318	1	Maybe he just dropped his wallet in the toilet. 
6	1523976362	1	"satoshi" is the nsa. enjoy using their already hacked hashing algorithm.
0	1523959539	183	It is time for decentralized exchanges 
1	1523975690	1	How?  How do you transfer from Bitcoin to cash without a centralized exchange?  Or cash to Bitcoin?  Someone has to be behind the curtain doing it right? 
2	1523976676	1	This. USD isn't compatible with decentralization. It's sort of designed not to be.
3	1523978409	1	I mean, they could send through PayPal or something, but that isn't really a whole lot better than what we have now.  
4	1523987132	1	man you guys are just made to be scammedthis whole thread after everyone already knows hitBTC is shady af, and then suggesting paypalholy shit can't wait for the next crypto bull run to bring in a whole new flock of people with zero context about this scene
5	1523988908	1	in that case...PSA: [what to do](https://imgur.com/a/HQmxj) when you lost bitcoin and you didn't write down your recovery seed or you didn't 2FA your trading account
2	1523977721	1	and how do u do it now? using tether? thats worthless shit
3	1523978347	1	I put money on coinbase and in a few days I get Bitcoin to transfer out.  I personally don't deal with tether on my end at all.  
2	1523977963	1	Anyone with a bank account can send the amount. Then a free market develops of who can send it with least cost.Think online commerce, but instead of sending a package in mail you pay to a bank account.
3	1523988499	1	Bitcoin payments are final. Bank payments are not. You are just asking for someone to claim it was fraud have your payment clawed back and walk away with your bitcoin. 
3	1523978288	1	So you are giving your bank account number to strangers?  That really doesn't sound good.  I guess you could pay pal them but then you have a centralized system again.  
4	1523978497	1	I don't know what kind of weird system other countries have, but over here the only thing you can do with a bank account number is to pay into it.
5	1523978687	1	Checks are still a thing here in the US.  Literally a check is little more than a paper with your bank account number on it.  They could literally just print one off to themselves.  
6	1523979954	1	Cheques have a LOT more security than that. You can't just print off a cheque based on someone's bank account
7	1523983402	1	You absolutely can.  They do not.  A check is basically a note with your bank account number.  
8	1523985695	1	I'm literally looking it up now, and security feature include: treasury seal, bleeding ink (runs red with moisture), microprinted words that don't show up when copied, a watermark, ultraviolet overprinting
9	1523985815	1	Not on a common check book check.  You are thinking cashier's checks or something.  It is like you never held a check.  ALSO you can deposit by taking a picture of the check, so how secure is it?  But no, it has none of thsoe features.  
9	1523986025	1	The things which must be on a check to make it a legal check are very few.  You can write it on a napkin with a crayon. 
7	1523985253	1	You could write a check by hand on a piece of toilet paper.
5	1523982034	1	I am in the USA.  I can withdraw or deposit using bank account numbers.  I can move money between bank accounts as well.After all, it is the 21st century.
6	1523982768	1	>After all, it is the 21st century                          Ahahahaha. Are you implying that not being able to withdraw from only a bank acc number is an outdated scheme?
6	1523984248	1	Are you saying your bank doesn't require any further information beyond account number in order to withdraw money?That's insane.
7	1523984671	1	When I first set these up, very small transfers were made automatically and I had to verify the amounts that were transferred.  In order to do that I needed direct access to current account information.
8	1523986428	1	In other words, not just an account number.
9	1523986586	1	Not initially, no.
2	1523978691	1	Local exchanges
2	1523978726	1	Haven't you heard of Bisq? Of course it's not as useful as a centralized exchange, but it doesn't have this kind of problems.
2	1523980854	1	Generally (using ACH as a stand in, could use Zelle, etc.)-Dex links two users-Users swap ACH account #s-Users agree to send x-BTC one way or the other-User ACHs to the other-BTCs agreed upon are put in a mult-sig if I recall correctly-multi-sig gets unlocked once ACH completes-Exchange exists to settle arbitration -A lot of exchanges have exchange-tokens largely used to incentivize development, and bond arbitrators 
2	1523984869	1	Wait for NEX which is set to release this year. It will have Fiat to crypto too.
2	1523985830	1	Decentralized for coin to coin.  For fiat we need centralized.  
2	1523980046	1	A decentralized exchange that accepts vouchers bought with fiat. The vouchers are created by miners and are bought and delivered via a decentralized process. This removes the paradox of 'more security = less freedom'.... It is now 'more freedom = more freedom".
3	1523984292	1	If you have to buy a voucher with Fiat, is that really so different from buying the crypto with Fiat?
1	1523974735	5	Time for regulation*
2	1523975220	1	Fuck off with that bullshit. The entire point of crypto was to get away from central authority, not to centralize it with regulations and governments.
3	1523975682	1	>  not to centralize it with regulations and governments.Yeah, now it's centralized by shady and corrupt exchanges. So much better!
4	1523977455	1	I've never had 5BTC stolen from me by the exchanges I've picked. 
5	1523987686	1	Oh, as long as *you* haven't!
6	1523987808	1	[There are dozens of us... dozens!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKie-vgUGdI)
4	1523975818	1	Hence the op mentioned decentralized exchanges, while the moron I answered to is asking for the government to do it for us. If that's what you want, there is regular stocks, bonds, and securities.
5	1523977452	1	Edgy much?  Cant have this conversation without calling people moron? 
3	1523975563	1	Fuck off yourself. If you think entrenched corporate power won't figure out how to centralize itself and abuse individuals without protection from government then you're more naive (or stupid) than people who think government will solve all their problems.
4	1523976422	1	You call people who think government will solve all their problems naive or stupid, yet that is exactly what you are proposing with government regulations.
5	1523978152	1	Dude it's not an all or nothing proposition.
6	1523988765	1	How can you trust a fucking government controlled by unlimited SuperPAC money ??They can't pass ANY sensible legislation!!
6	1523979946	1	What's the last time the government didn't overstep? Income tax was supposed to be temporary to aid the war effort, now the debate is only centered around how much we should be taxed. You have to do some serious mental gymnastics to believe the government will not overregulate crypto. 
7	1523981633	1	When's the last goddamn time a corporation didn't overstep? Governments are slow bastards, private individuals and corps are much better at fucking you over.  A balance is needed, this libertarian stuff is bullshit.What will actually happen: the governments will over-regulate crypto AFTER the private corporations and power brokers have sufficient control  over it, placing barriers to entry on acting as a money exchnager and holder for others.  Banks will be the only ones "legally" allowed to run crypto nodes. miners, and wallets.  Privatization without regulation just leads to control without consequences for fraud.  Nothing is a black and white, 0 or 1, on or off, kind of answer in this realm.  Pure privatization arguments are complete nonsense in that regard, even if they hold merit in the face of over-regulation.  We either end up criminals and outlaws, or we fuck their system so hard we still end up being called the equivalent of communists against a very strong capitalist banking system.
8	1523984603	1	Who do you think defines what a corporation is? Who do you think defines their boundaries? Who do you think a corporation would lobby to change or enforce those boundaries?
8	1523986860	1	Make a decentralized exchange and you don't need to rely on either the government or any corporation. What's more, they wouldn't be able to control it without banning entire internet protocols, including VPNs which would be used to circumvent that initial ban. The libertarian thing is fundamentally what crypto was founded and is based on, so if you consider that bullshit, you probably shouldn't be invested in it.A trustless system puts the responsibility of storage, security, and anything else, including fraud prevention, on your hands. It is your responsibility not to get scammed, as nobody can help you in a decentralized system. You entered crypto because you hopes to make a lot of money but want it's fundamentals destroyed because you got burned. No. The handholding you are used to from governments and corporations like Visa and PayPal aren't and never will be a part or crypto, and they shouldn't. Maths (i.e. logic) makes the coin, you are responsible to use that same logic in handling the coin. If you want safeguards, go to the stock market or invest in real estate. Your last paragraph is absolutely idiotic though, so I will not even try to reason with it.
3	1523983702	1	As long as people want to exchange BTC for USD, you are going to need to deal with a central authority 
3	1523979267	1	Regulation =/= Centralization
4	1523979325	1	How do you regulate something without centralizing it?
1	1523964030	-3	Yes, when there is a problem on a decentralized exchange you literally have nobody to turn to. Better to lose all your money guaranteed instead of having to wait x months on a support ticket right?
2	1523964279	43	Better losing it and knowing it was your fault than losing it and knowing it wasn't. 
3	1523965254	5	exchanges today do play a pivotal role in offloading some of the scaling burden with off chain transactions.though I do agree that I would prefer a decentralized exchange - even though it would go through a period of bugs, etc... just like I prefer bitcoinexchanges take too much personal data, and the controls on how they store that data are largely unregulated... they are perfect targets to be hacked, especially smaller ones that have small IT
4	1523975448	1	http://wavesplatform.com
3	1523973524	0	lol
3	1523971744	-2	OK, I LOLed but that is one dumb comment.
2	1523966689	16	What kind of problem? Deposits never get frozen on Bisq because nobody has that power. Deposits won't get "lost" unless there is a problem with the software. If the other trader tries to scam you, that's what escrow is for. 
3	1523973791	1	Escrow still puts trust on a person. We need atomic swaps.
4	1523973948	5	You can't atomic swap fiat. It's not a cryptocurrency.
5	1523976418	1	We need a world where fiat is no longer needed 
6	1523976638	1	And everyone drives yellow lambos.
7	1523980099	1	Then a war shall break out between the yellow lambos and the green ones. Then the blue lambos shall prevail.
4	1523974528	2	Trust in 2 of 3 people. The escrows can't move funds without either the buyer or seller, so it's more secure than fully trusted centralized services.
2	1523964453	3	But their wouldnt be limits like hitbtc has enforced. Also, a decentralized exchange would not be anything like a centralized one. Ever hear of hot swaps? Decentralized exchanges will be the norm down the road while centralized ones days are numbered. 
3	1523974211	4	Until USD has its own cryptocurrency and can be atomically swapped for BTC, centralized exchanges will exist.
4	1523974701	1	Hopefully in the future, it will be used so much we won't have to swap. I'd love to be paid in Bitcoin and have an option to use it everywhere. Feels like a pipe dream 
2	1523974026	2	Better to be in charge of your own financial security than to put it in the hands of people who have a demonstrated history of "losing" your money shortly before ceasing all communication with you.Who do you trust more - yourself, or a scammer?
2	1523975675	1	That makes zero sense. It is traded as a token but Bitcoin is on Waves Platform and trades are automatic and between two parties with no funds leaving your wallet until a successful trade. Why would I ever need someone to turn to? 
2	1523965026	2	We can have the same discussion about crypto and fiat. If you screw up some letters your crypto might be gone whereas at a bank account you are more likely to restore your money in some way. I guess that's the price you need to pay for decentralization. And yet I'm preferring BTC > Fiat. To me the way to decentralized exchanges it's just a consequent step.
3	1523974807	1	> If you screw up **some** letters your crypto might be goneThere's a checksum at the end of every address. You can paste in an _entirely_ wrong address without checking, or get phished, but mistyping some letters has a near zero chance of losing coins. 
4	1523978627	1	try missing a few eth characters.
5	1523980907	1	TIL. Are most users using this new system (namereg/ENS) yet?
2	1523975027	1	You have your escrow to turn to. With centralized exchanges you _need_ the exchange's permission, not just any 2 of 3 parties.
2	1523973776	0	You should probably stick with USD.
1	1523984267	1	Time for more exchanges that are based in countries with strong regulatory structures and laws that ensure said exchanges will abide by their clients.
0	1523958892	55	If they go on like this they'll get fucked losing plenty of even potential customers. Stay away from such crappy "services" and choose those with good reputation!
1	1523962256	9	They fucked over a bunch of Monero users for quite large amounts
2	1523968567	2	How so? Because they didn't disclose the source of the transactions?
3	1523969527	8	By not letting them withdraw their funds lol
4	1523969600	1	I meant why.
5	1523969777	6	Oh, not sure. All that claiming that they need more documents and never replying to support tickets.You can see them all on /r/hitbtc if you sort by top
1	1523980914	1	Yes, but major crypto media sites are plastered with hitbtc ads, so they appear legit and probably keep getting new customers who don't read the subreddit. 
0	1523967396	25	DO NOT USE HITBTC! Many people have had such problems. 
0	1523963441	13	Don't forget the absurd withdrawal fees and minimum order amounts, leaving tons of dust in your account
1	1523970376	0	Yes, a while back they had a $100 fee to withdraw tether. And similar huge fees for other coins. I gave up on them after that.
0	1523968070	53	Why the fuck would anyone send 5 BTC to an exchange with an unknown address or CEO, has been hacked, and does not offer any crypto/fiat pairings?People like op are going to continue getting screwed because they don’t recognize untrustworthy institutions.
1	1523977182	1	This is exactly what I was thinking.   Damn I wish I had enough money to be that careless.
1	1523974993	1	I remember in some other thread I was arguing about fee prices with some guy about Gemini pumping their fees for rich people, and he tried to argue that rich people are smarter! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! So stupid. Just because you have money doesn't make you smart, you just have money. 
2	1523980745	1	There's generally a correlation between being rich and IQ.  It's not a 100% guarantee, but generally speaking most people who made their fortune have above average IQs. 
3	1523981485	1	A lot of people I know who have 1M+ in assets are dumb as a rock, they either were trust fund babbies, their daddy pays for everything, they got in to Bitcoin when I did (2010) or they made it big at stock trading. All of them are luck based in my opinion. I was lucky that I happened to be working with the FBI at the time and we discovered a child pornography ring that was using Bitcoin to pay each other. But that's just my experience. I've seen people as smart as Warren Buffet make stupid decisions even ignoring his own advice. "Never buy a stock in a company you like" and he bought BIG in to IBM!!! A stupid decision that cost him billions, and his rebuttal was "I like them." 😂
4	1523983034	1	Wow you’re SOO cool. Millionaire and former FBI agent/discoverer of pedo rings all by yourself. Pleeease tell us more. 
4	1523985913	1	General correlation and exact all the time are different concepts:)
4	1523982873	1	> Bitcoin to pay each otherLmao, gotta love how stupid criminals are. Literally every ledger has a copy of all of their transactions. I hope you put them away for life.
5	1523983201	1	That's actually how we charged them with conspiracy. We were just investigating one guy that we picked up, turned out it was a whole ring of them. We didn't know until we searched his computer, and we had to explain to the judge what Bitcoin was and how the ledger works. 
6	1523983566	1	Thanks for your service to humanity :)
7	1523986218	1	You realize he is probably full of shit right?   
8	1523987890	1	/r/nothingeverhappens/
1	1523979943	1	Arbitration greed
1	1523985868	1	I disagree with this comment.  5 bitcoin isn't that much to someone with 1000+
2	1523986609	1	Does OP have that much?
0	1523960804	10	crazy stuff, hope you get your 5 btc back
0	1523964363	7	Thanks for the heads up. I won’t be using that service after hearing this. 
0	1523959679	11	Shame man, yet another hitBTC story. I made an account there to dump my bcash when it was the only exchange taking it, and I never had any issues so I traded some alts there from time to time.I know it’s super sketchy now because there are a lot people complaining that they can’t withdraw, and I have been unable to withdraw the alts I have there now for weeks (though this is $150 worth) which pisses me off.
1	1523960811	3	me too. Changed BCH to BTC without verification
1	1523973355	1	I can't even register, never getting email confirmation, so no idea how so many get scammed
1	1523987277	1	Should have held it.

1	1523971031	2	Not sure that helps the OP. 
2	1523976542	1	And they fake their volume regularly
0	1523971145	7	So you could use massive, popular exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, but instead you decided to use garbage like HitBTC? Interesting choice...
1	1523973252	3	There are shitcoins, like blackmooncrypto, for example,  that can only be traded on HitBTC.
2	1523987887	1	Why would you even bother?
0	1523965947	4	I can't withdraw my Ardor, though that's true for everyone on HitBTC right now.My recommendation: pay a lawyer in the country that HitBTC is registered. Have that lawyer send them a letter asking for your Bitcoin.See if they respond to that.
1	1523985938	1	What country is that?
2	1523989208	1	Unknown.
0	1523967520	5	ShitBTC
0	1523969848	5	HitBTC is a disaster. I've had an open case with them for MONTHS and it hasn't even gotten a single staff update. Someone logged into my account from China or some shit and changed the password and enabled 2FA so now I can't get back in. Every couple weeks I get an email alert that the account was logged in from Eastern Europe or Asia. Luckily there's no money or bank linked to the account so it's no loss other than the frustration. I've emailed a million times and tweeted at them, nothing. Useless.
0	1523979511	1	OP maybe message these guys as it appears as though they work for HitBTC* /u/andriyanabdbel * /u/arif09See their comment histories. 
0	1523972110	3	Honestly if you have 5 BTC why is God's name do you not have it on a Trezor or Ledger?  If I had even half that amount...hell even LESS than that, I would have it only on a hard wallet that I control.
1	1523973548	2	He probably does. But you can't trade the BTC for any alt with a hardware wallet....
2	1523976165	1	Well some alts you can.  I've got BCH, BTG, and ETH as well as BTC on mine and there are several others that Trezor supports.  And who trades alts using 5 BTC at once?  That's just asking for trouble.  And who puts that much coin...or ANY coin at all into an exchange that NO ONE KNOWS where the business is based?    If you have enough fiat to be into BTC for 5 coins, you had better be doing your due diligence on the places you put it.  This is the financial version of "Don't stick your dick in crazy".
3	1523982086	1	Yes, Hitbtc is garbage. Exchanges are scary, but you need to use them if you want to buy alts. Stick with Binance and Bittrex and you should be good. Still, never wise to hold anything there. But I wouldn't be afraid to send 5 BTC to either exchange, they've proven time and time again to be reliable. 
1	1523985960	1	Hes trying to trade it 
2	1523988269	1	Then do it through an exchange that is a LOT more reputable.  Like one that actually reveals what country is operates out of for starters.  Especially with an amount like 5 BTC.
0	1523973817	3	>More time passed with no news, and I messaged them again and they asked me for my social media information which I gave them.What the actual fuck? I have zero social media, what would I do?!
1	1523975574	1	not give your BTC to someone you dont know
1	1523983916	1	TIL social media accounts are a reliable form of identification.
0	1523970330	6	I think you're also at fault for not doing research. I would never even think of sending more than 1 BTC to an exchange that people around me have told is terrible. There's no reason to even use HitBTC, they don't even offer that many pairs. Go Binance or go home, that simple.
1	1523974672	2	> Go Binance or go homeIf you live in a country that isn't a corrupt cesspool, use a  exchange located in your country, and whose office and execs are based in your country. Should you have a problem, this makes it much easier to afford a legal battle. There is no single exchange which can be recommended to everyone. And you don't want to do that even if you could, because that's how you get Mt Gox 2.0.If a national exchange does not offer the liquidity or currency pairs you want, or does not exist in the first place, then it's honestly time to second-guess what it is you plan to do.
0	1523963036	2	I had issues with them, my  were ETH stuck last year. I got them back with a lot of persistence. Never used their exchange again. They were having lots of issues almost with every crypto pair. It seems things haven't changed much. Just stay away from HITBTC and you'll be fine.
0	1523968977	2	Scum bags, that’s all these insects are, should be beaten with sticks.Give him his BTC back you low life’s, they are not your property.
0	1523972348	2	scam exchange, scammy coins always added, that should have been a warning for you
0	1523972512	2	Hitbtc is compromised imo. I created an account using a dummy email I set up for hit. Wouldn't you know, that email kept trying to get broken into. No one else has that email.
0	1523973279	2	Greeting frum  india
0	1523974290	2	Well I successfully withdrew more than 100btc selling shitcoins over there with no verification, but that was months ago
1	1523974736	2	I don't know why hitbtc is discussed as much but i think it can be explained by a big number of traders working here. people like this exchange for sure. 
0	1523978097	1	I know everyone here hates banks, but when I deposit to my checking account, I can actually withdraw the money. 
0	1523979268	1	If anybody at HitBTC is reading this - eat a dick
0	1523974509	3	Not your key, not your coins.Welcome to crypto.
0	1523968720	2	If you look at the ticket numbers...that is  LOT of tickets just between the first and last ones. Avoid this place for sure!
0	1523973132	2	I love seeing how much a shit show crypto is.  How the fuck is BTC above 8K even now?  It's nutty.  
1	1523973687	-4	I sometimes view threads on crypto for entertainment and see how greed works its ways.
2	1523976531	1	you post on wallstreetbets, shut the fuck up
3	1523977352	1	100% chance your money is in crypto.  You’re down 20% in the last month.  Keep losing your money lol
4	1523978791	1	jokes on you, i'm down 80%
4	1523978977	1	You're right, in the last month; still, I'm up 800% since almost exactly a year ago. Pretty nice isn't it? :)
0	1523964894	2	When making these claims i like to see some proof
1	1523968662	5	Its widespread. I got access to mine after 9 weeks and handing over everything I had. They now know everything about me
2	1523969952	5	They are certainly using our info i used to trade on some chinese exchange deleted my account and then a few weeks later a chinese woman called me using my real name if i had interest in forex trading or something? Freaking chinese.
0	1523969908	1	thanks for the warning dude.
0	1523972340	1	ouch, that's a big amount, HitBTC  has many issues, that's why I never tried to deposit, I'll try posting your requests ticket in their twitter account. 
0	1523972914	1	Googling "hitbtc review" instantly gives you clear indication to stay well away from them
0	1523973598	1	thanks for posting this. i will never use their site & i hope this message reaches alot of people. ill try to spread the word, hitBTC is a fraud & scam.
1	1523973950	1	big Xchanges will always have bad publicity and positive reviews are a rare case. i believe lazy people won't bother with the latter but infact there're enough good comments, too.
0	1523973974	1	HitBTC again
0	1523973995	1	HitBTC has had numerous red flags for a while now. Why are you still using them?? People never learn. 
0	1523974368	1	sad to hear that 
0	1523974598	1	HitBTC lost(stole) over 70k XEM from me.  Addresses and messages completely correct.  When I open tickets about it they take 2 weeks to address them, then move them to 'next level support', then the tickets get closed without any response 2 weeks later.  There's no denying that the deposit was made correctly of course b/c it's on the blockchain for all to see, but they refuse to credit me.  I've been fighting this for 3 months now.
0	1523974711	1	Why would anyone use a scam site like that. You should have known better..
0	1523974837	1	Yeah hitbtc fucking sux. I see them failing in the long run. 
0	1523976031	1	I've never come accorss a single big exchange that would never gather bad comments and claims. each platform has its bad record but what is important is that they're get solved instead of being "frozen for long.
0	1523976103	1	hitbtc has always been shady.
0	1523976219	1	dear god... who gives 5 BTC to hitbtc? it's a garbage exchange i learned that like my 2nd day in crypto
0	1523976531	1	This is good for Bitcoin. 
0	1523976578	1	Doesn’t mean I take part in those bets motherfucker
0	1523976793	1	I work around the corner from their registered office in London. Id be trashing their place by now if it was my money.
0	1523976884	1	Wow. That’s just insane. I hope you’ll get this resolved eventually...
0	1523976931	1	Anyone know where they're based? China? I used them once but then GTFOd out when I experienced how sketchy they are.
0	1523977196	1	Significantly less than the amount you had, but I deposited around $200 worth that I lost because they refused to put it in my account. They're just a scam, man. Im sorryy.
0	1523977325	1	rofl, "social media"... its like they are gauging the potential for/scale of negative public reaction they could expect from stealing his coins.
0	1523977737	1	Dam, I'll make sure to stay away from them, sorry to hear.. thanks for the headsup
0	1523978190	1	Stay away from hitbtc they are a horrible exchange 
0	1523978669	1	HitBTC is rubbish and full of cheater, cause me lost many coins. HitBTC should be closed forever. 
0	1523979089	1	I have same problem, but smaller amount :( Also no response!
0	1523979245	1	Go Binance bro and sue the shit out of them.
0	1523979727	1	The joys of crypto currencies. 
0	1523980025	1	HitBTC is notoriously slow. I've been waiting on a support ticket from them for months. There's a reason I always recommend Binance over them in my articles. There are good reasons to use HitBTC, but mainly it's to make trades when superior exchanges are down, or trade particular coins or tokens that don't trade on many other exchanges.
0	1523980131	1	Lawyer up
0	1523980270	1	Once you get your btc back please store it an offline wallet.
0	1523980627	1	Hitbtc are terrible. They are the worst company I have ever been in touch with 
0	1523981570	1	+++ 1 xlm
0	1523983697	1	A few months ago I got two email notifications saying someone had opened an account on HitBTC using my email address. They never responded to my support requests.They are shady as fuck. 
0	1523983777	1	Time to have a rule against scaremongering using "stole" in a headline about exchanges.
0	1523983797	1	These guys seem to have a ton of shills giving them positive reviews on review sites. All of the reviews follow the same format, worded slightly differently, in broken English ([I am happy with this service][They have a "modern" interface][Their fees are very low][Don't trust those calling it a scam] etc.).If you want to hurt them, run to those sites and warn off potential victims. Upvote other reviews calling them out, and downvote the shills.
0	1523984689	1	hard lesson learned for you, but the first rule of bitcoin is:never trust people who bitcoin.
0	1523985916	1	If you don't own your keys, you don't own your coins.
0	1523987776	1	Wait is this *the* Dan??? 
0	1523988570	1	I’m considering investing in cryptos but reading these things really puts me off. What is a legit exchange that I can trust?
0	1523969186	1	I suspect you are not telling the full story here.I went through the same process. It took 9 weeks and was very painful. They now know everything about me but I got there in the end.Your problem is most likely with the source of your deposits. You need to do your best to trace every deposit back to a recognised source. If you can't or are unwilling, your money is gone.I suspect HitBTC are being forced to go through this process. Ultimately, no exchange will be able to accept 'Black' coins. I suspect we will see it this year.And before all you morons jump in and say "Well its his money, he shouldn't have too", thats irrelevant, this is the way it is, you need to play ball or lose your BTC.
1	1523975877	1	Apologists like this one are the reason crypto is so far behind where it should be.
2	1523983288	1	Its nothing to do with Crypto. The US gov is forcing regs down the neck of all exchanges. There is nothing they or we can do
1	1523974022	2	sounds like a scam exchange.. a proper exchange doesnt ask you to trace your btc... this is crypto, not a bank & fiat we are talking here. if you mined it in 2010 & found it now by accident how the fuck would you explain it? not like you can trace that shit or have any proper proof there. fuck hitBTC scamming piece of shits. worst exchange ive ever heared by far.. id rather give my cryptos away than deposit a single satoshi on their shit exchange.
2	1523975353	1	>this is crypto, not a bank & fiat we are talking hereuh. we are talking about an exhange here. it literally is about fiat and banks
3	1523975786	1	depositing btc has nothing to do with fiat. he never said he was selling it. even if he tried to sell it they have no right to take away his btc. they can simply deny the sell order, they cant take away btc that doesnt belong to them.what op said happened was that he deposited btc to hitBTC and they took it to themselves. that is not right.
2	1523983487	1	Everything you say is correct. But they are not doing it by choice. Why would they? They are being forced. I lost a fortune due to their incompetence and they lost me as a customer. But the fact of the matter is, you have to play by their rules to get your money out, otherwise you are not getting it.
3	1523983603	1	that sucks. i mean i had problems with coinbase last year but it was nothing compared to what i just read.
1	1523971987	1	This
1	1523974093	1	>"Well its his money, he shouldn't have **too**"Not much of a position to judge his logic.
2	1523983356	1	Logic! = Grammer
3	1523985723	1	>Logic! = GrammerGramm**ar** = A lot of things
0	1523963743	1	I traded there a while ago, never had any problems with deposits and withdrawals or anything, withdrawals and deposits always processed immediately. They never asked me to confirm anything, but also I never exceeded the daily limits.
0	1523966734	1	If you did it in one transaction, then well done, it's probably your fault.  Currency transfers over $10k will raise red flags with the Feds who will freeze the tx.

0	1523974053	1	so were you locked out your acc without any visible reason? You know, now exchanges are being often compromised. so claiming a proof is a common thing with exchanges now whether we like or not.Let me guess, the exchange wouldn't have blocked you if your transaction were not so suspicious. Or I'm not right and you can bet your transactions are fully legit? Just asking becaz all of us demand security from finance platforms but when they require proofs, we're irritated. I wouldn't like my account is hacked (just an example) and my platform would ignore all transactions on it.
0	1523974505	1	The exchange wouldn't have blocked you if your transaction were not so suspicious
0	1523971732	0	You wont get any sympathy here as everyone knows the "No key, no coin" adage by now. Sorry.
1	1523974124	1	How do you sell or trade?
2	1523975259	1	only gamble with as much as you are willing to lose
2	1523975269	1	only gamble with as much as you are willing to lose
3	1523981376	1	So when I wanted to sell my Bcash I should do it in batches of 5BCH, what if I had 10k of them to sell? I don't think it is fair to blame the people themselves when an exchange rips them off, I imagine to a certain extent it comes from a jealousy that the person offering such a comment could not ever be in the same situation because they simply don't have many coins. But the person who has the amount mentioned, or more, can feel more empathy as it is a situation they themselves could be found in one day.
4	1523987679	1	>I don't think it is fair to blame the people themselves when an exchange rips them offrisks that everyone should know about before entering the world of crypto. if you have 10k BCH you should be aware that its possible you will never get one cent out of them. especially if you are not willing to figure out a method to get payment before sending them to someone else. and OP chose a specificly shitty exchange. we can only assume he was blinded by greed to make such hasty decision.
0	1523971853	0	It's not theft when you willingly give it to them, FYI.
