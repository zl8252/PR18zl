0	1523968644	16	I'd love to open a node at my small business to help out with the network but I'm still waiting for the plug and play program because I can't computer so well.  Hats off to ya'll making this happen.  As a newb to BTC (Sept 17) it's been a fun ride educating myself beyond the "get rich quick" speculation.  I'm all in on BTC changing the world.
0	1523956708	44	I always believed in bitcoin, but when I had a discussion with people and they asked me "So what's the problems" I always responded that the biggest trouble bitcoin was facing was the randomness of getting into a block, and I couldn't give a good explanation of how it would be solved. Standing around in a shop waiting for confirms obviously isn't viable. I'm glad to say I can answer my own question now.
1	1523959080	9	And now they ask you: How do we find a route from A to B in this mesh of (insert a very high number) nodes within a reasonable amount of time?I'm not trying to bash LN by the way, I love it, but can you explain that to a random guy on the street in a way he understands, I certainly can't?
2	1523959597	18	If the person asking the question is knowledgeable enough to realize that routing in such a context is a tricky issue, then they should be able to understand an appropriate answer, e.g. "For a small or medium sized network, a global route table can be maintained; for larger and more complex/mature networks, it gets trickier, but a few rounds of 'six degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon' will demonstrate that the problem is much more tractable than you might intuitively assume."Really, the only time you'd encounter problems with an answer like this is if the question-asker has an ulterior motive or agenda, and is actually trying to shill an altcoin.
2	1523961415	13	Finding a route is not hard. The hard part is finding the most optimal route. As long as you are willing to settle for a route that is "close to optimal" (that means you expect the route to be X% away from optimal), it's not a hard problem at all.
3	1523981068	1	Exactly and when there are a lot of potential routes the price of each route will tend to a minimal fee. The fact that the fee can be calculated precisely in advance also helps the user to make a decision.
3	1523979577	1	Finding a route is incredibly hard. We're not just trying to find a single route in a static, well-known graph; we're trying to find a very large number of routes at the same time in a constantly changing graph with Byzantine nodes.This is not a shortest-path problem. Ignoring intentionally hostile nodes, it seems a lot like the Canadian traveller problem, which is known to be PSPACE-complete. Add to that the tolerance of Byzantine failures, and you end up with a problem which is really quit hard to solve.The LN currently has 1.6k nodes and 5.1k channels, so for a graph it's still quite small. The next few years will show whether the developers have managed to actually invent a suitable algorithm, or if they have just implemented a "good enough" one which will fall apart once the network grows to 50k nodes, 500k channels, and a significant number of them actually trying to break the network to profit from a price drop.
4	1523981232	1	This is the reason why the protocol does not force any specific algorithm for routing and try to make it as easy as possible to upgrade it.
4	1523982029	1	> Finding a route is incredibly hard. We're not just trying to find a single route in a static, well-known graph; we're trying to find a very large number of routes at the same time in a constantly changing graph with Byzantine nodes.Are you talking about exchanges? The majority of participants only wants to find one route. The majority of popular routes probably don't change a lot. I can't imagine it taking more than a few seconds to calculate a moderately optimal route in a graph with a million nodes, at that time scale the network is essentially static. The chance of your route disappearing before the payment completes seems very small.How do byzantine failures matter in this problem? If we only include routes that have at least X confirms, it doesn't seem like there is any problem.> This is not a shortest-path problem. Ignoring intentionally hostile nodes, it seems a lot like the Canadian traveller problem, which is known to be PSPACE-complete. Add to that the tolerance of Byzantine failures, and you end up with a problem which is really quit hard to solve.Do you have any sources? I can't find anyone online that discusses the canadian traveler problem in the context of the lightning network.
5	1523983291	1	> Are you talking about exchanges? The majority of participants only wants to find one route. The majority of popular routes probably don't change a lot. He is not talking about exchanges. He is talking about opening channels between peers.And yes, paths are incredibly hard to find, since you need a way to avoid loops in networks of which a peer knows little about it.Also, It only takes one node from the path to go offline, and the entire channel is useless. That will trigger a new search for a newly available and well funded channel. Now multiply this by thousands of nodes, going online and offline... Complex issue.>  How do byzantine failures matter in this problem? If we only include routes that have at least X confirms, it doesn't seem like there is any problem.Because you don't have the knowledge in real time, when a node is online or offline, unless you *"centralize"* the network in a bunch of *"bank"* nodes.> I can't find anyone online that discusses the canadian traveler problem in the context of the lightning network.Unless it has been discussed in this context, you won't find any. Still, it is a well-known algorithm problem, studied in every decent and worth-taking CS degree.
2	1523962539	4	The question is why do you need to go in such detail?I mean, I cant even explain how my nodes find other nodes...
3	1523978188	1	Exactly, the p2p bootstrap is far less sophisticated and still works.
2	1523963580	9	How did you connect to Reddit? You don't have a direct cable from your house to the Reddit server. Your request  hopped from router to router until it got to the Reddit server. Just like LN. 
3	1523974279	5	Actually totally NOT like LN.Most of the routing on the internet is not "dicovered" but "managed". Internet providers do not come and go like crazy and the number of AS is quite limited.
4	1523978052	1	If the discovery algorithm doesn't work well, LN will evolve into a multitude of hubs that will keep a giant cache of routes to popular payment sinks. They will charge a fee but you will only need to open channels with one of them. I'm fine with this.
4	1523979993	1	Autonomous Zones may be small in number, but they contain a multitude of internal routes. So your analogy is flawed. You simply cherry-picked the topmost level of the internet routing topology to make a very case-specific point.You should know better than that.
4	1523981246	1	currently, the number of AS is much larger than the number of LN nodes.
3	1523979698	1	The internet depends on trust. Any single node is able to break it entirely. Something like https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/russian-controlled-telecom-hijacks-financial-services-internet-traffic/ is not a "bug", it's how the internet has been designed to work. LN shouldn't allow something like that, should it?
4	1523983458	1	[And of course the well-known weak point](https://media.giphy.com/media/uL1IF1WNAlptu/giphy.gif)
2	1523959608	4	The comparison has been made a lot, but it is like the early internet. Such channels like these are handeld by your router so everyone uses such a system without knowing about it. Bitcoin will go through the same process. Lightning Wallets will start to do all the channel stuff under the hood, and all you see are instant transactions with low fees. Users will not have to concern themselves with the underlying technique's. 
3	1523963192	-4	Yea but then they also won't care about how to get a transaction into a block :)
2	1523960987	2	It's true, routing is an issue but I personally don't envision multihopping 6-7 steps will be common or needed.In a research paper about twitter it showed that the most common separation between anyone on twitter is just 4 steps and nearly everyone is 5 steps inbetween. https://sysomos.com/inside-twitter/twitter-friendship-data/Now twitter friendships is ofcourse free and seemless to create, so everyone will have alot of friends and not so many LN channels. However the number of stores you are interested in are more limited than any random twitter user and will also be more well connected to eachother. Example you are really into stamp collecting. You're visiting a stamp shop to buy some rarities sometimes so you have a connection there. Now you find a new shop that sells stamps. The chance of you being 3 steps away from this new shop is alot larger than being 3 steps from a death-metal poster shop that you have no interest in. It will likely look something like this (You) - (Stampshop1) - (Another collector) - (Stampshop2)This is ofcourse only theories and we'll have to see how it develops. In the meantime, payment channels already solves the issue of instant trustless payments.
3	1523966070	3	I've done a bunch of random payments on LN mainnet recently; 4 hops is the most I've seen so far (early days). It's interesting to watch; I believe a bunch of optimisation low hanging fruit is still there, it can take considerable time (10s +) to build a route for 4 hops, 2 hops and maybe 3 is usually sub second.
3	1523978301	1	> It will likely look something like this (You) - (Stampshop1) - (Another collector) - (Stampshop2)Or (You) - (Coinbase) - (Stampshop2)
2	1523976528	1	> And now they ask you:What is bitcoin?
3	1523976602	1	if it's not my grandma , they've probably heard of it by now
2	1523977165	1	The guy on the street doesn't know how internet routing or a cell phone works... they just use it.It isn't necessary to know how it works to use something.
3	1523977923	1	wasn't my point, I totally agree with you.
2	1523977596	1	Random guy understands banks. You tell him that LN gives you a choice to select from a few "known banks" (hubs) that are so well connected that they guarantee connection but they charge a fee.  You can always use cheaper banks (hubs) but they might fail.Random guy will ask: but what is the difference with the current system?And you answer: In this system you can run a bank. I do.
2	1523977960	1	nobody in the world gives a fuck about that, just like they don't care (or understand) why transactions between banks are "pending" for so long, or how Visa confirms your credit/debit card as fast as it does from the bodega.If some rando is asking about networking efficiency they're smart enough to figure it out themselves.
2	1523978330	1	The same way you explain to a random dude how data packets get from Google or Facebook to his computer.Which is to say, you don't. It just silently operates in the background. 
2	1523979855	1	Does the random guy in the street knows how complex a credit card payment is nor does he know the real cost? Then why would the random guy care about the technical details of finding a route in a computer network?
2	1523987996	1	Use the internet as an analogy. They're both very similar.Lighting Network nodes can be thought of as routers, which route transactions, and help find the shortest and quickest way to the final address that the transaction is destined to.Correct me if I'm wrong.
1	1523961973	3	So what about 0-conf?
2	1523962369	15	0-conf has no guarantees of being included in a block.
3	1523968480	4	And a block has no guarantee of not being orphaned. The finality of a transaction isn’t black and white at any point. 
4	1523974847	3	You can't compare the situation of a orphaned block with a 0conf not being included. One is highly unlikely and almost an impossibility to pull of on purpose even if you have close to 50% of the hashpower. The other is fairly easy to pull of if you have a pool that finds a few blocks per day.Regardless 6-conf is what I concider safe, it's no issue having a 6 conf LN channel for your spending since you can open it at your convenience ahead of time. You won't ever orphan a 6-conf transaction.
5	1523976409	1	Blocks get orphaned daily...
6	1523977861	1	You are correct, about 0-2 blocks / day so about 1/144 chance(alot lower in reality). However if nothing malicious is going on the transaction is most likely included in both competing blocks.To pull this of maliciously however is extremely unlikely and not profitable given risk/reward. 
4	1523971969	1	Isn't ETH going to have transaction finality soon?*ducks*
5	1523972150	1	[deleted]
6	1523974646	1	Based on this information, why is Bitcoin a viable currency for everyday merchants to accept in exchange for tangible goods? The odds of unknowingly accepting counterfeit paper currency given minimal diligence are very low, near zero (1/10000 or 0.01% estimate in circulation, but simple methods can weed out most of those). Can that same level of confidence be found in btc/crypto with the same level of user involvement (e.g. as simple as a swipe with a marker and a quick glance against a light)?
2	1523962411	10	Because when blocks get full this doesn't work anymore. So unless you will always have free blockspace, forever, for any application that wants to use it then it will not be a good idea. Also I've heard Roger state multiple times that 0-conf was the way it was done prior to RBF on bitcoin. When I started bitcoin it was the common praxis to wait 6 confirmations to consider something safe. I often hear the argument that 0-conf may be considered safe enough, that a coffe owner probably doesn't care about the added risk of accepting it etc. I'm just glad that the developers of the bitcoin protocol doesn't settle for terms like "good enough" "doesn't care about" etc. Also I don't see the point when there clearly are better solutions available.
3	1523962936	6	Not only should we not be satisfied with just good enough. But if the system relies on an insecure process you've got an attack vector.Imagine if bitcoin payment were relying heavily on 0conf, and someone opened a doublespend mining pool everything would become completely fucked.
3	1523963588	4	Even with free block space this is no guarantee at all. Just check BTC blocks over the last months. Plenty empty and half empty blocks even with a filled mempool. 
4	1523969471	1	Why does that happen? Surely the miners could make more money by validating and adding more transactions to the block and collecting the fees?
5	1523971158	3	If they find a valid block before they can download and verify the transactions they are likely just going to broadcast it as is rather than risk someone else finding it.Block reward in hand > fees in the bush.
5	1523978450	1	A Miner can set a minimum fee to be included , if miners act collectively they can force a fee bump (It will never happen if no violence involved)
3	1523969040	3	The interesting thing is that RBF might make 0 conf *more* secure, due to similar game theory as Lightning anti-cheating penalty, called scorched earth.First you need to know that RBF calculations take into account dependent txs' fees as well when determining if a tx chain has a higher fee. An attacker sends a replaceable tx to Gyft with a low fee. Gyft delivers the gift card. The attacker replaces the tx with one paying a higher fee. Gyft notices this, and invalidates the gift card. They take the original tx and spend its output in a new tx with a single OP_RETURN output with a value of 0. The entire tx amount becomes a miner fee. This tx chain has a higher fee so the double spend is replaced. The attacker cannot replace it again as there is no higher fee that can be paid (without them losing even more).The strong possibility of losing the funds would deter such an attack from taking place if scorched earth was a widely used policy.
4	1523972683	1	Doesn't work that well if the seller can't take it back
5	1523973074	2	It still discourages double spend attempts, as unless the double spend confirms before the scorched earth, the best case is that they paid normal price for the item. It's game theory.
2	1523981122	1	Website that tracks double spends on BCash: https://doublespend.cash/1.html#respendsMoral of the story, do not use 0-conf if you don't want to risk your money.
2	1523982780	1	there is no such thing as a 0-conf transaction. Just a wish and a hope.
1	1523979883	1	This is a great article about mining centralization scenarios - dovetails into the whole argument about Bitcoin's future.https://medium.com/@jimmysong/mining-centralization-scenarios-b74102adbd36Lightning is awesome, and its making Roger Ver look slow, unreliable and prone to rage-quitting. :)
1	1523983251	1	whats the answer?
2	1523988773	1	Some solution based on presigning but not broadcasting paymentchannels. Currently LN is what's being worked on the most that acomplishes 0 trust instant transactions
0	1523970074	6	try the 3D version, it's BEAUTIFUL :Dhttps://lnd3.vanilla.co.za/multinodegraphs/index.html
1	1523973773	1	This made my Nexus 5 lag a fair bit.
0	1523974146	3	Realy love how the LN is growing, but I got a question though: The majority of channels are filled with like 10.000 sat or s (8 cents) is that channel then not a dead end? Is there also a way to filter out these low channels to only see <$10 channels?
1	1523980069	1	In principle, transactions can be split up and take multiple paths simultaneously, so this isn't a limiting problem.I'm not sure if any wallets support this at the moment.
0	1523963493	6	considering what LN is trying to solve 1592 nodes is a very very small number. I know we started with 4 or 7 nodes in January but the network needs to be some 1000 times larger to be useful...Luckily it is likely that the LN grows exponentially. So node count will explode at some point.
0	1523985357	1	Remember guys: - Lightning Network is vapor ware- Blockstream Core is the single centralized development group of Bitcoin- No one is interested in Lightning - Bitcoin will NEVER scale - Bitcoin will NEVER be used for payments - Censorship, because Bitcoin revolves around reddit^Everyone @ r/btc 
0	1523967691	6	This is just the beginning. It'll get bigger. A lot bigger.
0	1523968501	2	Is there a post that gives a detailed explanation of the Lightning Network? I’d like to know more about it. 
1	1523973197	2	I'd start with [Lightning Network megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7pwna9/lightning_network_megathread/?st=jg3q9nqi&sh=b2093721)
1	1523973259	1	http://lightning.network/
0	1523968994	2	What's going to be interesting now is to see if the routing will hold if the network keeps growing.The tricky part of scalability problems is that they don't show up on small scales, and with the current growth, any problems may hit the LN like a brick.
0	1523969992	2	actually it looks beautiful regardless the fact that it also lags my laptop hahahha
0	1523980935	1	Total fees: Too tiny.
0	1523983495	1	Same. Here’s a view from the ‘early’ days; so about 3 months ago :)https://i.imgur.com/DjIxJy1.jpg
0	1523968033	3	I don't know if I'd consider about 15 btc huge.
1	1523981210	1	I think so. Remember this is for purposes of using bitcoin as an everyday currency. 
2	1523982723	1	Having multiple nodes doesn't matter if there's no currency. If there's no btc on each side of the channel, the probability of finding a successful route decreases. I don't think LN is a solution. Bitcoin worked just fine with micro transactions years ago. 
0	1523971915	3	But that has nothing to do with the lightning network, just the inefficient visualization techniques used.
0	1523980571	1	As of April 10, LN mainnet boasted 1458 public nodes and 4713 channels, the node count having passed that of the Bitcoin Cash network to demonstrate continued belief in the currency-focused aspect of Bitcoin. The total capacity of mainnet LN is just under $80,000.
0	1523981351	1	Is it safe to use the eclair wallet now?
0	1523982923	1	It's not the Lightning network that is big, is the implementation of that visualizer that sucks. I'm assuming that's javascript so... it sucks.A decent visualizer implemented in Vulkan using C/C++ or rust, would easily show every single node at 60fps.
0	1523983086	1	Whats the name of the website to see this...
0	1523983369	1	do you get paid to run a node? 
0	1523986855	1	There is some serious work to be done since it is supposed to be used with millions of nodes.
0	1523987336	1	what about these centralized hubs?
0	1523972146	-2	Can someome explain why we would need such a LN when we already have other coins like for example Nano or BCH that are already really cheap (or 100% free in Nano's case)  on tx fees and blazing fast in tx speed. Im just curious.
1	1523978154	1	Altcoins with low market cap require high trust. Bitcoin requires much lower trust. So, LN has not only high speed and low cost, but also low trust requirement.
1	1523974758	6	Why do we need RAM when hard disks are already fast and cheap?You also might want to ask Satoshi who came up with the basis for the lightning network: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-April/002417.html
2	1523976418	1	> Why do we need RAM when hard disks are already fast and cheap?Because it is much faster. What is your point ? 
3	1523976951	1	Exactly, we use RAM because it is much faster than hard disks. RAM is a 2nd layer solution which is much less secure than the hard disk, and I find it funny that no one finds its use controversial.
4	1523976996	1	Ok, I got it this time. Thank you.
4	1523977218	1	Thats a good analogy - mind if I borrow it?
5	1523977327	1	Use it as much as you like. I've used it in a presentation about lightning network, I think it's a very fitting analogy
2	1523975106	1	Or e-mail....paper communication was enough.
3	1523975409	1	Bro LN still has fees ... take for example NANO... explain to me in details how LN and BTC are a better alternative than NANO (Instant tx and ZERO fees). Im just curious
4	1523986270	1	The network effect of Bitcoin is huge, which gives a big advantage over alt coins.  I haven't looked at those you presented.  They have not been tested at Bitcoin scale.  They might be great, and might have dominated if they came first.  But they didn't and now are mostly lost in a sea of alt coins.For me, I don't want to mess with dozens of coin types.  So each time Bitcoin gets more useful, pulling in new ideas that solve problems, I am happy.  Happier than when I see a new coin invented, even if that new coin solves all the same problems. 
4	1523976060	1	One works, the other is an altcoin which likely is a scam. Go figure.
5	1523976344	1	Likely is a scam ? lol
5	1523979525	1	Have you ever actually used it or taken any time to look into it?  Please do your research before making blind claims.
1	1523974620	2	Because we want Bitcoin to evolve and be better than it is now.
1	1523978247	1	They are cheap and "fast" because either nobody uses them or because they made trade-offs in decentralisation or other metrics. 
1	1523981316	1	So we have *shitcoin* and *scamcoin* as alternatives? Hmmm.... think I'll stick to Bitcoin.
1	1523975157	1	Heck try DGB UTXO 0.00001cents per transaction and instant sends. I really don’t know why anyone would want to step away from the safety of a UTXO and go off chain. 
0	1523963330	-13	Looks highly centralized...
1	1523974671	3	Bitcoin is even more centralised, there is only a single Blockchain! 
2	1523976236	1	Yes, but anyone can compete to find blocks. Everyone is equal with the same chance as everyone else. For LN, not quite so. Just looking at that topology; if you want to route you are going to go through that big burger in the middle there, the Goldman Sachs node... Good luck decentralizing that.
3	1523981727	1	Yes, but anyone can compete to create a lightning node. Everyone is equal with the same chance as everyone else. For Blockchain, not quite so. Just look at that topology; if you want to get in a block you are going to go through that big single Blockchain in the middle there, the Goldman Sachs Blockchain... Good luck decentralizing that.PS: of course what I am saying is complete nonsense. But than your arguments are equally nonsensical. A lightning node has nothing to do with a bank, that's pure anti LN marketing.
3	1523984879	1	or just connect to your destination, or a friend of your destination, or a friend of a friend of your destination. nobody forces you to have your transaction routed by jihan wu.
1	1523964782	8	Centralisation >concentrate (control of an activity or organization) under a single authorityThat is not centralised at all. 
2	1523976383	1	So that big Goldman Sachs LN node in the middle there is nothing? From a scale from 0 to 100 it might no be 100% centralized, but my goodness if you take the 5 largest nodes its close to 80. And its just going to get worse, the incentive is to connect to the most connected node so the route is as short as possible. 
3	1523978416	1	None of those nodes have "authority." You're still not saying anything.Centralization in the context has to do with authoritative control over the entity. Case in point: "the big Goldman Sachs LN node in the middle" could go away, and the functionality of the network would not change.The big blob at the other end of the bodega's visa swipe machine? If that goes away, you're not getting a payment in.Stop speaking in your bullshit cancer philosophy and use realistic terms:The difference between the most efficient route and the most efficient route with "centralized nodes" set to ignore would be on the order of milliseconds. BTW you don't know much about opening channels if you think any of these nodes' "centralization" is an issue.
3	1523986386	1	Confusing highly connected with highly centralized, perhaps? 
1	1523968050	2	Yes, centralized and run by Unicorns and Gremlins. It sure looks like that....
1	1523971408	1	Yes, true... very centralized - just look at it https://imgur.com/BCnYgxS
1	1523968106	4	i thought you were being sarcastic and then I went through your post history and you shit talk this sub a lot. Nearly all your recent comments are here on r/bitcoin yet you say things like> I find myself visiting /r/Bitcoin less and less frequently. From once a day to once a week. Every time I do I'm reminded how horridly absurd that sub has turned into. It's a complete twilight zone.My question for you, if you think we're all retarded why do you visit ? Nourish your own coin instead of focusing on what you think is "inferior" 
2	1523970409	3	I agree with him about the sub tho tbh :D
2	1523986523	1	Dissenting opinions often bring new ideas, making Bitcoin stronger.  
2	1523976036	1	I love bitcoin. I've been involved since 2010. I made that 3D rendering with Aequitas, Libertas, Veritas on it that has been used like 3 zillion times all over the world. I've observed the community daily for 8 years now. I know i'm in my full right when i claim that this sub has taken a turn for the absurd. A dangerous and counterproductive mono culture has taken hold. Its a "either you are with us or against us" mindset (which your reply is a good example of). This is so far far away from what it was. Since i've vested so much time into bitcoin, introduced bitcoin to hundreds of people, years ago. Its just embarrassing to see that the original sales points are being urinated upon. People are coming back to me asking if this is what i told them about all those years ago. I have to say 'no, im sorry'. I would never have expected such a turn of events. Still hodling, still hoping that someone with their heads in the right place can turn the ship.
3	1523978792	1	yes, what r/bitcoin needs is someone to come here and declare "how bad it is" > Its a "either you are with us or against us" mindset (which your reply is a good example of).Isn't your post a good example of "you're against us"?> Its just embarrassing to see that the original sales points are being urinated upon.shoo back to r/btc ... you're a clown, and not the only one who's been around since 2010. I know it is in your best interest to steer the narrative towards r/btc as the "grizzled veterans huddling together for warmth in this cold world" but cut the shit.For how intelligent you appear to be, you sure don't seem to be able to handle what happens when something gets "popular."But don't veer it into "the original sales points" territory, because you're not going to convince anyone that roger fucking ver is the vanguard of purity. What's embarrassing are all the people supporting a fork coin to multiple early profits while pretending it's due to philosophical standards. Zzz. If all you have is "hope" then you have no capability to turn any ship and you're just adding to the flaming pile of bullshit. Post some code, invent your own system. I'm sure we'll either be too stupid or too blinded by its brilliance to comprehend The Solution, clearly it isn't here anymore and gosh golly I sure hope the devs wake me out of my nightmare.PS, draw a node/mining chart of BCH and let me know how decentralized that's looking to you
