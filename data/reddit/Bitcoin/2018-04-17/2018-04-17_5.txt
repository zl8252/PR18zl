0	1523967715	8	God dammit. That means she's confident """they""" can track it. 
1	1523969937	3	As long as theres good privacy on the subsequent layers, they can track the base layer as much as they want. Won't do them any good.
2	1523976848	1	Also, privacy will be the next “blocksize debate”. Buy monero/darkcoin now and dump them for bitcoin as the debate heats up. 
1	1523972983	2	At this point the idea was fun and if the overlords want to use it at least I/we have some.
2	1523974713	1	True dat
1	1523982857	1	I doubt sincerely they can track all crypto transactions even with software designed to do so, just think about the scale of the task.Most tax authorities have trouble collecting normal tax from individuals that are self employed and get paid in cash on occasions.That is why governments would rather have everyone working for companies so that the tax is deducted at source and easier to claim.One thing for sure is that it is good that Christine Lagarde has an open approach.
0	1523972980	2	When the IMF says something nice it means they're about to steal something.
0	1523973914	4	Don't trust that lizard folks. Magic number 7 
0	1523973622	1	It will do take some time until the sentiment gets greedy.
0	1523974288	1	Not the first time she makes a positive comment. She hodls, I'm sure of it.
0	1523974293	1	It doesn't say anything positive. She's asserting that what regulators think is more important than the people, and that crypto has the potential to amplify shocks and may need to be "secured" by authorities. Otherwise she's keeping her cards close to her chest, probably because she knows taking a firm stance against bitcoin is not popular.
1	1523985977	1	cryptos "secured" by authorities ... it doesn't make sense at all. 
0	1523977485	1	She's flip-flopped on the issue of Bitcoin before. I expect her to continue sending ambivalent, sometimes self-contradictory messages, as that appears to be the preferred MO of the elites.
0	1523981220	1	This is a good news. I hope it can contribute to the bitcoins uprising
0	1523982734	1	> An important initial step will be to reach a consensus within the global regulatory community on the role crypto-assets should play. Because crypto-assets know no boundaries, international cooperation will be essential.”The reason some crypto-currencies have as much value as they do is that the IMF and central banks and basically helpless to control their monetary policy.Once crypto currencies start draining serious liquidity from the major central banks / fiat currencies, they will lose the ability to set monetary policy for fiat currencies as well.Any attempt to print money on their part will cause the price of their fiat to plunge far enough to not cause any net increase in total liquidity (and probably then some), at which point there is no reason for them to try printing money again.So in the end, it will be bitcoin deciding what role the central banks and the IMF play and not the reverse.It adorable the she sees it the other way around, though.
1	1523986502	1	They'll do what they did with gold. Hoard it while offloading their printed monopoly currency on the masses.
2	1523987590	1	That's a very interesting point of view.
3	1523988853	1	Would definitely increase its value!
0	1523988195	1	Careful, she is an EVIL SNAKE WITCH
0	1523970639	0	not really, merely it is. what people are thinking!
