0	1523966040	6	Anyone working on LN wallet UI/UX should have a look at WeChat payments. The thing has largely taken over both cash and cards within the last 2 years in China. Waitresses and taxi drivers are now annoyed when people don't use it.
1	1523982925	1	Yup, my buddy in China says everyone uses it. Beats having to carry around a stack of Yuan whenever you want to buy something.
1	1523977435	1	Tim Draper said cashiers will be annoyed if you try to pay with cash in 5 years, and we'll all be paying with BTC. That doesn't seem so far since China is doing it already.
0	1523967942	3	> "I'd like to see a system where the payment terminal sends a nice HTML receipt for the customer - that receipt has, say, a table list of your grocery shopping with subtotal, taxes, grand-total, perhaps a shop logo, some loyalty code or a coupon for future use," he said.Mmmm, give the wallet arbitrary interpretable data input. Looks much reasonable.
1	1523972576	2	Yeah, HTML is an odd idea, especially that we already have fields for the purpose in LN invoice specs.
0	1523966172	2	nfc is great. can do payment straight of smart phone. lightning still got long way to go
0	1523971186	2	Bullish!
0	1523985227	1	Merchant adoption here we come ðŸš€ 
0	1523986960	1	Live in Europe and use nfc all the time with my debit card. Itâ€™s really handy way to pay euro directly out of fiat account. Canâ€™t imagine ever replacing it to spend my digital gold though.
0	1523988850	1	I love the sound of this ðŸ˜Œ
0	1523967411	1	Meanwhile, Roger shows up uninvited to Bitcoin exhibitions, takes a selfie and claims it was a Bcash event.I guess we're stuck with innovating the planet as he heroically saves babies (in a parallel universe).
0	1523980185	1	This is exactly what I had envisioned for btcâ€™s future. Payments a la Apple/Samsung pay where you pull out your phone tap the screen and pay instantly. Next step is broader retail adoption
