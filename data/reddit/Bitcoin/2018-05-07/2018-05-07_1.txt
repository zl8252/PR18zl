1	1525711513	1	It started all with a tweet, how did it end up like thisIt was only a tweet*It was only a tweet*
2	1525714366	1	Now I'm falling asleepAs she turns up the gasWhile he's putting on glovesAnd she's prepping the knifeNow they're cutting my dickAnd my stomach is sickAnd it's all in my ledgerBut it's not worth 1milNow, he's taking a snipNow..... letting my dick go----I just can't look its killing meAnd now I've got no dick......
1	1525699719	9	Why would you set the start date in 2017?
2	1525699786	19	That‘s the date he made the prediction tweet. 
3	1525699944	25	predicktion*
4	1525710970	1	Right now, we are in the “predicktion” era, and in 2020 we will enter “postdicktion”.
4	1525701446	3	Oh my god. You are killing me.
5	1525709333	1	\- McAfee's dick, December 31st, 2020
6	1525712338	1	Relevant username BagODicks
3	1525701834	1	Right. But shouldn’t it start from the day his model started production? As soon as you pull the date back it looks less like it’ll come true. 
4	1525701935	1	Maybe. What startdate would you suggest?
5	1525708993	1	9th Jan 2009
4	1525712145	1	Not if you look at it on a logarithmic scale. Trend almost completely linear on there. All the way from its inception.
5	1525714127	1	I’ve set the date to the earliest you can. The target price is 1m end of 2020. It says bitcoin is 49% lower than it should be. 
1	1525706405	1	This is my Oracle until it proves otherwise.
2	1525706628	1	Nice thought. An oracle that demands a dick sacrifice if wrong.
0	1525705844	1	I don’t even check the value my portfolio, literally the shitposting on this sub is the only indicator I need to know how I’m doing.
1	1525713288	1	Yeah the meme-o-meter says it all
0	1525691755	15	Yep, that's me
1	1525691998	8	same here
1	1525696724	5	I’m looking at Reddit to prevent myself from looking at bitcoin. 
2	1525699828	7	$9335.43
3	1525706383	1	Pull down and refresh.
0	1525694885	27	Yea maybe after we crossed 20k again. These last 20 (!!!) weeks were just zzZzZZz
1	1525701959	1	I'm the other way. When the price goes up, I'm bored.The price will probably drop and make me disappointed.When the price drops and altCoiners are freaking out, I harvest that fear as energy.
1	1525703538	1	??? 17k-6k-11k -6.4k-9.9k Bored you?
2	1525714459	1	Yeah. Same old
0	1525701360	4	Dogecoin is superior
0	1525705751	1	It's a proven fact the more you check the charts, the slower it drops. The only guaranteed way to make it go back up is to sell first.
0	1525705969	1	So in 2020 we'll finally have a new president, and either à billionaire eating his dick on national TV or I'll be a multimillionaire.Looking forward to it. 
1	1525707608	1	Trump is winning again. When's the last time we had a 1 term president?
2	1525707659	1	The last time we had a shitty enough president that he only lasted one term. 
0	1525693493	7	Bitcoin isnt even that special metals like copper have more volatility these days
0	1525699168	4	Yea! We're at like 60% of ATH!!! s/
0	1525704783	1	Money being boring is the goal IMO
0	1525707193	1	It gets easier the longer you hodl. I don't even think about it anymore
0	1525691695	3	Not true lately.All we are seeing dead cat bounce but still it will be worth watching if btc sustains level 10k+ and the way forward for now its very much sideways.
0	1525697774	2	Me with Altcoins :/
1	1525698400	-7	>shitcoinsftfy
2	1525698480	1	ftfy?
3	1525698927	1	fixed that for you: quoting someone while changing a "mistake" in the original post
3	1525698924	-1	Fixed that for you. 
0	1525699081	1	Ohh ok thanks but u didn’t fix anything :)
0	1525705009	1	I use this app on Mac which puts the price of Bitcoin and various other cryptos right in your menu bar, so all you have to do is quickly glance at the top of the screen then go back to work. No affiliation to this other than being a happy user. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coin\-tick\-crypto\-currency/id1141688067?mt=12&ct=sh
0	1525705189	1	Just get a smart watch then you can check the time and the current btc prices all at the same time quickly and easily 
1	1525706180	1	This.  Gotta love Android  complications.
2	1525707186	1	First off they work on iOS it's nothing android related second what complications exactly? Open App/Play Store, install watch face with btc ticker/prices (with a watchface you like), install, done
3	1525707251	1	That the mechanism I use on my watch man.  You do you, I do me.
4	1525707505	1	Seems we do same
0	1525706388	1	'Investing should be boring'. Right now, it's the total opposite for me.
0	1525707344	1	My Blockfolio is screaming at me. 
0	1525708434	1	Brilliant 😂
0	1525709820	1	Honestly Bitcoin, you’re so needy!! 
0	1525711362	1	The price is irrelevant, the use cases however...
0	1525712320	1	Sitting in my box, checking my stocks. Feels a lot like .com
0	1525695642	-1	Lol i havent bought anything since i got in in December. I thought oh boy looks like i should buy a lil bit ofnbitcoin this is going up. Bought 100$ at 9586. I kidnyou not 5 mins later it was 9380 or something like that. I am still down from my original investment all around. This blows big time i really hope i am not wrong to think none of this will matter come next year.....
1	1525697019	22	If you're already shaking from potentially losing a Benjamin you should either stop looking at prices or just sell it and forget it.Bitcoin - or any kind of investment - might not be for you.
2	1525698492	9	For real. My wife's friend couldn't handle even having just $20 "invested". It dropped to $15 in total and she panic sold. I just don't get it. 
3	1525701196	8	Because they don't actually have that money to invest and are just looking to get rich quick. The only way to do this safely is pretend the money is already gone.
4	1525707393	1	It doesn't matter how much you gamble with: NEVER INVEST MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.It's that simple really. If you can't afford to lose 20 bucks stay the hell away.
2	1525699106	-1	ive been down 5 gs for 3 months I think I can handle it. I was just venting.
3	1525707529	1	Hah, fair enough. Most of us here have been super bored with their portfolios. :D
1	1525697529	4	When in doubt, zoom out on the charts
2	1525699319	1	:)
1	1525698668	6	Bitcoin is financial freedom. Freedom from inflation. You're making the right decision. Heres the best thing you can do, spread your buys out across price points. It drops to $8k, buy some, it drops to $7k buy some, and so on. Eventually you will catch the bottom and you will be winning all the way up. Look at the people who bought at $1200 in 2013...the smart ones waited. Sure back then it probably felt like a lost cause, but we do have some history to go on. I haven't even touched on the technology or how LN is already easy to us or it's finite amount. Im still super bullish, even if we go to $4k.
2	1525699274	1	I mostly just buy and treat it as lost money, One this is for sure though I will NOT sell for less than I got in. This buy in particular really got me though. I am so bad at timing the market lol.
1	1525703762	1	You are emotionally invested in $100??  Sell now dude That is not even worth 5 minutes of anxiety.  
2	1525704059	1	I saw my 10000 dollar investment down to its current at 3.8k I think i will be fine............ just venting. 
3	1525704814	1	So your first post is a weird lie? huh, that's neat.
4	1525704927	1	what? I bought $100 worth of bitcoin since i bought in december. Do you know how to comprehend what you read?
5	1525705321	1	Um yeah I'm having trouble understanding where the 10k came from.  What your OP means to anyone that understands English is "I haven't bought since I made my first purchase in December.  I purchased $100 worth ofnbitcoin."> Lol i havent bought anything since i got in in December. I thought oh boy looks like i should buy a lil bit ofnbitcoin this is going up. Bought 100$ at 9586. I kidnyou not 5 mins later it was 9380 or something like that. I am still down from my original investment all around. This blows big time i really hope i am not wrong to think none of this will matter come next year..... 
6	1525712864	1	10k was first purchase in Dec............
