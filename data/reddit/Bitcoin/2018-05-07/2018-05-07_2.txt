0	1525643580	97	Great Guy. he's so good at explaining bitcoin that even a 6 year old would understand it. he makes bitcoin human, straightforward and real. he 's the real ambassador of bitcoin, an example to follow.

1	1525647183	10	> That man is now a millionaire =)....thanks to the lessons he learned from Andreas.
1	1525661382	3	I think everyone is missing the point here... https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2017/12/08/bitcoin-prices-anton-antonopoulos-rich
1	1525649803	2	Did he sell his bitcoins?
2	1525653558	5	from what i remember him saying somewhere is he uses bitcoin whenever he can..so hes a step beyond hodler,hes a true useri highly doubt he sold it for fiat lol,maybe little bits when he not no other choice
3	1525677781	5	>i highly doubt he sold it for fiat lol,maybe little bits when he not no other choiceAndreas has just recently become a bitcoin millionaire thanks to many donations. Andreas got in Bitcoin pretty early but he did in fact sell and did not hodl those early coins he acquired. He has spoken about it many times and has said he had a family and needed it to support them.

0	1525658001	3	Why do they look like cardboard cutouts? Especially the guy on the right. 
1	1525664704	7	You caught me, I'm actually made of cardboard.

0	1525661638	3	Hell yeah reppin the MO. 
0	1525652269	4	You know he tours the US too right? 😂
0	1525651133	2	Where in Panama and for what event? How many people were there? Was there a Spanish translator?
1	1525651491	4	It was the Panamchain Blockchain Conference in the City of Knowledge(about 15 minutes from downtown Panama City). There was a Spanish translator. Most of the other speakers spoke Spanish. Andreas actually apologized at the beginning for not being able to deliver the message in Spanish.Edit: I'm bad at judging crowds but maybe 200 people? 
2	1525652554	3	Thanks for the information. 
2	1525661688	2	I live very close to STL and nearly lost my shit thinking I’d had missed a visit from the legend himself.  Very cool man! 
0	1525657747	2	“We’ve gone to plaid!”
0	1525665271	2	You were lucky. He is holding a lethal dose of crytonium in the syringe in his right hand.
0	1525668192	2	Which guy is Andreas ?!? loll for real tho 
0	1525670604	2	Why do they both look like cardboard cut outs?
0	1525673563	2	Its because people like Andreas that I have no doubt about bitcoin.

0	1525648576	2	Username is not true. Not Rick Sanchez. 
0	1525647601	2	Andreas is a very eloquent speaker, but enough with the hagiography. Goosebumps?C'mon!
0	1525659963	1	the man himself!!
0	1525667929	1	Quick. Launch an ICO and post this photo in the whitepaper. 
0	1525669841	1	I wish I could be there.

0	1525649534	1	Where's MO?
1	1525650312	6	Missouri
0	1525704663	1	Goosebumps? Dude, it's fucking bitcoin. Find something worthwhile to get goosebumps about.
0	1525647772	-33	You traveled all that way to listen to that guy? And he gave you *goosebumps*?As an orator he is mediocre at best. And yet any time he opens his mouth you bitcoiners all \*swoon\* over him. It's so hilarious. :)You are all very mistaken if you think Andreas is going to help win over the general populace to bitcoins. Every non-bitcoiner who hears him just laughs.Seriously, this is pathetic.
1	1525649691	15	I think he's a great speaker, I came across him before I knew a lot about cryptocurrency and he made me want to learn more. I didn't know what to make of him for a minute because he's a weird dude, then he cracked a joke and I was sold on him as a speaker - he's good with crowds and he speaks \(or seems to speak\) honestly. > Every non\-bitcoiner who hears him just laughs. Well, I don't know about that. I don't consider myself a "bitcoiner", and I think Antonopoulos has helped a lot of newcomers understand the space a lot better, I don't really see what the issue is here.
1	1525649614	8	But currently you are being laughed at. 🤔Move along man, no one gives a rat's ass about your openion here. Shoo shoo
2	1525706513	1	I care about your openion a lot. 
2	1525656938	-6	The guy looks like a creepy pedo. Bad for bitcoin. 
1	1525685123	4	jealous much?

1	1525648509	-7	Religious fanatics will always need a God to worship. 
0	1525672864	0	Lets hope he does not turn out to be another BROCK PIERCE...BROCK PIERCE help create the EOS Token
0	1525668863	-1	The man is an ETH shill
0	1525659224	-1	It probably would of been easier just to see him in Chicago. 
1	1525662069	1	When ?!Edit - fml
