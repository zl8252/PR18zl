1	1525665570	8	Confirmed.
2	1525669478	7	Can't be Andreas , he was in Panama today.
0	1525666369	30	Bitcoin Satan! 
0	1525663607	41	Oh god lol, we have to get the producers make sure to call him Bitcoin Jesus in the show.
1	1525667433	9	I'm sure he's reading this
2	1525672037	5	Some say he is in the house right now.    Maybe check plate reflections...
3	1525683031	3	The real Bitcoin Jesus is with us all through the good and bad. When the FUD is heavy and plenty, Bitcoin Jesus is there holding us during those dips and when times are good he's there buying Lambos with us.
0	1525671336	7	When the joke gets too serious lol

The people at Blockstack are pro\-Bitcoin, and have plans to borrow from Bitcoin's security for applications of decentralized internet.See a podcast here with Patrick Slaney of Blockstack for details: [https://talesfromthecrypt.libsyn.com/tales\-from\-the\-crypt\-25\-patrick\-stanley](https://talesfromthecrypt.libsyn.com/tales-from-the-crypt-25-patrick-stanley)Played around with their decentralized version of Twitter...decentralized internet is becoming reality.
1	1525666004	11	I’m still amazed at the content generated from this sub. This has honestly been one of the few I check on a daily basis because of either news, information, or just plain slack-jawed fun. Keep us up folks!
1	1525691307	5	Is it like Mastodon?
1	1525668496	3	Thanks for that detail, cool shit
1	1525702008	1	>Fun fact: Blockstack is advising Silicon Valley on some technical details of decentralized internet.

1	1525669430	5	Fun fact indeed.  I've always been pretty impressed with how "in-the-know" Silicon Valley seems to be and wondered about who advises them.

3	1525701512	2	Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea are the Blockstack co-founders.. I guess there are multiple companies advising.
0	1525663574	14	Isn't Gilfoyle a satanist? 
1	1525669895	41	Only insomuch as it is a biblical metaphor for rebellion against tyranny. 
1	1525701005	2	Is that wrong?
0	1525670395	5	Gilfcoin!
1	1525679107	5	Granny, is that you?
0	1525684265	5	It's like I died and went to hell.
0	1525689043	4	He's always been my favorite character on that show
0	1525674225	3	Satan, not jesus.
0	1525681021	3	love this show and definitely love this scene! 
0	1525700095	3	ok what did I miss?
1	1525703182	1	In case anyone missed it, in last night's episode of HBO's Silicon Valley, the character Gilfoyle (my personal favorite) took a very pro-crypto stance and gave some good speeches on the subject.
0	1525685365	2	How good is his BJJ though?
0	1525692668	2	He has my vote. I shall write a book about him. It will contain methods for living your life. Wars will be fought over them. Follow along sheep. I will protect you.
0	1525694035	2	Fuck yea, the writers just fucking get it. Brilliant show.
0	1525694483	2	Bitcoin doesnt need a 'jesus'. Noone does .
0	1525697922	2	Is that guy from freaks and geeks? 
1	1525714120	1	Yeah.
0	1525672565	2	Roger Ver lost all credibility the day he claimed that Mt Gox wasn’t insolvent. 
0	1525680081	1	Moose?
0	1525687694	1	Long live Anton!!! poor fucker
0	1525691787	2	Actually in his power point presentation Gilfoyle [wrote this.](http://i.imgur.com/97ariGN.png) Which will only work with fees under a dollar cent, which are properties that Bitcoin-BTC only has when the blocks have enough free space. 
0	1525674492	1	Well at least he has a better looking than Roger ver
0	1525701420	1	Stop saying Roger Ver, it’s getting annoying. Downvoted
0	1525690778	0	Just because you need a haircut, doesn't make you Jesus.
0	1525665881	-7	Cringe.
0	1525667181	-6	dont you stupid get it??its  a decentralize coin, where GOD = DOG is not needed any moreFor this kind of people gold stand for GOD right now, but we need changes , so society developed a new technology to make changes ,not to repeat same mistake again n again.Take this chance as a opportunity ,otherwise this might be your last chance.  
1	1525681732	2	Tell that to Nouriel Roubini, the antiquated dinosaur. 
1	1525696021	2	Seriously guys! -6 pointsha ha ha!
