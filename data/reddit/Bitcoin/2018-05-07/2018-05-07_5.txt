1	1525710724	1	I think respect comes from someone being asked a question about a subject they know nothing about and making the decision to say "I'm not informed enough on the subject to give you my opinion, let me get back to you."
2	1525715584	1	You're right, it's definitely better for them to not have spoken in the first place but you have to respect the humility to be able to change a previous stance publicly
0	1525702227	1	Rich people care more about money and put their bet on the winning side.
1	1525704819	1	only what they can understand
1	1525708295	1	It's good that Bitcoin is the winning side
0	1525706473	1	>Jamie Dimon – CEO JPMorgan Chase>> After: “The blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that.”Yeah, the take-home message here sure is "Bitcoin is Cool"shm
1	1525709618	1	yeah, pure clickbait. someone says "digital assets in Fiat are great", and the other says "see, he likes Bitcoin!"
0	1525698796	3	What about Bill Gates? Doesn't he count as well, or do people who go the other way aren't listed?
1	1525705825	1	Why would expect people who made millions of USD in FIAT, to ever want a competitor with bitcoin. He is sitting pretty and wants us to remain peasants.
2	1525711177	1	He's also a raging authoritarian who hates freedom.
2	1525713976	1	No one ever sees themselves like that. To him, he helped bring people the software they needed and did what he had to to compete against Netscape/Apple/Linux. Now he's _sharing_ his _earnings_ with the poor.
3	1525714825	1	Just because he doesn't see himself like that, doesn't mean it's not true. The only reason he shares his earnings with the poor is because his PR was so poor in the 80s and 90s. People HATED bill gates it's a new thing to see him as some lib hero.
4	1525715642	1	If we agree about how he sees himself, then it would be out of character to want us to remain peasants.
1	1525699216	2	Did Bill trash Bitcoin as well ? 
2	1525699820	5	he once said it was amazing and now says its a tool for criminals more or less

4	1525700800	2	if there is a deep state, his comments definitely come off as someone the deep state "got to"he basically is pretending that there is no way for USD to be inferior to Bitcoin and therefore it couldn't possibly ever appreciate in value. Seems pretty obvious to me that Bill Gates saying positive things to bitcoin would only help it
5	1525701625	6	People of this rank not always can say what they think, but rather what is best for them at that moment in time. 
5	1525711019	1	> if there is a deep stateThere isn't. That's just a vague term that has no meaning. Before "deep state" it was all about the illuminati. Before that it was all about the freemason's.People love to invent boogeyman's to explain large-scale macro phenomenon. 
0	1525702574	1	 Grants ‘green light’ to his investment fund to start trading in Cryptocurrencies &amp; Bitcoin
1	1525712676	1	he called btc a bubble at start of year, it was a bubble, it popped, it went down to 6000, he starts investing.good trading decision imo, despite how much i think hes one of the lowest forms of human being ever to exist.
0	1525707263	1	404 from Mexico.
1	1525713501	1	404 from New York.  EDIT: More precisely, the domain name did not resolve.Maybe [this is a better link](https://99bitcoins.com/fiat-defectors/)?
0	1525708233	1	This isn’t a problem, all this shows is that these people have just had the eureka moment and finally understand how it works.Of course they will be highly embarrassed that the penny has only just dropped, but better late than never, welcome to the future of money.
0	1525709911	1	"This term is also applied, often pejoratively, to anyone who switches loyalty to another religion, sports team, political party, or other rival faction. In that sense, the defector is often considered a traitor by their original side."- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DefectionMaybe it would be best to be easy on Jamie, ... like put out a welcome mat. It'll make it an easier decision for those who are not far behind him.
0	1525710770	1	This one from CME is gold...>Before: “I really don’t see us going forward with a futures contract in the very near future.” >After: CME plans to launch Bitcoin futures by the end of 2017 [Source:](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/31/cme-plans-to-launch-bitcoin-futures-by-year-end.html)October 2017Reminds me of Jamie dimon calling Bitcoin a fraud which had real life Market implications, while his company was about to publish research that they had done probably over the last year into moving JP Morgan into the cryptocurrency trading Industry.Dude should be investigated for SEC violations.
0	1525709483	1	Bad researched clickbait! Downvoted!Jamie Dimon from  JPM didn't change his stance on Bitcoin. At least not from the quotes given.I stopped reading further from there on, as the first quote is already a misleading lie (because the quote has nothing to do with / to support the clickbait title.Jamie edorses digital fiat, and the article interprets this as endorsement of Bitcoin! How DUMB is that??!!
