0	1525735612	531	I’ve never snorted Coke with a rolled up bitcoin
1	1525740165	100	You can always print out a $100 dollars worth of BTC to a paper wallet so that you can try. Let me know how they compare! :-) 
2	1525742140	57	No no, you're supposed to print out a 100 BTC paper wallet and snort your coke through that.
3	1525746624	23	Pretty soon we'll have foldable LCD screens. So just take your phone out, open up your bitcoin wallet, punch in 100.16578 bitcoin, roll up your phone, snort coke. 
3	1525742479	16	I prefer to snort goldenseal through a 100 BTC paperwallet written in silver ink on gold leaf.
3	1525754131	5	I guess I’ll try it. Can I borrow yours?
3	1525768348	3	If $100 bills are fun coupons, then 100 BTC are fun code? Fun bits? Gotta snort dat B?
4	1525770550	5	Username 
5	1525788622	2	You can't rehearse that.
1	1525744481	11	This is the ultimate test of fungibility.
2	1525755218	3	> fungibilityshut up Gilfoyle
1	1525745619	7	Would you download a car?
1	1525742409	3	One day.. one day I hope you snort coke with a rolled up bitcoin. 
1	1525748150	2	Thanks for the million bitcoin idea.  Now where to find thin sturdy metal?
1	1525749109	2	Ha, made me almost spit out my beer.
1	1525756361	1	but you would if you could
1	1525757613	1	You should probably just put it on a glass with ice like a normal person ya fuck’n weirdo!
2	1525792040	1	Ha.ha. LOL!!
1	1525766776	1	You haven't really lived yet.
1	1525782885	1	Then you, sir/madam/non-binary equivalent, haven't lived!
1	1525788186	1	You've never partied until you snort coke with crypto
1	1525797600	1	Then you didn’t try hard enough. 
1	1525755555	0	+1
1	1525756613	0	but you can definitely buy coke with bitcoins 
0	1525731823	190	That's it. Shut it down. Ban this USD thingy.
1	1525733260	54	We must protect the children from tewwowists.
2	1525783059	7	The day the US Government starts secretly shipping pallettes of Bitcoin to countries we're not supposed to be supporting...Moon.
1	1525746354	16	I'm proposing a total and complete shutdown on US Currency until we can figure out what the hell is going on! Bad situation!
1	1525744929	6	We should trade in clams. They are much prettier. "Three clams for a cheeseburger!", I'd say.
2	1525776919	2	Holding usd is the same as harvesting fresh baby brains
1	1525760760	4	I don't know what USD is but if it can be used for drug paraphernalia, it's gotta be the devil himself.
1	1525776926	2	"This currency could be used more effectively for crime and corruption than any before it in history""B-b-but nobody's using it for that *now*, so everything will therefore be fine forever!"
1	1525779820	1	Thing is, we actually do want to have fiat cash around. Do you really want your every single transaction fully traceable?
0	1525739468	30	Brian Kelly talking about it here:https://twitter.com/CNBCFastMoney/status/993607620064882690
1	1525746018	7	"Eye\-koze" ffs Gates at least pronounce ICO properly and pretend like you know what you're saying.
2	1525787256	0	eh, that's how I pronounce it too
3	1525796647	1	Hey, at least you have something in common with Bill Gates: You're both wrong.
1	1525752419	3	Upvoted, this should be the top comment.
0	1525729450	79	One of the analysts also made a great point that BK, the pro-crypto “guy” on CNBC, has spent the last 5 years of his life dedicated to educating himself on crypto currency and blockchain. And that he “highly doubts” Buffet, Munger, or Gates have spent much time at all on the matter.This is a new era and a new generation will discover and adopt new technologies that will help create a new and better world. (i.e. crypto and blockchain)
1	1525729746	61	The way I see it right now, the fewer billionaires interested, the better.  I'm trying to accumulate and don't want them driving the prices up before us little people can build a reasonable stake.
2	1525732837	20	on the same page as you
2	1525751611	2	[deleted]
3	1525756025	15	That’s all relative man. You shouldn’t be basing your investment decisions off some random person on Reddit. You invest as much as you feel comfortable losing. That’s exactly the answer you’ll receive when asking this question.  
4	1525756184	1	[deleted]
5	1525756453	5	Hey worth a shot. No one will disclose what they hold though. You might as well paint a bullseye on your back. 
6	1525756786	-5	[deleted]
7	1525787785	4	[javascript equations](https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_940938_Nta1U.jpg)
7	1525777301	2	But if you knew that then why did you ask the question?
5	1525759624	2	I get the anonymity need of holdings and the desire to be quiet about what we all have, but I personally have a goal of one day owning a whole bitcoin, that means I’m 1:21,000,000 of the holdings, not to count all the lost BTC out there.  
3	1525766550	4	I'm putting 25% of what I consider disposable cash in each month. That's not a lot, because for me, disposable is what's left after paying all bills, rent, food, unavoidable costs, and setting money aside for a mortgage deposit. I'm also mining with 4 GPUs, and converting whatever altcoins I mine to btc. I don't like yo think in terms of the Bitcoin exchange rate, because that's only going to get worse from a buyer's perspective. I'm putting in everything I can safely put in. The longer it takes for the price to grow, the better I suppose for me, but that's selfish and I'd rather we had legitimate adoption even if it meant less overall for me
3	1525757687	2	Eleventy bajillion 
3	1525755107	-1	Lab grown stakes for sure. It's not reasonable, or sustainable, how we are currently managing livestock. Therefore these crypto e-stocks are sure to take over, though I'm sure someone will also try and give me a prime ribbing for making this comment.Edit: Pff, bunch-a kids. In my day we respected our elders.
4	1525761363	1	You can have a prime ribbing for spelling steaks the way you did!
2	1525753959	1	You should be worried the banks and billionaires aren’t snatching up your commodity. Historically not a good idea to go against smart money. 
3	1525785700	1	FWIW, There are lots of billionaires (just not these three) who are interested since early on and banks are even buying up exchanges now (such as the goldman sachs funded circle purchasing poloniex for $400million.) 
1	1525729757	6	Haha, yeah I watch CNBC a lot but I don't know everyone's name who pops in with a chart every once in a while. BK seems to really know what he is talking about and I am sure that Buffett and Munger have no clue what blockchain is...they are ancient. They didn't even buy Apple until fairly recently.Like he said, blockchain and cryptocurrency provide the ability to potentially decentralize the entire internet with the necessity of exchanging a token (or tokens) for services. Interesting times we live in.
2	1525747780	3	I feel a bit validated for owning Apple stock before Buffet. He may be the richest guy in the country, but WE know something he doesn't, or has not been properly educated on yet. He's going to be kicking himself in the butt. 
3	1525772691	5	He buys stuff he understands - it's not a stupid investment policy.
4	1525790014	2	Never said it was stupid, but if I was him, I'd be knocking on the door of one of the Qualified crypto millionaires at least for an explanation on blockchain tech.I feel as if someone could explain to him in depth the benefits of the technology, he'd at least be on board with Ether. 
3	1525762696	3	If he doesn't die before we figure out radical life extension.
1	1525745830	1	We need to hold the fort for Gen Z and Alpha
1	1525766337	1	Yeah, buffet may know plenty about the old ways, but crypto isn't just a startup company's stock, but that's how he seems to concepualise it.
1	1525777946	1	Or they are so stuck in their echo chamber they can't be objective 
1	1525782789	-1	\> Buffet, Munger, or Gates have spent much time at all on the matter.Microsoft employs hundreds of the world's leading experts on cryptography.  Microsoft employs hundreds of the world's leading experts on distributed computing, systems, and networks.  Microsoft has hundreds of the world's experts on different business systems, their applications, their strengths and weaknesses, etc.  Bill Gates doesn't have to spend 5 years of his life educating himself on crypto currency... he has at his disposal hundreds of experts to do that for him.  He then can sit back and look at the big picture and see if it makes sense to him.  The same thing is more or less true of Buffett and Munger.That doesn't necessarily  mean they are right, but it does mean the pro\-crypto "guy" who took 5 years to educate himself on crypto currency and block chain and thinks the same would apply to Gates and Buffett made a really stupid argument.  He also probably doesn't have the requisite background to have a useful opinion on crypto currency/blockchain if it took him 5 years of his life to learn about it.
2	1525783359	1	Well, you clearly did not fully comprehend what was said. Regardless, I’d say the pro-crypto “guy” is pretty credible.[Pro- crypto “guy”](https://www.cnbc.com/brian-kelly/) 
0	1525734872	46	Number of transactions involved in illegal activities for USD vs BTC? USD is higher, obviously, it’s has a much higher transaction count than BTC.However:Percentage of transactions involved in illegal activities for USD vs BTC? Likely BTC. BTC is great for illegal purchases online, USD isn’t.
1	1525738531	19	"likely btc"Lol don't even have to look at the numbers, obviously btc. 
2	1525745299	7	Yes, obviously btc, the coin with the immutable public record. Surely not one of those fancy prhvacy coins with an opaque block chain. This illicit activities surely want a record for all time!
3	1525761632	4	Its more a matter of fast and easily spent, not secret. Criminals are not that smart overall, I mean if they planned and thought out what they were doing, they could probably make more money doing ICO's than trading BTC for drugs or whatever, I mean, an ICO is like 50 % + profit, and you can do it multiple times, even.
3	1525745370	9	We're comparing Bitcoin to the USD, not to another crypto. 
4	1525766802	-1	How convenient
3	1525767135	-2	Oh shut up.
1	1525736294	12	Honestly, a few years ago I would agree with the sentiment. But I think most transactions on the network are likely trading and coming to / from exchanges. I imagine most darknet  transactions have moved to more anonymous coins. Of course knowing what the percentages are is a tough one
2	1525736814	10	Yes they have, most of the current dark web market dealers tend to ask for monero. 
2	1525739356	2	For sure, BTC has futures and chain analysis may start to be able to doxx wallet holders; xmr is the new dark net currency
1	1525739303	2	I came here just to point this out; thank you
0	1525739702	8	> He went on to discuss a decentralized internet on the blockchain which would inherently require a coin to function properly.Can anyone illustrate this better? How does a decentralized internet work, on a blockchain? Why would it require a coin to function? How can it function without the current internet?
1	1525750100	7	I'm presuming the coin is to encourage people to give their power to run the network. It wouldn't literally replace the internet, however it would act as a layer above it. People could upload websites to the network, and it would be replicated across thousands of computers each block.
2	1525758838	5	They are going to be some *very* big blocks.
3	1525776793	1	Sounds like a BCH project.
2	1525758846	3	That sounds awful. What's the advantage?
3	1525767262	3	Decentralisation..? 
4	1525784424	2	Again, what's the advantage? "Decentralization" isn't an answer, it's a word. 
5	1525784994	1	Are you not aware of the advantages of decentralisation? Sometimes it's not always an advantage, but it can be. 
6	1525787801	1	Can you explain how decentralization would improve anything in this scenario? I know what the phrase means, from a dictionary perspective but simply saying "decentralization" doesn't make me excited. You need to tell me why and how it would improve anything.Second, the problem is that certain websites and ideas are made illegal. The Chinese government would eventually figure out a way to detect this firewall blocking "decentralized" internet because your data has to go through an ISP, and if the ISP figures it out, then hey arrests for everyone!
3	1525784003	2	Don't need to host them on the blockchain itself. there are projects like substratum working on decentralizing the internet. They have a working prototype that enables an internet user in China to bypass the Great FireWall and access regular websites. Sites hosted on substratums decentralized network are not hosted on the blockchain, but it a separate database layer. The blockchain is to verify the integrity of that database; it actually allows for colocated hosting (forgot the proper English term). 
4	1525784475	2	And how would that solve the problem of the ISPs restricting the user access? Simply saying "they have a prototype" doesn't garner a whole lot of excitement until we see it in action. Show me a video of how this works in China first. Don't just describe that they claim it's working, show it.
1	1525761593	2	Micro payments. Imagine paying to use adobe photoshop where each mouse click sends 0.00001 IOTA to Adobe. Or where each retweet generates income for both you and Twitter. Every page of information is exchanged for a token worth a billionth of a penny. A new economy. 
2	1525763690	2	Yeah, it is a fascinating technical possibility; streaming money.But I've a deeply set suspicion of "user pays" systems. They oftentimes don't turn out as efficient as a "group buy" system.> Or where each retweet generates income for both you and Twitter.Off the top of my head imagine the spam. And not just on twitter : \Let's not jump at the conclusion that new technology is always for the best. I'm sure we can both list of a hundred or more technological advances that have set mankind on a dangerous or precarious course. Hell, your example of twitter is one of them (see: Trump).
1	1525771879	2	I assume he is referring to something similar to the Elastos project? 
0	1525736641	6	I agree that it is more usable than bitcoin 
1	1525789275	1	so far... 
0	1525740375	5	I would be interested in percentage wise which is used more for illicit activity. Obviously way more people use Dollars than Bitcoin so it would make sense it's used more for crime. I have a feeling percentage wise Bitcoin has been used more for illicit activities because lets be honest Bitcoin grew because of darknet markets. That's not a criticism of Bitcoin, any tool can be used for bad, some terrorists run people down with cars, doesn't mean we should ban cars. 
1	1525786171	2	probably 90%+ of transactions are people moving funds to and from exchanges imo. Sure BTC attracted a lot of hype forbuying weed and mdma off the internet from strangers, but now its almost exclusively a trading and investment thing. 
2	1525795945	1	Yeah totally agree with you there. I think that's partly because people have become more educated on the fact that Bitcoin is not anonymous. People have seen most darkweb markets go down so are less likely to trust them. There also aren't really any good options right now. Andof course crypto has seen a lot more adoption so most of the new people flooding in are buying and investing not buying weed. 
0	1525744399	5	Very few hookers, drug and weapons dealers take Bitcoin compared to Dollars.
1	1525798654	1	Tell me about it :(
0	1525751923	5	I bet more $100 bills were used to fund 9/11 than Bitcoins. Hell, probably even Bitcoin Cash too.
0	1525731163	18	Whoa you mean the most popular currency in the world is used more than a niche digital asset???Mind-blowing news.
1	1525733171	10	I heard there's drugs on almost every dollar note, you don't find drugs on Bitcoin. Case fucking closed.
2	1525733921	-6	Instead you can find child porn? Bitcoin has 0 fungibility so tainted coins will always be tainted.
3	1525735601	19	Show me on the doll where the bitcoin touched you
3	1525798526	1	This is hilariously inaccurate. Lordy.
0	1525736273	7	even TIDE DETERGENT has been used for illegal activity.  People were smuggling Tide because they knew it had value.  So many things can be used for illegal purposes.  I could use my steak knife for illegal purposes.  But I choose to use it to cut my steak (or to open one of those adult-proof packages you'll find some kids toys in.)
1	1525798588	1	People don't kill people?!? Guns do!
0	1525729628	5	He's right. For now.
1	1525733252	4	Let me know when someone figures out how to snort cocaine through a rolled up Bitcoin. 
2	1525734072	5	Paper wallets
3	1525745126	2	Print out the whitepaper.  The sacrilege.
3	1525745650	1	Can confirm. 
0	1525735195	2	So true..someone gave me a $5 bill yesterday that had obviously been in someone's bloody coke nose. I don't have to touch that nastiness with bitcoin. 
0	1525756275	2	Duh, that's because USD is used for everything far more than bitcoin. 
0	1525761550	2	"According to the Central Bank of Iraq, hundreds of small ISIS-linked exchange houses now operate in Baghdad. Such businesses allowed the group to convert their Iraqi dinars into American dollars — a currency that will have further reach across the globe."
0	1525734660	3	And what about the €500 bill?! That was surely made for some good.
1	1525739474	3	Larger bills, up to $10,000 and $100,000 in USD were generally used inter-bank; digitization of USD transfers removed that use case and then the bills were removed from circulation; though, given the serialization of USD bills, I would imagine that using them would be very hard if they existed, how much scrutiny do $100 bills receive
2	1525744405	3	You can’t use the $100,000 it was never legal tender. You be stupid as hell to use any league tender above $100, because it’s worth more than face value, but a bank would have to accept a real $10,000 bill. 
0	1525742063	1	https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/brdr5p
0	1525742892	1	Glad to know it's at least being said on tv.
0	1525744774	1	Duh, most criminals really low-level shitters 
0	1525748591	1	well duh..
0	1525749908	1	That's a *no shit* statement.
0	1525750349	1	There has been a strong argument for eliminating ir severly limiting the supply of $100 USD bills for a while now as it would make black markets much more difficult to sustain and most consumers don't require the $100 bill on a constant basis. Most done fine with the $50 or even the $20. However doubling or even quintupling the amount of space needed to transport millions of dollars would cause a much bigger headache for criminals.
0	1525750533	1	was it tone vays?
0	1525753265	1	Those don't look stacks of Bitcoin that they're seizing from the cartels.https://imgur.com/a/045ILjE
0	1525755480	1	Well duh...by adoption alone, cash /fiat will hold that for quite a while. Also Monero is the illicit activity crypto... I think lol
0	1525756673	1	Unfortunately this counter argument will be redundant if governments follow through an abolish cash in the future. Then it will be a comparison of their digital cash with ours!
0	1525760798	1	So what he's saying is there a still room to grow?
0	1525761437	1	There’s this whole concept that innovators of a past era are almost the worst people to ask for advice on the next wave on innovation. This is shown throughout history where a company specialising in a certain field, let’s say cart manufacturing during the horse and cart era, will almost never pivot to join the next wave of innovation for their industry, the automobile, and instead call it a bubble. A well known example of this is the blockbuster vs Netflix debacle, and it happens a lot more frequently than you’d expect. 
0	1525764066	1	I have spent so much USD on illicit substances but never ordered them to my house using bitcoin lmao.
0	1525764369	1	Does anyone have a link to this yet?
0	1525765802	1	Any link to the full video ?
0	1525768750	1	Of course Bitcoin is going to be used for illegal activity. Any form of currecny is. The question is not which currency is used more and which less but how can we stop people from using it illegally. If I want to buy an assassin to kill my ex girlfriend and I pay him in Bitcoin then that isn't Bitcoin's problem. The problem is that people are willing to do wetwork for money.To stop using new inventions because they could be used for illegal activity is just stupid.
1	1525791112	1	I think people unfairly compare visa and btc at least implicitly
0	1525774675	1	Heard somewhere that every single hundred dollar bill has traces of cocaine on it enough for a drug dog to sniff out 
0	1525776584	1	this is obvious without a random guy on cnbc saying it
0	1525777862	1	Stop trying to  compare btc with fiat. Is stupid . Btc will never replace fiat.
0	1525777906	1	Well goodluck
0	1525778602	1	I think it's misleading to say the dollar is used for more illicit activity than cryptocurrencies. Probably true in absolute numbers, but I'd bet Bitcoin fares worse if you look at the percentage of the currency relative to total circulation, that's used for illicit activity. Thus, when someone spends bitcoins, it's more likely to be in an illicit activity than when someone spends dollars, even if you only consider coins and bank notes. I'm guessing.
0	1525778611	1	I think it was William Gibson who called the USD$100 bill the "International Currency of Bad Shit."
0	1525779846	1	I mean, he's probably right. The concerns about BTC being used for crime is sorta silly when you spend 5 minutes thinking about it and realize that every drug dealer works with stacks of USD
0	1525781424	1	So he is saying that USD is more anonymous than Bitcoin?
1	1525789183	1	The blockchain is transparent...
0	1525781774	1	And it's true. 80% of circulating US cash is in 100 dollar bills. How often do you see a 100 dollar bill? The feds have admitted they don't "know" where most of them are. People sit on them and exchange them in deals that never go through or end up at a bank.
0	1525783146	1	How do I enter the market without owning anything?
0	1525783337	1	Obviously. 
0	1525785256	1	I read a stat while that 70% of US bills are held out of the US. 
0	1525786920	1	We knew that. Didn’t need some coat on CNBC to validate what we already know. That’s common sense and simple fact.
0	1525787622	1	I have heard that as well:http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_customer/2010/12/ban_the_benjamins.html
0	1525788926	1	Probably going to get down voted to hell but every person I know uses Bitcoin to launder and bet.So who knows about drugs, but it's incredibly easy to for anyone with minimal knowledge of Bitcoin/alt coin to launder other currencies.
0	1525789126	1	Duh...
0	1525789368	1	yes but is it comparing to the same scale? $100 bills have been around for much longer and are far more common/easy to use/widely accepted than bitcoin. go online and 90% malicious of payments are transacted via btc.
0	1525789395	1	It's true, there's a good Freakonomics Radio episode about "no-cash" economies and its super interesting but almost all crimes are committed using cash. 
0	1525790430	1	Both have no inherent value, so probably...
0	1525792578	1	Sure, and more criminal acts are committed with steak knives than with nuclear weapons.Doesn't change the fact that nuclear weapons need to be controlled a lot more strictly than steak knives.
0	1525794775	1	A rock is a solid aggregate of one or more minerals. Gold is not a rock, it's an element and a mineral. To classify as a mineral, there are a few criteria: Naturally occurring, inorganic solid, definite chemical compositionspecific atomic arrangement. Also, sounds like BK is referring to the public blockchain as an aggregate of multiple blockchains. I don't see how that makes any sense. I do see where he needs to be open to alt coins though, it allows him to do more stories by being open to many, as opposed to a proponent of one.

0	1525797341	1	 This is very interesting project! Crazy Estonians are making it happen. They got 4.5 score in ICObench. https://icobench.com/ico/zantepay Seems like a really promising project to invest in and get coins. Take a look!  
0	1525754172	1	Because people actually use USD.
0	1525760391	1	Also more legitimate activity than bitcoin. The better measure is what share of transactions conducted with each is illicit 
0	1525771955	1	He's right. But only because no one uses bitcoin as a currency.Though as a percentage, I expect the two primary uses of bitcoin are bigger idiot investing and drugs.
0	1525745192	0	Well, he is not wrong. I once heard that 80% of all cash in US dollars was in $100 denominations residing outside the US, if for no other purpose than to evade local taxation in whatever jurisdiction it was in. So that illegal right there.
0	1525749683	0	Btc will eventually get there. 
0	1525759136	0	I'm as pro bitcoin as the next guy but thats mainly due to the sheer number of bills. Percentage wise it probably looks worse. Currently bitcoin is used for dark net markets and as a speculative asset. Its important to be truthful here!
