0	1525781204	68	I was expecting actual rat poison returns
1	1525798897	1	Lmao me too 
0	1525775478	57	What was the return on baby brain?
1	1525790610	1	You're breakin' my balls. 
0	1525785200	49	Lol, something really weird happens to this sub above 9k.
1	1525799703	1	It's called delusion, mixed with trying to compensate for poor financial decisions with memes.
2	1525804564	1	Or it’s called “people having a laugh” and posting memes. No need to be a jerkoff
0	1525792333	1	I think people misunderstand risk. 
1	1525794502	1	It's not surprising Warren Buffett is skeptical of Bitcoin. He is a numbers guy. He doesn't invest in any companies that have not been profitable for 10 years running, and he makes a decision after carefully looking at the fundamentals of a company, including its profit margins, debt, competitive advantage. He is a smart investor. It's one thing to get lucky on any investment, it's another to consistently pick winners like Warren has for decades. It's not a secret. He is a safe investor, a patient investor. It has paid off for him. He wouldn't have become a billionaire by jumping on every bandwagon that comes along, even if that means he misses some great opportunities. He sticks to what works. So, just because you disagree with him, you cannot deny his credentials, and it should be obvious why he would dismiss crypto currencies in general. 
2	1525795125	1	being sceptical and calling it a rat poison are not the same attitudes
3	1525802963	1	If you can't or won't join them, beat them. In a sense.
2	1525800324	1	Except that’s now how he became a billionaire and not how he invests. That’s what he’ll tell you, yes, but have you tried actually looking at what he chooses, analyzing why he chose it, and seeing how things work out? Warren Buffet is a terrible investor with good connections.
1	1525796202	1	Or maybe they don't. The risk to reward ratio on bitcoin is very, very good.Some people have literally become billionaires. I don't think people realize how much a billion dollars really is.
1	1525799332	1	Agreed, if they understood they were all-in on crypto. 
1	1525794450	1	You don’t say. 
0	1525780670	203	Warren Buffet is right that Bitcoin is RAT Poison.The Banks are the RATS.
1	1525788649	27	I see you too have been on twitter
2	1525790596	1	The best comments are always in the comments to the comments. 
3	1525794691	1	The comments to the comments to the comments are also spot on here, have my upvote
4	1525801138	1	And some random comment gets gold. 
5	1525802087	1	Nice try, haha.
2	1525790153	2	Lol
2	1525791110	1	Nah, he probably was on this subreddit the past 200,000 times the joke was made this month.
3	1525793052	1	It's still funny every time
1	1525785326	16	ROFL you got it man
1	1525789521	2	I guess uncle warren got a bit old and out of date
1	1525791202	1	I don't really care about Warren's complains. But am dissapointed that Bill Gates is following in this rant.
2	1525792935	1	Yeah you would think Bill Gates would be on the crypto band wagon
1	1525793734	1	Where can i buy this RAT token? 
1	1525794253	1	Booom
1	1525796366	1	:(
1	1525801394	1	Rat Poison \^ 2, pls
0	1525793728	1	While I get what OP is saying, a graph like this isn't really informative. Berkshire Hathaway has been extremely successful in the *long term* which is the difficult part. Many companies can do very well in a given five-year period, but maintaining excellency over decades like Warren has is ridiculously rare. I think in the world of investing, especially for people without a lot of financial means, stable long-term returns is a much more important metric. 
1	1525794469	1	BH is in the business of preserving wealth. When WB was younger he searched for every way to get cheap leverage to get insane returns. Also he answers to his shareholders and BTC directly competes with a lot of his investments. Why would he encourage people to leave his business to get into BTC? 
2	1525798659	1	He has a long hsitory of moving his money into the areas which are going to pose competition to his existing businesses. That's why he's so succesful. You dont have a track record like Buffet if you try to hang on to sinking ships. Banks are not going anywhere, any time soon. The average person will not wish to be responsible for the security of their own money. And banks can trivially transition to holding crypto, if it becomes a real market. 
0	1525786098	66	2018 returns (you know, when 95% of this sub actually knew about Bitcoin)Berkshire:  0%Bitcoin:   -30%
1	1525798348	1	plenty of people making money in 2018
1	1525791408	1	5 year span is much more informative than a 5 month one.  I'm not sure if you thought you were being clever or just wanted to embarrass yourself.  
2	1525791564	1	No, who experiences those returns is what actually matters.  You live in a fantasy land if you thing the public gives 2 shits about what happened in 2013 in Bitcoin land.  Grow up and learn how the real world works.
3	1525791738	1	Just because you didn’t invest in bitcoin a while ago doesn’t mean we didn’t or that you couldn’t have.
4	1525798427	1	He was talking about the majority of this sub. There are 8x as many people here than there were in 2016. 16x as many since 2013. So, even assuming 100% of subs in 2013 were invested to any significant degree, only 6% of the users here saw these returns. Likely, only 50% or less were invested, and probably only 25% didnt sell at some point before it blew up. In which case, only 1% of the people here saw those returns. The vast majority have arrived since the december peak, so if they have invested, they have seen a loss. 
4	1525791854	1	My point flew so far over your head that it might rival SpaceX on a mission to Mars.
5	1525792237	1	Or alternatively, you’re so narcissistic that you don’t understand the counter point everyone else is trying to make, and assume you’re the one nobody understands.
6	1525794271	1	Jesus Christ, what is this with this “you don’t understand if you think that I am retarded” mentality? The counter point is fucking stupid. Want to calculate the returns you would get on the 10Y instead of Berkshire? Oh, well, I get the 10Y is an entirely pointless instrument and we have all just been massively retarded all this time until the Bitfinanciers came along. Get you head out of your ass already. 
7	1525799658	1	He went after me saying his point went over my head but it didn’t, I simply disagreed that bitcoin is a bad investment vs Berkshire.  And what is your point about the 10y for bitcoin vs the 10y of Berkshire?
6	1525793033	1	Lol everyone else? Dude let it go
7	1525793071	1	Everyone else who replied to him
8	1525793142	1	Literally just you and 1 other person. Maybe you're the narcissist 
9	1525793460	1	2 people arguing now (including you) that nobody has invested in bitcoin until 2018.  Me and the other person before you joined the convo that not everyone learned about bitcoin in 2018.  Plenty did well in bitcoin through the years and you know that’s true.  So I’m not sure why you’re trying to argue that he’s right.  That’s not dissimilar to saying nobody made money in tesla or any other stock until recently just because you didn’t notice it early it it recently flattened out, as bitcoin has done dozens of times in the last few years.  Zoom out beyond the last few months.Also you know what?  I don’t care if you guys continue to stay out of investing in crypto.  More returns for the rest of us.  I was through this same argument with my friends in 2013 when it dropped to 1k and they assumed that meant it was a failure.
3	1525795312	1	Doubling down on the embarrassing yourself one, gotcha.
0	1525795463	1	 Don't confuse returns with price performance. You're making the exact point Buffet, Gates, and Munger made. Equating A with B and B with C. These guys know what they're talking about. Dismiss their wisdom at your own risk/peril. 
0	1525780754	9	The nature of rat poison is that it tastes good to rats and makes them thirsty. Then, they dehydrate themselves to death.It’s a powerful quote, though I don’t agree.
1	1525788772	7	Rat Poison is an anticoagulant (aka warfarin). This causes the Rat to become severely anemic and they end up dying through internal hemorrhage. You're thinking of insecticide.
0	1525783268	11	Why did he say "rat poison"? Isn't rat poison something good because it kills an unwanted animal?I am vegan, but I am seeing the thing from his point of view.
1	1525784625	9	Not only that, but when humans take rat poison it’s usually in the form of Coumadin to avoid blood clots. Rat poison is great!
1	1525785160	9	Rat poison is something deadly, but attractive and sweet to rats. Thus, he's saying that bitcoin may look/taste good, but it will kill you (financially speaking).
2	1525788575	2	So, we are rats
3	1525794350	1	Congratulations on this epiphany. Yes, that is exactly what he meant. A+.
1	1525797320	1	Know how to spot a vegan? They'll tell you with in the first 30 seconds of meeting then. 
2	1525798111	1	I am not really vegan, just very low animal stuff eater
1	1525788269	0	Hidden message from an old dying guy...
0	1525794347	1	Well, it's comparing apples and oranges. Investing in BTC at the outset was at the time extremely risky. Investing in birkshire not so much. So of course the returns on the risky investment can be insane.
0	1525776862	8	Eh, let the old man ramble. South Korea has the right idea. [Korea and Buffet provide interesting contrast](https://thecryptocurrencyforums.com/korea-buffet-provide-bitcoin-contrast/) 
1	1525796063	1	Link is broken do you have an equivalent? Not the same article but the general point on another page
2	1525796338	1	Link is fine as of now
0	1525788999	6	Not to rain on everyones parade but the author of this tweet chose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. B. If you compare Berkshire Hathaway Inc. A there is no comparison. Just some perspective 
1	1525793767	1	Berkshire A return over the past 5 years - ~75%Berkshire B return over the past 5 years - ~72%Don't get wrong, this post is ridiculous because comparing the returns of two completely different asset classes is pointless (Berkshire isn't trying to get those ridiculous returns, they don't take on anything high risk enough to warrant it), but the A vs B return are pretty similar. 
2	1525798536	1	I think he important point, is that the liquidity in crypto is so low as to be useless to Berkshire. It's also ignoring that crypto is completely unregulated, and there is no easy or safe way for berkshire to trade it. 
3	1525798806	1	Bitcoin has relatively high liquidity, it has high volatility though if that's what you meant? 
0	1525790034	4	I’m sure someone said the same thing during the .com bubble,This doesn’t mean shit.
1	1525791974	1	I mean, Buffett did. And 95% of .com stock crashed to nothing.
0	1525778056	7	I guess we can now say that Berkshire Hathaway is worse than rat poison.
1	1525795561	1	What do you mean by "worse?" 
0	1525780099	2	Just never said who the rat was.
1	1525780645	-2	buffett himself is the rat we're poisoning 
0	1525791403	1	I wonder what the gains would be on literal rat poison 
0	1525803221	1	Other scams have had greater returns. Doesn't make it a good investment
0	1525782189	6	whenever BTC rises the FIAT people spread FUD just like warren did.free yourself from the bank overlords, struggle for the victory or live in your comfortable stall
0	1525790727	1	Yeah and BitConnect had 100000000% returns 2016->until it failed. I think Ran NeuNer did not understand Charlie Mungers point.
0	1525794714	1	Rat Poison ICO coming soon
0	1525795108	1	Rat poision "SQUARED" he said. Lmao.
0	1525797595	1	I’ll have one bowl of the rat poison please sir!
0	1525799089	1	Well, if you think about it, the banks are the rats in society, and Bitcoin is the poison that is slowly but surely eliminating them?
0	1525799278	1	Let me introduce you to [Zeek Rewards](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zeekrewards-founder-paul-burks-heads-to-trial-for-alleged-900m-scam-ponzi-scheme/) one of the largest Ponzi schemes in US history. It too, promised insane returns and people were reporting that (on paper) they were making returns of 50-75%. I personally talked to someone who sent his life savings (around 50k total I think) to Zeek, because he "made" 25% back on his initial investment of (I think 5kish) in an insanely short period of time (I think a month). He tried to get me in on it, saying "oh it's not a get rich quick scheme, it's a legitimate investment".Measuring an "investment" solely by "which one gives me insane returns" is not a good way to determine if an investment is a good idea or not. Simply having bigger percentage returns on investment does not mean it's a good investment. Ask the approximately 9000 Zeek Rewards members who "made money" on this Ponzi scheme versus the millions who lost their entire life savings. 
0	1525800097	1	I mean if I put 50% of my life savings in BRK in 2013 or even now. I would be able to sleep soundly at night.
1	1525801301	1	Sleep is the cousin of death
0	1525800734	1	"Rat poison" returns, and this time its **²**
0	1525801146	1	Yes ...rat human poison ...chemtrails ..look at the sky
0	1525801706	1	"Warren Buffett says bitcoin is 'rat poison'" ....A big old rat knows best about rat poison,  just saying....
0	1525802369	1	Berkshire is the rat 
0	1525803869	1	Surely Coca-Cola is closer to poison than anything. 
0	1525776993	-3	Buffet’s opinion doesn’t worth my dog’s shit. 
1	1525788597	4	isn't worth
2	1525793138	1	He isn’t know which contraction to use. 
0	1525788196	-6	just a bunch of greedy old corp american men...pissed off they missed the boat.The sad reality for them is they will need to buy their first BTC @ $100,000 in 2020 when their shareholders demand it.
1	1525791779	1	I don't think you understand how wall street works....
0	1525793111	1	In before Ratcoin
0	1525797317	1	[removed]
1	1525797626	1	Epic shilling bruv.
0	1525783450	-2	They just pissed because their scared about how big bitcoin is going to be and how big it already is. They wont invest in it because they don't know what it is, so they fear monger instead. 
1	1525785887	10	They won't invest in it cause it bombed from 20K to 9K in a month.Professional investors don't put money in things that volatile. The goal is to make steady gains otherwise they'd just buy slot machine tokens. 
2	1525804126	1	Different professional investors look for different characteristics for their investments.  Some seek illiquid and high-volatility investments because those markets are less efficient, and because they can often generate higher returns over time to compensate for the additional risk.Bitcoin could be (it's probably too early to say for sure) an asset that will tend to move with low or negative correlations to traditional asset classes.  Many professional investors like to own assets with low or negative correlations to their existing holdings since doing so can lower the risk of their overall portfolio.  As bonds and stocks have exhibited higher correlations with each other recently, managers are looking especially hard at assets that won't correlate with those two asset classes. I don't think professional investors, broadly speaking, are avoiding bitcoin because of volatility.  I think custody concerns and the imprecise nature of any valuation method are probably bigger concerns than the volatility, but a handful of professional investors are willing to dip their toes into the water.  As custody options improve, I suspect even more will do so.
2	1525786958	1	Its called a bubble the same thing happened with tech. And there are professional options and futures traders who trade things up to 400x leverage. That puts crypto volatility to shame.
3	1525787508	12	All the people here saying Warren Buffet is a prick have clearly never read the intelligent investor.It is literally the exact same points almost word for word. Guy absolutely fucking hates volatility and always has. He doesn't hate crypto, he hates the risk. 
4	1525797403	1	Lol the whole point of the intelligent investor is finding good value investments for 10+ year investing. Volatility doesn't matter over that long of a period. One of Buffet's biggest rules is to not invest in anything he doesn't understand. So until he takes a monetary position against bitcoin anything he says on the matter is FUD.
3	1525795069	1	>	professional options and futures traders who trade things up to 400x leverageThat’s a good one. I’ll add it to my book of funny quotes. 
0	1525792403	1	How can we expect Buffett to grab the concept of Bitcoin when he probably doesn't even use a computer and check his own email?
0	1525793696	1	sage advice from a man who makes a lot of money selling sugary drinks and candy  = human poison.
