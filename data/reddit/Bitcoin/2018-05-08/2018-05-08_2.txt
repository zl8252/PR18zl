0	1525736968	146	The fact that he didn't know that in the first place is a solid indication of how much he knows about the subject as a whole
1	1525740330	69	I'm surprised neither Bill nor Warren say "I don't know," and leave it at that. Bitcoin is a rabbit hole of rabbit holes and it's not just technical knowledge either. Frankly the more you know the less you know.
2	1525747670	18	But if you know that you know less then by gaining that knowledge are you really gaining knowledge because you lost knowledge by knowing more?
3	1525748907	16	I just gained knowledgeless from this comment.
4	1525751138	-1	Khaled
3	1525758726	5	Yes, you gain knowledge of how much you don't know.
3	1525752324	3	The origins of the Universe have now been explained..... Thank You !!
3	1525752276	2	I, no.
3	1525785968	1	It's not that you know less, it just feels that way because you begin to open more and more potential knowledge that you did not know was there, eventually at a rate that you can't process comfortably. Present you feels stupid and lost, but future you gains so much, that is of course only if present you is persistent."The fool who persists in his folly will become wise."
2	1525769296	2	> The more you ~~know~~ learn the less you know.FTFY.  Otherwise you'll vanish in a puff of logic.
3	1525792775	1	> vanish in a puff of logic.There is worse ways to go.
2	1525797462	1	> Frankly the more you know the less you knowThe more you get to know, the more you understand how little you actually know.
3	1525799777	1	It's a shame that such realizations can't be easily communicated to others.
1	1525746090	15	I hope I live long enough to watch Munger, Gates, and Buffet eat their words when they are forced to invest in crypto to preserve their wealth while fiat inflates to infinity.  
2	1525779975	6	None of these rich people have very much fiat currency (compared to their total wealth). Most of their wealth is in stocks, real estate and other assets. If Bitcoin (or any other crypto) at some point replaces fiat, then these things will still have value.The people that stand to lose the most from a fiat->crypto transition scenario are those with some savings, who keep most or all of their wealth in their local fiat currency.
3	1525787800	1	Or everyone who has a job based on pay in fiat.Need employers to auto pay to decentralized exchanges in the further.Still, crypto will become more attractive to use than fiat and everyone, including the rich, will have to transact in crypto.  Even rich people sell assets.
3	1525803754	1	Buffet had 90 Billion in cash last year not a total of everything but dang that would be a nice haircut.https://www.investmentu.com/article/detail/54917/cotw-warren-buffett-cash-reserves-midcap-stocks#.WvHqdS7wbRY
2	1525749249	11	How old are you??  You don’t have to live long enough, they have to!  lol
3	1525758001	-3	With their wealth, they will live much longer than the rest of us,  Health care sucks for the poor and middle class.
4	1525758690	9	Not everyone lives in the US
5	1525782602	1	I live in the u.s. And I find Health Care to be incredibly good and I would say that I am very middle-class in fact I live close to some of the best hospitals in the entire world.... Strangely enough people from all over the world fly here for Healthcare treatments so who has bad Health Care? Have you ever seen a hospital in in most of Europe? 
6	1525787885	4	Have you ever seen anyone without healthcare in Europe?
7	1525791948	1	Not sure, but I've seen filthy hospital rooms, shitty technology, massive lead times to see specialists and doctors, lines lines lines, sub-par healthcare providers, shortages of medical equipment and medicine, and emergency rooms that look like they're from the 40's with 15+ hour wait times  etc. I think its great that everyone ON PAPER as "Healthcare" but when the care itself is so garbage people with means still fly from across the world to go to Hospitals in Boston, Texas, California, Washington, etc. what does that tell you? And it's not just the patients, When the most qualified practitioners flee their home countries to work here, what does that tell you? I think we need to differentiate universal healthcare from quality healthcare. It's your classic quality of quantity argument.  While its cool that everyone "has healthcare," do they really have healthcare...really?  I mean if you want to just tell everyone they have healthcare sure, then lets do that.Plus, even those without private insurance/healthcare here; can get treated by the best medical institutions in the world via emergency services, medicaid, medicare, etc.I think its kind of bull shit the world snubs the USA on Healthcare when in reality if ya'll ever get REALLY REALLY sick; you're going to do anything you can to come here - and guess what you're odds of surviving the worst illnesses here in good 'ol USofA will be a lot higher than in Latvia, or Greece, Italy, etc. even the big countries Germany, France etc.  It's also why the Shieks all come to the USA for healthcare.  Its like the way we measure "good healthcare" is totally fubar; it's measured on how many people have it - now how good the quality of care actually is.  
5	1525766379	-11	California sucks I think because of the free health care we provide to all immigrants-illegal or not.  Citizens have to pay or lose their credit rating 
6	1525789224	1	Oh no not our slave ratings!
4	1525784277	2	Steve.Jobs.
4	1525786393	2	Most redditors are in their 20s.Munger, Gates, and Buffet are 94, 62, and 87 years old.
5	1525787430	1	Really?  So, all Reddit users expect to outlive all old people? 
6	1525789783	3	Are you really this dense or do you just like arguing on the internet?
4	1525764244	0	You must be new here, I don't know any poor person who just bought a few BTCs a few years ago (and they definately weren't rich at that time).Even at this point I know multiple people who are working their ass off 16 hours a day to get to 1 BTC (by buying BTC or mining alts), which is far enough money for anybody for healthcare.I just write these because I believe you will live far longer than those old guys. I have nothing against them, it's just the sad fact of life with our current healthcare technology.
2	1525755377	3	Do you honestly think that they're just leaving their savings in fiat?
3	1525757900	-4	If inflation is high in fiat, transactions will be costly.  Crypto by that time will be a smarter currency to use.  Hopefully 
4	1525765443	5	Whut.
5	1525766204	-5	Hmmm.  Didn’t think it was that complicated.  Buying and selling stocks requires fiat.  If the value of fiat is like it is in Venezuela, would you not look for alternative currency to trade in?  Never mind 
6	1525783913	3	Brokerage is a percentage of the transaction, it costs the same regardless of how high it's valued.
2	1525762303	3	Most of their wealth is not in fiat to begin with, the ultra rich were never victims of inflation, it's not them we are trying to give a choice.
2	1525775470	3	how is bitcoin going moon, different than fiat going to infinity?
3	1525787175	1	Bitcoin rise in price is done honestly via math and demand.  Fiat inflation is from central bank printing for gov spending and bank cheating.  Which would you rather be a part of?
4	1525792182	1	honestly. lol.
2	1525747417	9	Living until the heat death of the universe isn't possible, sorry. :(
3	1525758072	2	I can only hope and dream it will happen 
2	1525764318	0	I feel he might die soon, he's very old.
1	1525743628	8	I don't think it's a matter of just not knowing how to open an account to short. You can't short bitcoin properly since the markets that allow shorting are cash-settled. It allows for very easily manipulations since there's no actual deliverables. Here's a quick tweet on the subject:https://twitter.com/breenemachine/status/993586973590736896Don't get me wrong, I'm pro-BTC obv (why else would I be here). But let's not pretend the competition are just pure idiots. It's fine to disagree.
2	1525756495	3	It doesn’t matter if there’s a physical delivery or if it’s cash settled.In fact I would argue that unless you’re a producer and you need to actually buy or sell a commodity at a future date it’s actually less of a hassle to buy the cash settled futures contract. Even in that case, the hedger should be indifferent because the cash gains should offset the increasing (decreasing) cost of buying (selling) the commodity in the spot market.
2	1525795533	1	BTC can never be shorted 'properly' because it is a completely new asset class, neither Gates nor Buffett have understood, otherwise they would not make such comments. 'Proper' shorting works only with assets which exist as IOUs and actual transfer of ownership is very slow. We all know that BTC is very different. BTC is like a local, physical gold market in that respect. In a local, physical market you can short gold only, if you really posses it and you have to deliver ultimately. You can't sell gold on paper and then let the buyers wait days or weeks on delivery. Nor will the buyers just accept a hard to verify warehouse receipt.

3	1525747522	10	> It has a cap of 163 trillion, whereas gold is 7.8 trillionI think you're off by orders of magnitudes. Crypto's market cap is 163 billion. Gold is 7.8 trillion.
1	1525790179	2	What he's really showing is a combination of disinterest and fear. I think Bill and Warren both hope this thing just goes away. They know they're behind the curve and hope that doesn't bite them.
1	1525768299	2	“Knaaaaawledggge.”
1	1525751539	2	I am so sick of everyone taking advice from Bill Gates, as if he's an expert on everything in the world.  He's very, very smart when it comes to software and started Microsoft at a very advantageous time but that does not make him an expert on everything.He even admits himself that he's not a businessman.  His last job title before he quit Microsoft was Chief Software Architect.I mean, he made some really bad decisions before leaving Microsoft, which is a big reason why they are no longer an industry leader.
2	1525769389	2	His technological predictions aren't all that great, so I'd take his pronouncements even his supposed area of expertise with a pinch of salt.
2	1525760148	1	Isn’t every celebrity also an investment advisor to the plebs?
1	1525790397	1	true that
1	1525798248	1	Where can you actually short $1B of Bitcoin that is deliverable/sellable?
1	1525804364	1	Bill gates is at that stage where he thinks its just video game money that is just a fad. It was a "fad" for years. Still here and with over a 99% uptime.

0	1525743222	12	THE ULTIMATE SHORT SQUEEZE
0	1525745350	8	The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. -Keynes
0	1525742878	36	Lol, probably not a good idea to poke the bear whose net-worth is >50% of BTC's market cap.   
1	1525743340	32	Haha yeah he might sell all the Bitcoin he doesn’t own 
2	1525749213	13	If he put 20billion down on a short position, he could sell a ton of btc driving the price down instantly. Ballsy AF though.
3	1525751967	11	He would have to find lenders willing to go long 20billion in bitcoin first. 
3	1525760333	10	But it would probably crash other markets as he liquidates 20billion. Unless he has it all in cash, which I doubt. 
3	1525751194	8	I think even 1% of that would have an impact
3	1525773081	0	It's cash settled - it doesn't affect the price.
4	1525780434	6	Sure it does. If futures are priced significantly below spot, you'll have Bitcoin holders selling their coins and people opening shorts on spot markets (exchanges like Bitfinex, Kraken, etc...) while simultaneously going long on the futures. This arbitrage action drives down the spot price of Bitcoin.The only difference that the cash settlement makes compared to actual delivery of the underlying is that the arbitrageurs will have to buy their Bitcoin back on the spot markets. But as long as the futures price is below the spot price (after correcting for the time value of money and market fees), this arbitrage action will be profitable and will work to bring the two prices closer together.
3	1525778760	-1	Shorting is not selling. It’s just betting it will be lower in the future 
4	1525780691	7	Shorting is most definitely selling. You just don't have to own the asset you're selling as you borrow it from another party (for which you pay them a lending fee). Opening a short position on an exchange has the exact same market effect as doing a regular sell order on that same exchange.The main difference for the market is that a short position eventually has to be closed through a buy order of the same amount (or the borrower has to obtain the assets in some other way than buying on the market), whereas a "pure" sell order will not necessarily be followed up by a buy order at a later stage.
1	1525743362	-3	Wouldn't want him openly demonstrating what a sham the rigged monetary system is with his tax free "save the africans" fiat.
1	1525747138	-4	And most of it is in form of MSFT. MSFT would plummet like hell even if he liquidate 10% of his net worth. And they would mention it in shareholder meetings for a couple of quarters before liquidating that much.
2	1525747317	9	Wrong.  Estimated $14B is still in MSFT.  Majority of the rest is in his private investment firm.  I wonder what he could do with that much money in an investment firm.  Again, I get everyone things Bitcoin is the savior, but it can be squashed if the wrong people are against it.  Keep tapping the tank.If tomorrow he releases his own coin, spends $10B on partnerships and global acceptance... Crypto has won... Bitcoin has not.  
3	1525769507	0	Maybe. But the grassroots movement that spun up bitcoin is also what makes it strong. Is he gonna pay people to run nodes in a distributed matter? He's still a weak point then. Creating decentralization is in my belief impossible without it growing organically. If he can create an incentive to do that that doesn't involve him doing anything, then sure it could happen
4	1525786783	2	Or, you know, use that money I just referenced to literally create an incentive program.  Come on... what are you even arguing?
5	1525794542	1	If he stands for the incentive, then he's the weak link that a robust system cant have. What if he stops? What if someone forces him to stop? He dies? What if he changes his mind?
6	1525794670	1	Every company uses incentives to drive business until natural adoption takes place.  Also, company's don't cease to exist when someone dies... Apple seems to be okay after Jobs died.  
7	1525794880	1	What if he changes his mind and only incentiveses full nodes that follow the rules he prefer?
8	1525795088	1	What if he uses an entirely different protocol?  Voting rules?  You're questioning a hypothetical coin.  I'm just saying, if he wanted to make it hell for Bitcoin, or any other coin for that matter, he definitely could.
9	1525796511	1	He could for sure. Some very rich people are throwing money at it atm, certain things can't be bought though
4	1525770790	1	People are fickle - I'll wager that the vast majority of miners are only in it for the money and not because they really care about crypto. 
5	1525778580	2	Yes ofcourse. But nodes aren't
0	1525748621	18	Just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should. And keep in mind, people aren't rational. Look at Bill Ackman shorting Herbalife. A proven pyramid scheme, yet a sucker is born every day, so someone will always buy into it.Waits patiently for years, and finally calls it quits, once he realizes that fools will continue to buy. Perhaps a similar situation here?Furthermore, very few people truly understand how crypto currencies or blockchain work. There are plenty of script kiddie on the internet, but how many could whiteboard the hour long session it would take to illustrate in detail how it all comes together?
1	1525763723	14	In other words markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. 
1	1525757307	5	Herbalife is a little different and more sustainable than traditional pyramids, because HL profits even when the pyramids below it crumble. Its not the company or shareholders that suffer, its the individuals "resellers". IMO that is what ackerman missed. Im still amazed the stock price keeps going up though.
2	1525782436	3	Very good point, I agree
1	1525788758	1	But he said he would if he could 
1	1525792764	1	I didn’t know he liquidated that short.  Holy shit they were like $1B balls deep into that 
2	1525801735	1	Yup, crazy right?[Here's a piece from Reuters on it.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pershing-square-utc-stake/ackman-ends-public-battle-with-herbalife-takes-stake-in-united-technologies-idUSKCN1GC2N0) > "Rather than fall, Herbalife stock has risen since Ackman began shorting it. Pershing Square’s total loss was unknown. The stock on Wednesday traded as high as $95.88 a share, up from about $45 in 2012 when Ackman began his campaign. "
1	1525776103	1	Just because you probably didn't click through - this was in response to an article quoting Gates saying "I would short Bitcoin if I could". Tyler just told him that he actually can.
0	1525750138	4	CBOE isn't deliverable and there is barely any volume for someone like Bill Gates.Let him *actually* sell BTC short on an exchange and watch the price plummet from a $1B market sell order.
0	1525751100	5	An explanation as to maybe why these super smart dudes say dumb things.By the man himself - "I think many of the intellectually honest people eventually stop being critics, because they suddenly realize that the flaws they are identifying are temporary features, issues, and not inherent problems. There are very few inherent problems in a dynamically evolving design or ecosystem of different designs all competing, that cannot be resolved.  There are critics who criticize this technology primarily based on their world view.   It is politically inconsistent with their world view.  It’s not that they do not like the technology it’s that they do not like the implications of this technology and the primary criticism you get then is “this should not be” to which all I can answer is ..and yet it is.  “but we mustn’t”… and yet we did, “but you shouldn’t”.. but yet we did"- Andreas Antonopoulos.
0	1525766893	3	Does anyone else struggle to read posts from Twitter?
0	1525746255	6	Interesting to see Bill's thinking chop and change over the last few years:Here's [Nathaniel Popper's account](https://chhaylinlim.wordpress.com/2017/01/26/how-bill-gates-was-attracted-to-bitcoin/) of the day Wences Casares (of Xapo) met Bill at the Allen & Co. conference, where Wences was given one of the speaking slots before Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett took the stage. >"You are spending billions to make poor people poorer" Wences said "...to me it feels like you are trying to get the whole world connected with something like Compuserve when everyone already has access to TCP/IP.">Apparently Bill responded with "You know what? I told the foundation not to touch Bitcoin and that may have been a mistake... We are going to call you."Not long after that, the Bill and Melinda foundation announced [pushing bitcoin promotion in Kenya via Bitsoko](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bill-melinda-gates-foundation-promotes-bitcoin-in-kenya), which they gave a $100,000 grant to.Xapo and Wences were of course major supporters of the B2X NYA 'agreement' last year which would have seen the interests of big business in this space brute forcing the consensus rules put in place to protect the network from such attacks.
0	1525745340	3	Or @CMEGroup of course!
0	1525745239	8	Bill is one guy that could truly mess with this industry and bitcoin if he wanted.....
1	1525748267	2	sure he could "mess" with it. but unlike many people think for whatever reason you can only short as much as  available to short. and every single short comes back in the market as some point. These massive pricejumps up in 3 minutes are only happening because of that effect.TLDR: Shorting can't kill any market. It is limited and only has temporary effect.If you think there is something wrong with what I said plz elaborate. 
2	1525753297	9	Bingo. If he massively shorted it, and crashed it to 200$ for example, I would be buying as much as I can. Because when he closed that short, it would jump right back up. Sure, It might lose 50&#37; of its cap after the jump, but you could still make a killing off of a long post a massive short.
2	1525755437	1	He could buy every bitcoin on the market.
3	1525760390	5	No. He couldn’t. 
4	1525765394	1	He couldn't do it with cash, but if you think that Gates can't amass an astonishing amount of capital very quickly, you are wrong.
5	1525790069	1	>astonishing amount of capitalI think you guys are talking about different levels of astonishment.
3	1525757507	3	not even close. You don't know how markets move. He could however buy every coin on the exchanges pump the market for day and lose tons of money. 
4	1525765585	0	>He could however buy every coin on the exchanges That's what the market is. If you don't have a sell/buy order at an exchange, you aren't on the market.
5	1525767026	3	ye so he is pumping the price for a day by clearing the orderbooks. Giving other people good opportunities to sell and losing Billions in the process.  If his goal is making crypto people rich ye that would be an option. 
3	1525757314	8	No he can't, people need to be willing to sell.
4	1525765634	4	If you don't have a buy/sell order, you aren:'t on the market.
5	1525782009	5	make it 200k a bitcoin and you'll see how many of us pop on the market. He can't buy every bitcoin on the market because they don't all exist on the market.
3	1525755976	1	Not true, because as he would, he would drive up the price!
4	1525758493	3	people really don't understand that a whale can't just move in and out of market like a normal guy.Bill gates has a networt from 91.5 Billion but guess what 95&#37; is in other stocks and the same way he can't just buy 91 billion worth of Bitcoin he can't just sell all his share in other companies in a day.On every exchange is only so much available at any given time.So before he even goes into crypto he would crash the other stocks were he has big &#37; in. If he wants to leave very quickly.after he has done that he pushes BTC like crazy everyone who wants to sell that day can. Not sure how that is "messing with BTC" . That is investing in BTC and pushing the price I can think of worse things.
5	1525765723	1	>Bill gates has a networt from 91.5 Billion but guess what 95% is in other stocks and the same way he can't just buy 91 billion worth of Bitcoin he can't just sell all his share in other companies in a day.Margin lending is a thing.
6	1525766538	1	So ye then 10000 other people can also "mess with bitcoin" whatever that means.
4	1525765681	2	And he could keep buying.
5	1525769748	2	And once he spent all his money buying online tokens that no longer (since he owns them all) are worth anything, what then? He won?
0	1525762996	2	They can short all they want, can't prevent the future!
0	1525758512	2	I don't know why people listen to either party. Neither Bill Gates nor Winklevoss are securities/stock experts. Both are speaking outside their field of study. It's like when you have Neil DeGrasse Tyson talking politics or about the economy. The dude has a degree in astrophysics, that doesn't make him an expert in anything else. The guy isn't even a great astrophysicist - he's published next to nothing since leaving college (scientific studies/research, I'm not talking about his pop-sci dick & jane books). His peers have published much, *much* more than him. He's great at popularizing science but beyond that, he's a disappointment. 
0	1525783672	2	Gates is just throwing FUD to protect his dollar\-based assets, or to buy BTC on the cheap.He's already professed his love for Bitcoin, so he definitely knows what's up.He may be a liar, but we all know he's not stupid.A commie SJW could see through this ploy.
1	1525790592	1	If commie SJWs could see through transparent ploys like this one, we wouldn't be in half the trouble we're currently in!
0	1525751452	1	Why would he waste his time on any kind of finance I’m sure he has people that do that for him.
0	1525758159	1	You can also short/long at [Magnr.com](https://Magnr.com) and even up to 10:1 leverage.
1	1525773163	1	On a non-regulated exchange.
0	1525787687	1	Bill Gates to Tyler Winklevoss: Whats your net worth?....I'll flip you for it
0	1525789214	1	I would prefer he short actual Bitcoin and have to buy in Actual Bitcoin,
0	1525790595	1	Gates, Munger, and Buffett should put their wallet where their mouths are.
0	1525795613	1	Bill is smart enough to talk trash and accumulate but not dumb enough to short
0	1525797682	1	I thought gates was a supporter of bitcoin. No?
0	1525748177	1	The Winklevii have impressed me with their understanding of money and their ability to correctly see the value and IMO certainty that was Bitcoin's rise. 
1	1525750570	3	> ~~correctly~~ subjectively see the value
2	1525790206	1	Disagree.  It's an objective and quantifiable measure 
2	1525753717	-4	Aspects of Bitcoin's superiority aren't subjective.
3	1525754040	1	Says you. Thanks for your opinion.
1	1525751527	1	Good thing they saw the folly that was their ETF and opened an exchange. 
0	1525745610	-1	I'm sure Gates is aware there are instruments out there that let you short BTC. He probably felt pressured to come out and denounce it in public as a form of virtue signaling to other 'progressives' in the tech/investing bubble.Bill Gates is, and has always been, an asshole. No surprise there.With that said, the Winlevii aren't that great either. A duo of moneyed statists.
1	1525751683	2	and then theres you, virtue signaling to us with your anti bill/msft rhetoric.you are pathetic.
2	1525789078	1	I take it you're a Winklevii fanboy, right? Or are you just a MSFT apologist? Doesn't surprise me w/ a username like yours. .gov lapdog.
1	1525801574	1	> Bill Gates is, and has always been, an asshole.Go on...
0	1525747173	0	Bill Gates did not just intentionally make himself look like a dumbass, he's gotta be up to something imo. And awesome for Winklevoss to post that. badass
0	1525752384	0	Oh shit. Bill Gates just got told. 
1	1525798443	1	I don't see them offering to let him sell short their clients BTC on Gemini...
0	1525759643	-1	All of these NO coiners have a lot of MOUTH, but we see very little substance in their arguments.And the likes of gates are the worst, as tech has enriched their lives so greatly they should be behind other technologies.Maybe gates has got old man syndrome now and his party is coming to an end.
0	1525753869	-1	Bill Gates. Don't be evil. Microsoft just put the recycle old computer dealer to the federal prison for 15 months and $50,000 fine with the felony charges for the rest of his life. Bill Gates and Microsoft put ten thousands or hundred thousands of American people to the federal prison with his copyright infringement laws. You go to China and enforce your crappy copyright with the Chinese government.
