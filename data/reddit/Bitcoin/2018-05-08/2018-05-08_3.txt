1	1525745138	21	Bitcoin's design addresses many complex problems. Having to work for a living is not one of them.
2	1525798722	1	Tell that to somebody who bought $1000 worth in 2012.
1	1525751706	9	Even sound investments might lead to losses. Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.
2	1525796386	1	Or politicians become irrational and bail out inefficient businesses which made bad business decisions. Even if you invested in good businesses you will lose because the bad business gets an advantage. The irrationality of the government is the biggest threat to investors unless you are in bed with them.
2	1525755790	1	One of the few times I’ll agree with Keynes.
1	1525752811	12	If I invest in Doge I can never lose money as one Doge always equals one Doge.
0	1525738410	60	Yes, I disagree with Warren on Bitcoin.That said - please do not discount the cautious, risk-averse value investment teachings of Benjamin Graham, David Dodd, and Warren Buffett.
1	1525754022	17	you sound like a guy with a book recommendation... 
2	1525755267	4	Graham - the intelligent investor 
2	1525778043	2	Apart from intelligent investor I highly recommend reading buffet's annual reports for berkshire and margin of safety by seth klarman (you will need to download this one, you won't find it anywhere)
2	1525754854	2	I am! I'll keep quiet about it, though. XD
2	1525794931	1	Not the PP, but I highly recommend A random walk down Wall Street, Black Swan, Fooled by Randomness , and Predictably Irrational (for some more human psychology stuff)You will start to see that things like bitcoin , though seemingly revolutionary in the moment could be the greatest thing since sliced Jesus , or it could just be a flash in the pan. I say this as a massive massive crypto fan .After you read those books you’ll start to see why it makes sense to only speculate with 5-10% of your net worth.  Five on the safe side and 10+ if you are young and/or are very risk tolerant and have a steady 6-figure plus income So many people have their life savings into crypto or gold or silver and it gives me fucking anxiety You aren’t a Luddite if you mix in vanguard s&p 500 and total bond market index funds.  Maybe a little real estate if you have some home repair skills and local knowledge It’s just smart thinking.  No one is going to listen to me though because FOMO and get rich quick sentiments are the strongest influencers that humans have ever experienced as a species so whatever I’ll keep preaching in the meantime 
3	1525796233	1	it's almost meme status at this point, but the more i learn about crypto the more i become convinced it does threaten the "status quo" of Bank and government declaration of what has/is value, as well as the services those two entities provide. but hey, it's r/bitcoin so i guess you have to take the opinions here with a grain of salt.thanks for the book recommendations! those look good.
4	1525799556	1	In my opinion It definitely threatens the status quo but not in the way that most people in the community think so.I feel like bitcoin as a payment processor is like the worst fucking idea ever.  Everyone compares it to visa but imagine if you had to locally store every single visa transaction in the world.  That’s dumb and horribly inefficient.The revolutionary thing that BTC did that is disrupting the world is it offered a tradable currency for oppressed and underserved people like: drug dealers, prostitutes, gamblers, citizens of dictatorships, etc etc which is a HUGE marketI remember hearing a planet money episode where they talked about the market cap of the hidden dark economy to be in the trillions of dollars 
1	1525755725	43	Buffett broke his own rule talking about BTC. He spoke outside his circle of competence. He’s not exactly a tech-savvy guy after all.Edit: a word
2	1525757018	7	Agreed.
2	1525789131	6	I'm pretty sure he's 99% more competent than anyone in this sub between the "i inv3st, i am sm3rt, need to g3t r1ch!" and "my friends told me bitcoin is the shit!". Not sure if he ever included Meme's and halfwit Quotes into his strategy as an investor but i might be wrong.
3	1525789646	1	He’s brilliant in general, but he’s still human and therefore fallible. He’s also not an expert on all sectors by his own admission.
4	1525799047	1	He's not brilliant. He's a salesman who sold a bunch of shares in his glorified mutual fund to his daddy's rich buddies back in the day and gave himself a bunch of shares for free. Berkshire Hathaway has a worse performance record than almost any run-of-the-mill mutual fund out there. He's all hat, no cowboy. Which is great for a con man or salesman, but it's not brilliance.
3	1525798643	1	When it comes to gold and Bitcoin Buffett is retarded.
3	1525804124	1	Everyone I've met is an idiot in one area of expertise or more, and I agree Warren B is not my go-to guy for anything crypto.
2	1525770009	2	he is not, but probably can afford the most savvy tech financial analysts in the world to guide him.
3	1525788765	1	and if you're completely ignorant to the subject, you wouldn't know how to find one. 
3	1525789468	1	No, Buffett and Munger do their own analysis. That’s the core of their jobs at Berkshire: conduct analysis and choose investments.
3	1525777924	0	and those guys don't always know what they're talking about,more often than not they are just parasites sucking on whoever they can.
4	1525781751	4	Right, we redditors know what we‘re talking about tho!
5	1525784185	0	Not always but compared to most government officials and all sorts of “advisors” I wouldn’t be surprised if some people from reddit or wherever would sometimes be closer to the truth...
6	1525791251	1	> most government officials and all sorts of “advisors” I can agree with this statement applying to politicians and gov't officials. But Buffet is a free market titan. He has to be good to get to where he is right now; the free market is not a cake walk. It's far different from just convincing some rubes to vote you into office.
7	1525791862	1	I doubt he has the mental capacity to understand something as technical as cryptocurrency. Not saying he is stupid, he definitely is not, but he does have a respectable age. Maybe the guy bathes in newborn blood on a daily basis or something. Because my grandma can't even figure out how to use the TV remote control at the same age.
4	1525784238	2	True he should have just read this fanatic subreddit ;) super unbiased.
2	1525782674	1	yes but he bought 75 million more apple shares in the past days
3	1525789252	1	Wheres the source for this? Im interested in reading about it. 
4	1525789682	1	here mate: [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/03/buffetts\-berkshire\-hathaway\-bought\-stunning\-75\-million\-apple\-shares\-in\-first\-quarter.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/03/buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-bought-stunning-75-million-apple-shares-in-first-quarter.html)
3	1525799187	1	He was at least ten years late to the Apple party. He bought in 2016. If he had bought in 2006 or 2002, I'd say he's visionary, and he and his shareholders would be a lot richer. But he didn't, I don't, and they aren't.
1	1525758364	2	Certainly not, particularly if you consider yourself a prospective investor (like I'm sure many of us do). I've read a fair bit of or about said people. Their philosophies are counter-intuitive to the very nature of Bitcoin, so it's not a surprise someone like Buffet so readily rejects it. That being said, I think a few projects would fit their perspective. Bitcoin is not one of them. 
2	1525759223	3	Absolutely agreed. Their approach would be far better suited to analyzing a financial services company that provides consulting, management, etc to the Bitcoin retail market.One of the big lessons they espouse is that of rational, reasonable management.Domino's Pizza DPZ is an interesting thing to analyze these days... After they took out around a billion in debt to fund share buybacks in the past few years. LOLI wonder how they, and many other heavily-leveraged companies, are going to maintain their debt covenants / interest coverage ratios when the Fed hits their rate target?..The conclusion I've come to is a lot of these companies are not intent on ever paying it back. They are just carrying it forward for the past few years, and I suspect will bail on it when it becomes unsustainable.
3	1525800039	1	Ding ding ding! We have a winna!  Give that poster a ceegar!Almost every company has been borrowing money for share buybacks over the past ten years, including companies like Apple. As interest rates rise, the exact same thing as happened with the mortgage market in 2008 will happen, but this time it will be companies unable to meet their debt obligations. The next crisis will make 2008 look tiny, and Bitcoin will prove itself at that time.
0	1525748450	12	This sub cracks me up.
1	1525749490	4	2 richest and smartest guys in the world tell the truth and everybody gets upset. Blather On about the tech but don’t listen to what the man said. Wonder if they’ll wake up when he’s proven right?  
2	1525756938	8	He also said Google and Amazon was not a good investment when they first started. He only invests in proven money such as the textile business that he got rich off of. He does not invest in new innovation. You can't take his advice on new technology or Companies.
3	1525771794	3	He’s also avoided massive losses from bubbles. You act like tech investing is a new thing. It’s just that older tech has matured so you don’t recognize the trend anymore. Aerospace, solid state electronics, chemicals, timesharing computers,  dot coms all went through hype, booms, and busts. Amazon and google are examples of survivorship bias. At the time they started they were NOT good investments. It only became obvious after they survived and dominated. 
4	1525772872	0	Uh no? He has lost tons of money in the market dude. He just got lucky with the one big winner that overshadowed those loses. Most of his investment money didn't come until later in life. He was getting paid a lot from his regular job already. That is the one thing that allowed him to keep his money long term in the investments. That is the biggest difference between him and other people. When you have big money, it's easy to hold.
5	1525773711	4	Who had one big winner?  Buffet?  Are you nuts? Buffet started buying stocks when he was 11 years old.  Not sure about Munger. Did he have some losses? Of course, that’s how you learn to stay away from scams like bitcoin. If your talking about Bill Gates maybe.  But even then not sure what losses your talking about? Early on his main payment was stock. So he was doubling down on MS which was quite a bit of risk taking . In the early years he was taking only 250K for a salary. Not Millions like most CEOs today.  The balance of his pay was company stock. 
6	1525774407	-1	Dude 250k is a lot especially for his time. He got to be millionaire in late 30s. Most of it from working lol. He became a billionaire from stocks. The point is these old money guys openly admit they are terrible at investing in Tech industries. So why are they opening their big mouths here? Protecting their old paper money duh. Bitcoin is a threat to their investments in Banks now and their own money.
7	1525779045	5	Ok. Stay deluded my friend. I heard the same crap before the dot com bust. And 30 years later history repeats itself. I just hope your not all in. You’ll lose your shirt. 
7	1525782414	3	I still don’t understand how bitcoin is a “Threat” to banks.  As far as I’m aware bitcoin does not earn any interest.  And I don’t believe anyone is lending bitcoin to buy houses cars etc.  Maybe as a payment system as opposed to debit/credit cards. But those fees are a fraction of earnings. Banks don’t profit by holding money in a vault. They “borrow” from depositors and earn from the float between what they pay and income from loans.  If bitcoin replaces US$ or € then banks will just modify systems to support that. Instead of buying a car for 30K US. They just loan you 5 bitcoin and still charge interest.  Such a childish comment.  All you are doing is changing who’s names is on the fees you pay for a transaction. Anyway you also forget that Bill Gates at least recognized several changes in tech and rose to meet them. GUI’s - Windows after crushing the market with DOS. Apple copied from Xerox first but was beat so badly by MS a cash influx from MS is the only thing that kept them going. Jobs owes his place in history partly to Bill Gates. Networking - when companies started networking PCs and servers he came out with Windows server and that ecosystemKilled Novell and a bunch of other network companies that had 90% penetration. Internet - originally windows has no IP stack. He realized and corrected. Pivoted development to the internet. Browser - IE wasn’t on Windows originally. Netscape (now Mozilla/Firefox) had 90% of the market. He fought that back and won for years. Cloud - kind of after him but MS is kicking butt in cloud deployments. So while I don’t like Bill Gates or his business practices, he recognizes game changing moves in technology and combats them.  He’s a smart guy and it’s pretty stupid to discount him. 
7	1525792133	1	no he did not become a billionaire from stocks...he became a billionaire from buying an insurance company and then buying businesses with the money generated from the insurance company. 
3	1525762139	2	Are proven investments still relevant today? What industries aren't either being, or about to be, shaken up by new technology?I don't know much about investing (trying to learn) but I get the impression that this approach might be outdated.
4	1525764443	3	Well proven investments to him would be something like a shoe company. Everyone has, still, and will need shoes for a while. Basically he does not gamble. He does not do the high risk high rewards method. He just buys safe stocks and hold them for a long time. That is why he is so old when he is rich lol.
3	1525767142	2	This is what you do with lots of money, less risk with small gains is what he aims for. Innovation is risky!
4	1525768069	0	Yes i agree but it just shows that he has no idea what he is talking about when it comes to Bitcoin.
2	1525749953	1	Maybe but Buffet has been wrong about a lot of other things particularly involving technology, so I wouldn't take his advice 100&#37; to heart. Bill Gates idk about because he was praising bitcoin not to long ago. Guess he is just acting like the follower he is at heart just like he followed steve jobs's every move too 
3	1525781406	0	... You realize that if Microsoft and Gates didn't personally bail out Apple, you'd have never heard of Steve Jobs right? 
0	1525748880	8	He said this on CNBC, I agree to most of it. Basically saying it is a non-productive asset, something that doesn't produce anything in return but is just what is without giving a return. Trading it just manufactures it to be more valued because you think the next guy wants to buy the same thing at a higher price. [Warren Buffett: Bitcoin Is An Asset That Creates Nothing | CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtITDtZPYEw)
1	1525782679	1	What’s so so funny about your response and also buffets response, is that buffet is heavily invested in gold, and gold itself is a non productive asset.Money that is invested into gold doesn’t produce any kind of real economic growth.Personally I think BUFFET, is your classical idiot with money, most produced by luck.He understands nothing about tech and people only listen because he’s got money, but he’s been wrong multiple times, and his statement about bitcoin may be right that it’s not productive but neither is gold so he’s a fool to not point that fact out also.Fair is fair.And may I add gold isn’t classed as an investment either for the reason it doesn’t produce anything, unlike stocks and bonds.
2	1525789466	2	First Buffet has always been against investing in gold, he is well known as being against it. He said that he doesn't invest in non-productive assets like he and you said, so you clearly have no idea what you are on about. A couple of quotes that you can easily find by typing buffet and gold into google; "Warren Buffett has been very vocal about his disdain for gold as an investment. He sees little to no value in gold. What Buffett refers to as a lack of value results from a lack of usefulness. He once stated about gold, "It doesn't do anything but sit there and look at you." . [1](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021615/does-warren-buffett-invest-gold-why-or-why-not.asp). "Gold gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head." [2](http://www.minyanville.com/trading-and-investing/commodities/articles/Warren-Buffett-brka-gold-investing-investing/10/3/2012/id/44617) Besides, gold atleast has more use as it been implemented in many areas.  "What's so ~~**so**~~ funny about your response" is that it is canceled out by your own lack of knowledge and contradiction on the obvious you pointed out. He does not like non-productive assets like Bitcoin and Gold, so you just made some backward ass logic to sound smart. Well no actually it makes sense. The majority of the BTC community HATES bankers, market makers, NASDAQ, CME, government reg, Jamie Dimon and Buffet because they are the part of the "system" unless they turn bullish which spikes the price so they are given a 180 flip overnight...
3	1525789789	1	You mean he doesn’t invest in the none producing asset silver then?Oh yes he does, he’s clearly full of bullshit is the point.So it’s not backward ass homework, yours is fool.Think that will shut you up, why don’t you check on google.And the crowd  claps 😂 .
4	1525792192	1	He makes money, he has invested in tech companies and sold all. Silver is used in real world situation, doesn't mean he is a investor, just like a pump and dump on shit coins. My reply referenced buffets well known thoughts on gold which you obviously researched. He isn't a old fool, he has people working for him looking at the shortings but he has the say. 
5	1525793556	1	Don’t back track you make yourself look more of a loser than you clearly are already , the fact was you said he doesn’t invest in none producing assets.And I said silver is classed as one of those assets just like gold, and he invested $130 million, which in anyone’s eyes is a large investment and it’s irrelevant why, just he did.Buffet has also missed many opportunities in other tech stocks and and is quite clearly only human, he’s also clearly wrong about BTC but that’s expected at his age and with no tech background.And time is his biggest enemy, no one in crypto gives a shit.But I was pleased you had to suck it up.And that’s how easy it is to slay a NO COINER hahahaha.
0	1525779430	3	He makes money in his sleep and it seems he'll be working until he dies, so what's the point?
1	1525781646	3	Some people love their jobs.
0	1525735848	16	He is also 87 years old now. He is wrong about Bitcoin
1	1525742074	18	Warren Buffet is also a MAJOR hypocrite. He talks and talks about the 'free market' but he was one of BIGGEST supporters of a government bailout of Wall St. in 2008.Prior to this he always said how proud he was that his insurance companies and financial companies could weather any storm. I guess not. He should have LOST EVERYTHING in 2008.
2	1525744704	10	"If I didn't think the government was going to act, I would not be doing anything this week. I might be trying to undo things this week. I am, to some extent, betting on the fact that **the government will do the rational thing here and act promptly.**"Warren Buffett on CNBC, Sep 24, 2008He is more than a hypocrite. In 2008, after Buffett was lending billions to the Wall St Banks, but the markets kept crashing and he realized he would lose a fortune, he furiously threatened to pull the plug if the government didn't step in. Essentially he blackmailed them. 
3	1525753377	5	Sounds like he owes them one. 
3	1525779192	1	He didn’t blackmail them. He just refused to bail out the banks all by himself. 
4	1525789151	2	And yet the irony is that's not how the free market works, that's not how any of that is supposed to work. Warren Buffet is a private citizen who was making an investment in a company, to "Call On" the government to bail him out of his investment is crony capitalism at best, straight up collusion at worst. Warren Buffet and the banks should have been allowed to fail. But when you're an 80 year old billionaire who knows everybody, the rules that apply to everyone else don't apply to you. 
1	1525746398	7	He has no incentive to truly research it himself. He won’t live to see the dawn of an era where decentralized applications have matured and become engrained in globalized society. Buffet  still thinks in terms of CEO’s, corporate leadership, board of directors, authority figures to hold accountable. He can control those guys and in return he gets profits. Understanding bitcoin would require him to undo his entire understanding of value without centralized hierarchies. So to him, anything challenging the ideas that made him rich just aren’t worth investing in or researching. He can comfortably say he doesn’t know it or understand it and still bash it. He won’t be around to have to answer why he was wrong. 
1	1525798220	1	👏🏻
1	1525798283	1	Clearly true my friend.
0	1525751871	2	Im on the Smith and Wesson retirement plan.
1	1525764044	1	End it, don't mend it ? ;)
0	1525772197	2	In less than one year, Buffet will be dead or officially into crypto. Every critic turned 180degree.Edit: This is Not a death threat fyi @r/BTC. 
0	1525781931	2	I am wondering if the BIG MONEY is trying to find their way into a ride they missed? Wall Street did the pooh-poohing and now as they are joining the progress of the future they see they missed the launch. All business's risk losing out if they don't get on board the blockchain revolution. Buffet owns alot of companies that trade on Wall Street. I would think the money going to the NEW WAY OF DOING BUSINESS.....is a loss for the manipulators. THUS, and my opinion only, they will POOH POOH until they get their share. jmho
0	1525743288	4	Meh.  It's really more of a first-world problem.  You poor sods in the U.S., EU, Canada, and so on would be astonished at how easy it is to make and save money elsewhere in the world, because you're not being fucking taxed to death.
1	1525745096	6	I rather enjoy a high standard of living. 
2	1525776301	1	Which I have.  The only downside is the earthquakes.
1	1525745061	13	I'm not sure which particular countries you're referring to but I bet the average American could retire at 40 if they accepted that standard of living. It's not the taxes; it's the greed.
2	1525776598	2	The standard of living here is almost as high as it is in the U.S.The difference is that the median income here is taxed at about 9%.  VAT on sales is 5%.  As a result, an Egg McMuffin costs the equivalent of $1.65.In the U.S., social security taxes alone are 15%, income tax tacks on another 20%, state income taxes run around 5%, sales tax is around 8%. . . .  And whether you understand it or not, you're paying all of those taxes (including the sales tax) for all of the workers at McD's when you buy an Egg McMuffin.  Plus all the business taxes, property taxes, government mandates like ObummerCare. . . .Congratulations, you're poor.
3	1525784812	2	Sure but what is the median wage? What country are you talking about?
2	1525745535	2	This is an underrated comment. 
3	1525776660	2	Except for him being completely wrong about the standard of living where I am. It's not the third world.  It's just a nice, pleasant, low-tax country where people aren't punished for working.
4	1525781876	2	Which country?
3	1525764185	1	The average US person could retire in 5 years, if they just stopped buying all the crap the TV tells them to buy. By 30 the average person already owns most of what they will ever need for themselves
2	1525799052	1	Obligatory r/financialindependence
1	1525778230	1	This.
0	1525741868	4	Ofcourse hes wrong about bitcoin. Please show some respect to the elder. For petes sake yall look like you never spoke to an elder before. You know how they are. Just be quiet and say yes your right WB.
1	1525748212	0	"You know how they are".. But we're the ones not showing respect for elders? 😂
0	1525757911	2	What exactly does this have to do with bitcoin?
1	1525789701	1	Exactly. It’s unfortunate that some people still only see Bitcoin as a way to get rich. 
0	1525761481	2	Bitcoin itself isn't a way to make money though. It may make a reasonable speculative invesement today, but it was never designed for this and eventually this opportunity will pass (if it hasn't already). At best we can expect bitcoin to stablise and increase relative to inflation.
0	1525749153	2	Why are we trippin' about Buffet's opinion of crypto? No, the man probably doesnt understand even the tip of the iceberg in how all this stuff works, that doesnt mean every thing else he says financially should be thrown out the window, or vice versa. I think a big problem that folks like Buffet see is people investing in crypto as an idea of passive income or financial freedom. When they get burned, people like Buffet see that and note that versus a traditional investment, this would've never happened. 
1	1525768833	0	He and those bashing crypto understand it better than most people here. Only they're bashing it to keep it low so they can buy into it cheaper. Food for thought. ALWAYS watch what they do, not what they say..
1	1525778132	0	He may not understand it but perhaps he \(still\) has the flair to see it as a risky, volatile investment and possibly combined with regret for not having jumped in he would come out with all sorts of crap. Sadly it influences general perception to a certain extent. 
0	1525751506	1	Except he makes his money when he’s awake since the markets close before he sleeps. 
0	1525752845	1	Warren is an OG hodler
1	1525764279	1	Warren was hodling before hodling was cool, or even existed, or the guy who misspelled 'hold' was born, even.
0	1525753265	1	Warren Buffet is constantly working? I mean, if I retire I guess I have something better to do than traveling from trash talk to trash talk lol
0	1525755554	1	100% agree 
0	1525763058	1	Pretty ironic coming from a person who's 87 and is still currently working.
1	1525766968	1	does he 'have to'? I'd say it's a huge difference between wanting and having to do something.
0	1525765246	1	I have the idea damnit I just don’t have the money nor financial security to even attempt to begin the idea
0	1525765364	1	Ohh, I just watched a documentary on youtube entitled "money, happiness and eternal life". From what I understood about happiness, poor people from poor countries are happy and rich people from rich countries are also happy. The poor might not have equal access to medical care, equal access to water or any other "common good" but their average happiness are the same. In countries with high geni index, where the gap between the poor and the rich is high, people are more depressed and violent and so on. But greed and income inequality are supposedly an evolutionary matter as experiments on primates suggest. I am not saying one should then ignore our moral imperative to rescue the severely ill and so on, but happiness fundamentally has a chemical basis in our brains. So, in my opinion, the opinion of warren Buffet is solely his own and is, at least, not scientifically defensible.

He can't. He is clueless to the technology.

0	1525782404	1	what he meant are for everyone to have a business.
0	1525785947	1	What about welfare? It's a shame basic income is still not a thing
0	1525786606	1	How old is warren buffet, 88? Still working.
1	1525794404	1	87, and he will surely work until he dies.
0	1525788944	1	Yeah but if you make 100 times of what you invested then 99 other people will have lost the same amount. You guys DO understand that these principles only work for the very few either lucky or skilled ones.Money is not created out of nothing. Stay for the technology, not the profits.This is a giant merry go around where the last ones will foot the bills of the first ones if you're in for the profits. But hey, at least you can post smart pictures with cool coins and memes.
0	1525790292	1	Looks like Buffett and Gates are manipulating the Bitcoin price as it turned down after their negative opinions aired on CNBC.
0	1525790972	1	Buffet is wrong about bitcoin and blockchain. He is a very fallible human who is outside of his lane on the subject. Buffet has made numerous large mistakes in his career of investing. Take the name Berkshire one of his biggest investing mistakes, he got emotionally invested and things got personal. Next take Dexter Shoe another two huge mistakes first the purchase of it and then the use of stock to make the purchase...Purchasing Waumbec Textile Company...Investing in Tesco...Taking on debt from energy future holdings...Not buying the Dallas-Fort worth NBC station...Issuing extra shares of Berkshire Hathaway to buy General Reinsurance...Not performing proper due diligence when buying General Reinsurance...Buying a large amount of ConocoPhillips stock...Failing to dig deep into Lubrizol Corp. stock...Opting not to buy Amazon stock...Purchasing US Airways stock...Missing his chance to invest in Google...Overestimating select manufacturing, service and retail investments...Guy is not infallible, he is an elitist and is often wrong in subjects outside of his wheelhouse. Does anyone know if he paid the billions that he owes in back taxes to the government yet?
0	1525792707	1	well said but of course there is a certain risk on that
0	1525798371	1	There's no easier way to make money than to rely on central banks to print money.  So far so good.
0	1525798740	1	Warrent Buffet is actually a brilliant investor, and just an excellent example of "The good guys on wall street."But he is getting too old for this game.  It happens to everyone, and only truly 1:100 Million people are exceptional enough to know when to quit while they are ahead... 
0	1525799399	1	well, he bought geico, so he does have a way to make money when he sleeps.
0	1525801591	1	Funny it's in /r/Bitcoin. I quite like the dude, very smart. But he's against bitcoin, but not really surprising; i watched a documentary on the guy and he claims he doesn't use a computer at all.... he still reads the stocks from the newspapers etc. I'm sure he has great advisers though. But yeah, he's not really keen on the bitcoin.
0	1525802192	1	This is excactly why we need bitcoin, so noone can ever again print insane amounts of fiat for drugs bitches and slavery.
0	1525753141	1	Science has proven that the first thing that goes in a human being over the age of 50 is the ability to reason. This gets progressively worse as age increases. Do not take financial advise from anyone over 50.
0	1525743928	1	Warren once said: *never invest in something you don't know,* in reply to a journalist who asked him how he survived the dot\-com bubble in 2000s. Does Warren really know and understand fully bitcoin to say something like he says?Only time will tell us. My thoughts tell me he is wrong because he doesn't fully understand bitcoin.
1	1525754651	2	Years back he said he didnt understand apple and said it would have a hard time continually innovating... now apple is his biggest investment and he wished he could own all of it.
1	1525745362	0	I don’t think he fully understands it... Hence why I think he is so against it and why he doesn’t own any. He is also extremely old fashioned... the man is 86 years old. 
0	1525757093	1	I think that Buffet made a mistake with not investing in Bitcoin, and if he talk about Bitcoin he knows he did
0	1525743622	0	That's why I am mining :3
0	1525745676	0	"A check is a way of transmitting money too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money? Just because they can transmit money?" - Warren BuffetThe man is clueless on this topic.
0	1525750780	0	Warren, 87, disproves his own saying.
1	1525752655	2	I'm pretty sure he figured out a way to earn money while he sleeps.
