5	1525885766	1	I *think* it's wearing a monocle?
6	1525886937	1	I didn't know there was a monoclonal emoji.
7	1525888440	1	Yes, it was I! My machinations lay undetected for years, for I am a master of deception! 
5	1525896368	1	That's Monacle Mike. He's on the case.
5	1525893486	1	👁‍🗨
4	1525892001	1	That's gentleman!
3	1525886063	1	With that kind of attitude it's amazing the entire country hasn't adopted cryptocurrency yet. 
4	1525892635	1	People will always fall for stupid scams.
5	1525893436	1	They sure fell for the whole crypto currency pyramid scheme thing that's for sure
6	1525894712	1	Did you forget your medicine again, grandpa?
7	1525895811	1	Nope no sir didn't forget my medicine just trying to make money off a scheme that I can't quite understand. Also this IRS guy keeps calling me about taxes on my digital currency! What's that all about!?!
5	1525895271	1	So forcing them into a system that has no fraud protection is the answer to...what problem exactly?
6	1525896537	1	No fruad protection yet. If you can't protect yourself are not tech savy don't get into BTC for another 10 years.
7	1525896937	1	So, mass adoption is over a decade away when fraud protection that doesn't exist and there are no plans to make some may or may not actually exist at that time?K.
2	1525876997	9	Never use any .in domains.All INDIAN Crypto Websites are crooks
3	1525877137	36	[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/utzTCyo.png)
3	1525882434	6	flair checks out
3	1525881464	22	Almost anything having to do with India is shady. They have a feringi business mentality. Lying is just a tool to get the needful.  
4	1525888175	1	You are incorrect sir, and you needn’t the repeat malicious stereotype. Kindly consider that India is having decades of experience in successful business, and several multinational corporation have the headquarters in India. In reflecting on the same perhaps you will let go the racist thoughts.
5	1525889843	1	...do you know what a ferengi is?I'll just say that "experience in successful business" is more of a conformation of the ferengi stereotype, not a rejection.  Though, the most ferengi country is of course, 'merica \- after all, they were litterally based on 20th century Americans. 
5	1525894471	1	I can't tell if this is supposed to be satire or not. Anytime I see someone say 'Kindly do X' it triggers me from my early IT career days when I worked with a bunch of "plz do the needfuls" on the daily.
5	1525892287	1	Stereotypes have truth to them. Western tradesmen in my country all intuitively know to be on guard when dealing with money with certain cultures. It's a wink, nod and nudge thing, so don't be offended. The korean blue collar immigrants are less tolerant than whites of this sort of thing, from what I've noticed.
5	1525895469	1	How does nobody see this is obvious satire
5	1525891615	1	Sorry. Not racist. Indians are Caucasian. It’s your culture. Of course not all Indians are this way. But even if it’s a small portion out of a billion people. Well that’s going to be a world problem. No means try harder and lies are ok as long as you get what’s needed for your family. Not a polite way to navigate through the world. 
3	1525884486	1	You'd think that would be common sense
2	1525875017	1	>>.05FTFY
1	1525883806	9	Only rookies withdraw. No problem with deposits though so all good. 
1	1525874485	-12	this is a joke right?... pls god plssssssssss
2	1525877333	23	Yes, obviously it's a fucking joke, look at that url
3	1525880061	6	Some people are just slow man. 
4	1525881565	-2	me dumb dumb, me very slow in headit was a joke, cause nowadays you never know ;)
2	1525880494	5	I wish...One guy on 4chan told me it was the most secure wallet. 
3	1525881538	2	LIES, that domain doesnt even resolve
4	1525883643	4	That's why /u/themonkier is having trouble withdrawing from it. The owners forgot to renew the domain.
2	1525889757	1	this is a joke right?... pls god plssssssssss
0	1525874948	44	And that is the problem with Bitcoin.  Outside of a tremendous level of knowledge... the odds are good you will get ripped off or screw up and lose it.  Biggest obstacle to it becoming widespread in the population.I can go to a crappy bank, open an account and between the laws and insurance, any money I have will be there tomorrow.  Knowledge level zero.  I can check my account 10 different ways and know what I have there.  I can write checks and know it will go through for the amount I wrote.  I can get cash, I can deposit more.  Bitcoin is not that easy and does not appear to be getting easier.  It won't have widespread adoption without that.  And without widespread adoption, it might not "make it".
1	1525875786	11	Coinbase is pretty easy for people who don't know what they're doing, and they're FDIC insured for fiat and Lloyd's insured for your coins.
2	1525876940	15	True, Coinbase is one of the easier methods to buying and selling, but I think u/IndianaGeoff's point still stands. Until someone like my mom can understand it without having to watch 20 videos from Andreas on YouTube, you are going to see adoption stalled and only increase among the techno\-elite.
3	1525891522	1	Does your mom know how to invest in penny stocks?
3	1525878059	-1	Funny you mention your mom.  My mom has some coin on Coinbase.  Doesn't seem to be a problem for her.  She even used it to pay for a plane ticket.
4	1525879341	10	Cool, YMMV I guess. My mom gets confused about FaceTime, so that’s where I’m at.
4	1525894359	1	You mean different people have different levels of technological understanding? Wild
5	1525894686	1	You don't need much technological understanding to use Coinbase.
6	1525895330	1	Gran Gran tries to use the mouse as a microphone.
2	1525876309	3	They took my money in the fall, but now I can't withdraw because "that feature isn't available in your country" I'm Canadian
3	1525878085	3	You can't withdraw Bitcoin or fiat?
4	1525884656	1	I'm assuming he/she is trying to exchange his/her bitcoin for CAD and withdraw that. I've never heard of Coinbase restricting withdrawing crypto by country.If that's the case the best thing to do is just transfer the BTC to a different exchange and then exchange it to CAD there.If it's that he/she can't withdraw his/her crypto then that sounds like a bug. Contact support.
2	1525886806	1	>Coinbase is pretty easy for people who don't know what they're doing, and they're FDIC insured for fiat and Lloyd's insured for your coins.Where did you read about Llyod? I just see the FDIC insurance on their website 
2	1525896123	1	And for those who don't live in the US or any other country supported by coinbase?
1	1525879519	3	Well no shit. Do you want to a) control your own money, or b) give it to a third party and trust they won't steal it?If a) bitcoin is as easy as anything else. Securing cash isn't for newbs either. if b) there are bitcoin banks that will hold your bitcoin for you, if you trust them not to steal it.
2	1525887134	1	Everything you do in Bitcoin is through third parties with many of them having screwed people in the past.  Just look at the flaming rage quests on this forum about who is stealing, who is overcharging, who is refusing to execute transaction and who is committing outright fraud.  Until you have systems that the average people can understand and trust with appropriate backstops... it adoption will be stunted.  And if it's adoption is stunted, its future is very uncertain.
3	1525895603	1	> Everything you do in Bitcoin is through third parties That is a ridiculous and trivially false statement.> Just look at the flaming rage quests on this forum about who is stealing, who is overcharging, who is refusing to execute transaction and who is committing outright fraud. Now I see how you came to this false conclusion. If you only pay attention to people complaining on reddit, of course you're going to believe that everything is broken.> Until you have systems that the average people can understand and trust with appropriate backstops... it adoption will be stunted. And if it's adoption is stunted, its future is very uncertain.True, but you could have said that about early versions of every technology that ever became popular. Cars, televisions, computers, email, cellphones, instant messengers, etc. Technologies need to be useful and relatively easy to learn. The users will learn them. I think bitcoin is getting there and there are no major hurdles in terms of usability. The question is really whether enough people will find bitcoin *useful*. I think they will. 
4	1525896141	1	>The question is really whether enough people will find bitcoin useful. I think they will.    why? what is the average person going to do with bitcoin that they aren't already doing with their federally regulated and insured bank account?
0	1525876227	133	I put money into coinbase before the big spike. Been sitting on it ever since. Went to withdraw it to make a purchase, and got his with "this feature is not enabled in your country yet".... I'm in Canada, how could I put money in, and buy but now I can't. I don't know what to do. I'm not super Bitcoin literate but it seemed interesting and something to check up on periodically. Now I just want me money
1	1525876329	67	So you're saying you purchased bitcoin on coinbase, the bitcoins are stored on the exchange now and you can't withdraw them to a wallet? Or, are you trying to sell the coins now and withdraw your money?
2	1525876501	29	I bought them on there, but now I can't sell them. I wanted to sell them for CAD
3	1525876716	27	That's fine! All you need to do is send your bitcoin to a different  exchange (Probably Canada based), where you can then sell the coins for CAD.I did a little research and some people recommend QuadrigaCX.What you need to do is set up a new account on there, then send your bitcoins from coinbase to the new exchange. Then, sell your coins at the new exchange for CAD and withdraw to your bank account.Let me know if you have any difficulty!
4	1525877168	9	GDAX is Coinbase’s trading platform. It also does not deal in CAD. Only USD, Euros, and Britain pounds. 
5	1525877389	2	Thanks, I’ll edit my comment.
4	1525876787	3	Thanks very much for the information. I'll do this after work tonight. Sincerely appreciate that. 
5	1525876850	3	You're very welcome. Happy to help.
3	1525876667	44	Try withdrawing them to another exchange or even try selling in person if you can. 
4	1525876807	12	Thanks for the advice. I'm going to do this tonight.
5	1525877327	19	You can't sell for CAD on coinbase anymore. I'd recommend getting verified on quadrigacx, then transferring and selling them there.
5	1525877845	5	Let it ride homie don’t sell now wait a few months at the very least. 
5	1525892161	1	ill buy them
5	1525877807	-1	I dont know people that used for CAD but I know people that withdraw euro. Use [kraken.com](https://kraken.com)  https://support.kraken.com/hc/en\-us/articles/360000411303\-How\-to\-withdraw\-CAD\-using\-Canadian\-Dollars\-bank\-transfers
3	1525879511	2	Use QuadrigaCX, best for Canadian withdrawals IMO. Equifax verification, super quick, no need for more verification unless you want to withdraw something like 100k
3	1525886248	1	You can’t convert crypto to CAD on Coinbase. Use Quadriga.
1	1525885714	1	Im canadian and i use quadriguacx for crypto/fiat pairs. Cheers brother.
1	1525882427	1	Chances are it will be due to your withdrawal limit, for example I can only withdraw x2 BTC per 24 hours via Binance. Away from that you will just need to transfer to another exchange where you can buy CAD, maybe binance again? 
1	1525877909	-2	How much you have in btc?
0	1525873615	28	Should do another one with 1) hodl-ers straight ahead2) n00bs chasing their eth giveaway taking the exit
1	1525875192	16	Hey, eventually Vitalik is going to send back that 10x ETH from the Twitter giveaway. A bunch of random accounts with 0 tweet history confirmed it works!
2	1525887818	1	I send 1000 TRX to someone on twitter and they said I'll get back 5000 after month. Guess I'll find out in 3 days if I got scammed. BTW do you think TRX can ever reach Bitcoin? 
3	1525889053	1	Please tell me that you're joking and that this joke went woosh over my head.
4	1525889274	1	Ye but the joke is kinda bad
1	1525882150	9	As someone who invests 300% of the paycheck into bitconnect, inform me about this ETH exit again please?
2	1525884109	1	Only 300%? Enjoy being the owner of *only* 3 yachts and 2 mansions in 10 years.I however, invest 500% of my paycheck into bitconnect because in 10 years I not only want 2 mansions and 3 yachts but a private jet and a helicopter as well.
0	1525874584	38	a big factor for adoption imo, bitcoin is not babyproof enough yet.The general population does not have time or brainpower to think even a little about techy stuff
1	1525889943	1	When the Nasdaq picks up bitcoin they are going to learn quick. So make sure ur in when/if that happens. 
0	1525874429	25	This totally makes sense, there should be a well-written guide for new users on the right side of this sub so they don't fall for scamy websites.
1	1525875339	13	If someone did enough research to check /r/bitcoin then they probably wouldn't fall for scammy websites anyway. I don't even know how they find these things but my guess is that they Google search for Bitcoin and click a scam ad. Or a banner ad on Facebook or something.
2	1525876075	13	I did something weird when I first got into bitcoin.  I asked people who were already into bitcoin which wallet they used.  
3	1525877316	16	“You can just leave them on mtgox they’ll be fine.”
3	1525876520	7	You monster!!!
1	1525876811	5	https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet
2	1525885280	1	Is this updated? I don't really trust any of the wallets on Android. I used to think Mycellium was the way to go until they started promoted RMC through the app
1	1525887270	1	Who ever declares a site to be "scamy" and is even a little wrong, is open to being sued into oblivion.  Even if they are 100% correct about a site being a scam, they can be sued up one side and down another.  On the other side, if they recommend particular sites, how can we be certain those sites are not self promoting?  It's a great idea, but I would never step up into this kind of risk.
0	1525880596	11	You realize this is the communities fault right? When you are new to whats going on, and trying to do research,  for every person telling you to use this good and trusted wallet, there is also people saying how bad it is. Now to the experienced we see that as them meaning they had a bad experience, or its not as good as others. But to people new to bitcoin what they see is that this wallet is mediocre at best because of all the bad reviews and stories. And let's be honest, when someone starts complaining about a wallet they complain hard. So the newcomers go for something with less bad reviews, which end up being the ones most people haven't used.
1	1525891629	1	This community is supposed to teach people the basics of how not to get scammed by random internet websites?
2	1525895060	1	The lost is "hurrr durr why don't they go to the good sites" my response is that because they see the people who lnow more about it then themselves constantly shitting on the good sites. And honestly with how non-mainstream bitcoin still is there is a very thin line between the quality of the legit sites and the quality of the scam sites. Therefore people rely on testimonial to tell the difference
0	1525878019	4	Yooo I think I just got scammed! I sent .05 BTC to https://www.BTCRealExchangeWebsite.notascam and I didn’t get it back! 
1	1525878236	7	>https No I think you’re alright there. Should be fine 👍the ‘s’ stands for safe.
2	1525878908	1	Oh thank god I was scared for a second! Now if you don’t mind I’m going to go plan out what color Lamborghini I’m going to buy with my 0.05 bitcoin

0	1525872447	7	If You see it like in the picture, you are taking the wrong way too
0	1525877534	5	My new website is live, come make your wallet at btcnoobslayer.com
0	1525875241	2	The problem is everyone wants a get rich quick scheme.
0	1525875936	2	Is this talking about exchanges or wallets? Mt. Gox was a trusted exchange when it came out.
1	1525876155	2	Wallets. There seems to be a lot of new users making wallets on these weird websites and getting scammed because the private keys were shared with the website too.
1	1525876202	1	Regardless of how well you can trust popular exchanges/wallets, you definitely can’t trust unknown exchanges/wallets.But OP is not talking about exchanges or wallets; OP is talking about people.
0	1525881195	2	Jokes on you...I sent 0.5 Bitcoin and getting 5 Bitcoin back from CZ !!! Limited offer 
0	1525886172	1	How would you rate Bitcoin Core?
0	1525875274	1	Makes sense. Is it cuz they realize that was the exit they were supposed to take?
0	1525876010	1	So I'm a newbie, whats a good wallet?
1	1525877308	5	electrum
2	1525879528	5	**dot org**
1	1525882239	2	For cold storage (offline, for large sums): hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger. For online wallets: Samourai, Electrum, GreenAddress. They differ a little bit, so you can pick based on what you actually need (more privacy features? User-friendly? Etc).
1	1525876082	2	Hardware wallet is best. For software based, I use Etherium.
2	1525880763	2	 Etherium wallet? First time I hear
3	1525886888	1	I'm 95% sure /u/EMC2_trooper meant to say "Electrum". As in https://electrum.org/
1	1525881530	1	Use the wallet I do.  It located at www.nobtcscam.se.  It is 100% totally safe!  They hold the coins for you AND give you 10% extra on your deposit every 6 months!  They do have a minimum withdrawal amount of 3 BTC once you deposit but that just provides me an incentive to hodl!  And yes, they DO hold the private keys but that's not a problem because they are *completely legit*.
2	1525884559	1	Awesome thanks.
0	1525876107	1	Paraphrased quote from an SMS message I received not that long ago: "How do I buy bitcoin and send it to my [site I wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole] account to buy altcoins?"
1	1525876206	1	Reply: You don't.
0	1525876290	1	Some would just register to a trading platform and just find random entries.

0	1525878003	1	Mtgox was once the straight road though
1	1525878185	1	Sure, but even then it was risky keeping coins in someone else’s wallet. It always has been. 
0	1525878310	1	I like it.
0	1525879206	1	And even if you use the wallet of the most prominent top level domain of the internet (.com) you might might still be tricked and mislead into an altcoin or even lose funds :-(
0	1525879384	1	Ahh man, I appreciate this OC. Gave me a good laugh.
0	1525879788	1	Haha! Yes I to take a right turn 😂😂
0	1525880564	1	hahaha funny
0	1525881045	1	Some people are just too naive, trusting, greedy, or just plain dumb.
0	1525881446	1	is there a list of shady fuckers websites for us to laugh?
0	1525882275	1	Oh cmon, what’s wrong with “www.bitmoney4you.com”?
0	1525882276	1	They're only "trusted" because they haven't decided to cash out yet.
0	1525882286	1	That’s why we need Lambos to make that quick readjust. Turning ratio haaha
0	1525882608	1	What's the origin of this meme
0	1525882656	1	True, I own the website bitcoinwallet.nl (a Dutch website) to inform people about choosing the right wallet. Just bought bitcoinwallet.fr (haven't had time to set it up yet) to inform people in the French language. :)
0	1525883099	1	We get along so why can't they?
0	1525883132	1	We get along so why can't they?
0	1525883530	1	Which is a known and trusted wallet?
1	1525884162	1	GreenAddress, Trezor, Bitcoin Core, Electrum, Ledger
0	1525883734	1	How else would competitors reach anywhere though? Plus it's like the child learning that they can't play with fire. You can give guides but ultimately they might have to learn for themselves.
0	1525884192	1	natural selection -> good for bitcoin
0	1525886441	1	As a soon to be 'first time bitcoin user', I keep asking myself 'why dopeople go to an unknown/little know site?' vs learning in the safety of know/trusted sites/wallets
0	1525886624	1	I don't even have any BTC and i know to use an external wallet, some peoples kids
0	1525887924	1	It has Bit in it, must be legit.
0	1525889149	1	Newbie, haven't even started.  What do?
1	1525892107	1	bitcoin.org, check out the listed wallets
0	1525889465	1	haha too true. but also very sad
0	1525889707	1	They feel like they lost out by starting so late and think that they might make it big by catching on to something else that’s new. Scumbags feed on that.
0	1525892101	1	They legit google "bitcoin" And click on the first link. That leads them down a rabbit hole of trouble. 
0	1525892111	1	Thats a volvo :)
0	1525892692	1	Anyone ever had issues with Coinbase? I get that they essentially act as a bank and it goes against the interests of Cryptocurrency, not to mention their annoying transfer fees, has there ever bee any kind of major issues with them?
0	1525893273	1	Bitconneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeect
0	1525894916	1	I think the difficulty is to know whom to believe, since there are so many sites with top 10s and Tutorials and you don't know who you should trust. Saying that, what information source would you recommend for information about exchange and wallets?
0	1525897708	1	 It's because they are retarded and don't understand that bitcoin is an actual commodity,  it's like they wouldn't go to a some unknown website and buy gold at 1/10th of market yet the expect to do  that with bitcoin simply because they don't understand it.You're not going to get cheap bitcoins anymore than you're going to get cheap gold and silver, be wary of any website advertising significantly discounted gold bullion or bitcoins...sure you may save a few points here and there but huge discounts or deviation from market price should be a huge burning red flag imo.
0	1525898001	1	Still have my Bither wallet.
0	1525898372	1	I did this. My first withdrawal to actual money was difficult (GBP). Used site called Exmo and PayPal. Didn’t get the money for 6 months and when I did I lost £200 ;-;
0	1525872613	0	This was me with blockchain.info wallet, 0.27 BTC hacked later... did some more research and got a ledger nano, lesson learned 
1	1525887249	1	Did you have a weak password or something? And no 2nd password?
0	1525876217	0	To be fair, BTC in particular can be pretty confusing/intimidating to new users, even if they have used other crypto before. Bitcoin.org has numerous recommended third-party wallets (all with their own pros and cons), while many major crypto projects have a single official wallet, making things very simple for a new user. Toss in the confusion created by bitcoin.com, and it can be really daunting for the inexperienced. I recently obtained some BTC for the first time, and despite having used ETH and XMR for ~2 years, I admit I was a little confused by all the options and apparently contradictory information floating around. 
1	1525877454	2	Yep, I totally agree. I consider myself pretty tech\-nerd, \(use Linux for everything, GIS technologist\), and I had to combine 3\-4 days of non\-stop Reddit/YouTube/Jameson Lopp just to feel like I had a firm grasp of the *basics.* There's no way anyone in my family is going to invest an equivalent amount of time to figure it out. They just won't bother.
