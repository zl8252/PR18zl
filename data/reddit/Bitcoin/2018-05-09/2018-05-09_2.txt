0	1525843020	46	Keep it, itâ€™s historic
1	1525886574	1	I wonder how much longer "news" will be printed on paper for? 
2	1525888803	1	Until the last baby boomer is dead, apparently.I really don't understand how they can make money on it now, especially with the distribution costs of physical paper.
0	1525847625	32	*Frontpage, above the fold.*That's the real news.
1	1525847702	4	Good point!
1	1525867070	-14	>New York Times>real newsPick one
2	1525868093	14	Oops, t_d is leaking again.
3	1525884379	1	That's actually many of us here.  We just tend to be silent.
3	1525894637	1	The New York Times is a mouth piece for the US government.  You needn't be a Trump supporter to criticize it:https://theintercept.com/2018/01/03/my-life-as-a-new-york-times-reporter-in-the-shadow-of-the-war-on-terror/ 
3	1525893231	1	Oh look!  A triggered alt-left soyboy who loves fake news.
4	1525893485	1	Why are you the way you are?
5	1525894035	1	Because I am capable of independent thought unlike you?Why are you so easily brainwashed by fake news?  Have you ever considered doing some independent research outside of your far-left echo chamber?
6	1525894608	1	Fascinating.
2	1525875694	3	Can you point me to a better source of real news than the NYTimes please and thank you, good sir!?
3	1525880501	4	Breitbart wouldn't write about this sort of thing, they're too busy investigating Obamas birth certificate.Maybe Infowars will cover some parts if it in relation to their deep analysis of chemicals that the gov. puts in the water to turn Americans into gays?After all, it's the only possible explanation for that tingling sensation you feel when you're in the showers with other guys at the gym.
4	1525884434	1	BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST!Sorry, natural reaction.
5	1525887639	1	Yeah, he's a shitstain. But so is Donald "creeping on teenage pageant queens" Trump who has also been credibly accused of rape. So you can't denigrate clinton and then act like Trump also isn't a rapist....
6	1525893323	1	> Trump who has also been credibly accused of rapeNice fake news bro.  Have you always been so easy to brainwash?
7	1525894323	1	Lol, he fucking admitted it on camera! HAHAHAHAHAHA "anything bad about Trump is fake news amiright?" He also admitted to intentionally walking into the dressing rooms of 16 year old pageant queens........ dude's a pedo and you're bootlicking him. How sad 
4	1525882742	2	lol there ya go. 
2	1525882783	1	Come on Gooch! I need an answer! Where do I go for the REAL NEWS!~?~?~
0	1525855968	9	This definitely is so bullish
0	1525871872	7	People have been busting my onions about Bitcoin price and when is Bitcoin gonna do this and that.  I told them all watch the second half of this year. The tsunami is coming.  Wall Street can't watch another epic year of Bitcoin returns go by.  Now there's a race, between Goldman Sachs and the NYSE over who can make a mainstream exchange for big institutional money into Bitcoin..... Hodlers, your day is coming, and that right soon!
0	1525838615	11	Thx for posting this. Makes it very real 
1	1525838708	2	You're welcome and I completely agree!
0	1525874046	4	cut and frame this.
0	1525856729	7	Venezuelans really have it rough
1	1525857340	-3	Well considering modern sciences efforts for people to use contraception and practice safe sex.... aids is avoidable.
2	1525858217	3	Yes, but in a nation where 6 eggs costs a third of a month's salary I'm guessing there's not much access there.
3	1525881530	1	what are we all doing on here then? lets buy some chickens....
4	1525881651	2	The eggs aren't expensive bud, it's the other way around.
0	1525853132	3	**Onboarding moon rocket.**    *Drop mic*
0	1525865644	3	100K Coming.Also, will Venezuel have good news someday?
0	1525852053	2	Cut it out and pin it into da collection mate. Mark this day. 
0	1525868772	2	Oh the irony with the picture to the right of it..
0	1525886283	1	Hooray, dumb money to flood in!
0	1525838441	1	First posted this on /r/cryptocurrency (https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8i222k/new_york_times_front_page_today_in_case_you/) ... figured since it was about BTC I should share it here! :)
0	1525838839	1	Would this be a positive ?
1	1525875509	2	Yes, this gives huge legitimacy on the eyes of the masses that, unfortunately,  still look up to those institutions for permission/authority. Before, those institutions were saying Bitcoin was a 'fraud', 'bubble', 'money-pyramid', 'dead', 'Ponzi scheme', etc. Now, they are jumping into it. They know the financial institutions that ignore this technology will become obsolete.
1	1525839235	1	Another step towards adoption.
0	1525861494	1	So the price of BTC will rise again :p
0	1525863600	1	Can I get a copy of this?  Anyone?  
0	1525865861	1	strange everyone on reddit saying its going to help bitcoin, twitter says going to kill bitcoin....
0	1525871899	1	I need to your help people. I want to buy BTC at NY. What I can use for it? Because coinbase and coinmama don't work for NY
1	1525872095	1	Try Gemini, Kraken, Bitstamp, or Gatehub if Coinbase doesn't work for you. I'm sure there are more.
2	1525872788	3	Hi, Kraken support here! Unfortunately, we do not service residents of New York due to the state's imposition of the "BitLicense". -- Apologies for the inconvenience.
3	1525872932	2	Nice, quick response!
2	1525881346	1	Thanks,  I will check) 
0	1525872758	1	Price drop incoming. What a weird year. 
0	1525876520	1	Wall Street has been quietly trading btc for some time. CME and CBOE wouldn't have created bitcoin futures and launched them last year if their bank customers hadn't asked them to.
0	1525882205	1	"Virtual currency" please Nathaniel
0	1525883136	1	Love it
0	1525889604	1	Send a copy to Buffett.
0	1525891656	1	And we care that the suits are wanting in on bitcoin why exactly?Let them burn.Don't sell to these clowns.
0	1525894657	1	There's a baby in that picture, Roger should save its life.
0	1525838817	0	And yet the price is dropping. Wtf. News like this would have caused a run back in the day.
1	1525840915	6	Not dropping, just coiling like a spring. 
2	1525841269	2	^Ooooohhhhhh snappy verbiage.   Price has been stalling no matter the rose words you put on it. If the fucking NYSE was planning on making a ntc exchange shit would have been NUTS two years ago. 
3	1525842178	2	I think everyone is waiting for Consensus 2018 and the price is just flushing out. Iâ€™m sure after the 15th weâ€™ll see a further uptrend as great new projects come out. Youâ€™re right though. 2 years ago is a different world and this would have been beyond any reasonable prediction. So, with that in mind, whatâ€™s the equivalent in 2 years time ? :)
1	1525839012	4	Well, I'd imagine that most people that read a physical paper are not already involved in crypto. Those that are involved in crypto probably didn't notice this in the newspaper because they don't read newspapers. I wouldn't have noticed this had I not passed by the stack as I was leaving Starbucks. Good news is, once it does start trading on Wall Street, that's probably when the newspaper audience will start to enter the market.EDIT: In addition, if this article did actually inspire some people to get their hands on some Bitcoin, it would probably take them a day or two to get accounts set up, etc.
2	1525839693	-1	Physical paper wasn't the only way this information was available today. Also saying someone that's read physical news isn't into bitcoin seems elitist. 
3	1525840579	2	I'm just generalizing but I have no statistical proof -- just guessing. I know this information is available via other sources. Didn't see anything "front page" like this, however. Plus, there's just something about being on the physical front page of a newspaper.
4	1525840670	0	https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8hxxne/nyse_isnt_planning_a_bitcoin_futures_market_but_aLiterally on the Frontpage 
5	1525841440	0	Front page of the Finance section -- that's a different level of front page.
6	1525841689	-1	Front page of the subreddit you fucking tard. Do you go to sports center for current world news?!? 
7	1525842062	2	Umad? I'm just sharing news about the front page of an actual, physical newspaper that was printed today.
6	1525841987	-3	This a bot account. Check post history. All crypto. 
7	1525842680	1	you'reTOOhighrightnow
3	1525855402	1	True. [Bitcoin Sees Wall Street Warm to Trading Virtual Currency](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/technology/bitcoin-new-york-stock-exchange.html)

0	1525869028	-1	Interesting how everywhere where theres poverty aids breaks out...ðŸ¤”
1	1525876529	0	Why, it's almost as if the aid we're providing is damaging those communities because we enter and never leave! Check out Poverty Inc. on Netflix. 
2	1525878493	1	Aid or aids? Probably both...
