0	1525839036	77	It is rat poison.... and the banks are the rodents
1	1525850417	4	By far my favorite statement
1	1525860768	-12	This is such a phenomenally lame thing to say. You guys really make Bitcoin look bad with you petty attempts to BTFO people with much more experience in finance than you and particularly with this idiotic war you‚Äôve started against Roger Ver.It‚Äôs the Reddit Effect again. Atheism, makes sense. /r/Atheism, fucking retards that spend all day crossing out the word God on their dollar bills and ironically thanking God for airplane crash victims. Bitcoin, interesting little bit of tech that probably has some specialized use. /r/Bitcoin, fucking retarded goldbugs everywhere. Like WTF?
2	1525862003	11	You off your meds?
3	1525879343	0	Anybody who give a flying fuck what someone with a username I-DESPISE-NERDS says in a CRYPTO SUBREDDIT, or really about anything remotely intelligent, needs to check themselves. He couldn‚Äôt be more clearly trolling if his flair stated he was a troll. Just downvote Mr. Alpha, roll your eyes and move on.
4	1525886315	1	Oh, well, I‚Äôm so sorry. Clearly ‚ÄúI-DESPISE-NERDS‚Äù is a troll username, but being called ‚Äútwobugsfucking‚Äù is a mark of a gentleman and a scholar.
5	1525888698	1	So what‚Äôs up with the hate? Did some rich nerd fuck your wife? Maybe a nerd at the office shitcanned your ass and that‚Äôs why you have the time to drag this thread down with your sniveling whiny bullshit. Actually, I‚Äôm willing to bet you got your shit pushed in  buying at the ATH and now you‚Äôre on some pointless vendetta against crypto and the people who invest in it - just another butthurt loser. Go back to r/buttcoin, talking shit on things you don‚Äôt even understand. Better pad that weak ass ego in your troll subs; no one gives a shit about you here.
3	1525862252	-7	No, are you?
4	1525862683	1	Hah. Your OP is so misguided it looks like you didn't even read the OP to which you have responded. And you are very upset. Very upset.
5	1525863070	-4	Oh yeah, U MAD and all that. Very clever. 
6	1525866050	1	Lol. You are though.
7	1525866394	1	But what are you for trying so hard to tell him that? Worse, whatever it is.
8	1525866763	2	No u
9	1525866767	1	No you both
8	1525868627	2	What I am is confused and curious about what happened to fuel the above angry misguided comment.
9	1525868859	0	It says it in the very first sentence. The extreme lameness of the OP. That must be very confusing to you indeed. 
2	1525872240	2	You are right. But you have to read through the lines. It's not about 'banks', it's more about the currency manipulators. It's time the world got a ledger that's nearly impossible to manipulate. And that time has come.
2	1525865487	2	Oh shit someone is mad at internet people. Show me on the doll where they touched you.I couldn't care less about Roger Ver and his shitcoin, or the opinions of a bunch of dinosaurs who are so stuck in the old ways they can't see how Bitcoin leads to easier access to financial markets for regular people and more financial freedom/sovereignty in general. You complain about internet people being petty, but then when famous people throw immature remarks about Bitcoin you say nothing. Kind of a double standard you got going there don't you think?
3	1525868765	2	>	I couldn‚Äôt care less about Roger Ver and his shitcoin, or the opinions of a bunch of dinosaursWow, could have fooled me. You call me mad, but this subreddit is literally shilling some law suit on a daily basis because someone is using the name of a decentralized brand for a different brand. Talking about being mad. Sure, buddy, all these guys just ‚Äúcan‚Äôt see‚Äù the light of Bitcoin. Better listen to some Greek dude from tech support. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
3	1525871301	1	Get like coin the original fork all the flavor 1/2 the bullshit
2	1525871184	1	I like your fire
1	1525856160	0	Nailed it!
1	1525863092	0	you have a good sense od humor.. LOL
2	1525864540	6	Or he spends a lot of time in this sub.
3	1525872859	2	cause that comment hasn't been post 20 times in 2 days.
0	1525840424	14	Yup. This is as close to a speculator's dog whistle as we'll find in modern times.
0	1525835656	24	I agree. I put everything I am willing to lose into bitcoin, which is everything I have. 
1	1525846006	5	rekt
2	1525852731	-1	He got rekt bc he tried day trading
0	1525832525	8	I love this advice! Basically, it's as strongly effective as doing the opposite of what Goldman Sucks advises the muppets to do.
0	1525841345	13	Hmm, so I should buy cryptocurrencies when people use childish language rather than rational argument to attack them...Hmm... 
1	1525852172	11	I think the use of childish language implies that they don‚Äôt have any more rational arguments. Hence, good time to buy
2	1525872918	2	moon and hodl are very rational, mature arguments?
3	1525878222	2	just make sure you dont invest in any shitcoins by mistake
3	1525882741	1	Well, there's also all the documentation, discussion, code, and the blockchain and bitcoin network itself, to demonstrate how and why it works. It is up to detractors who wish to argue against all of that, to explain how and why.
4	1525884840	1	I like the tangible side of this cryptomania. Intel and Nvidia stock is doing great. so keep mining, trading, selling, and buying, it does nothing but help.
2	1525872153	0	Just like how when someone calls an anti-vaxxer a "fucking moron" that means the anti-vaxxer is completely correct right?Declaring yourself right does not mean you're right. Sometimes, if someone insults a concept with a childish insult doesn't automatically make them wrong. If my favorite movie of all time is Troll 2 and someone calls it a steaming pile of cinematic crap, that doesn't validate my belief that Troll 2 is a cinematic masterpiece.
3	1525873669	0	Well, there's clear evidence vaccines help
4	1525883592	1	And if the doctor tells the anti-vaxxer that they're a "fucking moron" for denying vaccines and reality in general, does that mean just because he used an insult that he is wrong? Because that's the logic of OP: "Buffet used chilidsh insults against Bitcoin, therefore that means he is wrong about it and scared of it".Or it could mean he is like the doctor in this example and trying to tell an anti-vaxxer to stop being so stupid and the anti-vaxxer is saying "see? The doctor called me a fucking moron that means I'm right!" That's not how logic works. 
1	1525864337	3	You mean this sub in its current state?
0	1525847072	13	Bitcoin = Rat PoisonBanks = Rats
1	1525878113	1	I thought institutional money was going to send bitcoin to the moon?
0	1525827577	8	The best time to buy was when they said "fraud". 2nd best is "rat poison". The more rational-sounding the insult, the more effective it will be.
0	1525850861	4	The concept of buffett's value investment is really not fully adapted to the current market. Warren buffett represents the American capitalist market, and now it is the era of the Internet and intelligence. Obviously, this era belongs to people who understand technology and future trendsÔºõwhile those early investors might soon lose the dominant power of this society.
0	1525827658	36	Did you test this investment thesis or is it one of those idiotic statements to power up your circlejerk?
1	1525830489	10	It proved to be a good buying point when Jamie Dimon called it a fraud. So... there‚Äôs that. I bought the moment I heard him say it on live tv. 
1	1525831581	6	Lambo
1	1525827942	18	It can't be more idiotic than "Bitcoin is a turd"
2	1525837288	-8	Sure it can. How about"Buy bitcoin"
3	1525841667	1	You don‚Äôt believe in btc?
4	1525843279	-5	Believes belong in a church
5	1525848037	7	Plenty of beliefs aren't about religion and are useful. Our society is built upon these. You believe in human rights, you believe in the function of president or prime minister, you believe in the company Amazon, and finally if you use it, you believe in money. Those are all imaginary things.Bitcoin is no different.
5	1525844073	6	Believe is an English word and it belongs in everyone‚Äôs vocabulary.  
5	1525843985	4	‚ÄúBelieve‚Äù in the sense of do you understand the greatness and potential that bitcoin has to offer for solving a lot of the issues associated with traditional fiat currencies?
6	1525844192	-11	Replace the word bitcoin in your sentance with god and read that again
7	1525845870	1	You are obviously misinformed and/or uneducated about cryptocurrencies and your own financial system. You should look into how fractional reserve banking and the federal reserve works, then compare it to BTC
8	1525846786	1	And you are obviously delusional to think that bitcoin can replace such systems and that by replacing it all problems would be solvedEither that or you simply want to get richer from your investment
9	1525865710	2	Hahahahaha. You're really going to regret posting these comments/holding this view in the future 
9	1525849795	3	Well atleast he is putting his money where his mouth is. I am also critical of most of these coins but let's be honest, Bitcoin is still a better solution than banking in numerous ways.
5	1525863770	0	 support you bro
1	1525862107	2	What circle jerk? The top comments have been anti Bitcoin for at least the past month.
2	1525863139	1	Top comments are anti bitcoin when people think their shitty altcoin is going down because of it. People love bitcoin when shitcoins are appreciating value because of it.
1	1525829389	2	It really affects the price. There is atleast some dip which can be bought. 
2	1525832679	1	And in some cases, those instigating the FUD are BTFD!
3	1525837416	1	BTFD means? 
4	1525842557	3	Buy The Fucking Dip
4	1525842585	1	Buying the fucking dip!
0	1525851382	5	best time to invest in bitcoin is when you have money you can afford to lose and want to make a reasonable gamble 
1	1525862923	1	So putting everything  I have into EOS and hoping for the best wasn't the way to go?
1	1525860866	1	This needs to be said more. 
0	1525853388	6	First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you and then you win ~ Ghandi
1	1525863946	8	But they never learn to spell your name right.- Gandhi
0	1525825931	2	Agreed
0	1525845158	2	You don‚Äôt have a fuckin clue. 
0	1525848219	2	Ah yes, the old "buy when everyone calls it a turd" theory proposed by the great economist Benjamin Button. 
0	1525852144	2	bitcoin had worse events which led to crashes. until now every negative event was a good chance to buy.
0	1525854382	2	Buffett is a great investor. He simply does not understand blockchain technology. I believe his statements were made out of ignorance rather than fear or a desire to protect his bank investments
1	1525855388	3	Doesn't need to, he can afford the best technical / financial analysts in the world to advice him
0	1525855083	2	Best way to invest is when you don't listen to reddit shill or fud posts but filter, detect and evaluate quality information, know what impact on price some news might have, never buy high and always sell high even if you have to wait for months without a single order placed. And the most important  know when to get out forever.
0	1525858068	2	> investNo. Never. This is a currency, or it may be a currency one day. Stop speculating!
0	1525862914	2	...But what about the freshly harvested baby brains?
0	1525876148	2	Or something like "baby brains" 
0	1525846783	3	it is so obvious , thrust down our throatscould it be bait for bitcoiners could it be that they want us to dump turds so they could buycould it be that they are worried about their retirement money on the islands , somebody should just comfort these octogenarians and whisper in their ears that hyperbitcoinization will take some time yet , and even so their paper stash may have other uses , without going into the (b)anal like them , eg wallpaper for a beautiful Dollar Room
1	1525869218	1	I think the motivations Buffet/Gates are pretty easy to understand.  1 - There is a nugget of truth in the 'pyramid scheme' hyperbole.  Just like with any investment, it only goes up because more people want it in the future.  Even fiat currency follows this principle were it not for inflation typically countering it.  2 - They've made fortunes under the legacy system.  This means both that they don't appreciate the circumstances under which cryptocurrency can be superior (avoiding rampant inflation in banana republics, non-access to banks, easy transmission, etc.) and also that they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.If BTC or any crypto become hugely successful, I think there will be a time when, like gold, it becomes a stable and relatively boring investment.  At that point, yes, there will certainly be better investment options.  Ignoring all of the democratizing, liberating effects that would bring to the world population, however, is fairly shortsighted to say the least.
0	1525871106	1	They are trying to.slow down The migration. The infastructure is not ready for The masses quite yet Warren buffet was picked to be mouth piece Same with the others 
0	1525873282	1	But it is rat poison ‚ò†. And you know who the rats are 
0	1525882194	1	I don't think rat poison is childish, it actually is a decent metaphore for something that seems really good at first, but ultimately kills you when you get a lot of it.
0	1525883337	1	It's rat poison for them . Theirs times are going away and fast. The empire Buffet will collaps on the next creditcruch or Enron while the cryptos are skyrocketing  . Buffet knows that the next recovery for the stocks wouldn't be that easy because the cryptos will compete hard with the traditional assets .
0	1525884713	1	If it was that bad they wouldn't even mention it. They are afraid of loosing.
0	1525885501	1	There's nothing like negative publicity in cryptocurrency. Its just like in politics. Publicity is simply publicity. It actually makes more and more people learn about Bitcoin and want to invest 
0	1525830056	1	This advice gave me cancer.
1	1525830647	1	Too bad you won't live to take it.
2	1525879771	1	Your turd comment is rat poison.
0	1525855332	0	Ironic, that‚Äôs how I feel when bitcoin maximalists attack bitcoin cash.
0	1525862022	0	I believe in Bitcoin, and a few other coins. That being said, I don‚Äôt think anyone can truly say that it‚Äôs not a risky investment. I don‚Äôt know a great deal about Warren Buffet‚Äôs investment strategy, but I am quite sure that it‚Äôs based on seeing something that works. I.e. Coca Cola is sold everywhere in the world every single day, which in turn must mean that it‚Äôs a quite low risk long term investment. At the minute, most people that own Bitcoin wouldn‚Äôt dream of using it, so its purpose is purely speculation.I also don‚Äôt believe that banks will go down. It‚Äôs just not going to happen, and if it did, they would just get replaced with Bitcoin banks. But I can see it becoming an alternate method of payment. The risk is whether that actually happens or not. And that risk is significantly higher than the risk of Coca Cola going bankrupt, for example. I think people are a bit too quick to call Buffet an old crusty white billionaire dude who knows nothing of the future. He will have taken extensive advisement on the matter, and decided that it‚Äôs not for him. I think he should perhaps just say that, rather all these negative comments... But that still doesn‚Äôt make him ignorant. 
1	1525869163	1	I knew that was going to be a post worthy of a thumbs down even before I got to 'Coca cola'."Do you wanna sell sugar water for the rest of your life or do you wanna change the world?" - Steve Jobs to  some guy who left coke for apple.
2	1525873199	1	What‚Äôs wrong with investing in Coca Cola?It‚Äôs making his money work for him, betting on a relatively sure outcome, with reasonable long term expectations. And that‚Äôs quite frankly the opposite of what crypto investments are today. However much you and I love crypto, none of us have a clue about what‚Äôs going to happen. Bitcoin could become absolutely massive, but it could also become the Netscape of Crypto. All of the Cryptos we know today could be worthless in 5 years. They could also be worth a small fortune. What I can tell you for sure is that no one here will be netting a stable and predictable 6-10% return per annum. It will either be 1000-5000% at some point or it will be a big fat 100% loss. And that‚Äôs probably fine for the most of us who have invested money we can afford to lose. But Warren and the likes, are not playing the same game we are. The stakes are much much higher, and therefore it must be something tangible... Like Coca Cola. Look at it this way... He bought Coca Cola stocks for $1 billion in the 80‚Äôs (roughly $2.2 billion in today‚Äôs money). Last year it netted around $500 million in dividends, and the stock holdings are worth around $16 billion. Even if you adjust for inflation that‚Äôs 25% return per annum in dividends, while still keeping your holdings, which are also growing in value. Not bad for flogging sugar water. Bitcoin at this point certainly can‚Äôt give you anything like that. You can gamble on it mooning, but then you would have to sell it or spend it to realise your profit. Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt do dividends. Unless you get together with other people who have sizeable BTC holdings and start lending it out for a return... in which case you have just created a bank. Say what you want about Gates and Buffet, but they do have a point that should be considered. Dismissing them as stupid or ‚Äúscared‚Äù is ignorant as hell. If they were threatened by Crypto, they would keep their mouth shut and just quietly stock up on it and emerge as Crypto overlords in a few years time. Between those two, they know far more about world finance and the application of  technology than all of us here combined. 
3	1525874149	2	Point taken on the value of dividend stocks, but seriously, two people know more than 800,000 redditors combined?  I'm not buying it.  Starting off wealthy, having a good strategy and incredibly fortuitous timing doesn't make one more knowledgeable than 400K+ people.  Let's wait until Szabo, Osuntokun, or the Winklevii are 85 years old to make such comparisons with the benefit of hindsight.
1	1525863883	0	Most accurate and intelligent post I‚Äôve seen in any crypto sub yet.
