Um, well, I had it...just because someone gave it to me!  Then I just got rid of it!  That's bad stuff just like Charlie said!  I don't own it now.  In fact....if I could I would short it big time!  Bet on it going to zero!"Me in High  School: "Magic the Gathering?  Magic the Gathering?  Psshh!  I don't play those kinds of games!  Those are for the weird kids!  Not me!"   \(I loved that game!  I was dying inside!  I just wanted to fit in with the cool kids!\)
1	1525823231	18	And Mt Gox started out as a Magic The Gathering trading website. You were destined to be involved in cryptocurrencies!
2	1525825493	2	Except for1. I just buy them. I'm a speculator. I'm not advancing the technology; I'm just camped out on the digital real estate and betting that other people will...kind of like landlords in Palo Alto. 2. Now I don't give a shit what people think about me nor do I twist and bend myself to fit in with people...kind of like Mr Munger. 
3	1525832606	-3	> I just buy them. I'm a speculator. I'm not advancing the technology; Pick one.  These two statements are incompatible.  
4	1525834940	2	There are three statements there...
5	1525870474	2	And "both" of them are compatible.
1	1525829000	2	I don’t understand, his company accepts bitcoin as payment, but then he says this?? 
2	1525830847	6	He no longer works at Microsoft. 
3	1525832185	2	Oh didn’t know that
1	1525843271	2	I don’t know if this is true, but it’s a funny visual. Take an upvote.
1	1525838692	1	Link? I would love to watch that 
1	1525859119	1	Black Lotus $5000 today, most expensive card in Magic the Gathering!
2	1525892152	1	$300 15 years ago. I should have invested in Magic the Gathering cards. 
3	1525895141	1	I believe the Alpha/Beta version of the Black Lotus is far beyond $5k
4	1525895667	1	$27khttps://www.cnet.com/news/guy-opens-old-magic-the-gathering-deck-stumbles-on-27000-card/That's the one I could have bought for $300.Charlie doesn't believe in speculation. That's fine, he got rich without it. That doesn't mean others can't profit from it.Magic the Gathering cards speculation beats the market apparently. 
1	1525891244	1	Your analogy fits so well here. Strong hands will dominate this asset class. Those big fish just dont want to pay $10,000 each bitcoin lol
0	1525822870	10	Yes, please temporarily crash the price
0	1525815564	42	He won't.... he just worships Warren, and totally went against what he said in the past, about BTC being one of the most exciting new technologies. Bill, be a man.... 
1	1525816849	24	Bill needs to go drop some psychedelics in some beautiful, natural preserve and get back to us once he's had some solid introspection.
2	1525818130	17	Probably Africa where he's helping to eradicate Malaria. 
3	1525819440	7	A noble pursuit, to be sure. I respect him immensely, thus my desire for him to go on the journey.
4	1525835536	1	aka might end up catching it?
3	1525852774	1	ya but how many Lambos has he bought?
3	1525821071	-3	He also supports forced population control. Check it out! 
4	1525821257	3	Source that's not info wars?
5	1525821611	-5	https://youtu.be/4vzFeiKH1jQHow about him?
6	1525823015	8	You know educated populations with good healthcare have less children right? That sounds like pretty horrible POPULATION CONTROL
7	1525837150	1	Why aren't they educated and what do you think from a purely practical perspective Bill Gates has done to help. Links on numbers of dollars spent and milestones reached appreciated.
7	1525824639	-2	The only way to have zero CO2 ommisions is to have forced population control. Research agenda 21 and the Georgia Guidestones.
8	1525825051	4	The goal is not to have 0 CO2 emissions, it's to reduce CO2 emissions enough that the global rise in temp doesn't keep rising. 
9	1525826510	2	Which is impossible. 
6	1525850478	2	Youll be hard-pressed to find one redditor here that isn't gobbling gates knob, but yes, he is indeed in favor of eugenics and forced population control. Everyone back to sleep. 
5	1525821760	-3	https://youtu.be/8BobKXkrt8M
6	1525822334	6	Wow a heavily edited video with an all caps title that repeats the same 3 lines over and over, stay woke fam
3	1525877822	0	after forcing his products on govs and schoolsbof poor countries instead linux? fucker is devil
3	1525842577	-2	/educating the various indigenous tribes as to what a middle aged white man’s semi-erect penis looks like. 
3	1525837018	-5	He's as helpful as I am in eradicating malaria in Africa. Not much. But hey he hasn't spent a penny of the 50 billion so can't expect much.
2	1525823118	2	[deleted]
3	1525823346	1	A very legitimate concern. I, too, had some bad experiences at the outset. It took a long time to work through the bad things I'd done to myself and others, and to finally take the world in even measure.My only suggestion is to get people in with a soft psych, like marijuana. Once that's something they can handle, their guide should help them into the next set if it's necessary. Shrooms, perhaps.It's important to have people around who can provide some grounded perspective to whatever may come out of the experience.Always have a guide when visiting a new place, or an old place long since forgotten.I need to revisit, too. The world's had a huge impact on me over the past three years.
4	1525824254	3	[deleted]
5	1525824734	1	Thank you for sharing your experience. It's comforting in a way to know other people have similar experiences. Loneliness is a painful thing.I hope you have a good one, too! :)
4	1525836825	1	The point of psychedelics is not to be handle it. That is exactly the purpose: to get rid of fear by force. Otherwise it is just another bullshit. Like marihuana.Mushrooms are just perfect. I jumped from high building after them.I mean, there is no order how to go into chaos. It is just jump and swim. Exactly as life. Exactly as crypto.Bill Gates is de facto after death. If he is using his precious time for monetary nonsense like selling bitcoin then he is gone. Lost in his escapism. What good he will do for 3rd world? Reality is far more complex than that the White rich man can come to shithole and solve the problems.
5	1525839057	1	I'll put this out there - it's up to you if you discount it.Microdosing works, so does easing in with soft psychedelics. It may take longer, like easing into a pool, yet I think it is still a productive endeavor when mixed with mindful, thoughtful inner searching.
6	1525840020	1	I would stick with the saying: no bad trip is no trip at all.
5	1525837460	-2	He has done more harm simply being himself, accumulating wealth, using his podium to promote wealth accumulation. Someone with his sphere of influence and hasn't done shit except speak to the fortunate about the problems in Africa. Go actually do something Gates you shameful cunt.
6	1525839896	-1	It may be a too harsh. But after the W10 of my friend and fucked up autoupdates ate all my data I have to agree.Yet he will not do anything. He will not even short the bitcoin, because he came with the upfront excuse that it is hard.
2	1525853687	2	Ahh another universal library member... Peace
2	1525835408	1	Yes who needs years of experience and business acumen when you can do drugs
1	1525845097	3	The technology is exciting, that doesn't make bitcoins any more valuable? Do you understand the difference in the technology and actual bitcoins? 
0	1525839607	8	Maybe Bill misremembered his comment in 2014... "Bitcoin is better than currency in that you don't have to be physically in the same place and, of course, for large transactions, currency can get pretty inconvenient."
0	1525822941	42	i mean even if gates is anti bitcoin, i cant hate the man.. sorry the guy who single handedly wiped out malaria from 95% of Africa in a single lifetime? not to mention the work he's doing with clean wateryea you can hate me for all i care, you a good dude mr gates.
1	1525831904	8	Definitely. Can disagree with a man and still respect him tremendously.I mean, it goes without saying. Bill Gates' moral fiber is strong but no one can predict the future.
1	1525827946	14	> i mean even if gates is anti bitcoin, i cant hate the man.. sorry the guy who single handedly wiped out malaria from 95% of Africa in a single lifetime? not to mention the work he's doing with clean waterI feel the same way about Gates. Dude wiped out Polio from half the world. A part of the reason why people from developing countries can even buy bitcoin is because of him. He's incredible.
2	1525837572	-2	You people are extremely misinformed. You think Gates wiped out Malaria and Polio?? Where the fuck are you getting your "information"??
3	1525865624	8	Not sure why you are getting so many down votes. Malaria is definitely still a problem. (Bill gates did not fund the polio vaccine either)
3	1525869466	4	Exactly. The more comments I read on reddit, the more I realize people are extreeemely deluded. Gates is a savage, along with Buffet
4	1525883456	1	Didn’t he promise to donate 99% of his wealth to charity?
5	1525886715	1	If you consider the "Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation" a trustworthy charity.
3	1525851211	0	link please
1	1525865470	3	You might (not) want to read The Tyranny of Experts.
0	1525832665	5	He just did as Warren Buffett’s team told him to say or he wasn’t getting his yearly charitable donations to save the world. It’s obvious when they all made the same comments within 2 day period. Talk about collision. Just buy the dip they caused. 
0	1525861856	4	Bill talking billshit...
0	1525839597	7	Who in the right mind tells Bill Gates to put his money where his mouth is? The facebook wannabe twin who has 1/100th of \(probably a little less\) his wealth? Lol. To fact check some of you below, Gates is not with 50 mil; he's actually north of 90mil and considering trusts, assets, and yonder... probably \>100 mil. Bill and Melinda Gates have single handedly saved more lives and eradicated more lethal \(with much more to come\) viruses and diseases than everyone on Earth... combined. Lol. And they have just scratched the surface as they are testing methods that may one day provide clean water and useable energy for millions of poor and starving people all over the world.  So who talks shit about one of the most influential and important people to have every walked the Earth? r/bitcoin does, lol, because he made a comment that opposes our speculation of an unregulated, whale manipulated, exchange scammed, cryptocurrency. A\+.
1	1525842514	4	He has more than 100 million dollars?  Are you serious?  He must be one of the richest people in the world.  :/
2	1525846560	3	Technically hes correct.
3	1525864422	2	He has 90 billion ....
3	1525880631	1	lol, true
2	1525880918	1	He has billions! 100million isn't even part of the wealthy elite.
1	1525865942	1	Gates is only picking up steam the longer he does things. Expecting him to do a insane amount of great things for the world population in the next 20-30 years.
1	1525867381	1	But how much money and good stuff do you need to do before being in favour of eugenics is okay?
1	1525886303	1	Saving lives and eradicating lethal viruses is a separate topic. One can appreciate Bill Gates amazing contributions in this field, but vehemently disagree with statement he makes on a completely separate issue. Bill Gates didn't get to where he is without failure along the way nor on his own. A public figure like this should avoid discussing topics in the media unless he is ready to back it up. 
0	1525822010	2	Freedom is not liking something to.As far as the Winklevoss-ie... pffftt.
0	1525832727	2	Microsoft is one of the biggest sponsor of the ETH alliance. Bill Gates might not be in the CEO company anymore but the future is heading there and he previously talked about BTC with high regards. Warren Buffet always said that he never invest in an asset such as gold where the gains are there if someone will be willing to pay more in the future for it (aka majority of coins now), plus he rarely invest in tech so why should he differ now. I am personally a huge crypto supporter and investor since early 2014 but give the man some slack. They both have been remarkable in what they did :)
0	1525841473	2	Bill is just holding warren’s hand helping him into the grave so he can take his money and throw it at charity that further adds to his own legacy.
0	1525868234	2	When billionaires play, it is hard to get involved in their games.
0	1525873958	1	Damn I wish I could become a billionaire because of a sham lawsuit and then act like I know how money works.The real reason gates and buffet are weary of bitcoin is because they don’t know who created it.  They are imagining the worst possible outcome. 
0	1525883378	1	How to lose $90 billion...Step 1:  short a small amount of bitcoin There is no step 2
0	1525886578	1	He better shoves 5% of his net worth in to a short position. I would respect his statement then
0	1525850188	0	Illuminati transgender Jew muppet confirmed 
0	1525820033	-3	How can you short bitcoin if you don't have it lol
1	1525823979	8	When you short, you borrow someone else's coin, then sell it instantly and try to rebuy it back cheaper and give the coin back to the person - profiting the difference in price.The catch is, you pay interest while holding that sold coin, so from the start you are already losing. In a basic example, say you borrow a lenders coin at $10k, you sell it. You are now holding $10k ready to rebuy cheaper, but you only have $5k collateral in your account (meaning you can only lose up to $5k of your money). Now the coin goes up to $11-12-13-14k. Once it hits $15k the exchange will close your position, **forcing** you to buy the coin at $15k, taking your $5k collateral (you lose $5k **plus** the interest holding the coin you sold.) So, bottom line is, when you short, you sell other people's coins, betting the price to go down to rebuy it cheaper and make the difference. 
2	1525827716	1	Which exchanges allow you to short without posting bitcoin as margined principle?  This is what OP is talking about, exchanges require Bitcoin as margin for a short trade.
3	1525828435	1	Ok, well I'll be honest I have never opened a short position, but I do lend some btc on Poloneix. Further looking into it, I see how it works as btc is used as collateral for margin trades on Poloneix. Are there no exchanges that allow USD as collateral, or is this why shorting on futures was so significant for shorting?
4	1525894488	1	It would be inadvisable for an exchange to allow collateral, that isn't the security that's being shorted, to be used.  If the prices increases dramatically, a short's position will need to be closed.  If a short trader only has USD balance as collateral, there's no guarantee that the exchange can liquidate the USD holdings into as much BTC as is owed to the lender.The fact that the person you replied to is being downvoted is worrying.  Looks like net effect is that most people don't understand how the markets work.
5	1525897008	1	I'm a little confused. If the person shorting has $5k collateral, and the exchange will liquidate at a certain percentage of that, won't the exchange just automatically buy the coin at the higher price with the shorter's $5k USD and pay back the coin to the lender? Isn't that the guarantee, that the exchange already has extra funds locked up to buy the coin when it shoots up? 
2	1525858517	1	I always thougt that short/longs are always symmetrical. So for every short position there should be a long? But in your example this does not have to be the case, right? Do I switch something up there or is your example the buyer of the coin the long position?Thinking about it, you need someone to bet against it so the person who takes the bet automatically takes a 'passive' long? So there could be a timeline where mr. Gates wants to short but there are not enough people to bet against it?
3	1525874818	2	When you go long you are doing the opposite, but you are borrowing cash this time not coins. You still get hit with an interest rate and are betting the price will shoot up. If it does, you can now close your position, selling the coin and paying back the loan and collecting the profits.I'm not sure exactly how exchanges balance the books, to make it so there are equal longs and shorts, but maybe they use their own funds, to allow a buyer to take out a loan or borrow a coin. But from what it sounds like, it's difficult to find an exchange, or any exchange for that matter to go long short like my examples, but the idea of what I'm explaining is how it works.
4	1525875145	1	I think I get the gist of it, thank you.
1	1525820999	6	Shorting is usually refered to lending it and then selling it opposed to just selling an asset that you already own
1	1525831455	1	You can short by selling futures contracts on CME or CBOE. This would be indirect as you don't borrow the actual asset, but works essentially the same way. Or, you can sell short on exchanges that offers margin trades. Both viable options. 
0	1525833678	-5	Bill Gates. Don't be evil. Microsoft just put the recycle old computer dealer to the federal prison for 15 months and $50,000 fine with the felony charges for the rest of his life.  Bill Gates is the hypocrite.  You make billions dollar by selling the softwares and the computers to American people.  You spent these billions dollar to help African nations, India, China.  Then you and Microsoft put ten thousands or hundred thousands of American people to the federal prison with your copyright infringement laws.  Why don't you go to African nations, India, China to sell your softwares at the price $100 per Microsoft Windows license, Microsoft Office license and $1000 Surface Pro computer?  Bill Gates, you go to China and enforce your crappy copyright with the Chinese government.  Please don't be evil to the American people.
