1	1525873102	1	it sounds like Ron Weasley just made up a new spell
1	1525879857	1	Lol I just noticed what you're talking about... Damn I f'ed up. Sorry sensei.
0	1525836882	10	Dis how I feel right now...
1	1525841047	7	Just start not caring. It's easier than it seems 😁
2	1525872201	1	It is easy when you only invest money that you can afford to lose. There are a lot of people in this space which don't follow that rule.
1	1525842818	6	It only went down like $700 this month. It is still over 9000.  That was a big deal a couple weeks ago.  It'll head back up.  
1	1525857340	4	if you actually bought all the dips youd be pretty damn happy right now... seeing as it was like 6k just a couple weeks ago and now its above 9k...
2	1525872463	1	nice hindsight comment. If he really bought all the dips he would have a cost average around 11k now. If you start from 19k  If you use hindsight why not buy 100&#37; at 6k ?  You already pay 50&#37; more now.
3	1525873035	2	ive bought almost all the dips... sadly i was on vacation during the 6k dip... yes the average is higher, but you dont have to sell everything all at once... i bought some at 7k and sold at 10k, rebought at 9k... the ones i bought at 11k? those i just hodl longterm my comment wasnt even banking on hindsight, you just buy the dips and your average will come down to below the current price as long as you keep doing it and you dont blow your load early (also it actually has to be a dip)edit: also doing some very rough napkin math lookin at the chart i count 6-7 dips and come up with an average of around 9500 if you bought 1 btc each dip
4	1525874498	1	kk maybe I read your post a bit wrong. Sounded to me like "if you bought every dip from 6k on you would be really happy now"Ye maybe 9.5k I mean you can't always tell where the dip ends or if it is dip anyway. and ye If you were able to recognise crash pattern you would have sit out quite a bit of the downmove.So I guess it would be more a range from 7k\-12k.I mean on the bigger scale you can't even tell if the current dip ended already.
5	1525879612	1	>I mean on the bigger scale you can't even tell if the current dip ended already.definitly, dips are relative
0	1525851451	12	Any time you buy below 19500 is a dip as far as I'm concerned. We're just in one big dip.
1	1525872878	1	Ye helps to keep zoom out. Like I wrote not a trading chart but if helps to stay relaxed when you can't barely see this daily movements on the bigger timeframe.
