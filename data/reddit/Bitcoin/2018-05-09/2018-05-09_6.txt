0	1525840686	20	Given that we are heading towards a society of education and taxation vs the failed society of prohibition and gangsters; can we expect to see Ross receive amnesty? Sadly I don‚Äôt think so. Ross was taken down for his threat to the status quo not for breaking the law; the punishment far outweighs the crime. Make no mistake a double life sentence for such a young man is death sentence. This is so wrong but I see no solution.
1	1525873888	1	And what about him hiring a hit man to kill an employee? And don‚Äôt tell me you believe that he was framed. And then what about offering bribes to his arresting officers to let him go?
2	1525874259	10	Never proven in court ==> assumption of innocence.
3	1525875724	-2	Except the court found the evidence ‚Äúample and unambiguous‚Äù and gave him a life sentence instead of treating him like a regular drug dealer for this very reason: https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i1v0w/_/dyp2v5r/?context=1Do you guys even bother checking the stuff you read or is perpetuating bullshit a kind of a hobby?
4	1525879801	3	Linking to your own comment is stupid and proves nothing. Your comment is meaningless and it is you who is perpetuating bullshit.Like a "regular drug dealer"? What fucking world are you even living in? Go pander to the police serving injustice for "crimes" without any victims in some other sub.He was _never_ proven guilty or even charged with any murder for hire schemes. Canada said they couldn't even find any "victims" with the names given!
5	1525880165	1	What is meaningless about the comment? Are you denying that the judge determined that he had indeed hired hitmen to kill five? I couldn‚Äôt give a flying shit what Canada said.You are more then welcome to fuck off yourself, sunshine. This is /r/Bitcoin, not /r/defendingscum.
6	1525883606	0	Honestly, you really have no idea what you are talking about. No judge "determined" he hired anyone to kill anyone.Learn about the US legal system before opening your mouth, please.
7	1525884039	1	>	The district court characterized the evidence of the murders for hire, which included Ulbricht's journal, chats with other Silk Road users, and the evidence showing that Ulbricht actually paid a total of $650,000 in Bitcoins for the killings, as ‚Äúample and unambiguous.‚ÄùTell me what this means, because Ross knows very well what it means for his anus in the long run. It‚Äôs amazing how there is this endless stream of retards who change their argument from ‚Äúno charges‚Äù to ‚Äúdismissed charges‚Äù to ‚Äúthe whole trial was illegal‚Äù in a matter of a few posts. You want to tell me to learn about Bitcoin before posting next?
8	1525887081	1	I also find it funny how his defense lawyer never filed a complaint against the judge or any mistrial, but the genius armchair lawyers of Reddit know it was an illegal trial. 
9	1525893782	1	Uh... Yes they did, it was denied. https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/02/judge-shuts-door-on-attempt-to-get-a-new-trial-for-ross-ulbricht/
2	1525875048	3	The fact that you're using something that wasn't proven in court to deny the injustice just shows how easily manipulated people are. 
1	1525854982	-5	Who stood to gain from his prosecution? 
2	1525865198	9	Drug War
0	1525829721	41	Life in prison for victimless crimes. Absurd. 
1	1525870914	6	Didn't he try to hire a Hitman?
2	1525871780	2	No, this was fake so that Ross would loose all his supporters, and it worked. All murder for hire charges where dropped by the state soon after his arrest but people keep bringing it up.
3	1525873404	7	Interesting that they are still present in his sentence ü§î: https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i1v0w/_/dyp2v5r/?context=1 It‚Äôs almost as if you are full of shit. 
4	1525878556	6	No, they‚Äôre not. The state used this as a way for Ross to not have bail posted and as a way to get a harsher sentence. The charges and ‚Äúevidence‚Äù were brought up but Ulbricht was never convicted for A SINGLE ONE of these charges. 
5	1525878919	-2	Because he was sentenced in a different state, dipshit. Furthermore, the charges **were** used to determine his sentence, which is why he got life in the first place. There are no two ways about it, unless you want to make a conspiracy theory out of it.
6	1525880120	3	What are you going on about? When I say ‚Äúthe state,‚Äù that is another term for ‚ÄúUS government.‚Äù It does not matter what state he was prosecuted or sentenced in as it was US v Ulbricht (shown in the title of the case you conveniently linked). Federal investigation, federal charges, federal prosecutor. Nothing state based about it.Furthermore, you can‚Äôt use a charge to determine a sentence unless you can PROVE it. Ever heard of the term ‚Äúinnocent until proven guilty?‚Äù Also, the charges must be proven ‚Äúbeyond a reasonable doubt‚Äù for a criminal case. If they truly had the charges to lock him up for these crimes, trust me, they would have. 
7	1525880565	1	The charges in Maryland have not been dismissed, but we are dancing around the issue here: Has the judge determined that there is ‚Äúample and unambiguous evidence‚Äù that Ulbricht paid for five hits and has the said determination been used to determine the severity of his sentence? Yes or no?E: Mark your edits as edits.>	you can‚Äôt use a charge to determine a sentence unless you can PROVE itIndeed, which is why you should shut the fuck up before you read his fucking sentence. I don‚Äôt need to trust you, random user on reddit, there is a federal document that states that he was sentenced for life precisely because the judge determined that he had hired the hitmen. I have linked you to a legal commentary for the said document, but you are more than welcome to read the original. I have.
8	1525894042	1	>Has the judge determined that there is ‚Äúample and unambiguous evidence‚ÄùExcept for the fact that you have a right to a trial of your peers, not just a judge. He was never convicted of these crimes, and even if a judge feels like there is ample evidence it doesn't mean he did it, until a jury finds him guilty of those crimes he is innocent on those charges
2	1525882127	1	Yes, he did. 
1	1525878174	2	He was a drug kingpin and he himself admitted it.
1	1525868416	3	Victimless?  Didn‚Äôt he attempt to have someone killed?  
2	1525871005	3	Multiple people is my understanding...  Well realistically I just read it in American Kingpin and probably lots of stuff in the book isn't true.
3	1525871795	7	One associate and three bystanders. It‚Äôs all in the court record. E: Sorry, four bystanders. >	At the sentencing hearing, the district court resolved several disputed issues of fact. For example, because Ulbricht contested his responsibility for the five commissioned murders for hire, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Ulbricht did in fact commission the murders, believing that they would be carried out. **The district court characterized the evidence of the murders for hire**, which included Ulbricht's journal, chats with other Silk Road users, and the evidence showing that Ulbricht actually paid a total of $650,000 in Bitcoins for the killings, **as ‚Äúample and unambiguous.‚Äù** App'x 1465.https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1862572.htmlE2: Oh no, it‚Äôs three bystanders after all. The other hit was on someone else entirely that managed to piss off our cherub here. 
4	1525873146	0	Ok thanks. People are telling me it wasn't he who started the Armory either and now I don't know what to believe aha 
2	1525871614	5	No, this was fake so that Ross would loose all his supporters, and it worked. All murder for hire charges where dropped by the state soon after his arrest but people keep bringing it up.
2	1525871045	3	He wasn't convicted of that.
1	1525872770	1	Victimless? He created a market where drug cartels could sell even more drugs and get even more power. Let's keep giving cartels more money that's a good idea... If you think there's no victim from Silk Road you are being retarded AF.You could argue that prohibition gives cartels lots of power too and you're right. That doesn't excuse what he did though. 
2	1525874896	12	Actually, online drug markets probably did a lot more harm to drug cartels by breaking up the local and regional monopolies they had. He introduced black market globalization to every person with an internet connection and computer.Every actor in the drug war was perfectly happy with the way things were going until he changed things, and it made the state appear neutered and the cartels see a massive increase in competition.I'm actually more surprised he made it to trial alive than the fact that he was ever prosecuted.I hope one day he sees his freedom, or at least a fair trial.
2	1525879796	3	true!
2	1525878228	4	The way those markets are set up is actually extraordinary. There is a messaging system, there is escrow to keep your funds safe until your order arrives, there is a review system where you can review the product after you get it, and there are numerous online forums where people discuss drug safety, the purity of the drugs from different vendors, and many many other helpful resources. These are things that you‚Äôll never be able to get buying from a street dealer who gets their drugs from a cartel distributor. Plus, an online, anonymous marketplace takes away the risk of being injured and greatly reduces the risk of being robbed while purchasing these drugs. The biggest downside the markets have is how quickly people can import dangerous drugs for the intention of cutting their product. [Carfentanil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carfentanil) is 10,000 times as potent as morphine and can kill A LOT of people. This drug, along with its weaker but more popular sibling [fentanyl,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl) have been imported into the US at alarming rates recently. 
3	1525878235	1	**Carfentanil**Carfentanil or carfentanyl is an analog of the synthetic opioid analgesic fentanyl. A unit of carfentanil is 100 times as potent as the same amount of fentanyl, 5,000 times as potent as a unit of heroin and 10,000 times as potent as a unit of morphine.The toxicity of carfentanil in humans and its ready commercial availability has aroused concerns over its potential use as a weapon of mass destruction by rogue nations and terrorist groups.Carfentanil was first synthesized in 1974 by a team of chemists at Janssen Pharmaceutica which included Paul Janssen.*****Fentanyl**Fentanyl, also spelled fentanil, is an opioid which is used as a pain medication and together with other medications for anesthesia. It has a rapid onset and effects generally last less than an hour or two. Fentanyl is available in a number of forms including by injection, as a skin patch, and to be absorbed through the tissues inside the mouth.Common side effects include nausea, constipation, sleepiness, and confusion.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

2	1525875118	1	Sovereignty over your own mind and body is freedom. 
2	1525874641	-1	Cartels lol. The top sellers were a variety of individuals.
3	1525880254	3	And where do you think these variety of individuals got their drugs from? At the top of the drug chain it's all cartels. This just created another supply chain for them.
1	1525879682	1	everything is relative...
1	1525839499	-15	It was beyond brazen of him to run a multi-million dollar online drug bazaar.  An example has to be set.  If people were allowed to get off on a light sentence for an illegal operation of this scale, others may follow and commit far more heinous crimes on the darknet.
2	1525852625	11	You‚Äôre making serious serious assumptions. And the reason these things are so heinous is because they are ‚Äúillegal.‚Äù If we actually lived in a free society, many of these activities wouldn‚Äôt exist and the ones that did would be far safer. 
3	1525866183	5	Precisely. I wonder if /u/racc00ndawg shares the same views about people that sell alcohol \- effectively poison to the human body. People's views on these things are skewed by the absurd laws in place. 
4	1525871111	5	2017: the year people who should hate Bitcoin started buying bitcoin.
2	1525854311	7	> If people were allowed to get off on a light sentence for an illegal operation of this scale, others may follow and commit far more heinous crimes on the darknet.LOL! You really don't follow much do you? You don't even have to do much digging to realise Ross was pretty much a boy scout compared to some ppl in the (dark)web.Setting an example is a stupid argument for the sentence. Others follow regardless! It may scare some people, but most likely it just drives the markets to the hands of people that are already criminals who couldn't care less about the safety of the people using the service.
2	1525844924	4	Your right, they had to make an example. As for the crime; helping people bypass dodgy back street dealers and the crime/drug rings that surround them.People use technology for bad things, but they get used for MORE good things.
2	1525870194	5	Ya, nobody is allowed to run illegal drug bazaars except the CIA
2	1525867588	1	And now there are many of these bazaars. The ‚Äúexample‚Äù did nothing but destroy the life of a good person. 
3	1525869767	1	You have a very interesting definition of a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù. 
2	1525863852	3	crazy how people react to you. you obviously pointed out the position of the judge.lol redditors are more and more stupid
3	1525864659	1	He said it like it's his opinion. Setting an example is not going to help at all, but can make things worse. Poor judge.
4	1525865199	1	he pointed out what the judge were thinking. you can disagree, but it is an important argument in this discussion. if you think it is his opinion, fine you can think like this. but in reallity it is the argumentation of the judges. a quite comprehensible argumentation aswell.
5	1525865674	1	I just read again what he wrote. It's obviou he is just voicing his opinion. There is nothing wrong with that. I [replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i1v0w/let_us_never_forget_about_ross_ulbricht/dyosz3e?utm_source=reddit-android) to him with my own opinion where I disagree with his.  [/meta]
6	1525865839	3	this can go on forever. this dudes opinion (if he was not just qouting the judges) is the same as the judges opinion.they both kind of suck and are kind of comprehensible. 
7	1525865941	2	Sure. I'm not arguing that. Don't know what the point of your comment was though.
8	1525866779	1	originally it was about his massive downvotes and all the "fuck you" reactions. i out of here. freeross, and have a good one sir
9	1525867862	3	Ah, sorry. Maybe I just misunderstood your comment then. I agree with you about  "fuck you" comments and downvoting. I should get some sleep..
2	1525863603	1	> An example has to be set.That is not how justice works. Every case should be judged on its own merits.Setting examples is back to barbarism.
2	1525859249	-2	Fuck off
2	1525863486	0	Examples? How about affluenza kid, are you activing protesting him getting off killing people because he was "too rich to know better"?
2	1525875119	0	They already have and probably learned a lot from Ross's mistakes.Face it, buying drugs online is as easy to do technically, and safe to do legally as pirating copyrighted material.
1	1525831937	-13	An online drug bazaar is not synonymous with victimless crime.. Plenty of people probably died of OD and plenty of others ripped off or sold counterfeit product. Buyer beware and all that is bullshit so you can't play that card. Whether he facilitated the sale of narcotics or contraband directly or indirectly, victims were subsequently created as a direct result of the creation of silkroad. I don't fully agree with the sentence but there certainly were victims.
2	1525833026	16	Whose rights were violated? Whose person or property was attacked or stolen by silk road?
3	1525849483	4	You realize that vendors on SR and it's clones also peddle items like stolen credit cards and identity documents right.Do you think that these are victimless crimes?
4	1525851305	8	So if a bad person meets someone through craigslist and rapes and murders them... does that mean we need to give creator of craigslist a life sentence?
5	1525866769	7	Completely irrelevant. Is craigslist's business model to facilitate and profit from the sale of narcotics and other illegal items? Do they not have a responsibility to moderate the content posted via their platform?
4	1525861522	1	Nope. Clearly victims there. DPR didn't steal them, or sell stolen items. He didn't do anything to create victims, and even if you make the case that he's an accessory to those things, how is a life sentence a fitting punishment?
5	1525866106	2	He profited (greatly) from providing a marketplace that peddled illegal items.Say I create a physical shop specifically so that people buy and sell illegal items, and I skim a portion of each transaction, am I innocent?To say that he did not get a fitting punishment is to gloss over the wider effects on the community of his actions. Do you know how many mom and pop shops face financial ruin due to, say, their pos systems being compromised by carders?
6	1525866748	1	All of those things that were to be used to harm or defraud another were explicitly disallowed by Silk Road.Silk road was about drugs and fake IDs, not credit cards and hitmen. Any time it was used for such was akin to Craigs list being used for murder.
7	1525871305	1	Uhh didn't he also start the Armory that sold guns and other weapons? 
8	1525871753	2	That was someone else
9	1525872944	1	Really? Is much of the stuff in the book 'American Kingpin' known to be bullshit?
8	1525871749	1	What's your point? Weapons are just tools with no inherent morality. Walmart sells guns too; should they be held responsible for what people do with them?Doesn't matter.
9	1525872860	2	My point was that the statement "All of those things that were to be used to harm or defraud another were explicitly disallowed by Silk Road" is extremely misleading. He just separated guns etc to a different website.
7	1525867207	1	Fake identity documents are fraudulent by their very definition.
8	1525867846	3	Only if it's used to steal something from someone. Using it to assume an identity that doesn't belong to anyone is not fraudulent
9	1525890109	1	fraudulent - obtained, done by, or involving deception, especially criminal deception.synonyms: dishonest, cheating, swindling, corrupt, criminal, illegal, unlawful, illicit, against the lawUsing fake identity documents to assume a false identity fits that definition. Not sure what planet you're on.
5	1525871724	1	Especially when the creator of SR 2 only got a fee months
4	1525871678	1	These items were not allowed on SR
3	1525833414	-1	Indiscriminate sale of drugs leads to access for minors, addicts and date rapists etc... At least the neighborhood salesman doesn't hand it off to literally the 'wrong person'. Like I said the dealers who sell to kids often get treated like pedophiles in prison and on the street in gangs. You get assaulted or murdered for it. With darknet anonymity you don't even know who the fuck you are selling to...
4	1525833791	13	So what you're saying is that some people might get hurt because of the choices they've decided to make with their own bodies, and that makes it so that someone else is somehow violating them? Is that right? 
5	1525834154	0	Nope, I am saying completely anonymous access to narcotics and contraband by literally anyone and everyone is dangerous and reckless. DPR knew the risks just like everyone doing drugs should know the risks. He overdosed on liberty and now he's paying for it with his life.
6	1525835408	6	I don't disagree with anything you just said.  My point is that the only person who has been violated by another person in this story, thus being a victim, was Ross Ulbricht.I thought you were saying something that made no sense. Thanks for clearing that up! 
6	1525853971	3	> Nope, I am saying completely anonymous access to narcotics and contraband by literally anyone and everyone is dangerous and reckless.Do you mean to honestly tell me that street drug dealers are selective with their customers because they have morals?  Just how clueless are you?
7	1525893551	1	Actually yes. Children under say 13 will generally be off limits. Gangs self regulate and target people who break rules whether you are a member of the gang, a rival gang or not a gang member at all. Aside from that the average person may overlook a dealer selling to adults in their neighbor(hood) but if that someone is selling to children that person is effectively outcast on a persnal level from their community. Police will act with extra pregidous against such a dealer and even other criminals in prison will target them if word gets out. You might as well be a child murderer or child rapist if you sell any sort of narcotic to a child.
4	1525854736	3	> Indiscriminate sale of drugs leads to access for minorsI think this is the wrong way to think about it.The abundance of birth control doesnt lead to the rate of teen pregnancy. Teens will have sex regardless of that. The ones that won't either made the choice, or arent because they dont have access to sex and will when they can (maybe as adults, thus not falling into your statistic). Its the same thing for drug use.A teen decides to try drugs. most of the time they aren't pushed onto them. the availability doesn't have anything to do with it. I have been to plenty of parties where people are having fun socializing, drugs come out, and people generally are fine saying no and still being part of the social activities. Others might want to but cant, then do later in life... regardless of if your the young adult trying something new, or the kid at a party interested in something - the important part is we teach how to research, test your drugs, limit your intake, and wait for the effects before trying more.
5	1525893211	1	That's what the neighborhood dealer is for. As far as selling to 'kids' goes only the dirtiest scumbag would sell to a child, whereas teens whether one considers them 'children' or not are known to experiment with drugs as a demographic. A dealer who actually does sell to kids is not accepted by general society or the law obviously, but even within ranks of criminality. A gang on the street or in prison would murder someone they knew was selling to actual children. They do exist but are few and far between. Even most criminals have a conscience. This is why child molesters are regularly murdered in prison and must be kept separate from the general prisoner population. It's almost a self regulating industry.
2	1525833329	20	Unless a dealer is lacing his drugs without telling his customers, leading to death because of dosing confusion, then it's not a drug dealer's fault for the death of his clients.Doing drugs is a personal choice.  If you choose to do drugs, and die, that is no one's fault but your own.  It would be like blaming a liquor store because a guy buys a handle of vodka and chugs it back at home, dying of alcohol poisoning.Selling a product to a customer is absolutely victimless.  What happens afterwards is not the fault of the merchant, as long as the sale was voluntary entered into by both the buyer and seller.
3	1525833555	2	Not if you sell anonymously. Minors, addicts and date rapists are a few groups of people who should be denied access to illicit materials and narcotics at all cost even by the most despicable of drug dealers.
4	1525875195	3	>Not if you sell anonymously. Minors, addicts and date rapists are a few groups of people who should be denied access to illicit materials and narcotics at all cost even by the most despicable of drug dealers.Alcohol is the most common date rape drug. Are liquor store owners equally at fault? 
5	1525895324	1	Since you want to get specific let me ask you; if you knew a liqor store owner who sold to anyone including children without regard on a regular basis would you say that's okay? 
4	1525841869	4	A dealer's biggest customer on the street is often addicts, no difference.
3	1525849272	0	So you'd be absolutely fine with someone dealing drugs to your kids then?Because AFAIK, darknet marketplaces don't exactly do KYC checks.Or say I sell you a car with a malfunctioning air bag? Are you also personally responsible?
4	1525852833	5	Yes. Thats how free markets work. They are your kids, and its your job to protect them. Not the governments. As soon as word spreads that you sell cars with malfunctioning airbags, how many people will buy from you? You‚Äôll go out of business. It would be seriously against your self interest to sell cars with faulty airbags. 
5	1525894815	1	Dude who sold defective airbags broke laws and goes to prison re: modern society.. The unsuspecting victim who died as a result of his illegal sale of an unsafe car has no recourse.. Unacceptable actions have consequences. The only variable is the person committing said crimes. Responsibility is shared and trust is leveraged in all aspects of any transaction. Bad actors are recognized and weeded out. It doesn't make any of what they did okay or acceptable nor does their failure to get away with their crime somehow shift responsibility onto the buyer or their guardian... 
5	1525866500	1	To say that the government has no role in protecting kids is ludicrous. If your kids get kidnapped or molested you're not expecting any assistance from the government because muh free market? Good luck with that.You realize that on the darknet if you fuck your customers over you can simply rebrand under a new pseudonym and setup shop again. Exit scams are rife. In the real world, it's much harder to do.
4	1525853795	4	> Because AFAIK, darknet marketplaces don't exactly do KYC checks.> Do you think that the street dealer does KYC or quality control?  Get real.  He'll probably rob you if he thinks you're a pussy.
5	1525895088	1	Yeah but he won't rob or kill a child and if he would / does usually society at large including his own treacherous homies will turn on him.. Child molesters and abusers get murdered on the street and in prison regularly. It's common knowledge if you harm a child you will be a target. This goes universally for any place on earth. Nobody in the world bar his own worthless cunt militia and maybe some terrorist groups would harbor or sanction Joseph Kony. We all just want him dead.
4	1525866696	1	>So you'd be absolutely fine with someone dealing drugs to your kids then?No. The question is, if my kids do end up choosing to buy drugs, I'd rather them not be thrown in jail. I'd rather be free to punish them as their parent. Additionally, I'd rather them not die. So I'd rather them buy safely online, where dealers have reviews, and drug quality is tested and discussed on dark market forums, as opposed to them getting a hot load laced with carfentynol from a street dealer. I'm their parent, not the state. I will deal with them, parent them correctly, and make sure they don't use drugs in the first place. 
2	1525832263	29	The quality of drugs from the Silk Road were higher than street drugs (according to academic studies) meaning fewer overdoses. Also there were no turf wars online.It's almost certainly the case that the Silk Road reduced violence overall. Prohibition causes violence and poor quality, dangerous drugs.
3	1525849309	5	No turf wars online? You must be naive.
3	1525851939	0	This is the dumbest shit I've read all day
3	1525842676	-8	I would downvote twice if I could
4	1525851994	3	You could buy downvote bots from Silk Road.
3	1525832826	-16	Lol so you think because the drugs were clean people didn't overdose? Would you care to link these supposed 'academic studies'? Rofl.. Darknet markets can easily be accessed and used by minors wherein only the lowest form of criminal scum would sell to a child. Those dealers are actually murdered in prison. With a darknet market you don't even know who you are selling to. There is manufactured complacency built in to go along with this level of anonymity. 
4	1525833289	28	There are several studies about this and I won't waste my time searching for them all:https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160211/09001033575/how-dark-net-is-making-drug-purchases-safer-eliminating-associated-violence-improving-quality.shtml>But think of the children!The hallmark of someone who has no argument. Kids buy drugs on the streets too. Prohibition is a failure. 
5	1525834794	-4	Where in the article does it say that better quality drugs leads to fewer overdoses? I dont see it.
6	1525847739	1	It‚Äôs kind of common knowledge, even me who grew up in a ultra conservative Christian family and who never touched drugs know that. You know that if you‚Äôve been to school after 2010.
7	1525852145	0	By "you know that" you probably mean "you heard that".I don't say you're wrong, but I think a lot of this thread consists of confirmation bias.
8	1525857398	3	knowing exactly what your putting in your body makes it a lot easier to use the right amount and not OD... with street drugs you never quite know what you are getting so the chance of misjudging the amount/potency and ODing is way higherjust look at the whole fentanyl situation and youll understand
9	1525857647	2	This comment has no relation to mine. I wasn't talking about overdosing but about confirmation bias.While we're at it:> knowing exactly what your putting in your body How do you "know exactly what" just because you bought it online?To gain knowledge, you have to research, not trust. You have to test your substance.This can be done with both street and online drugs.---I am fully aware that the streets are dirty. I'm not arguing against that.I simply state that it's not "knowing" because everybody (rightfully) says so.
5	1525833980	-8	Yeah so let's open access to anyone with the ability to navigate a smartphone and the internet right? Foh, even alcohol sale is controlled for a reason. People can OD if they want but when you try to hawk any old shit anon you cross lines. You can't expect to go unmolested by society at large for that let alone the feds and local authorities.. Even the govts of other countries.. Dude took risks and got sent to prison for it. Is he a hero? Depends on who you ask. For the most part you will hear a resounding "no" outside any place not heavily biased by people who think like you.
6	1525834194	17	I didn't say he was a hero. I said it was absurd he was sentenced to life in prison for victimless crimes.
6	1525839440	10	I get the feeling /u/RallyUp is LE. 
7	1525854184	4	Or he thinks that the war on drugs is somehow winnable.
8	1525893728	1	War on drugs? This was an anon drug bazaar run by a kid with the worst OPSEC in history. He literally waved a big red flag at the feds with his hands dripping of the same hue. Guy was an idiot and idiots deserve what they get.
7	1525893828	1	That's a bad feeling partner, I've never been govt or LEO but I have been arrested and jailed. So the literal opposite actually.
6	1525853028	6	People like us? People who enjoy personal responsibility and freedom? We should have privately funded education programs to show people the effects of drugs and addiction. Throwing them in cages is barbaric and solves exactly nothing. Otherwise, this problem would have been eradicated by now. 
4	1525835320	6	>Those dealers are actually murdered in prisonSays the guy that has never been to prison...
5	1525837977	5	The worst part about prison is the dementors
5	1525894183	1	It's common knowledge? Also I spent 4 days in a central facility pending a bail hearing and while it's not prison, you still reaching with claims about a person you don't know literally anything about. You seem the type that would by anon drugs and pop them indiscriminately. The type that would probably die of an OD.
4	1525838904	5	>Rofl.. Darknet markets can easily be accessed and used by minors wherein only the lowest form of criminal scum would sell to a child.       How many children have bought and overdosed on drugs through the dark web?    
5	1525868371	1	There were several ODs, although you'd have to read the court case to figure out if any were minors.  [Vice News mentions one death of a minor](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/539ey3/the-heartbreaking-letters-from-families-of-silk-road-overdose-victims), although not exactly an OD, more of a bad trip.  
5	1525885881	1	>How many children have bought and overdosed on drugs through the dark web?How many children have bought and overdosed on drugs from some shady street thug in an alley?  What's your point again?
6	1525891004	1	My point is /u/RallyUp is over here throwing a hissy fit about children getting drugs from silk road acting like it's some epidemic destroying the youth of today when in fact there is little to no data to support his emotionally based claim. 
7	1525893975	1	It's the fact that anon access opens the door to his type of shit *at all* with basically no recourse. Thankfully they caught dingus in the act of running his bazaar and closed him down albeit subsequent markets were and always will exist.
2	1525852692	4	I hate drugs. They are evil. But the government locking people in cages is also evil, equally, if not moreso. 
2	1525867660	3	Ross probably saved lives... drugs on Silk Road came from rated sellers, far safer than buying random drugs in a back alley.
3	1525892332	1	Yeah they also came from people not afraid to lace drugs or sell counterfeit shit like fentanyl with filler in the shape of oxycontin pills. Anonymously, no less. So literally anyone can gain access to the drugs, contraband, illicit materials and even weapons when the armory was up and running. 'Probably saved lives' vs proven to be actively seeking and engaging in attempt murder for hire.. Sounds like he was a nice guy.  He was not a hero and he was too young, dumb and naive to understand the implications of what he was doing. That goes for all the people who used Silkroad as well as Ulbricht himself. His OPSEC was so poor he literally got caught red handed in a fucking public library of all places. The most that can be said about what he accomplished in passing is that Silkroad was a cool experiment but he definitely isn't a hero and the crimes certainly were not victimless.
4	1525897017	1	>Yeah they also came from people not afraid to lace drugs or sell counterfeit shit like fentanyl with filler in the shape of oxycontin pillsActually thats much more likely with a street dealer. Street dealers don't have reviews and often have a monopoly on a certain area. Online dealers rely on reviews and doing something like what you're saying would jeopardize their whole business. A street dealer doing that barely jeopardizes anything. 
5	1525898361	1	Reviews don't mean shit when a Chinese seller can ship a 2lb bag of Fentanyl to anyone, anywhere anonymously. The street is self regulating in it's own way. Anyone selling bad junk or selling to kids for instance becomes a target of gangs and certainly the average mope on the street, not to mention cops who will treat these types of dealer wih extra pregidous. Only the lowest level of scum attempt to run their business unrestricted. They are oft junkies themselves or hardened lone wolf types and they never fare well, not even among their own kind. They are robbed, beaten and killed by those who actually know how to run an operation or they end up being caught. There are certain things that make you an all around target to *everyone* and nobody survives in that situation for long.
2	1525853647	2	People that do drugs are going to do them, weather they have to meet in a dark alley or buy them online.  The Silk Road didn't create more drug users, it only facilitated the folks already using drugs.  How many victims were robbed, killed by street dealers before thee Silk Road?  How many victims died because the quality control of the heroin they bought on the street didn't pass muster?Your argument is stupid.  You probably think the war on drugs is a good idea and it's going well.
2	1525854063	2	Hey there RallyUp, i see your getting a lot of down votes and people who are attacking you in the comments. First off, not cool. When we disagree with someone we should lay out our counter argument to their idea, not attack them as a person.with that being said, i would love to provide my first hand experience with the market place. Feel free to look at my post history, I was widely active in the harm reduction scene a few years back and tried to take an academic stance to drug usage, and often took quite a lot myself.___The top claim that plenty of people died of an OD / tons of counterfeit product is completely wrong. The largest cause of drug overdose is adulteration where users buy a drug thinking its pure substance X, then taking a large but normal dose and having it end up be a mix of X and Y with some cutting agent. The dose response of Y might be different which can lead to bad side effects. You see this a lot with street drugs (such as fentanyl laced heroin, which is near impossible to mix evenly)... the good news is, that the original sink road had almost none of this. I say almost because i cant speak to an absolute here, but i never talked to anyone that tested dnm drugs that were not sold accurately, nor did i experience that myself. There was a very rigid review system in place where anything other than the most stellar reviews would be a death sentence to the vendors sales. There were even anonymous groups in the forums that would buy random vendors LSD (which is probably the most counterfeit psychedelic) and rate the vendors on how much they over sold the dosage and what the lab tests came back as (a lot were even GC/MS tests so you knew beyond a doubt it was real).
2	1525865186	1	Far more people die of cheese burger and tobacco related deaths in the US, heart disease being the number one killer, but no one is trying to kidnap Ronald McDonald. Engaging in known dangerous activities doesn‚Äôt make you a victim. Dale Earnheart was no more a victim than your average OD victim. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we have real victims dyeing of overdoses right now but 80% of them started out in a Doctors office. Seems a bit hypocritical that the government would stand behind doctors and prosecute Ross. As for getting ripped off or sold shotty products, I would be interested in seeing what the customer scarification rating was for sikroads vs eBay.  Something tells me they would be pretty close to one another seeing as both have to rely on their reputation to survive. 
3	1525892786	1	The individual sale to average Jack and Jill are subsequent to the massive orders of things like fentanyl which then go on to be used in counterfeit products and sold on the street which contributes to the epidemic of deaths caused by fentanyl in all capacity. Silkroad was a portal to the Chinese seller who gave no fucks thus unto the street dealer who gives no fucks and finally the user who does give fucks but dies anyway.    Anon sale itself is janky to begin with, wherein you have no idea who you sold to nor does the person buying have an ounce of recourse other than a review or rating should something be wrong. Dead people can't write reviews or give bad ratings anyway.
4	1525897265	1	Dead people can't go after their street dealers either, so what's your point? 
2	1525865310	1	Ya, I hope Ross rots in jail...a year for every person he forced to take drugs.
3	1525892391	1	His own stupidity and lack of precaution took care of that.

1	1525830183	-17	He hired a professional killer, no?
2	1525830307	27	No. Not only was he not convicted of that but he wasn't even charged, and therefore had no opportunity to defend against the claim.
3	1525861028	-4	Lol, he was charged. There are literally court records listing the the charge one google search away, yet this bullshit is still continuously being repeated on this sub. Dude is a fucking peace of shit and got what he deserves. He also did defend himself, by saying that he was just RPing. E: https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i1v0w/_/dyp2v5r/?context=1
4	1525878631	0	Calm down child, he was initially charged with procuring murder, but it was later removed from the indictment. This was prior to the trial, so it never was produced during hearings, but it did factor into his sentencing for some reason.
5	1525879303	0	Different state, ‚Äúchild‚Äù, where the charges are still on standing. If you are going to protect a murderous piece of shit because he used Bitcoin at least do us all a favor and put a modicum of research into it that goes past his personal fan page. The is no reasonable doubt that he has payed for the hits and wanted people killed as is evident by the judge‚Äôs decision. 
6	1525886824	1	I'm not protecting him, just correcting you because you're angry child brain is amusing to me. 
2	1525830777	21	That fake charge was leaked so that people would be perfectly fine with locking him up, but without actually needing evidence in a court of law.
3	1525845360	7	Exactly. It's the oldest trick in the book. It's a message to all the young would be hacker rebels.
2	1525833535	17	That was just a cheap tactic by federal prosecutors.  They told media outlets that they were going to charge him with attempted murder, so that public opinion is formed.  Then when it comes to the court date, then don't even charge him, let alone convict him.Yet here we are still talking about the completely fabricated "attempted murder" change.  I guess the prosecutor's disgusting tactics worked.
3	1525834647	0	They made up the entire transcript?https://www.wired.com/2015/02/read-transcript-silk-roads-boss-ordering-5-assassinations/

5	1525851976	1	So is that chat log fabricated? Because in it Ross clearly says he would like to have the blackmailer killed and how much he is willing to pay.
6	1525867470	1	> So is that chat log fabricated?Yes, definitely. If not outright made up, multiple LEO had access to the DPR account where they could've typed that themselves. Carl Force was one of the officers with access.. look up how moral he was...

8	1525879141	0	Noone was talking about any of those things. But Carl Force had access to DPR bitcoins too.> just to make him look badYou say that like it's not what they do every day.
9	1525879779	2	I am genuinely curious what it would take for you to relinquish your position. The judge determining that there are no two ways about it? Not enough. The cunt in question himself not denying that he didn‚Äôt hire the hit men, but using ‚ÄúI was only pretending‚Äù as a defence? Not enough. Should Satoshi himself decent unto us and reveal it to you in a way that you can be absolutely sure. You are being downright ridiculous in your denialism. 
4	1525866779	1	A transcript exists. What does that have to do with Ross? If they had any evidence it was him, they would have easily gotten a conviction. I don't jugde people based on hearsay from the state. 
2	1525830263	15	No
0	1525870637	3	Although I can see that Ross is ONLY in jail for life for essentially getting the feds caught with their pants down, and I think Dark Net markets have probably taken a LOT of violence and other negativity out of the process of procuring illicit substances, I really don't think the bitcoin community should associate itself with the illicit drug underworld - something that has already been used against this technology. I kind of feel about him the same way I feel about the idiots being charged in Canada right now operating dispensaries for recreational use: It's still illegal. You knew the rules, you knew the risk. He only made the heaps of money because he acknowledged and took a tremendous risk.
0	1525830547	14	I think he probably did deserve some kind of punishment for facilitating illegal activities, but the punishment he got does not fit the "crime."  
1	1525833990	33	Illegal doesn't mean immoral.  In my opinion, he did absolutely nothing wrong.  In fact, I'd say he tried to make the world a better place.  People should be free to engage in voluntary trade, as long as no coercion is involved.  Buying drugs online is much safer than buying from street dealers, who are likely affiliated with gang violence.
2	1525853148	4	Illegal doesn‚Äôt mean immoral, true. Immoral is worse than illegal. I think he did many immoral things, but you‚Äôre spot on with free trade. 
3	1525864314	1	What are you talking about, immoral is neither better or worse than illegal. Illegal is objetive, immoral is subjective. He did illegal stuff and thus should be punished. 2 life sentences, is too much in my (and many others) subjective opinions.
4	1525872955	2	Actually... illegal is subjective. If you're a cop or judge, you can choose to uphold a law if you want. 
5	1525875895	1	Also, as a cop, you can arrest anyone for anything "you think is illegal". They're not beholden to know the laws they enforce.(These cases get thrown out, but they're good harassment tools)
5	1525875182	0	No, wheter is legal or not is written down and is immutable, what can change is the choice to enforce such laws or not, or the veridict of someone being guilty or not.If you steal, but the cop takes pitty on you and lets you go: Stealing is still illegal.
6	1525875324	2	The law is still up for interpretation, though. Some laws are less black and white than others.
7	1525875833	0	Hmm, can you give an example?
8	1525877641	2	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_interpretation
2	1525865168	3	I agree and think drugs should be legal.  BUT if you break the law and get caught, you should expect to be punished.  I think a few years in prison and big fines would have been appropriate, not life in prison.
3	1525885239	1	Also keep in mind that Ross is an Eagle Scout, has an MBA and absolutely clean record.
2	1525849959	0	Hate to argue, because I agree with you to an extent. But nothing wrong? The way he put out a hit to have a guy killed, combined with the cavalier disregard for life? He thought he was like a Walter White. That is a dangerous person. That being said, life without parole is outrageous- I cannot believe it has not been overturned on appeal. 
3	1525854568	5	The contract killing was fake news.he was not prosecuted for that. It was used as a smear which has worked very effectively amongst the general population at preventing an uproar over the outrageous sentence.
3	1525866079	4	>The way he put out a hit to have a guy killedI'm so sick of this bullshit lie. Not only was he never convicted of this, the prosecutor dropped that charge entirely because there was no evidence.  You can't judge him on that. Prosecutors do this regularly in big cases. They fabricate trumped up charges to sway public opinion, then never actually charge them.  But it seems to always work on the ignorant. Here we are years later and all you want to talk about are these fake murder charges. 
4	1525876391	0	Amazing insights from a true reddit law specialist. I had no idea that prosecutors could drop charges ***after*** the sentencing. https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i1v0w/_/dyp2v5r/?context=1Nobody needs to judge him on anything. A judge has already done that for us. Amazing how it works, isn‚Äôt it?
1	1525836240	8	Illegal activity is a generalized term that just appeals to authority. 
1	1525836097	-6	He did hire hitmen to unsuccessfully kill up to six people.  
2	1525843269	9	Yeah if that‚Äôs the case than it should be proven in a court of law. I doubt a normal person would get life in prison for hiring a fake hit man. If a unsuccessful hit man hire meant life in prison, I‚Äôd hope they *proved* he hired a hit man.Ulbricht was given life in prison by implying he might have. That‚Äôs not justice as I understand it.
3	1525870088	2	Clearly. I mean, wiring fifty grand before the hit and fifty grand after the hit and the judge finding the evidence conclusive as per court record is only ‚Äúimplying‚Äù that he ‚Äúmight‚Äù have. E: Sorry, it‚Äôs actually half a mil. https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i1v0w/_/dyp2v5r/?context=1 You can see that I am clearly not in the assassination business being that far off with my numbers. 
4	1525881241	1	In the USA people are supposed to be considered innocent until proven guilty. A preponderance of evidence is not enough to legally convict anyone of a crime.In addition, you have a legal right to defend yourself in court for such a charge.Ulbricht did not get that. He basically got the court declaring it in the sentencing hearing with no ability to rebuttal. It was very Spanish Inquisition.
5	1525882005	1	So you are arguing that it was a kangaroo court and that he was convicted illegally? Why didn‚Äôt his lawyer file a motion against the judge? I am sorry, but you must understand that it does not look very good when someone who really does not really seem to be a legal expert is trying to argue against a Circuit Court judge. Do you think that someone outside of this circle jerk would find it convincing?
6	1525882224	1	He should have. He was being a bad lawyer. Some people guess he was aiming for an appeal case but who knows his actual motivation.
7	1525882554	1	Why doesn‚Äôt Ross‚Äô family hire a different lawyer? Anyone can file a motion against the judge. Surely the financing shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. There is a whole subreddit here of people who made ‚Äúinsane gains‚Äù by holding their bitcoin and think that this guy is innocent or even a hero. You guys could easily fund a legal case. Why don‚Äôt you? Pretty sure I know the answer to all of those already.
8	1525882789	1	Lots of lawyers working on it and lots of money raised.

0	1525877612	1	He got screwed sentence wise, but no way he was a hero. Helping to fuel drug users is a terrible thing. People are mostly too stupid to control themselves.
0	1525830254	0	He is one of the world's greatest living heroes.
1	1525868500	1	Haha.  No.  
0	1525836413	1	Free Ross with every purchase of $99 or greater!Supplies are limited!
0	1525856730	1	Wasn‚Äôt he that drug dealer who went to proson?
1	1525870015	3	Nonono he only provided the means for drug dealers to function and expand their network. He's a saint.
1	1525885221	1	Don't forget the murders he comissened.https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1862572.html
0	1525836549	-2	Honestly fuck these monthly beg for ross threads. Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. Also, take a plea deal when they catch you at the library you always goto on the laptop you always use, logged in as administrator to the dark web site your running. Also quit while you are ahead especially if you are a minnow swimming amongst sharks. 
1	1525845552	4	You're an authoritarian pussy.
2	1525863819	1	That may or may not be true, but we know whose boy pussy is being pounded in prison at this time. üòá
2	1525869334	0	Lol ok keep believing in the myth of a wannabe know it all king pin. 
1	1525839358	2	In this case, the punishment did not fit the crime. I don't think anyone denies that he deserves to serve time. But two life sentences? That is not justice. 
2	1525839444	-4	That's why you take the plea deal ;) 
2	1525849598	-5	You're not a judge. So your opinion of whether the punishment fits the crime or not is meaningless.
3	1525875660	0	You sound like a bootlicker.Everyone has a right to objectively analyze the situation, and justice is supposed to be based on democratic ideals (juries exist...and they're usually stocked by people dumber than you or parent. are their opinions meaningless?)
4	1525884334	1	federal sentencing guidelines offer little wiggle room for a judge come sentencing. Its quite objective. Right or wrong thats the way sentencing works. Generally speaking in this case HE KNEW he was facing harsh sentences and opted to not take a deal despite mountains of evidence and a ridiculous high federal conviction rate.
4	1525878637	1	Juries don‚Äôt determine sentences. That is entirely in the judge‚Äôs domain. 
0	1525832767	-6	Let it go. Drug dealers are not what this technology needs to be associated with. Let monero have them. 
1	1525834415	12	You don't get to decide that. The Silk Road proved Bitcoin was useful and a powerful tool against oppressive government programs like the failed war on drugs.
2	1525842941	2	He‚Äôs not ‚Äúdeciding it‚Äù. Just voicing an opinion like ‚Äú...Bitcoin was a useful tool...like the failed war on drugs‚Äù
2	1525842844	-4	Do you want bitcoin to become highly regulated and banned from exchanges? Ok, he fulfilled his libertarian dream for awhile. People are dying daily cause they can‚Äôt control addiction. It‚Äôs human nature. Many good people who would advanced human evolution, died from that flaw in human evolution to continue doing what feels good. We have no problem with guy and he‚Äôs definitely not going to spend life in prison. That was just a warning for others. He‚Äôll be out eventually. Bitcoin needs to separate itself from that cause majority of human population don‚Äôt want that association. Monero is taking care of their needs now and is being thrown off exchanges all over the world. Do you really want that to happen to bitcoin which has a higher potential now than just getting people to kill brain cells? Bitcoin has the potential to be a trusted currency and free people from central banks all over the world. People like you who continue to focus on drugs, are feeding the bankers exactly what they want. You‚Äôre discrediting bitcoin for them and enslaving humanity further. Go use a privacy coin but stop this negative association and working for big banks.  
3	1525853379	2	What...? Addiction isn‚Äôt solved by locking people up. Ever. 
3	1525863353	-2	>	Do you want bitcoin to become highly regulated and banned from exchanges? I think many lulz would be had if that happened. Many, many delicious lulz. 
4	1525870095	2	Bitcoin can't be confiscated. A 35 year old neckbeard with a ponytail can.
0	1525830034	-9	I do not agreed acutally. The website he had delivered huge ammounts of harmfull drugs and allot of it was payed in btc, giving it a bad name. Think what you want with your dreadlocks and slicklines but im pretty happy silkroad was taken down. And yes..drugs can be harmfull, and NO most ppl do not need it for medical treatment. 
1	1525830805	15	Drugs are harmful.  Prohibition is more harmful.
1	1525831866	2	They're called slacklines brah
1	1525840741	2	> Think what you want with your dreadlocks and slicklinesI'm just picturing Ron Paul playing hackey sack or slapping a djembe.
0	1525865759	-1	"It is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both." --Niccolo MachiavelliMake sure you fear your government. Know your place.
1	1525869462	1	Or, you know, don‚Äôt start drug trading platforms and hire assassins to murder people who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Works really well.
0	1525827314	-11	Nah fuck him
1	1525828522	17	Found the government. 
0	1525878990	0	IMO, the currency Ross helped grow will ultimately bring about the collapse of the government that is imprisoning him by devaluing the dollar, without which the state--as we know it today, cannot exist.Ross will be free as will we all, thanks to Bitcoin
0	1525885290	1	If I could break one person out of jail it would be Ross.
0	1525855727	-4	Who?
