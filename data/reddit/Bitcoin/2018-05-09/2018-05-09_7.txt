He has said he doesn’t mess with anything he doesn’t understand , most technology stocks... he has been wrong many times and has admitted to be wrong many times about not believing in certain companies / industries .He is the man though otherwise if you read his books at all about his life .The words of buffet aren’t going to cause most potential bitcoin users to second guess anything . 
1	1525890795	1	If he doesn't understand it, he should stay quiet instead of calling it rat poison at every opportunity he gets.
2	1525891408	1	I found the rat poison comment really odd. It’s very unusual for Buffett or Munger to attach any particularly emotional or pejorative language in any of their comments on anything. 
3	1525891625	1	I mean he's a pretty old man at this point. Incoherent ramblings are kind of their whole deal.
0	1525873138	13	"No Colonel Sanders, you're wrong...Momma's right."
1	1525874261	6	Got all those teeth but no toothbrush... 
2	1525878961	4	So that's why crocodiles are so ornery. 
3	1525883274	2	What an obscure reference. Accept my upvotes, sirs.
0	1525880039	30	Chamath has been right about every major trend in the last 10 years, and has directly participated in them as a builder, owner and VC.Warren, Charlie and Bill Gates built their billions in the last 40 years by RENT SEEKING.If anyone provides no value its them. Bill Gates billions are legacy of the monoply he built in MSDOS/Windows over 30 years ago.Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger have been very shrewd in buying already great companies, they are  not mangers, operations guru, software developers or engineers. They are merely market makers.They  are not qualified to discuss new technology, when they have missed out in the last  4 decades of innovation.What we are witnessing and we are all involved whether we want to or not is what Ray Kurzweill has referred to as the singularity.  Bitcoin is being discussed on CNBC daily, when it was a joke just 24 months ago. No one in the current system knows what to do.  And Bitcoin/Crypto is only one subset of the massive change that is occurring, so rapidly we will have no ability to even measure it.  How few people can even comprehend the actual mechanism of Nakamoto-Consensus and  cryptography.Once GAI comes online and its happening, what will come out on the other side will be another humanity.  That will truly exploit the power that decentralized systems like bitcoin offer.Bitcoin was not built for us, it was built for the future.
1	1525882729	8	"Bitcoin was not built for us, it was built for the future."This.
1	1525885011	1	GAI?
2	1525885334	1	General Artificial Intelligence 
0	1525877264	5	I thought it was known he said he doesnt understand technology stocks so I don't know why we'd get his his opinion about bitcoin.
0	1525878004	3	Warren Buffet doesn't understand technology. Missed the big tech companies, ignored the Internet and doesn't even have Twitter (actually he has, but he doesn't use it).Why should I trust him on cryptocurrencies? 
0	1525873203	4	what does buffet have to gain by talking shit about bitcoin? 
1	1525878057	3	Nothing to gain, he just gets asked about it, and doesn't see the value. He sees it as 100% speculation over something that *might* be useful at some point, but has not yet demonstrated any usefulness. Thus the comments that it is a bubble that will end badly for many (he's not exactly wrong about this, many unfortunate people will be rekt), or that at this point it isn't an "investment" it is simply *gambling*.Time *will* prove him and others wrong, but what people need to remember is that with everything that has happened in the space, it is still an infant learning to walk. Those with foresight and requisite *understanding* can confidently predict the usefulness that will emerge, they can predict the paradigm shift.This is what permits Tyler Winklevoss to have the balls to call out the second wealthiest person in the world to "bring it on" essentially. He knows that while Buffet and Gates may have support for such statements now, they won't in due time.Just remain patient, stay informed, and ignore the FUD 
1	1525875447	6	He was asked about it and gave an answer. His opinion on bitcoin is right in line with his opinion about other asset bubbles he's talked about in the past.
2	1525876113	1	Exactly this, it's not about what he stands to gain or lose, it's that he's seen hype like this before and he is warning people to stay away. Warren holds the exact same opinion towards gold for the exact same reasons. I suspect he has a similar attitude when it comes to FOREX plays.
1	1525876072	2	he was put on the spot and gave an honest answer. An honest answer can still be uninformed. He is probably a million miles away from this world of crypto and is leveraging the limited knowledge he's absorbed from people around him.
1	1525888085	1	Nothing, because Bitcoin is a great paradigm shift he can't stop. He can only become emotional about it. 
1	1525874137	-1	retaining the Value of his wealth ? stocks gonna tank in the Next 3 years, Dollar wont do better. Hope he has Lotta real estate.
2	1525874365	6	He has more than real estate. He owns vast amounts of productive capital that will still continue to generate wealth regardless of the medium of exchange.He's a smart and talented man, and I really doubt he'll have issues whethering the crypto storm that is about to hit the modern fiat monetary model. He has something that most people don't: the resources to be flexible with social and economic change. He does not seem like the type of man who will stick his head in the sand when the obvious is knocking on his door.
2	1525876234	2	Warren has a massive moat right now. Literal piles of cash on the sidelines because he feels the market is overpriced with few deal to be had.
2	1525875582	0	 The stocks regularly tank. It's called an economic cycle. Why don't you learn a bit about value investing and his investment style before being Mr. Oracle of r/bitcoin? I think there's a far higher chance of the price of bitcoin collapsing in the next year than the stock market. And i can't believe you're spouting this stuff less than 6 months after a 70% collapse in bitcoin. It's actually pretty funny. 
3	1525876157	5	I can't believe you are spouting this crap without acknowledging a 9 year track record of continued growth. 
4	1525888734	1	He is a well know anti-bitcoin troll, so it doesn't surprise me. Use RES to tag the trolls to avoid wasting time on them :)
4	1525877841	-2	 you're spouting so much crap, i bet crap is coming out of your ears
5	1525878047	7	Savage burn bro! I learned my lesson! 
6	1525878331	-1	 this is how we grow wise my child
7	1525882495	1	[deleted]
8	1525882841	1	I don't believe in fiat bitcoin digital paper. 
3	1525889429	1	It's pretty funny judging a technological revolution by comparing short term price swings. I don't care about it, because it will revolutionize capitalism and companies which do not adapt won't survive long term.
4	1525890298	1	One thing Munger and Buffet hammer home is to ask the question "What if I'm wrong?" before committing to an investment. You, being a bitcoin speculator, cannot ask that question, because if you did, you wouldn't gamble on this irrational belief of yours. You actually believe that every company that doesn't adopt bitcoin will fail. You actually believe that bitcoin will "revolutionize" capitalism. But you have exactly zero rationale for bitcoin's current price and future price. I'll do it for you. If you're wrong, which in my opinion you are terribly, you lose everything you gambled (It's not investing) and your worldview only gets more pessimistic. Now that's funny!
5	1525893385	1	I am too much of an atheist to believe in anything. I can understand the technology and know the economic benefits of railways or cryptocurrencies.
6	1525893547	1	 Fair enough. You don't believe in bitcoin. Neither do I. We're in agreement. 
0	1525873250	3	Oh good another warren buffet post. I’m sure glad these are still happening
1	1525880347	2	It's the Wappening.
2	1525880944	1	Warrens warnings!
1	1525890736	1	Better than Vercash posts....
0	1525873102	2	This guy gets it.
0	1525876702	1	How can you trust the source
0	1525883798	1	You guys have a weird fascination with Buffet. He's probably right in many ways. I believe crypto is here to stay but no way will the thousands of shitcoins all make it. So why would he risk his fortune guessing which cryptocurrencies or tokens will survive. 
0	1525888129	1	Warren is wrong about Bitcoin, wrong about the Internet, wrong about Apple, basically wrong about technology all in all. Hello, he bought $aapl at the top. He's always late. He invests in chewing gum and con artist companies like Wells Fargo and predatory banks like BoA. His word should not be taken as gospel despite the great track record he's had.
0	1525889677	1	This idiot sold most of his bitcoin under 1000 bucks.   You sheep will follow anyone who tickles your nuts.   Run away... bitcoin is poison.  
0	1525893085	1	The cryptocurrency, which has faced heavy skepticism, was around $9,275 on Wednesday morning, according to industry site CoinDesk.
0	1525893216	1	Buffet never invested in tech, but his response has always been that it's not his field, and he invests in what he knows. Fair enough. Now suddenly, he's very colourful in shitting on this one particular new tech thing. Makes me believe that this sudden shift in behaviour means that he's playing an angle. He could just be senile, but given that he's Warren Fucking Buffet, it's easier for me to believe that he wants people to believe that he's senile, than that he's actually senile. 
0	1525897401	1	Chamath is the man. Check out his work with social capital and more recently his plans with $IPOA. 
0	1525871161	-2	Warren Buffett is highly overrated. Being a good accountant doesn't automatically make one a good investor. The bulk of Buffett's fortune comes from three things: luck, long term timeframe, and ties to the government.
1	1525875286	2	 Wow, officially the most idiotic thing I've seen all week. Your problem: you don't know what you don't know. So your opinions only matter to totally idiots.
2	1525881861	2	Dunno which is more idiotic. Warren is overrated post or diff post I saw that stated Buffett is loading up on btc while making these comments. 
3	1525882446	3	Classic move for an 87 year-old worth $90 billion "fiat paper" dollars. Pulling the old switcheroo on all of us! It's seriously like a popular psychic calling Einstein overrated in physics.
2	1525875716	1	Wow, a cow made of butter. My daughters would love it.
3	1525877915	2	Oh damn, nice work. You topped it!
1	1525871681	2	Post proofs on the third.
2	1525871891	5	I believe his father was in congress. 
3	1525874109	3	His father also died more than half a century ago. This is horseshit, if that's all that OP has.

1	1525872306	5	/facepalmHow do you explain the fact that his investment style made multiple people rich then? They all have ties to government and they all got lucky? Seriously, most people on reddit are fucking stupid.
2	1525875683	2	If everyone's a "value investor", nobody's a value investor.
3	1525875969	1	Everyone is not a value investor. Everyone who claims to be a value investor is not a value investor either.
4	1525876050	1	Agreed. Even Mr Buffett himself, who just bought a ton of Apple shares.
5	1525876242	1	I don't think you understand what value investing is lol. 
6	1525877620	1	I know it's not buying a company at 17 PE.

3	1525878043	1	Lol, ok? You suggest Buffett is a lucky corrupt accountant and googled to find an article that is critical of him, want a cookie?
4	1525878413	2	I just find it amusing how many people like yourself fawn over him. He was impressive in his early days, but in the last 25 years he's been just like every other Wall Street insider.
5	1525879480	1	I find it funny how people can dismiss the greatest value investor of all time entirely because they disagree with him over a sector he avoids specifically because he's a value investor. 
6	1525883591	1	He invested heavily in Apple. And he buys derivatives these days.
7	1525885730	1	Both of which are tied to wealth generating companies.
0	1525870834	-2	who is chamath palapapala?
1	1525876077	1	I remember seeing him on CNBC in December as part of their bullish bitcoin pump guest lineup.  He's a hedge\-fund guy that bought into bitcoin early. I'm waiting for them to invite Roger back on next week to drop some FUD bombs.

1	1525872791	0	Some guy who worked at Facebook, then failed on Facebook six years later, and is now getting airtime on stuff like bitcoin for whatever reason.
2	1525881863	3	Try again:> > Palihapitiya made investments on the side while still employed at Facebook, including investments in Palantir, Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG), Playdom (bought by The Walt Disney Company), and Bumptop (bought by Google).> > In 2011, he left Facebook[5] and started his own fund, The Social+Capital Partnership. The firm changed its name to Social Capital in 2015.[2][6][7] It has stood out strategically, with a focus on technology in healthcare, financial services, and education, as well as on software as a service. Social Capital started investing in health and education when those fields were largely neglected by other venture capitalists.[8]> > The fund was praised by Peter Thiel, who invested in it and expressed enthusiasm for Palihapitiya's approach.[3]> > Through the fund, Palihapitiya has invested in a number of companies, including Glooko, Inc, Yammer, SecondMarket, Slack, Box, and Premise.[8][9][10]> > In March 2013, Palihapitiya confirmed that his venture fund had raised more than $275 million in its second round of fundraising.[11][12] As of 2015, the fund had more than $1.1 billion in total assets.[13]> > In October 2015, Palihapitiya and Social Capital worked with the technology industry publication The Information to publish a report on diversity in venture capital. The study found that 92% of senior investment teams at top-tier venture firms are male and 78% are white.[14] Based on the report, Palihapitiya wrote an op-ed calling for a “wake-up call” among venture capital firms that would “recapture our potential and open doors” in order to “surround ourselves with a more diverse set of experiences and…prioritize a diverse set of things.”[15]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya
3	1525883689	0	Ok, yippee? His opinion is still just one of many.  And nothing I’ve heard is particularly compelling but that’s just me. Lots of voices in this world. 
2	1525873200	-1	Early Facebook employee worth tons of money trying to reform VC. He’s critical of technology for technology’s sake and the wasteful first world problems that western investors attempt to solve based on greed alone.Also don’t be racist.
3	1525874329	3	Geez, Chamath, you don’t have to take my post that personally. And I meant “railed”, not “failed”... damn autocorrect. 
0	1525872035	-3	How many years dose the old turd haave? Probably not so many, so he doesn't give a shit of btc, but I'm sure if he's in his 20s he would be all in
1	1525874094	1	Ye warren Buffets best years were before the year 2000. The stock gained 40&#37; every year over 25 years. That is like Tesla\(not BTC levels but amazing for "normal" stocks\)  levels over 25 years. After 2000 were the big global tech companies grow bigger and bigger they only did about 20&#37; each year \(still far above average\) but shows how he is missing out on the biggest success stories nowadays. \(still no reason to throw out personal insults when someone says something stupid \)
