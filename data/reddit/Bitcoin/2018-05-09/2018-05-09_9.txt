0	1525870885	12	so, once upon a time, a "bank" used to hold your "money" but it wasn't real money, cause there was what we call a "debt" based system.  All of these debts were kept on centralised databases that sometimes failed and people couldn't access the paper money that represented the debts owing to them. And if more than 10&#37; of the bank's customers wanted to redeem their deposits the whole financial system would collapse.Yes, children this is a real story, stop asking me that.  
0	1525856321	17	It's actually even worse: they screwed up so badly that people had access to other people's and companies' accounts, including the ability to do unlimited transactions if they wanted to.Two weeks later, these issues still haven't been fixed completely according to their own status page: https://www.tsb.co.uk/personal/
1	1525882412	3	Yep, one guy was in the news here in the UK, he told reporters that when he went to check his balance to see how much he'd spent on a night out, he found £30k had been deposited into his account. 
1	1525861789	4	Wow. Do you have any reference for these 'even worse' problems?
2	1525862407	6	https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43860449
2	1525870374	5	Its alluded to in the third paragraph of the linked article. >Those that were able to log in experienced continued problems including access to other customers’ payees, missing standing orders, and in some cases, the wrong balance.
1	1525886236	1	Why do you believe TSB is having these problems? Can you describe why no other bank in the entirety of Europe is having similar issues when they all use fiat currency and are all banks as well?
1	1525872341	-4	BCN just froze the withdraws of all it's customers. Is currently running an exit scam. Meanwhile, TSB is a garbage bank with a garbage IT team who is so incompetent they can't perform a system upgrade. All customers are guaranteed to get all their funds back, even if TSB tries to steal all their money.And BCN users are not guaranteed anything. Sfyl guys. What's your point here...?
2	1525875207	8	Your comment makes absolutely no sense, so I'm not even sure what to reply.
3	1525878161	-1	You think the problems at this one bank are indictive of fiat banking as a whole, right?I was pointing out that outright scams are happening every day in cryptocurrency and pointed to a scam that is happening right at this moment. Meanwhile, this bank is having trouble not because they are fiat, but because their IT team fucked up a system upgrade. No other bank is suffering as badly on the entire continent and even though TSB customers are very unhappy right now, all of their funds are guaranteed back to them. Meanwhile, all those users of BCN are gonna lose everything when the scam completes.Your post is like showing a picture of a flat tire and claiming that all automobiles are trash. [Edit] for those downvoting without replying, can you elaborate what is causing TSB's problems? The actual article says that their IT department basically royally fucked up. It had zero to do with banking or fiat currency in general because all other banks in the world are not experiencing similar issues.
4	1525879104	3	Congratulations, you're completely missing the point of Bitcoin: it's trustless and eliminates the middleman. You're mixing up fiat, crypto, banks and exchanges to make an incoherent argument with a flawed comparison.
5	1525883199	2	Can you point out what is wrong with the logic I posted?Example so you can see what I'm saying: If I say "BCN is currently running an exit scam at this very moment, therefore all of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin is just a massive scam", can you tell me what is wrong with that statement?Probably not, so let me describe for you. I am taking one thing that is a scam (BCN) and another thing not a scam (bitcoin/cryptocurrency) and saying all are scams without providing proof that Bitcoin/cryptocurrency is a scam. I only have evidence that BCN is a scam. Therefore, my statement of "Bitcoin is a scam because BCN is a scam" is invalid due to being a hasty generalization fallacy. Another example: KKK member says "all minorities are thieves because a black guy stole my car once". He only has evidence that a single minority is a car thief, but is stating all minorities everywhere are theives based on his single example. This is also a hasty generalization fallacy and completely invalid logic (and he should be kicked in the nuts for saying it).Do you get it now?
4	1525898330	1	> You think the problems at this one bank are indictive of fiat banking as a whole, right?I don't know how you got that from his comment.
0	1525868294	9	This is nearly two weeks old and has nothing to do with bitcoin. Why is this shit so high up here?
1	1525868747	4	I agree, this is old news. Here is an updated article.["TSB crisis: IT meltdown enters third week 'but progress being made'"](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/06/tsb-crisis-it-meltdown-enters-third-week-but-progress-being-made)"The TSB IT meltdown has entered its third week, with the beleaguered bank saying “progress is being made” amid fears that a **full service may not return for months.**"The reason it is relevant is because bank failures are a good reason to switch to a decentralized medium of exchange. People couldn't get their salaries or pay their rent / utilities. It's a huge problem.
2	1525872684	-3	Every other bank on that continent seems to be doing very well. This is like saying "because one Chipolte gave their customers food poisoning that means all meat is evil and will give you food poisoning". You are declaring the 1 bank to be indictive of the entire banking industry when their failure had zero to do with the type of currency they are using and more to do with plain, utter incompetence of their IT team. This is what is known as a "hasty generalization" logical fallacy. It's the same one that bigots use to declare all minorities "lazy and violent" because they once knew a black guy who stole their car: "therefore all minorities are car thieves!" This is invalid logic. 
3	1525873730	0	We still can't all ask for physical cash all at once. Not enough supply for everyone. Let's all agree on a a date for a bank run!
4	1525883383	1	What does that have to do with my post? I was simply pointing out a logical error in OP's post that invalidates his point (this one thing is bad therefore everything related to it is bad).Let me illustrate: "BCN is running an exit scam right now, therefore Bitcoin is a scam as well because it's also a cryptocurrency". Can you describe what about that logic is incorrect?Now, with that in mind, let's compare to OP's post: all banking is bad/corrupt because TSB fucked up. Can you see the problem with this kind of conclusion?
5	1525886890	1	Oh haha yeah mea culpa
3	1525875441	0	Banks also do it on purpose. You have no control over your money.http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/emergency-talks-as-greek-exit-from-euro-looms/news-story/90ccca6556da55ba773716eabc9bce40
4	1525876185	0	Greece was already falling apart as a country in general. If the country is falling apart and can't enforce rules because it has no money and your economy is in total meltdown, of course fraud is going to happen. This is as surprising as saying "in areas with extremely high unemployment, crime is on the rise".You also didn't address the fact that your entire post (and this one) is the definition of a hasty generalization fallacy.
5	1525879514	0	This isn't "fraud" but an official regulation, also you're not getting the point again: noone's ever gonna keep you from accessing your funds on a blockchain, no matter what the external circumstances are. It's trustless and 24/7.
6	1525882977	1	If a government issues a ruling that says that stealing cars is now not illegal, does that mean that the concept of owning cars is stupid or does it mean the government is stupid?Same thing here. A collapsing, incompetent and insolvent government drowning in debt and bad political decisions issued a bad ruling regarding banking. This doesn't automatically make banking bad, especially since in every other country on the continent, it's business as usual with no hiccups. You are using a single example from a collapsing government to try and prove your ideological point that you believe all of banking is bad. This is *the very definition* of a hasty generalization logical fallacy.
1	1525879635	0	You might want to start by reading the Bitcoin whitepaper, even if it's only the first sentence.
2	1525887670	1	What does that have to do with the fact that the IT problems at a single bank doesn't mean that banking as a whole is corrupt? Reading the first sentence of a white paper won't make someone suddenly understand a hasty generalization logical fallacy. This is like saying "well if you don't agree that all black people are criminals maybe you should read [racist book]". Reading a racist book will not change my mind that not all minorities are criminals because the basic idea is laughably stupid and I know for an absolute fact that it doesn't conform with reality  Same thing here. You are starting "one bank has problems due to an IT fuckup that means all of banking is corrupt" and that's just stupid.
0	1525875928	2	I can't imagine the level of IT fail that has to happen at this bank. Their IT department could probably be run by technical high school students, and do better than this.
0	1525880465	2	Mike Hearn was in charge of the migration.  He may have quit. 
0	1525892976	1	Incompetent employees.  I bet this bank fired their more competent engineers, possibly because they made a politically incorrect comment once, or possibly because someone else stabbed them in the back and took credit for their work, or their female boss was in a bad mood that day, or perhaps simply because they are white and male.
0	1525871254	1	Now let's imagine if the blockchain somehow went corrupt due to a new version of a software having a major bug or a hard fork that went tits up or something like that.
1	1525874731	1	Yeah. Scary. It does seem unlikely though. The new software would have to reach 51% before being fixed. As per most hypothetical situations such as this, wallets are typically safe. The issue is with transactions.I guess at some point some blockchain out there is going to suffer huge. NEO has gone down a few times because it's basically centralized for now. Transactions were stuck for hours. I think up to half a day a few months ago. That in itself is scary to me.
1	1525882566	1	Well you can't modify the blockchain after the fact without recomputing the proof of work for the entire chain, so worst case scenario, you could revert to the point where 'corrupt' transactions where first added to the blockchain. It seems unlikely that such 'corruption' could persist very long without being noticed, given that bitcoin is used by a great many people, so if something was wrong with transactions going into block immediately after a fork of some kind, someone would notice. 
0	1525877577	1	Told 'em not to hard fork.
0	1525888036	1	this is just like mr robot
0	1525895362	1	the start of bitcoins uprising,banks falling
