1	1526258076	23	Man-in-the-middle attack for sure.Just not cool though, lol.
2	1526305711	1	Because other types of MITM attacks are 'cool'.
0	1526258360	20	I mean wouldn't the paint on that wall cost at least a quarter of that?
1	1526265763	11	In this case, half üí∏
1	1526258579	11	Lmaoo the things we forget ü§£
1	1526263751	9	If he was going to paint the wall already it's a sunk cost and the real costs to consider would be the marginal cost of the white paint + the time needed to paint it + the pre-work time on the stencil of the QR code.Probably $5 in supplies and an hour of his time from that marginal cost perspective.
1	1526304626	2	Everything for the artü§ò
1	1526291625	1	And how does he get the qr code on there with enough accuracy for it to work? Maybe a sticker?
2	1526294465	1	grab a ruler, draw a grid, paint it on. On something that big, basically anyone could do the QR code good enough for most phones to get it
3	1526295765	3	If I remember correctly he has a laser cut cast for it. /u/Pascalboyart
0	1526265286	13	my plan is to put my qr code on monalisa's (.Y.)
0	1526248408	8	Link of the article on TNW : https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/05/08/street-art-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-qr/
0	1526265188	7	It's great for artists to receive money for their work.  Im doing a little comic on the Burstcoin page and some people have sent me a bit of Burst. It feels great! Well done on the 1K! 
1	1526265679	3	Thanks üôè, keep the great work !
0	1526259324	42	Omg he made a month‚Äôs fucking rent call a press conference lol
1	1526265307	41	It doesn't matter how much he made. The cool part is that anonymous art can be monetized with BTC
2	1526285896	6	It's not exactly anonymous when your name and btc wallet are all over the Internet on articles like this
2	1526267525	7	The world is gonna get flooded now with people posting their QR codes everywhere, hoping whatever they offer to the world deserves to be monetized. I'm not sure how cool this is really gonna turn out.
3	1526268001	13	What's wrong with that tho ? If someone wants to give you money for something they find worthy that's a good thing ..
4	1526268692	0	I'm not saying it's wrong to collect money, im saying people will start to take advantage of the idea, and there will be a surge of "artists" doing it just for the money and not for the passion. 
5	1526269032	12	So what ? No ones forcing anyone to send money ..  How is that taking advantage  ? If they can make money from it why not .. 
6	1526271842	6	Do you really want to drive down a neighborhood with 100s of QR codes all over the place because up and coming artists need support?I fully support the mechanism of easily handing out tips digitally to support the work of artists by using QR codes, but because it's so simple, everyone can spam the streets with QR codes hoping to get as much exposure as they can. There will be amazing artwork and terrible work, but because it's so easy to make money off it, which some will do, it will promote many artists to follow this same mechanism. So that's what I mean by taking advantage of it - taking advantage of the simplicity of getting tips from QR codes, I could see it just getting out of control.
7	1526272500	4	I'm interested to know what has caused your irrational phobia of QR codes ??  Do you live in a heavily graffiti covered town  ? Is the outside of your house covered in street art  ? 
8	1526274984	4	I'm not bothered by seeing QR codes it's the mechanism I'm worried about and how it can incentivize artists to paint more, as if it's a job - but more like spreading ads. Street art is subjective, I dont mind it, but others do and I respect that. I just think the ease of getting money from your talent will lead to a bunch of good and bad artists spamming their art everywhere with  most of the incentive to collect money.
9	1526291108	2	Funny. Next post was this. lolhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8j6sa9/the_banks_the_rats_street_art_made_from_rat/?utm_source=reddit-android
8	1526284487	-2	> street artThat's a weird way to spell "vandalism"
9	1526309228	1	Where I'm from people like you get slapped üòÜ
5	1526307726	1	Artists need to make money too. 
5	1526277983	2	So it‚Äôs not art if someone gets paid? 
3	1526287009	6	The bigger worry, as someone pointed out, is people adding their own QR codes to other people's work. 
3	1526287481	2	People already plaster their PayPal accounts and patreon accounts asking for donations. Most people don‚Äôt beg. I highly doubt we will see any kind of problematically large increase in requests for money
1	1526287440	1	It could have been a years rent in his country. :->
0	1526281453	5	F√©licitations l‚Äôami !
1	1526293461	2	Merci üòâ
0	1526263556	3	Awesome mural and I love the idea of tagging your work with a QR code.  I hope there will be more like this!
1	1526265618	2	Thanks a lot lurker1325 üòÑ
0	1526265545	3	Great way to get exposure aside from having it online. Similar to lbry or authors, directors and musicians. 
0	1526284749	2	Mooning Remember! 
0	1526299727	2	Soo happy for him :D definitely deserved recognition for his ingenuity! 
0	1526300708	2	If I had added my BTC QR\-code each time when I draw graffiti on the street walls I would have been broken to the end of my days
0	1526305256	1	Just curious, how do you know where the most money did come from?
0	1526292848	3	This thread is ridiculous. So much hate for artists.Good on this guy for making a a bit of money through his art. Artists are some of the most important people on earth. They help shape our culture and give meaning to life. They help you see the world through different eyes and keep your mind awake and open to new ideas.America's position as one of the main powers of this world wouldn't exist without the influence of its musicians, writers, filmmakers and painters.I'd rather live in a world with every wall covered with art than advertisement.Yet, 90% of them are starving because people are jealous that they don't have to have a shit job to survive...I doubt this whole qr code is a long-term solution, but it's a very cool story at least and gives hope. Im an artist myself and I have great hope block chain and cryptos will change our lives for the better. 
1	1526294132	2	Thanks for your comment, let's create and focus only on people who support sharing some love and strenght üëç
0	1526285076	1	 *If we are going to solve societal issues such as extreme poverty or infectious disease, we need to make sure that every cause is getting the money they were promised, especially from the world‚Äôs most impactful donor group: federal governments. Credits claimed about blockchain, that it is very useful in medicine also. I think it is the future..*
0	1526293218	1	At first I thought he might have painted a picture of [Ferdinand Hodler](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Hodler#/media/File:Ferdinand_hodler.jpg) - but he looks different. Food for thought for next time ;)
0	1526316351	1	Gets bitcoin. He made 1000 dollars 
0	1526316871	1	You realize some 15 year old is going to start painting his address over yours now, right?
0	1526318508	1	While mempool moons, he won't be making making any money, because no one will pay fees just to donate to someone making street art. 
0	1526283184	1	Soon we'll have gang members leaving their QR codes at the scene of a crime so they can get paid for their work...
0	1526284650	1	Art must always be recognized. Way to go man. congratulations pascal! :\)
1	1526293480	1	Thanks üôè
0	1526289474	1	It came **mostly from redditors?**So someone puts paint on a wall and people give money for it, but mostly those who only see it online and would never come near this place.I mean, it would be much easier and more efficient to not put that paint on a wall but on a digital painting and distribute it directly over the internet.I understand this would be "wrong" and nobody would have cared for it in that case. It's just something which amazes me, just like the art itself and the story about it. 
0	1526290975	-1	$1000 is terrible pay for that kinda work
1	1526316573	1	It's a donation.
