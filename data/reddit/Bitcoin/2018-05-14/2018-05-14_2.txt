0	1526238913	48	Is that a new Lambo model?
1	1526239549	29	yeah the BTC 2018 model a.k.a. 'Escape'
2	1526239720	6	√âscape GT3 LM
3	1526245001	3	Is that French? Es-kah-pey.
4	1526268446	3	Don't see why it would be; Lamborghini is an Italian company..
5	1526276820	1	Owned by Audi, which is owned by Volkswagen. It's complicated.
1	1526249789	8	No it‚Äôs what happens when you hodl your lambo too long: It becomes a honda. 
2	1526251624	2	Got that backwards: When you hodl your Honda for a while, it becomes a Lambo.
3	1526251686	4	You must have just woken up from a 2 year nap. Your carriage is turning back into a pumpkin
4	1526252453	2	Put it this way: If I had bought a Honda's worth of Bitcoin 2 years ago, I'd have a couple Lambos worth now.
5	1526256958	1	 *redditor for 0 days*, If ifs and buts were candies and nuts we'd all have a merry ChristmasBut here in the real world bitcoin is down $12000 from its ath, and shows no signs of being back there any time soon 
6	1526263363	2	That ETH tho, yeah I know it‚Äôs down but I just tripled my stack with some well timed trades. 
7	1526263547	1	Monthly charts on all cryptos showing continued downward movement forthcoming. Those trades will not be considered *well-timed* by June. Trust me 
8	1526263603	2	Who knows, all the fun of speculation, I made stupid money on BTC last year and I‚Äôve got only about 10% of my NW in crypto at this point.
9	1526263693	2	I can tell you that predicting price movements here is not speculation. An excuse to not pay attention to charts, absolutely. 
3	1526311075	1	My Yaris is upset it's not a lambo. 2013 tears of Yaris
1	1526249101	5	No they hodl, hence not liquid lol
1	1526243791	2	"*Lambo*"
1	1526251038	1	You need Escape velocity to get to the moon.

1	1526245178	9	My bih luh do cokane
2	1526251065	2	Yo mom still live in a tent!
1	1526245787	3	This would be a more lyricly impressive song simply because of the slight extension of vocabulary required to know what hodl means. 
2	1526255336	1	https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JZYZoQQ6LJQ?
3	1526255554	1	Much better song. Not just because I think the original is trash but a lot of the hooks are just more difficult to articulate as clearly, and he‚Äôs still got much better flow at that. 
1	1526252906	2	You should def check this shirts mate[- HODLGANG Shirt Collection](https://cryptobillionaire.store/collections/hodlgang) Cheers
2	1526253131	3	Thank you much, good sir. I quite like those.
3	1526263845	0	I wouldn‚Äôt wear that in public, might attract bad intentions.
4	1526263950	2	That's fine. Let them try to kill me. The last person who tried was unsuccessful.
5	1526264197	0	I carry a gun everywhere I go and own 20+ guns but I always try to minimize the chances of having to use one.
6	1526264909	2	Some days I agree with you, and some days I don't really care.
6	1526276921	1	Do you carry in the shower? Serious question.
2	1526263802	1	Ironic that this site doesn‚Äôt show prices in crypto. 
3	1526299107	2	Hello! Thanks for your feedback.That is true but you can pay in Nano, BTC, BCH and Litecoin! In fact litecoin is the most used payment method of the website ahead of fiat!Tell me if you need some help with your order!Cheers

0	1526249191	12	I‚Äôm starting to get tired of this shit
1	1526267489	3	everyone else is haha
1	1526284193	0	It is time for you to exit this space.
0	1526244169	3	Same model but mine is painted ‚ÄúChampagne‚Äù, because well you know... 
1	1526245021	2	Champagne can be a good color when it's clean.
2	1526261030	1	nobody gets that color unless they have too
3	1526263752	2	I've known women to specify that color from the dealership on new vehicles.
3	1526264768	1	It looks nice on a luxury sedan.  More of a gold than a champagne though.  Don't get a champagne minivan though.  
0	1526249241	3	Hodl is a meme
0	1526267646	3	Why do people want to be robbed?
0	1526247139	10	All I see is "rob me"
1	1526248713	1	More like "We know where you live. Give us your BTC or we kill your family". All it would take is a note with the address and the threat put in their mailbox. One of the problems that people with anonymous crypto that people seem to avoid talking about. Extortion is 100 times easier with anonymous crypto. 
2	1526262699	3	Why not make that demand of any rich person? It's not like it's hard to get bitcoins anymore.
3	1526263076	1	Sure, but it would it not be easier to demand a payment through an anonymous payment source vs demanding cash in a duffel bag or wired to an account that can be tracked?
4	1526264602	1	That's what I'm saying. Just threaten any rich person and demand bitcoin; they can just buy it online.
5	1526265170	2	I suppose it's more of a psychological thing. If you see that someone owns bitcoin, perhaps you might be more inclined to rob them vs someone who doesn't advertise that they own it. But, of course, we see payments being demanded from ransomware. If people do become more educated on anonymous crypto and realize that they could extort people with relative ease, then it could become a problem. Imagine if you don't like a coworker and you found out some dirt about them. You could send them an anonymous email to tell them to pay up or get them fired, provided you send the info to your boss anonymously. 
2	1526249589	2	Thankfully, BTC is pseudonymous crypto.
3	1526249717	2	Perhaps monero?
4	1526270830	2	Monero is anonymous (or purports to be)Bitcoin is pseudonymous 
0	1526249415	2	ESCAPE
0	1526254301	2	And that's why he will never drive lambo, he hodls bitcoin and eventually one day he dies because too much stress seeing the price action üòõ
0	1526285723	2	CRINGE gang
0	1526301345	2	The irony in that he probably SODL in order to buy that SUV.
