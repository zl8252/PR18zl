1	1526263192	12	That’s good 
1	1526271393	2	I thought a $ would be fitting too as a neat juxtaposition 
0	1526258707	9	This is now the background on my phone!

0	1526263109	23	LOTS of bank shills here. Almost starting to think that if your account is only a few months old, you shouldnt be allowed to post here.
1	1526302767	3	Most of the morons came in during that huge bull run. Maybe we should ban accounts <2 years old. Would weed out the bank shills and the idiots that don't understand finance. 
0	1526251890	15	Wow.  Seriously powerful stuff.I wonder if they've figured out that they're the rats yet.
1	1526256772	10	Im sure they know it
0	1526272226	2	Good kob
0	1526285194	2	Cool Job.
0	1526309390	1	I didn't know it existed, but this thread is full of bank shills.  Who the hell defends banks?
0	1526249112	9	That looks so illegal
1	1526252896	8	Illegal, but harmless. Will take them all of 10 seconds to take down.
2	1526259069	-3	Not really harmless. You could be brought up on charges of doing something like this, but nonetheless, good vibes. 
3	1526269728	12	The amount of charges that can be brought against you are points in the graffiti world. The ultimate grail of grafitti is to decapitate a man with a Geneva banned weapon and write your name with the spouting neck geyser like some kind of a war-crimes sharpie. On a Holy site nonetheless. 
3	1526260873	5	I mean someone is going to take it down. Hopefully with gloves. It's still rat poison. I doubt CG used any super permanent adhesive. But otherwise harmless. 
4	1526268654	2	You don’t need gloves to handle rat poison
4	1526293246	1	Pretty sure that's actually wooden pellet pet litter, it looks similar to rat poison pellets but is completely harmless. It's just compressed wood dust.Either way, I fucking love this art. 
5	1526301741	1	https://www.google.com/search?q=ratx+poison&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS717US717&hl=en-US&prmd=svin&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjbnNb7nIXbAhWhmuAKHTZRAfcQ_AUIEygD&biw=375&bih=591#imgrc=2EDFf0vnav49JM:&isa=y
3	1526310500	1	Having a charge brought against you doesn't mean you committed a harmless act. Similarly, not having a charge against you doesn't mean you didn't commit a harmless act. We shouldn't let laws direct our moral compass. The only harm I can see this doing if is someone tries to clean it off with their tongue.
2	1526261841	-6	Putting poison on someone else’s property is not harmless dingus 
3	1526262031	9	Well if your first instinct when seeing this installation is to eat it, then you kind of earned a Darwin award. 
4	1526272162	5	be nice to the guy, he was born without a sense of humor
5	1526272430	2	Wasn't saying he should eat it. Meant people in general. :-) 
4	1526262108	-1	If someone put rat poison in the shape of a skull on your door it would be perceived as a threat. 
5	1526262161	6	Then Buffet shouldn't call non-physical things poison prompting such a response.This is clearly satire and not a threat.
5	1526273080	3	Bitcoin is a threat to the banks... I think you are getting it
2	1526303889	0	It's pretty cruel to any animals or children that might get into it.
3	1526312519	1	I'm sure it was removed within an hour of being posted.
2	1526277490	-4	You don't see how this is threatening?  Skull and crossbones with rat poison?  This is also NYC...It could easily be seen as some type of terrorist threat.  
3	1526288326	2	They should have used rat shit. 
3	1526310688	1	Hahahahah you yanks and your penchant for terrorism. Ermegermeh. What's threatening to some is provocative to other. Art's magic lies in the ambiguity of it's message and interpretation. Also, many could justifiably contend that BH existence and business is threatening to the livelihoods of millions of people. Soooooo..... who gives a shit about the rat poison?
1	1526310758	1	So are blowjobs in some states. 
0	1526272227	5	We are better than this and shouldn’t celebrate. Satoshi wrote code not graffiti. I don’t care what Berkshire Hathaway think about Bitcoin. I’d prefer they just ignore it. The biggest impact we can have is to use it in our everyday lives. Lets just leave them all behind. We don’t need them where we’re going. 
1	1526303486	1	You know Satoshi?
1	1526306874	1	Death to the bankers
0	1526272344	6	ITT: 12 year olds trying to say that banks are good and that crypto enthusiasts don't understand banks
1	1526310787	1	Allows us to know how sharp our knives should be. Consider these fluffy contrarians to be an excellent opportunity to better your skills of rhetoric and reason. Then when you come up against the big guns it'll be easier street.
0	1526246933	3	Awesome.
0	1526248676	2	👏 good job !
0	1526258512	2	Niceeee
0	1526293065	1	LOL, but let's hope a small dog doesn't eat some small rat poison that falls off when they take it down.
0	1526312185	1	There are infinite alternatives to fiat. They just suck
0	1526260696	-7	Berkshire Hathaway isn’t a bank. It seems like nobody in crypto actually understands what banks are and what they do and they definitely don’t understand the difference between a bank and a central bank
1	1526261498	14	BH has a privileged relationship w/ investment banks like Goldman Sachs.Banks are legalized loan sharking operations that try to make money through any means necessary, including opening up new accounts without their customers' consent (ala Wells Fargo) and bringing the world to the brink of absolute financial collapse during the apocalypse of 2008.Central Banks are in the business of debasing the currency,  reducing people's purchasing power, and in the process penalizing savers.
2	1526277687	5	They're a holding company.  They have bought banks, but also retail and many other companies/parts of companies.  They are essentially an investment vehicle.  If you don't like Berkshire, then you don't like capitalism/investing. 
3	1526310792	1	If we lived under true capitalism, these irresponsible, incompetent firms would have failed during the 2008 crisis like they should have. 
2	1526262851	-3	Oh bah. Stop the banking FUD. There are bad actors in every sphere. Wells Fargo paid for their crimes and the banking crisis was entirely made by retarded us policy to put people who can’t afford homes into homes. Banks have done more to grow the middle class and increase prosperity than damn near anything. Central banks are entirely different than banks.Banking was the original crypto. Before banks you had to suck the dick if a king for money and hope he didn’t slit your throat. 
3	1526265179	10	>banking was the original cryptoI understand the urge to make rhetorical killshots to prove your point, but that's absolute nonsense.
4	1526265788	-1	It’s just historically accurate and continues to be accurate today. The shittiest countries don’t have basic banking. Banking gives flexibility to billions across the globe
5	1526271899	7	The concept of banking should empower people financially across the globe, but it's not enacted with compassion or equality, so the practical situation is one where BILLIONS of people are unbanked or underbanked. In fact, taken a step further, the reality is that those who work is powerful positions in banks are self-interested. Having self-interested individuals run powerful institutions that pull the geopolitical strings of our age is dangerous.I'm interested on what your metric is for defining the best or worst countries. Countries with a high quality of life have such because of economic freedom, not banking. Equating the two is a flaw. Now don't get me wrong, I think banks can be wonderful institutions. They're important. But I'd be a proponent of public banking. I don't think banks should make a profit for managing the currency flow or holding the funds of individuals. Such services are so integral to economic freedom, and therefore to the overall quality of life, in a given nation state that I think it's in the interest of the state to provide those services through taxes that are paid. Loans should still incur interest, the total of which could be put back in to state spending. But I think you're missing the bigger point. The advent of cryptocurrencies has opened up a dialogue that many people would have never even considered. Can we separate tokens of value from the state in which they're exchanged? Can we force oligarchial financial institutions to provide a fairer and more transparent service by scaring them into action? Can we create a system whereby people can create value without being charged for it? Yes we can. We can with decentralized tokens of value that rely on a transparent, secure and immutable ledger to broadcast activity. 
6	1526273437	1	Everywhere banking is introduced the people benefit hugely. It’s just a fact. It’s not debatable. The biggest driver of prosperity is banks moving into new territory. It’s just a fact. 
7	1526274032	6	It's not a fact. A fact can be backed up unequivocally. Having to say "it's just a fact" over and over is an unfortunate intellectual shortcoming on your part. Perhaps you can provide unbiased studies into the the effects of a bank at a micro and macro level? Can you provide any evidence that banks moving into new territory is the biggest driver of prosperity? (You definitely can't without a strong metric anyways, which doesn't exist) Do you maybe want to address other areas of my last comment to you aswel?A bank called Anglo-Irish was, by far, undoubtedly, the biggest factor of the recession that was faced by the Irish people in 2008. It's been documented better than any other financial happening in the country. More accurately, it was the (self-interested) individuals who run the banks that fucked shit up. Sooooooo, you're wrong. 
8	1526302295	1	Facthttp://fortune.com/2016/12/10/mobile-banking-poverty-research/There are tons of banks. There will always be some bad actors just like in crypto. BCash, bconnect, etc. It’s just silly to look at one bank and judge all banks by it. 
7	1526306606	1	Good thing Bitcoin let's you be your own bank
8	1526306888	1	No it doesn’t. Bitcoin has the same feature list as an old safe
9	1526313224	1	No, Bitcoin doesn't allow you to be your own bank. When people say that, what they mean is that when you have Bitcoins in your wallet \(a wallet you have access to the private keys of\) that you are in full control of what's in that wallet. Whereas when you have money in a bank, it's entirely feasible that the bank will put a limit on what you can withdraw. 
5	1526278123	2	Look, you're using rhetorical flourishes and I get that. But cryptocurrency in its most elemental form - bitcoin - is just a digital asset that is liquid. Digital currency. Companies that issue tokens and provide bank-like services notwithstanding, I can't go get a loan from Bitcoin, Inc. nor can I get a mortgage from Big Bitcoin. It's a digital currency/commodity, it's not *banking.*You're conflating the term banking with currency and liquidity. There was currency before there were banks, many different kinds of it. You're also confusing the "macroeconomics textbook" platonic ideal of banking with banks and banksters irl. Banks provide liquidity (to some, very conditionally) and do keep money safe (in theory, with the cooperation of a government which can print money at will). Beyond that, banks engage in predatory lending practices, insider information trading with both other major market actors and the government, and are a key pillar of the inflationary federal-bank backed petrodollar system which air-drops currency to privileged actors and manipulates the economy/credit cycle at will. Bitcoin does none of that sinister shit. Its inflation rate is hardcoded. It can't be manipulated by the powerful by traditional means. No one can delete your balance because you're a "bad actor" in the eyes of the government.This is (or was)  the culture and the practice of cryptocurrency before all these twee ICOs started coming out promising to bank the unbanked and be exactly like the status quo except plus blockchain. So your assertion that banking = the original crypto is wrong on several levels. It provides no banking services, it doesn't collude with the powerful, and its genesis culture was completely anti-bank. So, it's not historically accurate. It's not even economically accurate. It's a shitty metaphor.
6	1526303365	1	Sorry. You are right. Crypto is nothing like banks. It can’t do 90% of the stuff banks do. It doesn’t work as a currency. It’s only a speculative store of wealth like gold. 
7	1526313485	1	C'mon bro, don't be a tard. Why don't you tell us what exactly crypto can't do that banks can do, why that is bad and how it can't be replaced by other more honest means and services?
6	1526313419	1	If I could I'd give you billions of karma. A well considered response. I'd love to see more of your opinions floating around.
4	1526266307	-2	Culturally it’s similar 
5	1526279287	3	Exhibit A - ”Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks Jan 03/09” - It's inscribed on the Genesis block, and if you read Satoshi's posts it's clear he wasn't a huge fan of the banks.Exhibit B - Early Bitcoin entrepreneurs like Erik Voorhes, Roger Ver, Charlie Shrem and Ross Ulbricht were staunch libertarians who believed in the free market.Exhibit C - Mt. Gox was allowed to fail. Unlike with the DAO hack in Ethereum, no one rolled back the chain. Banks get bailed out w/ taxpayer money all the time. Culturally, Bitcoin and banking are a 1,000,000 AU apart.
5	1526276565	1	That's entirely debatable. Once upon a time not too long ago crypto was about giving banks the middle finger as hard as possible. Times have apparently changed a little bit, to the point where people assert crypto = banking. 
3	1526272421	4	Bad actors existing in every sphere does not somehow mean that we should ignore them.  Wells Fargo did not pay for their crimes, they had a slap on the wrist. Your arguments are bad and you should feel bad.  
3	1526272327	3	>There are bad actors in every sphere. It's systemic. I mentioned a few examples, but there are others like high frequency trading and 'analyst' reports meant to deceive and manipulate retail muppets.>the banking crisis was entirely made by retarded us policy to put people who can’t afford homes into homes.I can agree w/ that statement. Banks would have thought twice about taking insane amounts of risk if there wasn't implicit assurance they'd be bailed out.Still makes them a bunch of sociopathic elitists with delusions of grandeur, willing to take advantaged of a dumbed down, financially illiterate public,though.>Banks have done more to grow the middle class and increase prosperity than damn near anything. Perhaps. That's hard to quantify. The point is to create a system of incentives that's better than what we have now, and isn'tbased on trust. Even if I were to accept your premise (which I wouldn't without rigorous data), it's fallacious to assume we have to put up with a corrupt system because, at some point in the past, it had the positive aspect of bringing prosperity to the middle class.That's preposterous.
4	1526273584	1	There are far more bad actors in crypto than banking. It’s not hard to quantify. It’s a fact that banks have freed more people than crypto has. I love crypto but stfu  about your ignorant bank bs. 
5	1526275643	2	>There are far more bad actors in crypto than banking.Crypto includes a myriad of pump and dump, scam altcoins. It's a bit of a strawman to conflate altcoins and Bitcoin.Even then, the banking industry operates on a whole different level when it comes to scamming people. They're very proficient at it.>It’s a fact that banks have freed more people than crypto has.You're conflating things like a shift from the monarchy into a democracy with the advent of banking, which isn't backed by facts.The reason you don't have to suck off the king for a loan is because the peasentry got fed up with obsence taxation under Feudalism. They revolted and physically removed the king and queen in places like France. It had nothing to do with the banks.>I love crypto but stfu about your ignorant bank bs.Again, ad hominem. 
5	1526306776	1	This fucking bank shill thinks the current financial system doesn't make you a slave is better than a free and fair currency like Bitcoin. Okay Mr. Blockbuster. At one point blockbuster had shown more people videos than Netflix.
6	1526307231	1	Never in the history of the world has a deflationary currency worked. Btc is a fine store of value and speculative asset. Banking on bitcoin aren’t the same thing so your analogy sucks. A better analogy would be bitcoin being Blockbuster and one of the new alts being Netflix.Bitcoin missed it’s window for mass adoption. As mass adoption comes people will be looking at new technology
7	1526309186	1	>Never in the history of the world has a deflationary currency worked. The average lifespan for fiat currencies(which are inflationary) is something like 3 decades and the purchasing power of the US dollars hasdeclined by more than 90% over the last 100 years. That's not a functional form of currency. It's a wealth transfer mechanism.
8	1526309749	1	That’s why you don’t hold fiat. It doesn’t change the fact that fundamentally deflation and Currency don’t mix. Deflation is completely at odds with every fundamental aspect of what currency is
9	1526310549	1	>That’s why you don’t hold fiat.I knew you were going to counter with that argument, but corraling the population into stocks is not the mark of a functional currency. Depending on timing, you MIGHT just be able to beat inflation by investing in stocks, but don't hold your breath.Besides, for the longest time gold, which is deflationary, WAS money. Not just was it used (and can still be used today) as money, but also it has retained its purchasing power over a 2,000 year period.
9	1526313985	1	But that doesn't change the fact that banks are parasitic institutions. What argument are you trying to make? If I was on the fence before reading your comments, I'd now be well on the side of crypto just so I didn't have to associate with your opinions.Also, fiat and deflation aren't two ends of the same stick, so I don't know why you're comparing them either. You can have an inflationary currency that's not fiat and that is a decentralized crypto. Did you know that?
7	1526313762	1	If banking and Bitcoin aren't the same thing then why do you keep comparing them?Check out the rate of stores accepting Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. It's exponential
8	1526316756	1	Look at the FUD post we are on
9	1526318350	1	Are you mentally inept? Just unable to answer my questions?Sso you hide behind meaningless statements instead of standing bravely by your overall argument by backing it up with well\-reasoned opinions? 
5	1526313643	1	If it's not hard to quantify, then can you provide the data?Look at the little shill getting angry at the flurry of support for crypto.
6	1526313948	1	Why would I be angry about support for crypto? I hold crypto. I’m perfectly capable of holding crypto and enjoying banks and their services. Banks will play a huge roll in the future of crypto. It’s great 
7	1526314772	1	C'mon man, provide that data that allowed you to quantify the relativity of bad actors in crypto and banking."I love crypto but stfu about your ignorant bank bs". Tuttuttut. Very bold. Two cuss words and an insult, Is this how you operate on your better days?
8	1526317224	1	Everyday is a good day. The vast majority of banking is good actors benefitting society hugely. Crypto is mostly good as well and getting better as more and more riff raff gets shaken out. 
3	1526288379	2	“Wells Fargo paid for their crimes” Some rich people toss a few pennies to the government and you consider that payment for their crimes? Why don’t we do what Iceland does and throw banker-criminals in jail where they belong. 
4	1526303934	1	I’d be happy to support that. You should really focus your hate on govt rather than companies that play the govt game well. The govt is the problem. 
5	1526314172	1	No, the government is not the problem. Like banking, governance is a great idea implemented properly. Neoliberal policies are damaging, not only to the citizens of the country it espouses from, but globally. The fact that banks and corporations can effect the policies of a government is an issue. Governments should instead work to protect the citizens from nefarious corporations and institutions. 
6	1526316990	1	Lol. Yeah. If only we had an omnipotent dictator or oligarchy to protect us from big bad corporations. Did I fall into r/latestagecapitalismHail mother govt komrade! 
3	1526274018	2	Wtf. A banking shill? Go fucking die like blockbuster
4	1526294566	2	you know what AXA Strategic Ventures is? -_-
5	1526302829	2	The company/fund backing Blockstream? Yeah, not a big fan. 
4	1526301696	1	Banks aren’t going anywhere. Crypto is neat but it’s not going to kill banks. It’s going to be a tool for them to make more money. 
5	1526314273	1	You're probably right. But why are you supporting banks if that's the case? Why do you work so hard to defend them if you know that they are going to leverage any innovation to steal value?Anyway, who knows what the future holds. I seriously doubt that banks in their current form will remain forever. Only change remains
6	1526317083	1	They add huge value. That’s why people choose to use them. They provide incredibly valuable services and crypto will help them provide even more valuable services. Win win win win win
3	1526311074	1	Buddy. Banks participate in global money laundering and cartel assistance by the billions of dollars. Insignificant fees and, literally, ZERO jail time for bankers is what you seem to characterize as having "paid for their crimes". Get a clue.>Central banks are entirely different than banks.Hey bud. Tell me how money is created in our system via treasury bond purchases. Tell me who owns the stock in the central banks. Tell me, and then tell me why private and central banks are "entirely different". You really don't seem to know how the system works, and that's fine. Just don't pretend like you do.
4	1526312068	1	I bet you are an anti vaxxer who hates GMOs
5	1526314911	1	Whatever you need to believe to justify your abject ignorance.
3	1526266753	-1	Just imagine no banks. There wouldn’t be capitalism that created business that created tech that allowed crypto to emerge. Looks to be a love/hate relationship. Wouldn’t have the one without the other.  Almost like hating your parents for being too strict or not fair enough to your liking, then wishing they didn’t exist. Oh wait, I wouldn’t be here either then...
4	1526272298	2	This is a logical fallacy. This kind of reasoning would allow you to say, if there was no atomic bomb then japan wouldn't have become a technological giant, so the atomic bomb was a good thing!
5	1526273700	-1	No. Thank you for your contribution but you are dumb as fuck. 
6	1526273810	2	Well you've made a compelling argument...
6	1526314311	1	Hahahahahah what a lemon.
4	1526270947	3	Just as a son replaces his Father and betters him, cryptocurrencies will replace fiat (electronic or otherwise). No child should have to admire the sins of his Father.Also, assuming banks and businesses create technology is incredibly short sighted. Labour and resources create technology. If people can harness resources and create technology through their labour without banks, then it's entirely possible we would have devised an electronic vehicle of value and medium of exchange without banks. You could absolutely have one without the other. Your claim otherwise is baseless. 
5	1526271212	-1	Like the tech explosion in N Korea, Africa, or any other third world shithole without any reputable core banking institutions 
6	1526273497	3	Mother of Christ. Where do I start?So I don't know what the name of the fallacy is that you're applying, but it's there. But let's start elsewhere. North Korea isn't going through he issues it's going through because of poor financial institutions. Of you don't remember, or if you don't know, North Korea has been an explicit dictatorship for a while now. During that time they've had tighter sanctions placed on them by leading Western countries. This has made it incredibly difficult for North Korea to be economically progressive. Not because they don't have a core banking institution. Comparing North Korea and Africa makes no sense either. One's a country run by a dictator, the other a continent with many, many core banking institutions throughout. A lot of the problems on Africa hail from powerful parties trying to acquire resources throughout the area. There are many mineral and metal in areas throughout the continent. A by-product of this in a continent where Law&Order has trouble establishing itself is the forming or rebel insurgents in many different countries, groups that try to control access to and from mineral and metal rich areas. This makes it very, very fucking difficult for Africa to get itself off the ground.
4	1526314499	1	Mate, banks don't create technology. Labour and resources create technology. Through labour and resources we got to crypto. So crypto absolutely could have existed without banks.Every Son should better their Father. So let crypto through without repression. It'll grow all the better for it.
1	1526295995	2	Check the QR code. Berkshire is a major bank shareholder. They have a $25B position in Wells Fargo, a company that survived ‘08 better than most apparently because they were juicing returns by charging for products nobody wanted or asked for.
2	1526304004	0	How dare they invest in other institutions! Clearly they are evil!
3	1526310993	1	Shill.
4	1526311723	1	Lol. Okay FUDster
1	1526282059	1	Hey genius, "being a bank" isn't the point.  The point is that Buffet is invested in multiple BANKS, including Wells (Customer Fraud) Fargo.
2	1526303587	1	Millions of Americans are invested in banks. Now everyone with a 401k with a bank stock is evil.... It’s okay to like crypto and not think every financial institution must burn. 
3	1526310961	1	It's also okay to think the opposite. Maybe instead of polluting the thread with unsubstantiated opinions you should offer well\-resonded opinions that show research, compassion and a lack of bias. Unless you think the words that leave your lips are themselves justified for leaving \*your\* lips.
3	1526318146	1	When did I say "all" financial institutions are bad? lolAll I said is Warren "Fraudster" Buffet holds shares in multiple banks that have broken the law repeatedly.  That's not "all", at all lolHow brainwashed are you to think ANY insult to ANY financial institution is uncalled for?
1	1526288141	0	Still the f#$%k slaves of the Fiat system. 
2	1526303833	1	This assumes being a slave of a crypto system is better. 
3	1526311564	1	Yes it is. Decentralized tokens of value that aren't issued or controlled from a central authority is clearly better. It takes away a lot of the labour from financial institutions and the labour that's left over has less, if any, of an effect on the flow and control of that token of value. The labour that's removed from financial institutions could be placed in positions of medical or scientific research, essential public services etc.But your retort misses the point completely. We're a slave to the fiat system because their is no alternative. If you create value you are legally obliged to participate in the fiat system. Removing this barrier means people will be able to more freely create value and, therefore, more valuable things can be created.What is the "crypto system" by the way? I'm sure you know seeing as you referenced it, but I'd like for you to elaborate. Maybe you'll convince me yet.Also, your response assumes that assuming is bad. You literally null\-and\-voided your own argument with that statement. Maybe not being able to master your language isn't a big deal to you, but the limits of your language are the limits of your mind, and clearly you are quite limited. \(Are they paying well per chance?\)
0	1526247899	-4	Where else would you get a mortgage for your house?
1	1526252175	14	P2P loans and some sort of reputation economy. It’s going to take a while, but this market is going to mature. 
2	1526260733	-1	I saw that black mirror episode
3	1526282645	3	Reputation on basis of your past loans and ability to repay them, not the the way you Say "Hi". That's one of the things that your bank is already doing by the way.
4	1526303642	1	So keep doing exactly what we are doing now. 
5	1526312048	1	Because you want a Black Mirror\-type situation in the future? Do you understand the sequence of words determines the meaning of the sentence it produces?I think he meant, "Depending on how you say 'Hi' could in the future determine your eligibility for a loan from a bank." Not, "Depending on your reputation regarding repayments of past loans and the ability to pay them could in the future determine your eligibility for a loan from a bank." 
1	1526254293	6	Governments influence on the banks is the real issue.  Scum. 
2	1526312167	1	Nah mate, banks and corporations influence governments. Governments then enact their will. Removing the institutions that decide their policy implementation will lead to better governments. A government \(ran well\) is like an extended family. Everyone pulls their weight and is duly rewarded for it by the value they create within their home nation\-state.
1	1526275990	3	Certainly I wouldnt sell my soul for a loan and encourage a banking system that inflates housing prices and demand and doesnt build enough houses for people to keep the bullshit system going. Build more houses via automation, grow, and or die under the weight of your fucking greedy loans.
2	1526312263	1	Mortgage means "death pledge". Mort = death. Gage = pledge.The more you know...
1	1526278500	1	holy shit lmao"Where else would you get you slave shackles?"
2	1526309500	1	Man, you say that, but a yard, 2 car garage and enough space to raise a family sounds like some pretty swell shackles. What home loans are the libertarians/cryptoanarchists offering?
3	1526312579	1	Money and banks don't build houses. Labour and resources build houses. Money is a vehicle of value used to reward people for their labour. Money can still exist without banks. For the most part, a lot of what bankers do can be replaced by code and government policy. Combine that with the possible transparency and immutability of a public ledger and you'll get a system that's really, really fucking hard to cheat and corrupt. Now everyone that works in a bank can get a job that creates tangible value. The society that would breed form that would have a more level playing ground for achieving equality of potential
1	1526248759	-3	Don’t ask sensible questions in here 
2	1526265472	3	Right now that bank is loaning our collective savings out as loans... Why can't we do that ourselves considering smart contracts and crowd funding sites?
3	1526273274	1	This is absolutely not how banking works, at all. Deposits are not "loaned" out, the bank literally creates new money out of thin air by typing a few digits into a computer.
4	1526312970	1	That's true. Most credit is created within banking institutions when they lend. Which is the problem.We're forced to participate in the fiat system. Banks, private banks, get to create money and soak up the interest. I think that would be a job best left to the state through a cryptocurrency with a public ledger. Now interest from loans can be directly invested into the state \(roads, hospitals, schools, services etc\). So the more people that take out loans and spend it within a given economy, the more people from that economy will benefit from from that spending, more so than they/we do today. Although, approaching what was said by GeorgePantsMcG, do you think a lot of services that we rely on can be provided by smart contracts?
4	1526306030	1	Banks don't create money. The federal reserve does that.
5	1526308489	1	Wrong. The Federal Reserve creates M0 (monetary base) and supply notes and coins to banks on request. Banks create the majority of money (M2) through lending.Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply
6	1526308496	1	**Money supply**In economics, the money supply (or money stock) is the total value of monetary assets available in an economy at a specific time. There are several ways to define "money", but standard measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits (depositors' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions).Money supply data are recorded and published, usually by the government or the central bank of the country. Public and private sector analysts have long monitored changes in the money supply because of the belief that it affects the price level, inflation, the exchange rate and the business cycle.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
6	1526314817	1	From your link -> When a central bank is "easing", it triggers an increase in money supply by purchasing government securities on the open market thus increasing available funds for private banks to lend out through fractional-reserve banking (the issue of new money through loans) and thus the amount of bank reserves and the monetary base rise. By purchasing government bonds (e.g., U.S. Treasury bills), this bids up their prices, so that interest rates fall at the same time that the monetary base increases.> With "easy money," the central bank creates new bank reserves (in the US known as "federal funds"), which allow the banks to lend more. These loans get spent, and the proceeds get deposited at other banks. 
2	1526248805	1	I guess the sensible response would be "I wouldn't need it when bitcoin moons"
0	1526277317	-5	Very pathetic to make threats/harass a company because you don't like their opinion on your investment.  Hopefully they got you on their camera.

0	1526303137	-2	Banks have brought more people out of poverty and helped more poor people than any other industry except agriculture and gmo’s. Banks have saved more people than Jesus. 
1	1526303657	2	Giving credit for industrial investments is one thing, and surely it can cause a faster, more rapid growth but, anything else banks does is either unnecessary at this day and age or harms the society."economic stimulus" is just a made up word to keep bubbles growing.
2	1526304108	1	I too despise “economic stimulus” which has nothing to do with banks and everything to do with govt. govt is the thing that is evil. 
3	1526309461	1	cause of that package is banking industry itself, incompetent banking/management, giving credits to whomever they can find.
4	1526309803	1	No. It’s cheap govt credit that encourages that behavior
5	1526311797	1	Elaborate please. You make so many unsubstantiated claims. C'mon, help us to see what you see if it's so clear to you.
