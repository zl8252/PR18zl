0	1526243986	30	Hello I am the honey badger
0	1526246729	14	This should end well.
1	1526260113	14	Narrator: It didn't.
0	1526258326	4	LOL, nicely done.
0	1526260116	5	Dammit I always played chaotic neutral
0	1526245191	7	I also see a nice selection of classes in this chart. Wizards of different elements, barbarian, cleric and bard. Well done
0	1526247065	3	Who is the Lawful Evil person and why is he there?Also, Lawful Good should be Elizabeth Stark.
1	1526247765	15	Jihan Wu
0	1526273495	2	How come there is no wizard in the midst of this all?
0	1526242952	5	Thiel is clearly lawful evil. Satoshi is lawful neutral. 
1	1526256610	11	Satoshi tried to overthrow the entire system with a money that couldn't be stopped by the law, why he's labelled lawful at all is anyone's guess
2	1526263951	15	Lawful and following the law aren't the same on the D&D alignment scale, at least as I've always used them. Lawful tends to be more along the lines of having a set of immovable core beliefs or moral code that is followed even at the expense of one's own self-interest. In this case, creating a rigid, impossible to break system as a weapon against what you see as a corrupt and broken system seems the definition of "lawful"
2	1526258579	5	He creates the new Law
2	1526262105	4	If his system is victorious, he will be lawful and banks would be climinals. Only the victorious dictate what is right. 
1	1526263253	1	Why is Thiel lawful evil? I'm genuinely unaware.
2	1526294036	2	He's a vampire.
3	1526303239	0	So is every person who has ever received blood ever.I don't get the anti-science ignorance.
1	1526284086	1	I say satoshi is chaotic good
1	1526274791	0	Thiel is definitely not evil, both by the colloquial definition of the word, and the D&D one. The whole "Thiel is evil" thing comes mostly from commies who hate his strong libertarian stance.  Also Gawker, which was actually the right thing to do.  
2	1526275030	8	He definitely is. https://theintercept.com/2017/02/22/how-peter-thiels-palantir-helped-the-nsa-spy-on-the-whole-world/  and there's plenty more but I'm taking a shit and this is the absolute extent of any effort I'm going to put into this thread. IDGAF what you think. 
3	1526276383	-4	I agree, the Palantir's work with the gov is a bad sign.Although it's important to keep in mind that Thiel is a gifted chess player. And to win a chess game, you often need to make sacrifices.For example, it's a good idea to collaborate with the Gov if the collaboration gives you the means to destroy it.In the Thiel's case, the ultimate weapon could be seasteading. If you can get a few billions from the governmental contracts to finance the thing that makes the Gov irrelevant, then it must be done.
4	1526294103	3	Lmao, the 7d chess argument
4	1526303369	3	That is an illogical and weak argument.Hay guys, this person currently involved in creating a massive dragnet spying operation is totally kewl ok? He's not wreally a bad guy, just pretending to be one so that when he becomes powerful he can do the right things!lol at Mr badass libertarian Thiel! So libertarian that he infringes upon the rights of *all* law abiding citizens.Seriously, fuck that guy.
0	1526247372	0	But Rodger Ver isn‚Äôt a Bitcoin personality... he is a BCash personality
1	1526258369	2	He's more of a Douchetarian.
2	1526303527	1	That's Princess Douchetarian to you!
1	1526248589	3	Don't mention bcash.
2	1526255871	4	Don't mention Roger Ver.
3	1526272515	1	Don't mention Roger Ver!
2	1526248657	-3	Now now, you‚Äôre starting to sound like Rodger. (Takes in air) BCash, BCash, BCash, BCash, BCash...
3	1526248997	1	Don't draw attention to the not bitcoin.
4	1526303664	1	Sunlight is the greatest disinfectant.Your belief that we should sit idle while there is a massive well funded campaign against Bitcoin feels naive to me. Action and education is the key to overcoming these problems, not sticking your head in the sand and pretending it doesn't exist.Frankly I feel that you are just a rbtc shill. Nice 2 week account but no thanks.
4	1526251302	1	Well then for gods sake man! Stop doing it yourself!  ‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
0	1526255646	1	5.0 is the best version !
0	1526263715	1	Who‚Äôs the Neutral Evil dude?
1	1526286284	5	thats some Australian scammer who tried to claim he was satoshi nakamoto. Some retards still listen to him. 
0	1526279630	1	Until Ver disappears, this meme will never die
0	1526285530	1	The cryptocurrency industry is still small ‚Äî the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies to date is about the size of one typical S&P 500 company, according to CoinMarketCap. And as with any nascent trend, the risks are high.  Crypto finally offer a way for us to control our own destiny. For the very first time in the history of the world, we have a way to generate and distribute money without a central power. People will have control over the money they rightfully earned. I wish only that BTC would have a better transactions speed like CREDITS for example. 
0	1526285882	1	Nice work.Appreciate it!
0	1526287106	1	and who understands economics?
1	1526303492	1	The honey badger
0	1526292204	1	Amir Taaki would deserve a frame, not sure if there should be one more column at right side thou
0	1526300566	1	Genius.Edit: When playing Torment I went through the whole game as true neutral... clearly the honey badger was in my future!!!
0	1526263526	1	where is vegeta?
0	1526287632	1	BCASH!
0	1526239288	-1	I'll take "Chaotic Evil" for $200, Alex.
1	1526263058	1	I haven't hired a single sock puppet...
0	1526256753	0	McAfee is neutral how? If Bitcoin doesn't go up he'll eat his dick so shouldn't he be a good shill?
1	1526261052	10	He is "chaotic" neutral, not just neutral. Chaotic neutral people are often insane. Which perfectly fits McAfee.
1	1526278242	4	In about 2.5 years, his gender will be neutral, so i guess that fits him well.
2	1526278350	1	Lmao üòÇTbh I and many people hope that does not happen
1	1526262192	2	Maybe he will without the violence. Maybe he knows special yoga pose. He is chaotic in his statements but neutral for the economy.
