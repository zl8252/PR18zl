0	1526305679	1	This is so rich.....this non-functional government/country thinks it can contain Bitcoin with a decree.- 95% unemployment- 72% population lives below poverty level- Public debt is 75% of GDP- Is currently defaulting on $1.7 B world bank loan- Force labor aka Slavery is still commonJoke country...sad.
1	1526308173	1	US public debt is now >100% GDP. Should I be worried? 
2	1526308415	1	Yes.
3	1526308501	1	Snap! What do I do? 
4	1526309321	1	Buy bitcoins ;D
5	1526313033	1	**Ban Bitcoin, what a joke, just like they banned Ivory Poaching** 🐘🐘🐘🐘
2	1526308679	1	Does the US have a history of defaulting and being bailed out by IMF/World Bank and then defaulting on the bailouts?
3	1526310924	1	US defaulted on convertibility of the United States dollar to gold. Also known as Nixon shock.
3	1526313664	1	Inflation is default in slow motion.
4	1526316384	1	Yes but it's all relative so as long as all our main competitors are doing the same (they are), we're good.It's not *quite* that simple but as a gross generalization it's accurate.
5	1526316879	1	Ironically, that's where Bitcoin becomes a destabilizing element. So long as the only alternatives to, say, the Dollar were the Yen, Euro and so forth, there wasn't much point fleeing one debt-burdened fiat currency for another. But as Bitcoin becomes a viable alternative for capital flight the risk to the old centrally managed currencies increases. What would 2008 have been like if people could have fled to Bitcoin at that time? What will happen when 2008 repeats, and this time Bitcoin is ready?https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/
6	1526317019	1	That's a really good argument I hadn't thought of, thanks.
4	1526313888	1	cool well if its no different then how come nobody flocks to Zimbabwe for the economic opportunity?
5	1526318074	1	Because they don't share your assumption about inflation and economic opportunity?
6	1526318454	1	I made no assumptions, I listed facts. He made the assumption that the USA is in the same economic position.
7	1526318706	1	No he didn't.
8	1526318838	1	I don't know what his point as then because he didn't answer my question.
3	1526315320	1	The US version of that is leaving the gold standard
2	1526314841	1	Worried we'll end up like Zimbabwe, no.Worried we spend [about 10% of the national budget](https://www.thebalance.com/interest-on-the-national-debt-4119024) on interest and in general spending more than we take in, probably. But no one wants 'their' part of the budget cut, even 'fiscal conservatives' understand that rate we borrow now is acceptable in a political sense.  ["deficits don't matter"](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney)
1	1526310099	1	I wonder how the 23% of unemployed population lives above poverty level. 
2	1526310256	1	The political elite, the drug runners and the human traffickers.
3	1526310886	1	Just like America.
1	1526314676	1	Shithole country. 
1	1526315075	1	>95&#37; unemployment72&#37; population lives below poverty levelPublic debt is 75&#37; of GDPIs currently defaulting on $1.7 B world bank loanForce labor aka Slavery is still common  >  >Joke country...sad.to be fair 1.7B really isn't that much money at a nation state level, and the GDB figure isn't that bad lol
1	1526317134	1	If 72% of the population lives below poverty level, they won't be able to pay fees during the mempool moons, while Adam and his Analshitstream co-workers pop the champaign, because it means more adoption for their centralized lightning network with Blockstream Tax on every transaction. Also the satellite node is a lie.
2	1526317866	1	Derp Derp. Derp.
1	1526318757	1	But it could mean the loss of tens of dollars to the Bitcoin economy!
0	1526306389	1	Zimbabwe just stumbles from one man made disaster to another. 
0	1526307356	1	Who cares if the crooks in power in Zimbabwe ban crypto? Zimbabweans can and should just ignore the laws. 
1	1526311175	1	They will. They ain't dumbed down Umercans. They don't do as they are told.
2	1526315959	1	You ever been to Zim? 
0	1526307200	1	>The circular further stated that the move was taken in “public interest,” in order to protect and safeguard the integrity of the country’s sound financial system.Reading a bit more we get:>Reportedly, walking around with billion dollar wads of cash in the local currency means little to locals, as the purchase of basic supplies can run into several trillions of Zimbabwean dollars. Hence, RBZ’s claim of a “sound and secure” financial system is completely unsubstantiated.Nothing to see here.  "Evil" crypto has been, once again, defeated by the forces of good! ^/s
0	1526310220	1	Says the country that will accept just about any currency except their own for trade. Every time I go there they gladly accept Rand, US Dollar, Euro, Pound, ect. 
1	1526313121	1	What's your point? The fact is those currencies are a lot more stable than Bitcoin.
0	1526311427	1	You can't ban Bitcoin
1	1526313621	1	Sure you can! Nothing is preventing lost from being passed that ban Bitcoin except human will. It was a common meme that you can't stop the internet, that it treats censorship like damage and routes around it. Except that, for all intents and purposes, China has already done exactly that with their great firewall of China. I'll be fair, it's not a perfect solution and nothing ever is, but it is rather effective, especially when combined with the power of the state.Laws that ban activity, such as drug abuse and prostitution, do not completely stop the activity that they work against. But they do reduce and alter that activity significantly.
2	1526316266	1	I completely agree with you. We may keep proclaiming that bitcoin cannot be censored... but one fact remain: no bitcoin business can set foot over there, no merchant will be able to accept bitcoin in Zimbabwe and small business won’t be able to stick a “bitcoin accepted here” on their door. That will effectively stop many honest citizens from using bitcoin, let alone learning about it. Unfortunately.I know I will get downvotes for this, but I am convinced that governments can do great harm to bitcoin adoption.That being said, Zimbabwe is a relatively small country and if the government sees bitcoin being successful all around the world they won’t be able to keep it forbidden fort long.
2	1526318440	1	Most of the major VPN providers focus on having undetected modes that will get you out of China.
3	1526318639	1	Undetected... A permanent game of whack-a-mole with no long-term victories. Yep.
1	1526319244	1	Uhh... isnt that exactly what happened? 
0	1526305576	1	Lol, I would expect nothing less of the people that kicked out the white farmers and then starved to death.
1	1526310944	1	Veritas
2	1526316581	1	Turth
1	1526312915	1	That has an easy fix: bring them back or buy Bitcoin :)I can see all countries banning Bitcoin are weak and fearful.
2	1526318185	1	All countries are weak before math and reason.
0	1526307657	1	Lol, this is where the citizens should give a big F to the laws
0	1526309300	1	Recipe for revolution.Take careful note, banksters.
0	1526310892	1	Good thing Bitcoin is censorship resistant. This is what it's made for.Godspeed Zimbabweans. All in btc.
0	1526310858	1	This is probably the biggest threat to bitcoin. Government bans. 
1	1526311296	1	You don't understand people. You don't understand governments. 
2	1526311362	1	In what way. If governments make accepting bitcoin illegal for corporations, what happens?
3	1526312224	1	It's hard to say how that will play out in the U.S. But if you want the answer to that question, just follow current events in Zimbabwe and Venezuela, two places suffering from currency hyperinflation. People *need* to use money for everyday life. If the local money sucks, like it does in those two countries, then people will use another type of money, be it bitcoin or cowery shells. And if btc and shells are illegal, people will just use them anyway. Money is the ledger of a society
4	1526313716	1	Is there evidence that this is happening to any significant degree?
4	1526313019	1	I know people will work around the system, but some (like my parents generation) do what they are told. Crypto is still so niche I could see this being most people.  
5	1526314763	1	Your parents generation? Wow. You are filled with fear. 
6	1526314802	1	Yeah, fear that they don’t understand the power of crypto and would be alright giving in to the government requests. 
6	1526316369	1	Wtf kimd of comment is this? You're both jeering at someone and at the same time failing to communicate what your jeering about. You get an F
7	1526316595	1	I mean you have like 3 misspellings and are also a shithead. 
2	1526313991	1	Au contraire. You don't understand how little emotional investment people have in Bitcoin other than as a get-rich-quick investment.Are you by any chance a libertarian?
0	1526312028	1	I thought that I read somewhere they had switched to USD. If that's the case this could be the result of pressure from US. 
0	1526313427	1	Expect Bitcoin use in Zimbabwe to skyrocket because of this news.
0	1526314066	1	As if they haven't fucked their people enough.
1	1526316388	1	To a dictatorship only forever is enough
0	1526315025	1	END the Government!
0	1526315521	1	Lmao what a sorry excuse for a country
0	1526314098	1	This is good for Bitcoin. Will save poor folks from pumps and dumps
0	1526315415	1	Hey remember when China tried this like three times? They just want cheep Bitcoin's, you ain't  fooling no one. 
0	1526315540	1	Load the Zimbabwe FUD
0	1526316286	1	maybe they'll accept [World of Warcraft's Gold?](https://www.esports.net/wow-gold-more-valuable-venezuela-currency/)
1	1526317216	1	wow this article. this is so stupid i dont even have words
2	1526317625	1	come on, don't take it seriously though (͡• ͜ʖ ͡•) 
0	1526316325	1	Hm. Who woulda thunk. The one country known for printing a 100 trillion dollar bill is not friendly toward Bitcoin? I'm very surprised.
0	1526316350	1	Que a bitcoin black market. This ban wont stop anyone. 
0	1526317244	1	Stupid Zimbabwe government. Why haven't you just raised the minimum wage to $15/hr and saved your people from poverty!? 
0	1526317948	1	ban government
0	1526318422	1	lol at 'countries only monetary hope'fake news as fuck. no one in zimbabwe can afford to use bitcoins and its dumb fees.
0	1526308379	1	ban news caused a sharp spike an hour ago
1	1526311191	1	People probably just found out about Bitcoin there because of the ban.
2	1526311969	1	>found out about Bitcoin there becauseXD
0	1526310320	1	Literally a nothing burger. It is not like we want them spamming the network with $3 transactions anyways. 
1	1526313671	1	If Bitcoin is going to become a currency, it needs to support $3 hamburgers too.
2	1526314882	1	Which is why they are working on lightning. 
0	1526314997	1	They need to bring back Rhodesia if that country wants to ever prosper again.  Gonna get me some more btc this paycheck. 
0	1526308444	1	ban news caused a sharp spike an hour ago
