0	1526779567	164	Isnt this one of the Guys of thepiratebay website
1	1526785551	48	Anakata
1	1526784676	74	Yeah I think he's in prison
2	1526790465	103	God bless him
2	1526812858	29	Nope he's a free man now writing a blog and journalism in tech!
2	1526796140	46	Apparently for non pirate Bay stuff. He got released for that but then went back to jail for hacking some Danish government site.
1	1526796464	33	Yes. That's an old picture of Gottfrid Svartholm Warg.

3	1526828222	5	What did you mean by this comment?
4	1526828600	7	https://www.google.com/search?q=wharrgarbl:)
2	1526845344	1	Warg.I love that word for some reason. So cool.
3	1526845695	1	Indeed. He's Swedish and "varg" is wolf in Swedish. I assume "warg" is an older spelling of varg. The W-letter is called double-v in Swedish, not double-u as in English. So many older spellings that earlier had w in them and is now spelled with v. In Norse mythology a warg is a mythological wolfe. E.g. the [Fenrir wolf aka Fenrir warg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenrir). His other last name, Svartholm, translates to something like Black-islet. His first name, Gottfrid, is a very old name and is not common in Sweden for anyone younger than 100 years old. It doesn't translate as well or obvious but if I were to make an attempt it would be something like Good-peace.
4	1526846431	1	Well, im danish so I know pretty well but thanks ;)Just the sound of it is awesome
5	1526846745	1	Selv tak. Hopefully some non-Scandinavians will find it interesting. We already know that it is. :)
6	1526847158	1	I actually think gottfried is german, gott = god
7	1526848016	1	Yes, you're right. My literal translation in today's Swedish isn't where the name originally comes from. 
1	1526811058	35	Pretty sure that is Shaggy from The Mystery Machine.
2	1526823466	3	Yea, I was looking around those wires for Scooby-Doo. ‚ÄúScooby-Doo, where are yoouuuuuu??!‚Äù
1	1526799067	12	Yeah, Gottfrid Svartholm Warg

1	1526833943	4	I'm thinking Faraday cage? but I'm not sure if mylar does that
2	1526834427	1	No, but it would block your heat signature from FLIR cameras.

0	1526785227	16	Have been hodling since January. Haven‚Äôt made shit. Sad!
1	1526792019	14	Trump?
1	1526789208	-19	That's because you FOMO instead of TA like smart money
2	1526800254	16	TA is awesome for telling me what‚Äôs happened to the price. But how does it help me to know what‚Äôs going to happen to the price?
3	1526819240	7	You make up bullshit and then put your money on red or black. Then spend the wheel and complain about unexpected market influences if you were wrong
4	1526834124	5	Ah yes, the Golden Rule of TA: When you get it right, take full credit. When you get it wrong, blame "dumb money" or "whales." Repeat until you've convinced yourself that you know what you're doing.
4	1526823609	4	And if you guess right, you get to tell everyone how smart you are. Even if you're only right once every 6 years. 
3	1526803890	13	Previous resistance becomes future support except for when it doesn't. Super easy. /s
4	1526823607	4	Only three simple things can happen each day, after one of those things happens, it only leaves three possible simple things that could happen tomorrow. 
0	1526783256	4	Yep. I've had Bitcoin for a couple months now, and I already look like Shaggy from Scooby Doo.
0	1526805179	6	Shaggy: Zoinks scoob, like we're really going to the moon this time!Scooby: Roinks raggy!
0	1526812281	2	What's with all the foil? Like a real life radar jammer?
0	1526812569	2	Isn't that the founder of Kraken?
0	1526821813	2	Can relate
0	1526790303	4	Lazlo? Lazlo Hollyfeld?
0	1526784275	2	Shaggy's gone too many days without Scooby Snacks.
