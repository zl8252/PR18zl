0	1526839632	1	Need a QR code mate.
1	1526843650	1	for sure, whose going to try and type that in manually? 
2	1526844511	1	On Android, you can save the pic \(or take a pic of it\), go to Photos app and to the pic, click the button that looks like a box with two dots, and it will analyze the picture and convert the text. I just tried it and it fucked up some letters but it gets most of the job done at least.
3	1526844748	1	thats even worse 
4	1526846499	1	yeah a couple missed characters is huge in an address 
5	1526847426	1	Usually this will result in a failed checksum so its not that big of a deal. 
6	1526847702	1	Or someone getting a random tip... I'm okay with it.
7	1526848009	1	The odds that anyone would have the private key for a random address are astronomical.
6	1526848264	1	It is for the homeless guy lol
2	1526847153	1	Not with those boots on him.
1	1526847763	1	yep, and no segwit address , shameful ... let him starve
0	1526835482	1	If this is real, this guy wins the aware for most tech savvy hobo but wins the Darwin award for only appealing to a very niche section of the population XD
1	1526840344	1	Ya.. the "only" part makes me skeptical this is not staged.
2	1526840735	1	Seriously, if a pack of Raman is a welcome hot meal Iâ€™ll thank you for tossing me a nickel.   
0	1526834836	1	Staged
1	1526835026	1	I think, this is photoshopped. Still, this is possible because the crypto community is growing and in future we may see this kind of advertising boards.
2	1526837293	1	In China people beg using wechat.
2	1526843261	1	Stupid idiot its not photoshopped its just staged you dont need to elaborately photoshop sone cardboard letters when you can just simply physically write it and stage a picture. Get off your phone theres an actual physical world out there you dumb moron. 
3	1526843433	1	Damn, you ok there?
4	1526844130	1	claiming things are photoshopped when they might be staged must be a really sensitive subject for him/her.
5	1526846364	1	Here's in a support group. "Former Photoshoppers Anonymous."
4	1526846549	1	He needs a friend. Letâ€™s be his friend.
5	1526846577	1	I volunteer
6	1526847003	1	Okay now I can hate you both
3	1526843888	1	Wow, crazy much?  Also, that would be a super easy PS job, to be honest, there is nothing "elaborate" about it. Would take about 10 minutes max. 
0	1526844557	1	Tell him to use segwit.
0	1526845199	1	Nice try OP ðŸ¤‘
0	1526840872	1	Sorry, not giving anything, it's not a segwit address.
1	1526847682	1	Segwit is definitely needed for micropayments...
0	1526838087	1	He got burned on a Bcash donation and won't be making that mistake again.
0	1526844772	1	Well now that Starbucks allows homeless to spend all business hours in their coffee shop and restrooms without buying anything they can keep their smartphones charged to check their crypto balance.
1	1526846176	1	But business hours are begging hours.  
0	1526838110	1	You'd think with the spare time on his hands, he'd at least make a big qr code on the cardboard.
1	1526839719	1	Imagine how hard that would be with just a marker lol.
2	1526843835	1	all you need is a grid. (buddy who was incarcerated literally drew one he saw in a magazine on a piece of graph paper, sent it to me, and asked me to look it up, and it worked perfectly)
3	1526846074	1	Now I wanna go to jail so I can try that. 
4	1526847763	1	What if I told you that you don't have to go to jail to spend your time doing these sorts of things?
5	1526847906	1	It was supposed to be a joke.   I should add a /s
2	1526840892	1	Meh, five minutes in a public library ( and two of that nicely asking a librarian)and you can print one out. 
2	1526842719	1	It'd kill a day of otherwise possible numbing boredom. Not that filling in a qr code all day wouldn't be boring as well ;)
0	1526841774	1	Could have sworn this was posted here a couple of months ago. 
0	1526842676	1	Will take Doge 
0	1526845044	1	The soles on those shoes sure are in excellent condition.

0	1526842133	1	Haha best cardboard sign 
0	1526842648	1	Photoshop??
0	1526843648	1	Choosers can be beggars
0	1526843708	1	For a homeless guy, that jacket, pants, and shoes look amazingly new and clean. (ditto for the cardboard) Also, wouldn't someone who ostensibly spent a lot of time on their feet tie their shoes?
0	1526844246	1	Why is he not using Segwit? ;#
0	1526844293	1	He should have posted his QR code to make it easier. 
0	1526845391	1	No QR code? Fuck off man..
0	1526846984	1	No segwit address? 
0	1526847524	1	r/ChoosingBeggars 
0	1526847589	1	Amazing !! It's like a prophecy out of him asking for Bitcoin.
0	1526847869	1	Shows how great the potential for bitcoin is hey, look at the purchasing power of this anarchist.
0	1526847925	1	John McAfee, that you? 
0	1526848257	1	Seems like this guy bought btc when it was $20000
0	1526848461	1	Where's the copy text button???
0	1526843798	1	Nice shoes, nice coat, probably watching videos on his cellphone behind the sign.Yep, totally homeless.
0	1526845063	1	sent the bitcoin addy a $1

0	1526840300	1	not really? A bum takes what he gets and can't afford insisting on bitcoin. He'd also need wallet access and a possibility to payout in fiat.  I say fake.
1	1526843564	1	some bums are quite wealthy and make more then many workers, which is why they do it. he might have a lambo parked round the corner for all anyone knows
