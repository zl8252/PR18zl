0	1526814323	30	How about a list of wallets and exchanges that are not using segwit yet? I imagine most users dont know if they are using segwit or not.
1	1526822610	10	Jaxx doesn't so I uninstalled it today
2	1526839291	1	Ledger nano S has full segwit & legacy support
1	1526830241	2	[Bitcoin Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet&hl=en) :(The [Segwit issue](https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet/issues/431) on GitHub has been open since August 2017, or coming up on one year now.  Apparently, it's a waiting game for bitcoinj to support SegWit, but no commits have been pushed on the [SegWit branch](https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/commits/segwit) since November.
2	1526839129	1	That is a shame... I use a hardware wallet (nano s) and they implemented segwit long ago.
1	1526841553	1	https://samouraiwallet.com/ is using Segwit
2	1526844338	1	Samourai wallet on ios soon as well :)
1	1526821449	4	~~for one, [Coinbase still doesn't use SegWit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8jatgw/daily_discussion_may_14_2018/dyytno9/?context=3)~~ edit: I was wrong and [Coinbase has made SegWit wallets available since March 2018](https://blog.coinbase.com/product-update-march-6th-1cd082dd5168?gi=b3b9e8182571)
2	1526824036	5	So to send segwit transactions your address needs to be a segwit address is that right? If so then maybe that person in that thread had those coins in there since before Coinbase switched to segwit. Coinbase did fully implement Segwit way back in the beginning of March, but probably only new address generated by them are segwit.
3	1526825053	3	yeah, that's probably what happened. thanks for the tip about the March update!
1	1526839022	1	Breadwallet still doesn’t. But don’t worry they do have ERC20 coins, which are super important to carry around in your hot wallet everyday. And they have their own ICO too!
2	1526841562	1	😁 🤣will never understand why one would want to use this one.  
3	1526842099	1	It has a great UI, And connects directly to the network via real SPV and no third-party. I used it since day one until segwit activated and I had to switch because why use bitcoin without segwit?
4	1526842816	1	You are right, of course. Sorry for my „tone“. Yeah, sort of useless until they implement it.
1	1526843060	1	Coinomi is the great one
0	1526819558	26	I’m absolutely baffled Breadwallet still doesn’t support segwit. Are there devs/representatives lurking here? Do you mind elaborating?
1	1526822773	53	Hi there. We’re trying to leapfrog P2SH and go straight to bech32 (about a 10% efficiency improvement). The app connects directly to the bitcoin network so once we monitor a new derivation address chain we have to forever. Trying to keep it to 2 instead of 3 BTC chains. Also need to make it easy enough so that newbies can’t get confused or make mistakes. Also, I’m sorry it’s taking so long. 
2	1526823964	13	Proper response! Make sense to me and sometimes it's worth to wait a bit more to offer a simpler solution for a basic user 
3	1526831441	6	Its a chicken and egg issue tho :P People dont wanna support Bech32 because noone else really does. But if Breadwallet has a lot of users it makes sense not to be the first. It can just create alot of inconveniences.
3	1526827215	1	Perhaps they would be faster if they hadn't launched their own useless shitcoin and integrated bcash besides the initial claiming tool.They clearly aren't in the space to make it better anymore, maybe they used to.
4	1526829784	9	Just because you dont need BCH integration doesnt mean other people agree. don't be so narrow minded. They're one of the innovators/developers that make this scene work in the first place.They probably don't care about your personal needs, but care more about market demands. You namecalling talented developers because they fill another market than what you personally are interested in is just dumb, and solves absolutely nothing.If its so god damn important to you do it yourself. They have the freedom to do what they want, and you demanding that they should do what YOU need, and should stop doing their "WORHTLESS SHITCOIN!!!" is just plain childish. Grow up.free markets and booming innovation is what makes this space "better", and restricting that is just stupid. if they don't want to do it, someone else will.The worst thing is that they're actually working on it, trying to fix your problem. you're just sitting there namecalling just like an inconsiderate, impatient child.
4	1526829538	0	Proper response!
2	1526829075	3	fair enough. any guess on ETA?
3	1526832698	8	It’s all coded up. The missing piece is bech32 send capability being widespread among the largest services (for the record, BRD already supports sending to bech32 addresses). We will probably start lobbying for this and see what kind of traction we can get. Toying with the idea of picking a date beyond which the default receive will be bech32 and just live with a tough but hopefully short transition period. 
2	1526836857	1	Please hurry. I like your wallet’s interface a lot. Better control over fees and ability to “spend all funds” would be nice as well.
2	1526847661	1	I’m a newbie I use breadwallet and like you guys. Good UI :) 
0	1526825851	7	Gemini, do it!
0	1526835066	1	Make sure to write Support tickets and tweet at Gemini / the Winklevoss twins. 
0	1526833981	3	I don’t understand how to use/not use segwit, and I sure don’t understand using Lightning, at all. 
1	1526838129	1	There is nothing different you need to do to use segwit, just use a wallet or service that supports it, for the user it's exactly the same as its always been.
1	1526838299	1	Me too
2	1526847319	1	There is nothing different you need to do to use segwit, just use a wallet or service that supports it, for the user it's exactly the same as its always been.
0	1526817500	0	Yesterday a segwit transaction via my ledger costed more than an old school transaction any thoughts on that, shouldn't a segwit transaction always be cheaper?
1	1526818509	6	Probably ledgers fee estimation that is off. Learn to go to https://bitcoinfees.earn.com and find the appropriate fee and then choose custom fee.
2	1526834851	1	That site overestimates fees as well. The best way is to use [Johoe's Bitcoin Mempool size statistics](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,2h) and figure out what fee rate has less than 1 MB worth of transactions in it.Bitcoinfees.earn.com current suggests 20sat/byte, [when 6 sat/byte would suffice.](https://i.imgur.com/JcebxE2.png)
2	1526822003	-4	You have to check fee forecasts before using money? Bad money.
3	1526822789	8	I partly agree, yes for mass adoption to take place the wallets we use should make these checks not needed. On the other hand in this phase I should have done my homework better.I was in some time pressure and looking back i could have saved some 50% on fees, that would have saved me some €0.20, so I'm still fine... At this moment all my BTC actions involve larger amounts (adding to stack) and €0.20 is no deal breaker :0)
3	1526841483	1	Bad UX, not bad money.
3	1526827553	1	Bad wallet estimation
3	1526822315	2	Just use the lightning network and never pay fees again :)
4	1526827518	6	Exchanges don't use LN yet, neither do 99% of places that accept bitcoin.It will come with time, but it isn't as simple as "hey, just use LN now".
3	1526836909	1	> check fee forecasts Wallets should integrate this.
3	1526824379	-2	Use the banks then. Bye.
4	1526824639	-1	Or another crypto with cheaper subcent fees.
5	1526824855	0	What do you think will happen to that crypto if it ever reaches the adoption of Bitcoin? The exact same thing. Bitcoin is the only crypto, man. Everything else is just a joke. Eth and xmr are interesting. But "other crypto with cheaprr subcent fees" = shitcoin. Bitcoin transactions with 1 sat/byte are getting confirmed. That's $0.01 if you use segwit.
6	1526826003	6	I wouldn't say everything else is a joke. But yea any coins that offer wayyyy more tx processing throughput than Bitcoin are centralized which means they are crap. Some legit coins offer a few times more throughput, like Litecoin. But if we're talking mass adoption every single decentralized crypto would fail spectacularly once it even hit a tiny tiny bit of global usage as a currency. That's why 2nd layer solutions are the only way to make crypto something more than a store of value. Which is why segwit is important. Segwit's small scaling factor is nice and all but what makes it 1000x more important is that is allows secure 2nd layer tech to be built.
6	1526825116	-3	Maximalism is dogma. No thanks.
7	1526825197	3	What are you doing at r/bitcoin if you dont like/use it? Just move on and let us use this amazing technology. No one cares what you think about it.
8	1526825234	1	Never said I don't use it. If you don't care then don't respond.
9	1526825426	2	I do care.
1	1526848141	1	Did you move from legacy to segwit?
0	1526829501	1	I have had eletrcum for years at this point? Do I need to upgrade or do anything manual on my end to switch?
1	1526830167	3	If I'm not wrong, you need to create a new Segwit wallet with Electrum. 
2	1526844079	1	Yeah, when you first create a wallet file you can choose between segwit and nonsegwit. Then you would need to send money from old wallet to new one.
0	1526832816	1	I did a long time ago, but the only problem is that I need to have a non segwit wallet too because otherwise I wouldn't be able to receive money.
1	1526834306	1	Why cant you recieve money to your segwit wallet?
2	1526834428	1	Because the old wallets don't recognize the segwit address.
0	1526834989	1	If you use an coinbase wallet from before segwit was implemented do you just need to generate a new address.
1	1526838720	1	No, coinbase should already use segwit adresses. A segwit transaction is a segwit transaction when it is sent from a segwit address, it doesn't matter if its being sent to a legacy or segwit address. If your deposit address starts with a 3 instead of a 1 its segwit.
0	1526835052	1	For a while there Network fees for $8 maybe $2 at the most lately I've been seeing for $4.00 and more at coinbase
1	1526838788	1	the average bitcoin fee for the last three months has been around $1 but you can definitely get a tx confirmed in next block for around $0.02
2	1526844583	1	That's great. I remember paying 30 dollars!
0	1526835103	1	Does exodus use Segwit
1	1526848369	1	No
0	1526841002	1	unless you want to claim airdrops like bitcoinhex
0	1526841249	1	ELI5 segwit?
1	1526842063	1	It's a different transaction format. When calculating the space occupied in a block, segwit transactions get a "discount" because they utilize space that legacy transactions were not using. That's why you get lower fees.A segwit transaction is one originated from segwit addresses, that starts with "3" instead of "1".This new format not only optimizes space use but also fix an important issue (tx maleability) and introduces some extra features.
0	1526841302	1	Edge wallet for iOS ! 
0	1526842027	1	mycelium?
0	1526842037	1	I don't even know the difference I just jumped on board 6 weeks ago
0	1526842469	1	All in good time!
0	1526827596	1	shouldn't they update the wallets themselves?
0	1526832419	1	Yesterday I paid 168 sats for a transfer, next block. As close to free as its gonna get.
1	1526833062	2	Yesterday I paid 1 sat for a transfer on LN, instant. As close to free as it's gonna get.
2	1526833652	1	How much does it cost to use LN?
3	1526834041	2	The cost of one standard tx (ish) to open a channel. Then, you can make as many txs over that channel as you want. I suggest you look at eclair wallet if you have an Android phone. It is currently send only for ln, but much easier than other software to set up.
0	1526830905	0	Bitcoin Core wallet Segwit enabled?  
1	1526832532	2	Yes, make sure to run latest version.
0	1526813310	-20	I switched to segwit and had to wait over  2 hours for tx to process.  What a  marvellous technology breakthrough
1	1526814383	12	No correlation here, OP does not understand the variables involved...
1	1526814879	12	one thing that cannot be affected by SegWit is the speed of the transaction because the block generation is still one every 10 minutes. You probably were not lucky with the network congestion in that moment or you put fees too low.
2	1526817346	8	Block generation is actually a random Poisson distribution with an average of 10 minutes.  It can easily take an hour between blocks.
3	1526827750	5	The average is actually lower then 10 minutes since new hashing hardware is always coming online and the diff adjustment doesnt kick in right awayIn reality its like 9 minutes somethingBut yeah thats just an average, it can take longer if everyone is getting bad luck
1	1526817412	4	Tx id?
0	1526819691	-6	I sent ledger nano with custom fees. If I have to increase the fees then thats segwit out the window and if it's happening to others that 14% will not be 14% anymore. I actually don't give a shit about down votes up votes or upsetting the btc fan club. As a means of payment we all know it's a waste of time and the only benefit, if at all is the digital gold thing. I personally think btc is holding everything else back. These people that bang on about how great it is should move on. Yes it was great at the time but that was a few years ago so unless you can send btc for next to nothing and it arrives as you would hope it would like nano for example, then please give it a rest . Reminds me of these blokes who still buy and wear Reebok classics and have never tried another pair on coz they are the dog bollox. Sad
1	1526824246	2	You realize bitcoin is still being developed and improved upon and worked on every day right? Of course some cryptocurrencies will be ahead in some areas than others but always remember that bitcoin is the first and always will be, no coin can match bitcoins place, history and strength.
0	1526842186	1	And at the moment 99&#37; of those transactions are not actual uses as a currency.
