1	1526829726	16	If not, it might not be a scam.
1	1526841488	1	No, God runs all the nodes and owns \>50&#37; of HeavenCoin.
1	1526841354	1	Does heaven have a whitepaper? What are the devs like?
1	1526846725	1	Wow you have no idea how true it is in a way.  read the book, its quite good.  
0	1526826865	21	I read that as an assignment in college. Another relevant point is that the account balance got so high due to the passage of hundreds of years.
1	1526838628	1	Just like Futurama!
2	1526840862	1	Or Zimbabwe!
1	1526842979	1	That sounds a bit like [H. G. Wells The Sleeper Awakes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleeper_Awakes) at least the money part

0	1526827253	18	Great book / trilogy!
1	1526843979	1	I've read the first, I should read the other two.
2	1526844023	1	Highly recommend it! I also recommend starship troopers too!
3	1526845439	1	Also Old Man's war. It's all the same stories told from different Authors.
3	1526847280	1	I just suggested that to my dad today.
0	1526834039	13	This is how currency already works now though? Not like we use cash much anymore. Contactless or even just using a debit card is basically the same as this.
1	1526834216	1	If it were cash his backpay would have depreciated greatly.
2	1526834602	1	It doesnâ€™t say in that passage if it has or not. $890m at that point might be worth nothing. 
3	1526835354	1	Same difference.
0	1526826510	4	Nice find
0	1526834269	1	Trezor.
1	1526838956	1	Trezor is NOT an account in a digital bankster money dystopian future. In fact, it is NOT an account now.It is however, much better than that, a hardware wallet.
1	1526841592	1	Maybe what Finney might be?
0	1526840931	1	Plot twist: It was in Zimbabwean dollars.
0	1526844516	1	So, a debit card. He had a debit card attached to his bank account, like everyone does.
0	1526838688	1	I remember this book. It was a very good read. I know it is one of those books you return to every decade or so.
0	1526839978	1	Such a damn good book.  I wish they would hurry up and make the movie already, various studios have been promising it for like the last 10 years.  
0	1526842576	1	Not shilling, but there is a project called xzen that is designing a thumb print wallet like the one described. 
0	1526842667	1	Such a great read. 
0	1526842818	1	Fantastic series and recently they made a comic version \- part one is in a collected trade and a new series recently began. Definitely worth a look \- the writer Joe Haldeman is one of the great SF writers.
0	1526843142	1	I loved that book
0	1526843369	1	Spoiler Alert: The books lead character "Roger V" turns out to be a full blown finger sniffer.
0	1526838848	1	They are describing the bsnkster hell of pitting themselves between people on every single transaction. From your account (a bank ledger) to theirs.Scary as hell. Bitcoin is here to thwart those bankster desires of complete control and slavery.HODL
