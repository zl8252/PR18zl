1	1526846925	1	Agree! I've also heard Bitcoin Cash described more generally as a fork attack. I think this has now inoculated Bitcoin from a future case where another Bitcoin community subgroup or other coin may want to attempt something similar. Bitcoin has learned about this type of attack and now knows how to defend against it.
0	1526808241	28	A pretty good maxim for life is don't define yourself solely in terms of what you oppose. Its about what you stand for rather than what you stand against. 
1	1526818858	3	I stand for speaking truth. That means calling out scams or pointing out the emperor is naked rather than biting my tongue.
2	1526836244	1	One of Anton LaVey's wise (IMHO) maxims is to give advice/opinions only when they are asked for. In this respect, you can be truthful and keep to your beliefs but without being a loudmouth pain in the ass. 
3	1526845726	1	So youâ€™re giving me advice that I didnâ€™t ask for and your advice is... only give advice when asked for?
1	1526830460	2	Chuck said that humans inherently need more than one thing, different languages, different fiat, different religions, etc. Especially when it comes to money, not everybody is going to agree on one solution to it. Some coins and tokens will be bigger than others, sure, and many will go down to 0 and thatâ€™s alright, not every business or start up succeeds, thatâ€™s just reality. There definitely wonâ€™t just be one coin or platform that prevails. Just focus on what you believe in and donâ€™t worry about the others. No matter what youâ€™re into and think, there are others that are like minded.

0	1526830720	7	"The secret to change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new."-SocratesBitCoin isn't going around destroying banks by smashing windows or rioting. It is just being itself; a decentralized, trustless, unfuckwithable yet wavy, peer-to-peer electronic cash system.  Use it or don't.BitCoin was created to give the power of securely controlling your own finances back to the people. It is resistant to many manipulation techniques (printing money leading to inflation, denying access to funds, banks closing and taking off with your money, unfair reversal of transfers, etc.) These tactics are used by banks and governments all over the world.However, I feel as if Bitcoin Cash is trying to confuse future buyers into buying it instead of BTC.  Just the way the BCH community talks to the BTC community is enough for me to never even look at it's price, let alone buy any.  If someone has a valid point, they do better to base it in factual evidence, instead of attacking the opponent's character. Not to mention they're trying to rip off BitCoin's name.It's almost as if the ones who print our money and write our laws see it as a threat to their greedy ways.  These opposers will try to divide and conquer it as much as they can, which explains all of the BTC FUD coming from BCH supporters.  If they truly believe in BCH, they would spend that energy helping to build, safeguard, and spread BCH, not harm BTC.smh.....Just like so many peaceful visionaries before (including Ghandi, John Lennon, Martin Luther King, Tupac, John F Kennedy and maybe even Jesus), BitCoin is causing people to question the way things "have always been" and stands to benefit the average person, instead of a central authority.But unlike the names mentioned above, you can't shoot or crucify BitCoin, or even Satoshi Nakamoto, because it is not a person.  It is a shared idea of how finances should be.  Fair for all."Nothing can stop an idea who's time has come."- V for VendettaEdit: Grammar and some small changes to the general tone ðŸ˜œðŸ˜Ž
1	1526837017	1	Lol peaceful visionaries.. that's why I fucked yo BCH you fat muthafucka!! First off- fuck your BCH and the coin you claim
2	1526838877	1	Moon-side til we die, comin' quick with gains!You claim to be trader but you bought the hype!We call out shit-coins, n read white-papers all night....
0	1526826138	7	Patrick is right. Roger Ver will give a shit and not stopping to lie about Bitcoin. Not speaking out against that fraud not an option in my view (but you dont have to do it 24/7)
1	1526844339	1	you could compare Ver to McAfee. McAfee is a pro shiller, and even advertises so. So whatever he says should be taken with a boulder of salt. Yet despite that, still everyone eat his every word.Ver won't stop for that same reason.This is the principle of a figure of authority.
1	1526836579	1	I think Trump is a terrible asshole. Imagine how hard it would be to have a political conversation with me if every time you mentioned his name i shrieked like a parrot "he's a fuck face"... there would be no opportunity for actual learning our conversation. A lot of the conversions i see about the equivalent fuck faces in the crypto world are akin to the above. 
0	1526834082	3	this isn't true at all, protocols don't coexist long term, they are a zero sum game, eventually one wins out (Pareto principle, Schelling point, network effect, etc.)
0	1526818923	7	It's clear though that he opposes BCH. I don't think he discusses it in his book and in the second tweet he says "not even close to the biggest threat", so it IS a threat, albeit a small one.He just wants to stay out of the drama
1	1526825091	2	Wow...-Asparagus is the worst vegetable   -Asparagus is not even close to the worst vegetable-Ok, so youâ€™re saying asparagus IS bad, albeit not the worst
1	1526840847	1	r/whoooosh
0	1526807406	9	Thatâ€™s an oxymoron. The bcash project is about destroying bitcoin.
1	1526808014	6	[Of course, the first two replies are... more infighting.](https://i.imgur.com/p2MCzTs.png)*sigh...*
2	1526808670	4	>sigh...Why bring the subject up *yet* again, there's no need to.
2	1526808510	1	Bcash exists to introduce security flaws into an open source project and slow down adoption of sound money.
3	1526841634	1	What are the security flaws?
0	1526814621	9	If Bitcoin Cash wanted to peacefully coexist with Bitcoin they should have changed their hashing algorithm and stop trying to leech off of the name and brand of Bitcoin with their petty propaganda games.  If they did I would be all for it and wish them the best, although I still wouldn't want to buy it because I personally do not share its vision of huge blocks and I believe it leads to centralization. It already is quite centralized looking at how easy they pull off hard forks without much consensus building. If this is the future of online payments it would be horrible for our personal freedom and financial sovereignty.
1	1526827050	4	So much for permissionless eh?
0	1526806411	9	I agree with him. It's an important discussion to have, of course, but let's not forget that it's primarily us against the authoritarian government fiat system, not us against each other. The victory of any coin would be infinitely better than the domination of the authoritarian government fiat system. 
1	1526810837	17	I also agree with him to an extent, but for Bitcoin to survive the real issues he references, it needs to be globally cheap to host, function over tor, etc. If the bad actors ever succeed in negatively shifting the window of discourse, then indirectly it is an existential threat. These ideas need to be constantly called out, and Andreas absolutely does educate people on these issues, but never by calling out the bad actors. That is totally fine, admirable even, and expected in his position, but we still need those that are willing to go for the jugular. We just shouldn't expect him to fit neatly into that role.
2	1526812622	5	well said
1	1526814822	4	Naive. 
1	1526811776	-1	There is no discussion to have.  BCH has no use as a cryptocurrency, only as a get-rich-quick scheme.Toddle back off to /btc now, they enjoy shilling for Ver.
0	1526825578	4	I agree with the last sentence, as he is totally calling out BCH there since their only reason for existing is to try to destroy bitcoin.But at the same time the crypto community needs to stand up against scammers, BCH people are all scammers in their rhetoric. To be taken seriously as a community we need to rid the community of scammers like the BCH community. If BCH died and all their supporters fell silent that would be a huge win for crypto. They make everyone involved look bad.But yes I do agree also at the same time BCH is like a bratty little kid and while you do need to put him in his place it's also good just to ignore him. But since they try to scam and trick new people entering crypto who don't know any better we do need to fight against that.
1	1526827156	0	The only reason it exists is to increase the blocksize. Just ignore them. 
0	1526827061	2	Bitcoin use case: Sound & unstoppable money.Bcash use case: Make Bitcoin more resistant to hostile takeovers.In truth, shitcoins are an inevitable consequence of Bitcoin's invention, and a key part of humans coming to understand hard money for the first time. We should be both thankful Bcash was such a slapstick attempt, and aware that better-crafted attacks are inevitable in the near future.
0	1526836816	1	Incase you guys didnt know OP is a bitcoin cash Advocate. The amount of upvotes here is retarded. 
0	1526834746	1	ITT shit coin brigade. Bcash is a shitcoin scam trying to steal the Bitcoin brand and is completely useless with the invention of lightning. 
0	1526816017	2	Except the sole goal of Bitcoin Cash is to destroy bitcoin proper.
0	1526847461	1	A cheers to our great prophet 
0	1526819281	0	I disagree with Andreas on this one. BCH using the same PoW than BTC makes the hash rate volatile for both currencies. I don't think there is a role for BCH being the silver to Bitcoin's gold, especially in a post-lightning world. However if anybody should fill this (non-needed) role it should be LTC.I like Andreas but he's trying to be a uniting figure a bit too much. Life is not like the movies and sometimes feuding brothers don't unite at the last second the fight their true enemy ( which in this specific case would would the People's Liberation front of Judea :). **this is a life of bryan reference, not an antisemitic reference
1	1526827551	6	Peercoin also uses sha256. Should we send out a memo and tell all developers to not use sha256 because bitcoin is using it and the hashes belong to it because it has the highest price and is most important?Perhaps someone could get a trademark or copyright that prevents people from stealing our hashes.
0	1526813291	-3	Just tell people who are new to crypto that bcash is a scam, thats all
0	1526814181	-1	I mean lightning makes bcash irrelevant as well with all cryptoa if not bitcoin will have no use case period.
0	1526835702	1	Except from being a fucking ether shill he's now also a fucking altcon abc shill. Yes, they serve different use cases, namely, no use cases.
1	1526845265	1	A Turing complete decentralized state machine has hundreds of use cases. And many of those use cases require tokenization.Ladies and gentlemen, the naivety of a maximalist on full display.
1	1526842064	1	Yes burying your head in the sand works. 
2	1526842390	1	You mean like lowering the difficulty by hand because you can't get consensus. Try someone else with your crap.
3	1526845189	1	Yes I can also use technical words and not explain what the fuck I'm talking about. 
0	1526838016	1	Anton's nauseating virtue signal tweets confirm he refuses to cry fraud when he see fraud, and thus is himself a fraud.He's jumped the shark like Bcash Jesus.  Yesterday's news.I knew he didn't grok Satoshi's ethos when he blocked me like a thin-skinned little wimp the second I tried to teach him about why contentious hard forks are bad.Anton didn't even hodl and had to be bailed out of pathetic zerocoiner status.  He needs to STFU and stop playing Space Ghost ("I just discovered Bitcoin drama is toxic and I'm here to save everyone!").
