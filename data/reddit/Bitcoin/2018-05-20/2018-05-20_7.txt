1	1526807536	5	Maybe I'm missing something. Take one example in the text sample, the character that looks like a bridge with a circle on top. This seems to represent uppercase "I", lowercase "i" and lowercase "y".But the private key contains this character, which is weird.Some of the other characters seem to be phonetic sounds, rather than letters (the "ey" in "money" is the same as the "e" in "ecosystem").Also the spelling of "users" and "units" is driving me insane. I thought the symbol that looks like a cursive "do" with a horizontal line above the "o" represented "n". It's at the end of the word Bitcoin, and the second letter of Introduction. So why is it in the word "users"? And why has the word "units" got a weird C-shaped symbol inbetween the "u" and the "n" sounds?OP are you trolling us? Or am I just being dumb... :DEdit: Ah OK I'm starting to get it, phonetics are important.
2	1526808141	8	>Also the spelling of "users" and "units" is driving me insane. I thought the symbol that looks like a cursive "do" with a horizontal line above the "o" represented "n".Actually that is a typo, you wouldn't believe how hard it is to proofread a made up character set in MS paint. the character you think says 'n' that is in the word you think is 'users' is on the same key as the C shaped character in what you think is 'units'. They are bound to upper and lowercase on the same key, so that is my bad. I was hoping there wouldn't be any catastrophic mistakes. Not trying to troll. 
3	1526809301	4	Ah cool, thanks for the reply. So I'm assuming that the C shaped character refers to a different phonetic sound altogether... I think perhaps "oo". And the backwards Y thing is simply the y sound: "yu"So "units" should have that C character after the backwards Y?
4	1526809411	5	Yes
1	1526804067	2	R u sure 
2	1526804441	3	Yes. I put the balance there today.

1	1526810120	3	**Letter frequency**The frequency of letters in text has been studied for use in cryptanalysis, and frequency analysis in particular, dating back to the Iraqi mathematician Al-Kindi (c. 801–873 AD), who formally developed the method (the ciphers breakable by this technique go back at least to the Caesar cipher invented by Julius Caesar, so this method could have been explored in classical times).Letter frequency analysis gained additional importance in Europe with the development of movable type in 1450 AD, where one must estimate the amount of type required for each letterform, as evidenced by the variations in letter compartment size in typographer's type cases.Linguists use letter frequency analysis as a rudimentary technique for language identification, where it's particularly effective as an indication of whether an unknown writing system is alphabetic, syllablic, or ideographic.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
0	1526825697	2	Has anyone solved it yet?
1	1526825785	2	If someone solved it then the wallet would be empty
0	1526830111	2	Right I'm gonna post what I've got so far, cause these numbers are doing my head in. OP, can you give us a clue on the numbers? Maybe say what base system you are using, or point out a key equation? :DPretty sure I have all the letters in the private key correct, numbers have been replaced with bold symbols:L**!**fnrCYwxHsqbFKkfZVS**@**iflzwK**$**FyXV**&**Xet**$**FnmTG**<**W**>**eYgqdfqSo we have 7 symbols, and 6 unique symbols. At first I thought that !=4 and @=2, because one of the equations (6th one down from the left) is @lx@l=!!l (or 21x21=441). The one underneath is llxll=l@l (11x11=121) which also made sense. But as I went through, things started not making sense.0=0 for sure, and I think l = 1. But if we're dealing with a number system that is not base 10, the other equations I just wrote would be nonsense.I thought I worked out the symbol for 3 (7th equation down in column 2 is llxl@l=l{{l and I thought 11x121=1331). But again, this seems wrong now.OP, this is fiendish!
1	1526832950	2	Additionally, the key starts with "L" so must be a compressed WIF key - 52 characters long. This means that each number is a single digit, with 2 identical digits (the vertical line with 2 squiggly lines intersecting at the top and bottom) and the other 5 digits unique.0=0, so we can discount that. the symbols must be 1-9, with 2 the same...
2	1526835350	1	Just been researching old number systems, this one could be a lead - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal We got any Ancient Sumerians that can help us out?? 
3	1526835357	1	**Sexagesimal**Sexagesimal (base 60) is a numeral system with sixty as its base. It originated with the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC, was passed down to the ancient Babylonians, and is still used—in a modified form—for measuring time, angles, and geographic coordinates.The number 60, a superior highly composite number, has twelve factors, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60, of which 2, 3, and 5 are prime numbers. With so many factors, many fractions involving sexagesimal numbers are simplified.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
2	1526836444	1	On the right most column 11 - 18 down its a number multiplied by the same number (X) and the result always has the first number being multiplied by X as the last digit in the solution.so Y * X = ?YP * X = ?PV * X = ?VSeems like that symbol is the key to the puzzle but I dont see what number would make sense. It must not be a whole number. 11 Would work but only when both numbers after the = are the same which they never are. These may not represent whole numbers and they do not have to. Only the cypher digits in the private key actually need to be whole numbers. 
3	1526837040	1	Also works in multiples of 10. 21,31,41, 51
3	1526837110	1	Good point - yeah I noticed that symbol earlier (said it looks a bit like a text cursor) and figured it might be useful. LIke you said, the result always has the same digit that's being  multiplied as the last digit - and, *the digit before always seems to be a "smaller/less complex version" of the symbol in question*. I think this is very important.I've been thinking along the lines of a system using base 50/60, but you're right, there could be non-whole numbers in there.
4	1526837493	1	So to elaborate on your equations: Y * X = (Y-z)YP * X = (P-z)PV * X = (V-z)VPerhaps z isn't a constant, but it seems intuitive that the less complex symbols are smaller in value.Edit: I'm using z as a random value, not related to the Z shaped symbol
0	1526833848	2	OP you are evil
0	1526843025	1	This is the string of allowed base58 characters `123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz`And this is the result of u/majestic_12inch`L**!fnrCYwxHsqbFKkfZVS@iflzwK$FyXV&Xet$FnmTG<W>**eYgqdfq`My result is almost the same, I have some ideas about the numbers and I am not sure about Z characters. But we both clearly saw a lowercase l. Lowercase l is not in the base58 because it's can be mistaken for 1 or i.Shame I didn't notice lowercase l before I wasted time on numbers.I assume one of these three reasons for this. You made a mistake, you are trolling, this is a deeper puzzle and the cryptic text labelled 'Private Key' is not actual private key
1	1526846184	1	> I assume one of these three reasons for this. You made a mistakeUpon review what I thought was a lower case L was actually the number 1 in the private key.  
1	1526843833	1	Good shout on the lower case l. I was wondering why the keys I've been trying were not valid. Most likely it's a mistake and should be capital L (or something else...) It seems too close to a valid key for the puzzle to be deeper, and OP doesn't seem like the trolling type.
1	1526845199	1	Also re: the Z letters, I was assuming that the symbol that looks like a square lower-case p was a "zz" sound, making the characters in the private key "z-ee". Being British, this threw me a bit because we call it "zed" haha.Also there are some discrepancies - really if it's a "zz" sound then the word "users" at the start of paragraph 2 should have that character, but instead it uses the "elongated backwards Z" (which corresponds to an S. I figured by looking at some other words that contain that symbol (like "just" and "concepts") that this was probably a typo.

0	1526807006	1	If I get the square root of 21 for one of the symbols, am I doing it wrong?
1	1526807254	1	Are you using ring theory? 
2	1526843659	1	I'm using necklace theory. 
1	1526810512	0	must be another typo
2	1526846630	1	It's not, I found the example that would make you think so, but all of the number symbols are whole numbers.
0	1526810987	1	I have to go somewhere so I'll post whatever I could get to. Phonetics is important.

1	1526811281	3	Good Job!
1	1526812580	1	I solved most of the letters I think, and mine are a little different to yours. Perhaps the "uu" should be "w" (double-u)?Some of the letters you're missing are H, QB, ZV, Z, V, (symbol), ET, F, NMTG... I think. I'm having trouble with the numbers to be honest, it's some strange base system I think - there are loads of different symbols. I think I can sort the rest of the letters pretty quickly, so I'm gonna try and work out this number system.If anyone wants to give any ideas about the numbers, feel free (I'm a bit stumped, but the "~~bracket~~" edit "text cursor" looking symbol might be important). I'll post the rest of the letters when I decipher them.
2	1526813632	1	I think it's likely that each of the 6 symbols in the key represents a single digit, giving a 52 digit WIF private key. I think if I can crack that  text cursor thingy, I might be onto something.

0	1526837749	1	Yup well I guess it’s staying there
0	1526837769	1	The numbers are gonna turn my brain into mush. Either there’s typos or I’m crazy (possibly both)
0	1526815604	-1	That's $20 .. Unless someone knows exactly how to solve this kind of puzzles, I doubt anyone would care. 
1	1526818329	17	It's more for fun, rather than the money. But it's still 20 bucks! Millions of people just do puzzles for no money at all.
2	1526818417	6	Not if McAfee is right.. It will be worth a lot more in 3 years time. 
2	1526823861	4	True. I didn't consider how much fun it can be if you are into puzzles
