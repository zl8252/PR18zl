1	1526842205	1	Im not so sure, people are still going to want to use banks, and banks can use bitcoin to improve their efficiency.
1	1526837775	1	True, but they'll fail.No one likes banks. Even the people who work for them don't like them.It's like a people's revolution, because enough is enough.

3	1526842483	1	Thank you so much for the compliment. I cherish my youthful outlook as I am actually in my 9th decade.Cheers, you really made my day ;)

0	1526843790	1	it is full bulshiit!!after regulation, neither country wont be ban on the btc, yet. and other way btc will become more popular and use after regulation
0	1526848108	1	All the governments need to do is outlaw any business from accepting anything other than FedCoin.
0	1526835949	1	1) Bitcoin needs adoption to become meaningful.2) There will be no adoption without regulation.Companies will not accept bitcoin if it's harmful to their bottom line, ergo, Bitcoin is very much going to be affected by regulations.
1	1526842578	1	Redditor for a day. 
1	1526842331	1	I dont see how bitcoin can be regulated, only its conversion to and from fiat. the article doesnt really explain what it means by regulation
1	1526837428	1	Regulations will adjust to Bitcoin, not the other way around.Sorry.
2	1526838360	1	That’s not how regulations work.Bitcoin market cap: $145BM2: $14TDo the math.
3	1526838753	1	Countries that apply hostile regulations to Bitcoin will cease to be relevant.It's not complicated.
4	1526838976	1	You didn’t do the math: Bitcoin is insignificant in the world of finance. It is not treated as a currency. I don’t think you understand how the world or even your local economy works.
5	1526840835	1	All unbacked fiat is based on a fatally-flawed premise.All unbacked fiat has failed. There are no exceptions. Always has. Always will.Of course your problem gets bigger with fractional reserve banking (no subreference joke intended) but that's a different discussion. Fiat is a dinosaur with terminal cancer, the rest of us have moved on.
6	1526843730	1	You say “the rest of us” but you refer to less than 1% of the wealth in circulation. You say “fiat is dead” and yet we live in a dollar benchmarked world.Can I please have some of whatever you’re smoking? Sunday must be lit 
1	1526837981	1	Marcion is correct. Bitcoin cannot and will not bendvto 'regulation'.Although, you are correct anout companies not accepting bitcoin. We'll see the big corporations becoming undone because they are on gov welfare and are dependent on the fraudulent creation of money.Smaller operators and mom pop companies will thrive.We see this already. Mom&pop shops accepting bitcoin over the last few years have done very very well while corporations get in line for the tax payer hand out.
2	1526843314	1	Bitcoin doesn’t bend to regulation: it’s use does and it can go on for a while. Look at Marijuana in the US. It’s been illegal for 80 years and a large portion of the population understood this was a bad law... but that didn’t stop *a lot* of people from going to jail for that belief.The same thing will happen to bitcoin if the government feels it is a threat. They will find a few guys: guys you would find in this subreddit who are white collar with families who would get ass-raped if they ever saw the inside of a jail and they will make big public examples of them to scare everybody else.(They already started test cases with those local bitcoin busts a few years back)
