5	1526929388	1	Gotta spell it right man. If you don't spell it as hodl then we won't know what your trying to say. And of course, haven't sold a dime since I started, even if I use it as a currency to buy things I quickly buy back whatever amount went out for the purchase to keep my hodlings steady and growing.

0	1526910803	24	I still don’t understand this meme
1	1526912780	27	Explanation of the meme used... sort of:http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/is-this-a-pigeonIn this context, I guess the confused/unenlightened gentleman is calling this a bull run, when in fact it's just a little bump up in price.  I could have this all wrong.  I'm trying to figure it out too.
2	1526917459	3	Thanks! Definitely makes more sense now. Weird it just surfaced recently tho
3	1526931118	1	Memes happen fast and die harder. Gotta keep up.
1	1526928954	1	Worst meme ever seen...

1	1526926297	1	All the "redditor for 3 minutes" flair
2	1526927055	1	I am a Redditor for an Internet eternity, and involved in Bitcoin for years. I truly believe in this technology and its importance, yet if I am to discuss the possibility of price action being in a downtrend you will call me a nocoiner. Is that how it works?
3	1526927500	1	Pipe down, nocoiner!
3	1526927916	1	Ah I dunno I mean it certainly seems to be on a downtrend right now. As someone who owns Bitcoin I'm hoping for a reversal of that trend. I do see a lot of new accounts that talk shit I didn't say a word about older accounts saying things contrary to my hopes and dreams. 
0	1526918107	2	Lol petite baby gains= bull run alright. We are NOT locked in a bear trap folks lol
0	1526923743	1	Is this a cake day?
1	1526924072	1	It is!
0	1526924299	1	Up 300 % from this time last year is this a bull run?
0	1526928271	1	4% a day keeps the doctor away. 
0	1526915508	7	Has the bull run ever really ended? (Look at the long-term chart)
1	1526917934	15	by that logic, no bull run ever finishes as long as you cherry pick your time scale.
2	1526928729	1	Kind of but I think the timescale that matters the most to people is simply when they bought a large amount until today.  If you bought in December, this has suuucked for you, but if you bought 1 year prior it's been going great.
3	1526930723	1	We're talking about what defines a bull run, not how you feel about your investment.
4	1526930912	1	I know what we're talking about, I'm just explaining how everyone's bias is determined.
2	1526920072	2	Crypto market is like 4 years old man... the average stock market bull 'run' lasts 7 years... These few-month pull-backs are not bear markets.
3	1526921776	13	Until you consider the fact that the crypto market moves much faster than the stock market does. You may have heard it a lot, so you may think it’s a meme. But the crypto market is open 24/7/365, while the stock market is only open for 6.5 hours, 5 days a week (not including holidays). So doing the calculations, the crypto market is actually open about 5 times longer than the stock market. So the 1-year bear market in 2014 would be the equivalent of a 5-year bear market in stocks. The 2.5 year bull run from 2015 to 2017 was the equivalent of a 12.5 year bull run in stocks. The current bear market which has lasted for about 5 months, is the equivalent of 2 years in stocks. Luckily this means we will have a quicker recovery time than the stock market would.Also the crypto market is 8 years old, not 4 years.

3	1526934970	1	>These few\-month pull\-backs are not bear markets.rofl
1	1526916987	8	Nope it hasn’t. Still up 311% from 1 year ago to this date. 
1	1526919467	1	Lol, that's not how you define a bull run.
2	1526919947	0	20% rule definitely doesn't apply to Crypto. 
3	1526927996	1	When you shed over 50% after a bull run, you can consider the run officially over.
0	1526916739	3	>checks portfolioNope. 
0	1526910122	1	Well, CME futures expire on the 25th so tread carefully when those snakes are active.
1	1526926369	1	Nice can you post the link? What do they expire at?
2	1526926931	1	Ha! What do they expire at? I wish I knew, buddy.
1	1526916999	0	Yawn no one cares about the futures. They mean absolute shit to me.

1	1526917017	0	It's what fueled 2017
2	1526917713	3	Sure buddy, all bitcoiners use reddit, and memes pumped the price. Lol
3	1526923312	1	We pretty much blew past the "it's over 9000" meme phase the first time... Why else do you think the price dropped? Obviously so we can get a second chance now that we are better prepared. It's all about the memes.
4	1526923855	1	Meme to the moon!

0	1526906668	-46	There won't be anymore bull runs because the US Government has obtained control over \*Most\* Cryptos BTC included. In addition to that, Mt. GoX is dumping 100s of thousands of BTC when the price peaks close to 9.5K \+ killing any chance of of anyone making any money anymore.Crypto is dead as fuck. Do you think the Government will allow the poor to become wealthy? lmfao. slapdicks. Bull run.. BTC won't $10K ever again. 
1	1526907215	40	Do you think the Earth is flat? 
2	1526908756	23	It's so hilarious he actually believes the Earth is flat. This is true Reddit gold
2	1526907418	-21	I'm open to proof that's not provided to us by the very people trying to push an agenda. Have YOU ever seen the Earth from far away? The answer is a resounding "FUCK NO YOU HAVEN'T"NASA = Never A Straight Answer. I've no doubt we're being lied to. I'm just not dumb enough to buy and eat the shit they feed us. Clearly you think it's delicious and for that I'm truly sorry. Is the Earth Flat? maybe , I have no way of ever knowing.
3	1526908518	13	I know this is a pointless discussion but how do geostationary satellites work if the earth is a flat disc? There is no such thing as a geostationary orbit around a disc. You can literally build equipment in your garage that can verify the locations of and communicate with geostationary weather satellites like GOES-15. 
4	1526913861	3	are you seriously trying to convince him?
3	1526907420	29	Hi open to proof that's not provided to us the very people trying to push an agenda, I'm Dad!
4	1526907630	11	Dad-bot deserves gold.
3	1526908299	12	Ride on one of dem fancy airplanes that cross the ocean if you want to see the curvature of the earth without going into space, doofus. That's evidence you can provide to yourself.
4	1526915865	3	Right? And flights don't travel in straight lines
5	1526921958	2	You gotta wonder about these flat earthers. They will accept that the complicated math involved in cryptography and software development is correct but will disbelieve the simple math that is used to prove the Earth is round! Lol
3	1526908680	7	Get a fucking balloon and attach a go pro to it. Proof 
4	1526909428	1	You mean the cameras with the fish eye lens that distorts the picture?
5	1526909504	3	Okay grab any camera you want and attach it to a balloon. Or go ride a plane. 
5	1526916144	1	You can compensate for that in software. 
3	1526907869	3	> Have YOU ever seen the Earth from far away? The answer is a resounding "FUCK NO YOU HAVEN'T"What about those that have? Ahh the next thing you'll say was that the moon landings were all faked as well.
3	1526909718	2	Well, I'm sure we could do a laser test that would prove the earth is curved. Based on the stated circumference, it drops 8 inches squared for every mile. So anything longer than a mile (like a bridge) has the earth's curvature factored into it, right? I mean engineers have to account for that?
4	1526911967	1	Anything longer than 300 meters has to factor in the curvature of the planet, including ships.
5	1526913283	2	https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://s14.postimg.org/r65pjq9kx/chicago-618x276.jpgMaybe you're right.
6	1526914187	1	Maybe you are the smartest man alive....
7	1526915207	2	First, I'd like to thank all the little people...
8	1526917391	1	The earths median curvature is 1 meter drop per 12 km.Hardly visible on a blurry skyline.
9	1526920459	2	I think you meant 8 inches per mile squared.Which means a drop (or curve) of over 1,660 feet at a distance of 50 miles.Go ahead and recalculate and see if the picture makes sense. Take your time...

6	1526919465	1	I disagree with both on all issues. Same same.
7	1526920425	1	That...doesn't make sense. You disagree with both the ability to have abortions, and the ability to not have abortions? You want neither Net Neutrality or Net Neutrality? What?And besides, that just reeks of laziness. Just because a particular platform doesn't perfectly reflect your views doesn't make it completely invalid. That means it is the closest representation, and perhaps a first step  to what you do want (ie ACA being the first step to UHC). You need to learn to make the best, or least worst choice, because to just say they're both as bad and not vote at all is to willingly throw away your voice and stick your head in the dirt.
8	1526922314	2	> That...doesn't make sense. You disagree with both the ability to have abortions, and the ability to not have abortions? You want neither Net Neutrality or Net Neutrality? What?Nope, it makes much more sense than supporting the blue or red team. I do not believe the government should be making moral decisions for me, nor what I do with my body. If not for the government, we wouldn't need laws to protect neutrality! The government grants these corporations monopolies in the marketplace. They broke it, now you're telling me we need them to fix it? No, just get out of the way and let freedom work.>And besides, that just reeks of laziness.

You need to learn to make the best, or least worst choice, because to just say they're both as bad and not vote at all is to willingly throw away your voice and stick your head in the dirt.The opposite of true. It's lazy thinking to say that one party is going to fix the problems, when both parties have been causing the problems for many decades.ACA is a total and complete disaster, which is why we now have private, free market alternatives to health care popping up to fix the problem that government can't and won't solve.No, sticking your head in the dirt is not pretend that government is actually solving problems and actually doing good in the world, and ignoring all the damage, destruction, and unintended consequences. I'm not going to throw my support into a domination system that has been failing people since its inception.We can do much, much better as a society than these antiquated, top-down hierarchical structures that serve nobody but maybe a few in power.Decentralization and bitcoin are a nice start. Hierarchies are going to die anyway, might as well stop clinging to these old structures and systems and get on board with a decentralized world now.
9	1526926720	1	>Nope, it makes much more sense than supporting the blue or red team. I do not believe the government should be making moral decisions for me, nor what I do with my body.But right here, you would be going against your own interests then to vote for, or not vote against, the "team" that does want to make moral decisions about what you do with your body. You can obviously disagree on other aspects of their platform, but that is an example of how you do agree with a particular side. Further, a lot of voters are mobilized on this single issue alone, particularly among those that do want to make moral decisions about your body.>If not for the government, we wouldn't need laws to protect neutrality! The government grants these corporations monopolies in the marketplace. They broke it, now you're telling me we need them to fix it? No, just get out of the way and let freedom work.This is another confusing bit for me, because you acknowledge it's the corporations but lay the blame at government for trying to implement legislation to check the corporations. It's those private interests that are lobbying against Net Neutrality, and who try to capture regulatory agencies (as they have done with this administration's FCC) because the free market actively conspires to make itself less free. This also seems to mean that you again would be more naturally aligned with a particular "team" over the other.>The opposite of true. It's lazy thinking to say that one party is going to fix the problems, when both parties have been causing the problems for many decades.I agree, it's foolish to think either side can fix everything, or that either have been or could be perfect representatives. But you're letting perfection be the enemy of good. First and foremost, voter apathy (which is often due to the assertion that both sides are the same, which is why I'm engaging you on this) is the biggest culprit. It means that there are huge swaths of the population that representatives don't have to represent. If more people voted for the least worst option, eventually you start moving upwards until the acceptable options get increasingly better. Instead, the Overton Window has moved sharply to the extreme right, and Eisenhower would be called a spineless socialist today. Instead of continual progress, it's a race to the extreme, and to the bottom.>ACA is a total and complete disaster, which is why we now have private, free market alternatives to health care popping up to fix the problem that government can't and won't solve.ACA has major issues, but I don't know by what metric it would be a complete disaster. It also doesn't make sense to me to say there are private alternatives, because without a public option, the ACA is all about private insurance being accessible through an open marketplace. To say that government can't solve healthcare doesn't ring true to me when every other developed nation on Earth has UHC that does it better and cheaper; the US pays twice per capita the OECD average, and we have lower lifespans and higher infant mortality for it. It's like the new American Exceptionalism is being unable to do what others have done successfully for decades.>No, sticking your head in the dirt is not pretend that government is actually solving problems and actually doing good in the world, and ignoring all the damage, destruction, and unintended consequences.Then vote, especially in primaries where you have more power to select a candidate who does more closely align with your views. Without being engaged civically, it's just empty complaining about how ineffectual the government is, while giving yourself a way out of having to learn more about the issues or candidates. And that is lazy. The government is nothing more than people, and will only function as well as the people it's composed of are. It's failed in many ways, and yet also built national infrastructure, put a man on the moon, and created the internet. It also regularly does a [massive amount of other tasks that completely and positively affect our daily lives](https://i.imgur.com/Aic2o.png) that go unnoticed because that's not worthy of headlines.>I'm not going to throw my support into a domination system that has been failing people since its inception. We can do much, much better as a society than these antiquated, top-down hierarchical structures that serve nobody but maybe a few in power.The US has and its system has had many failures, but also many triumphs. Unfortunately, top-down hierarchical structures will have to exist in any enterprise, public or private. The only alternatives are anarchy, from which hierarchies based on power and resources will still emerge like the warlords of Somalia, or a fully post-state society like Marxist communism, which is unlikely until humans are completely post-scarcity. So, if we have to deal with these hierarchies barring major and likely disastrous change, it makes sense to me to continually work towards a better version of it.>Decentralization and bitcoin are a nice start. Hierarchies are going to die anyway, might as well stop clinging to these old structures and systems and get on board with a decentralized world now.I'm a big believer in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. But I think looking at fiat is a good example of why I think that, barring complete catastrophe, current power structures are here to stay. Fiat's value is backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, which is the best guarantee of value you can have. The reason is because for that to no longer mean something, the nation would have to have completely unraveled, and any way in which that could happen would mean complete global disaster.
6	1526915411	0	You're right. One side hates America, hates Israel, hates white people on a racial level, sides with ISIS, sides with North Korea, sides with Iran, sides with the EU. The other side supports Donald Trump. Thanks for clarifying. 
7	1526917170	1	This is fucking stupid and you are too if you actually believe it.
7	1526916035	1	Nice gaslight. But it rings hollow. From the looks of it, Trumpers are simply stupid, racist or both. The center, left or any self respecting republicans are disgusted by his pee pee show of an administration. 
8	1526916801	2	HahahahahahHahahaha HahahahaDude you can’t shit on trumpers and then shill for establishment republicans and democratsThat’s actually too meme 
9	1526929483	1	Shill? Show me where I did that. Or is this just another gaslight sando. Yawn. And for your edification—Trumpers are by far the lowest form of constituent. Functionally illiterate, driven by fear and all too happy to consume alternative facts as reality. 
5	1526914568	2	Nah
6	1526919318	2	You a Hill fan?
7	1526922794	1	Hell no, but saying she's as bad as Trump is absurd. 
8	1526932304	1	Ok, I'll accept that. What is it about Trump that you say makes him much worse than Hillary?
5	1526914941	0	False equivalency.
6	1526916948	1	Well one is a statist and the other is a statist. Idk pretty close imo. 
3	1526913564	1	I've never understood flat-earthers, I can't get my head around your train of thought for what possible agenda you think your being fed.All science, All basic fundamental principles are against you and the information is easily accessible to you even for you yourself to test.What level of lie do you think the whole world is feeding you and in what way, shape or form do you think that contributes to a 'mass cover up' I mean if it was that the world was flat (it isn't) But what difference would that even make to you specifically?Genuinely interested.
3	1526912276	1	Take a photo of the sky above your house every day for a year. You can prove you are on a sphere by mapping constellations and relative movement to markers that you can set up in your backyard.Also get a telescope and look at the fucking moon it's obviously a sphere.
1	1526907817	6	What are we going to do when mtgox prints more coins to dump? Oh wait, they can’t. This is a temporary sale. Grab what you can while they are under $50,000. As for Gov control over BTC? No, this is whales with the market by the balls letting the Gov think it has control. BTC is filled with the best and brightest in the industry. You really think a room full of grey hairs can control this movement?
2	1526908864	1	I choose this theory. I remember another time when Bitcoin started to fall and I sold everything.  It bottomed out low and hung out there for years.  Then in 2017 it... I learned my lesson as did a lot of us. Most of us are not willing to make that mistake again - for this things will be fine. Only thing that will change is each time this happens that stagnant period will get shorter and shorter. 
2	1526908270	-12	Yes, GoX is temporary. $50,000? Never lmfao.. not a chance in Hell.They're not "grey hairs" yeah they're old AF but it's their team that is paid money you and I and the rest of world will never see , with access to things we'll never understand that are in control of something that can't be controlled.You really think someone named "Satoshi" created Bitcoin? You think they didn't know all about it years before it was launched and weren't *there* the day it did. 
3	1526908841	16	For a person who demands absolute proof with their own eyes regarding the whole Flat Earth thing, you sure do feel secure in your beliefs about Bitcoin that you absolutely have no proof of.
1	1526915039	5	I will bet you 1BTC that Bitcoin hits $10k before the end of the year. 
1	1526909725	1	Shit, time to go home boys. Nostradamus speaks the troth.
1	1526912867	1	I saw US government.... Well.in the last 18 months only 15%to 20% of the cash ( not trades) cash going into cryptocurreny came from the USA. So if the USA gets knocked out of cryptocurreny. So what. It will be like China. It will keep going. The vast majority of the cash that made the market go from 200 to 500 billion came from. Japan and Korea. So.....What are you even talking abjut
1	1526908843	1	So either the price of an asset is being controlled by a secret cabal of government conspirators whose only desire is to crush a currency market that provides them total visibility of all transactions or the price is being controlled by market forces. Which one could possibly be true? Bitcoin is not going up because the market has decided that it is worth 8kish. That could change over time but that's what's happening here.
2	1526909933	2	Bitcoin is one of the only 20% of commodities under capitalism whose price is actually determined by the market ;)
3	1526918347	2	price is actually controlled by the market? then why are there different prices on every exchange? and with volume as low as it is, please explain the weekend jump. it looks more manipulated by the day.
4	1526929242	1	Markets are not "fair" or "logical." Nor are they not manipulable. 
5	1526929323	1	Ultimately, markets are no less political than the 80% of things whose price is not determined by the market.
5	1526930948	1	so then the arguement that price is based on math and science?
