0	1526904304	3	Youâ€™re work is insane. Well done, extremely talented.
0	1526910569	3	Is this a Human Grumpy Cat?
1	1526925025	1	No it's a caricature of an actual guy in real life named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. The media once decided he must be the real Satoshi because he happens to be a programmer and was once a neighbor of Hal Finney, the first guy to receive a bitcoin payment. But cryptography isn't his specialty and in short it's definitely not him. He occasionally comes to crypto conferences though because he's like a minor celebrity in this space now due to the case of mistaken identity that happened. People sometimes use his face as a representation of Satoshi because he's the community's favorite "faketoshi."
0	1526905540	2	Not bad!
0	1526912171	2	Is this a picture of what we think Satoshi looks like?
1	1526912564	6	Its Dorian Satoshi. The guy whom a reporter thought was Satoshi. He was like...."nup...not me"
2	1526912662	1	I thought he looked familiar. He got a bit of fame from the Netflix Bitcoin doc

1	1526916650	1	Its off white. But I could scan it in and adjust the brightness for you?
