0	1522630289	14	Sounds like FUN ;)
1	1522682179	2	Definitely glad I bought FUN when it was added on Bitfinex. FUN and BAT are some of the promising coins on the market right now.
2	1522685261	1	I'm all in for  BAT
1	1522636685	3	isn't that a gambling token?

0	1522623299	2	I'm willing to bet that there will be a MALTA coin in the future.
1	1522647046	0	Yes will be working on it I promise :)
0	1522641407	2	The hell is a gaming authority? 
1	1522645826	2	Regulates the gambling industry I guess.
2	1522647247	1	:) exactly.. the online gaming industry is what interests us... which consist of the world's biggest operators who receive and pay huge amounts of money online. 
3	1522688542	1	Gambling not gaming. You said online gaming and I thought you were talking about video games. 
3	1522655540	0	Stop with the euphemisms. Just call it what it is. So sleazy to call gambling gaming especially online. Before Malta can home crypto anything it needs to change this. It's like Bitcoin cash vs Bitcoin, abuse of the term helps no one.  
0	1522631995	3	The country has had banking and political scandals worthy of films. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/21/iranian-banker-malta-corruption-scandal-money-laundering-charges>Galizia, killed in a car-bomb attack in Oct. 2017, had reported that the Maltese prime ministerâ€™s wife was the ultimate beneficiary of funds in a secret company in Panama, including funds from Azerbaijan transferred through Pilatus Bank. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-malta-efimova/russian-source-in-maltese-scandal-fears-for-her-life-lawyer-idUSKBN1H613EOne should be cautious with how much trust they want to put into the systems their "regulators" will promote to the rest of the world. 
1	1522647164	1	Fair enough it was not something nice .. however the government put enormous pressure on the police to find the culprits and they did and they are no in Jail. it was such a big this as these things do not happen and are surely not permitted in Malta
2	1522654033	3	Malta is corrupt end of. Ever since Joseph Muscat rose to power we have seen unprecedented levels of corruption in every level of the public sector. Sure we had corruption when Gonzi was in power, but it was never as blatant as that of today.Source: I'm Maltese just like you.
2	1522655356	2	The regulators "accidentally" license the mafia and pull them whenever they're caught. https://calvinayre.com/2018/02/02/business/malta-suspends-phoenix-online-gambling-license/https://igacademy.com/bookmaker-mafia-ties-licence-suspended-malta-gaming-authority/Then there are the rumors that staff at MGA will be fired if they call attention to the shadiness that goes on. https://www.whistleblowersblog.org/2018/03/articles/international/u-s-ngo-calls-upon-greco-to-intervene-in-libel-lawsuit-filed-against-whistleblower-valery-atanasov/>Mr. Atanasov blew the whistle on oversight irregularities and lack of enforcement while working at the MGA. He believed these irregularities could allow for money laundering and other financial crimes. Since reporting his concerns, Mr. Atanasov has been formally disciplined, suspended with a salary reduction, and fired from his job. Mr. Atanasov is now being sued by the MGA for defamation.

0	1522651299	1	I hope this opens the door for online poker sites to start accepting cryptocurrency. Some of the shady unregulated sites do now, but I'd like to see the big sites (Pokerstars, Partypoker etc) start accepting it.
0	1522656352	1	I wonder what this does for BETR?[BETR - Better Betting](https://betterbetting.org) 
0	1522676780	1	Awesome news!
0	1522621264	1	Wow, thats huge
