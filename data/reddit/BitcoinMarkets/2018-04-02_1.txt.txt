0	1522677315	34	I see a lot of comments here about "people who bought in/after December" and what is going through their heads right now. I personally know four people who bought at various points from $6,000-$17,000. All four of them invested a few thousand dollars, which is about two weeks pay for them, so, not insubstantial, but also not life-changing. None of them obsess over the price, and none have sold or plan to sell. I'm sure a lot of people have already sold at a loss, but the sentiment I hear from them is, "well it's already down X%, and I don't need the money, so I may as well ride this out." Just want to point out that there are a lot of people, including those who are in the red, who won't be selling any time soon, regardless of price. Just some first hand anecdotal evidence from a random internet dude.Edit: I will also note that none of them have added any BTC during this downtrend, which I also find interesting.
1	1522678159	6	I can pretty much echo the sentiment of your post. Most of my acquaintances were actually in on Litecoin and Ethereum, and they've either not sold (and also are not adding) or sold either Jan 17th or Feb 5th and haven't mentioned anything since.I imagine if they looked at prices now they'd feel like they played the market pretty savvy but I don't think they are.
1	1522678757	5	Same for my social circle. Only those trapped in bad finances left ship. The others are still holding (though shitty alts mostly) and don't seem worried about the price fluctuations. The amounts are small, though. A few weeks pay is barely substantial. Let alone two weeks that's pretty much nothing for something you are considering as "investment".But this is bad sampling. There are millions of users out there. I think average-normie has stopped buying until he is pressured to (ie: price rising + new ath). Buying now is probably only whales.
2	1522681354	5	> Buying now is probably only whales.and smart boys
3	1522681651	3	Yeah. I'm still buying
1	1522679738	4	I bought in January - not an enormous amount, and spread out across 8 currencies in the top 20 for marketcap. Ones I felt were (hopefully) viable long term. That money will sit there for a while. I'll check the market every couple weeks, and most likely contribute a few hundred bucks every few months. I don't predict I'll see much of a return for a loooooong time. And that'a a-okay with me.
2	1522680108	1	Thanks for sharing, it seems like there are a lot of people in your situation who feel the same way, again just sharing what I'm hearing.
1	1522678379	6	The december-people I know are just bored, but none of them will sell with a loss and only one in four is continually buying - but not BTC.
1	1522679512	3	It's nice to hear stories of people holding BTC :)
2	1522679997	3	Haha thanks. And it's not some fanatical "hodl" mentality either, it's just hey I bought this thing that I think could be worth a bunch in the future, and I don't need the money now, so, meh may as well not sell.
3	1522686173	1	But I think that is the hodl mentality. Although I get what you meant by that, the true philosophy of hodl should just be - an investment you ride out until you need the money. The word has become imbued with a fanatical tone as if an idiot hodling would never ever sell. What would be the point of that? That’s hoarding not hodling. It’s just the opposite strategy to trading. 
1	1522677589	6	I know you're just sharing anecdotal evidence, but there's probably enough btc between the traders, whales and chopshops to take this thing to any price between $0 to a million without any hodlers' stash coming into play. Hodling is probably at best a personal investment strategy but not that big of a factor in market price in terms of those btcs not being traded.
2	1522678132	6	That is not true...the market is pretty illiquid with how low this volume is and if it remains that way slippage on large orders buying or selling will only get worse. Id be careful underestimating the value of coins on the sidelines.
2	1522677785	3	Thanks for the comment. So, you think FOMO from retail investors wasn't needed/didn't contribute much to bringing us to $20K?
1	1522680207	4	The casual investor just follows the big trend. They're the first to be slaughtered and the last to make the real big bucks. If pushed, my bet would be that the whales and the real big money are and will continue to accumulate as we head down (if we haven't seen the real bottom). The next bull market could be months or even years away. Casual money not accumulating in these ranges is par the course. It is interesting nonetheless that they're not running out the door to sell. I'm expecting that round of casual money that came in between Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan to exit pretty fast if we ever hit a new ATH.
1	1522680505	2	I know several who bought on margin >10k and we're liquidated. They *all* plan to re-buy lower.
2	1522680954	5	I don't think OP is talking about people who have enough experience about markets to buy on margin.
2	1522681816	1	Thanks for sharing, we'll see how their plan works out for them. What specific numbers are they targeting? Or do they just know they'll buy "once it's lower?"
3	1522682322	1	A couple I know are planning to wire in $ this week. Not sure their price target (they're certainly susceptible to fomo).
1	1522681487	2	I bought at $200. Cashed out enough at $20k ATH that I really couldn’t be bothered about what happens with the rest. All I do is occasionally buy a couple of BTC of any alt that looks like a worthwhile long term prospect. So I probably shouldn’t be in a traders group rubbing everyone’s noses in it, sorry. But maybe this will add a different insight for the more active traders. We’re not all panicky weak hands that bought in December ‘17. I’ll wager a significant portion of holders are in my position and feel fairly dispassionate (but curious) about where it goes from here. 
2	1522682249	1	Thanks for sharing. I hear a lot of people here talk about investors who bought at ~$200 who haven't sold anything yet. A prevailing viewpoint seems to be that if we keep dropping, say to $4,XXX, those people who haven't realized profits will start selling. I'll keep my opinion on this to myself. What are your thoughts there?
3	1522682633	5	I honestly won’t sell. But only because I was insanely lucky and sold enough of my stack at the ATH that I realized an almost 10000% return on my initial total outlay so I figure that no matter how much it falls I may as well stay in the remainder for the long haul. I held for periods of over a year where it dropped from almost $2000 back to sub $300 and then stagnated forever so this feels no different to me. 
4	1522690574	1	What if you had never sold any of your coins? In that hypothetical, if we dropped down to $4,000 would you start selling to at least realize some profit? My goal here is to try and understand the mentality of an average early adopter who hasn't sold anything yet.
5	1522690769	1	Having held through previous crashes and capitulations I suspect I still probably wouldn’t sell in the hope that it could moon again. 
6	1522691087	2	Thanks. As I mentioned before, there are people here who are convinced that a drop down to the ~$3,000/$4,000 level will bring out early adopters who have never sold before, introducing a new supply variable into the equation. I personally tend to think that the overwhelming majority of early adopters who have never sold before will not sell there. 
7	1522691462	1	Yeah. I don’t see what’s so special about that price level. If early adopters didn’t sell on the way down at 15, 10 or 7,5K I don’t see why they would suddenly change sentiment at 4K. 
1	1522679485	0	Anecdotal evidence can be a very poor indicator. For example, I personally know 8 millionaires that each bought over $100k of BTC in December. So it is far better to rely on actual data like number of new accounts opened at exchanges between October and December 2017. Measurable and quantifiable statistics! You might even be able to get the averaged stats on the amount of BTC purchased by those new accounts during those months. It would be great to have one of the major coin sites dig up and publish this data.
2	1522679690	2	It can be, but in this case I'm specifically responding to claims made here that refer to the people in question (casual retail investors). If you see lots of comments about millionaires and their motivations, I encourage you to share your anecdotes as well. That make sense?
3	1522680260	1	Those were retail investors purchasing through exchanges by and for themselves. In a cryptocurrency group that meets in my city I can tell you there’s around 40 more that were smaller purchases <5 BTC.
4	1522680466	1	Cool, so do you have anything to share about their feelings/actions/future plans since they bought?
5	1522681145	2	Generally speaking, HODLing what they have left. There are some trading now. The number of people attending meet ups has dwindled greatly since December so there’s no chance to converse with a larger group. But that in itself speaks to the feeling. Majority of the group members had watched through 2017 then bought in Q4. 
2	1522679980	1	Ridiculous
3	1522680645	3	Ridiculous? Not at all! In the crypto group at the peak in December around 110 people showed up. For March meet there was 18.
0	1522685849	32	I just wanted to say a quick thank you to all involved here.  I wish I had followed this thread when I bought my first BTC at 11250.  I've been in financial services for 18 years, mostly the volatile ones, hedge funds, managed futures etc.  The only thing I can equate BTC with is the most volatile of commodity futures managers, that somehow always end up on top.  I was not part of the mob, I invested because some folks I trust in the tech sector had been trying to get me to invest for years. They are all still extremely confident in BTC.  Luckily, I'm only down 25 or so percent.I'm here for the long haul, I love the technology, we are building a blockchain based solution that our clients need and have asked for. It will solve a major problem for them.  Despite the losses, I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of my involvement.Anyway, this thread has saved me alot of money the past few days.  I've never traded before, but may try my hand at it given it looks like the only way to make money in this environment is on short movementsI'll be around,but just wanted to give my appreciation for the first legit thread I've found in Reddit land. 
1	1522688560	3	I've had a very similar experience to yours. I was in financial services for ~5 years. I was as an associate at a macro hedge fund and before that was an analyst with alternative asset management at a top U.S. investment bank. I'm now in a different business altogether (corp strat/dev on the west coast).It's interesting that you equate BTC to commodity futures managers, I have noticed those similarities as well. I also equate it with top forex investors/traders, especially ones who successfully operate in highly illiquid markets. The volatility and lack of "foundation" is what makes this financial product unlike any other in the marketplace. It is BTC's blessing (where moons and lambos are being discussed one week then $0 is being discussed the following week) and BTC's curse (as it makes adoption difficult and scares off mainstream institutional investors).Like you, I also am here for the long haul. I believe in blockchain, I believe in crypto and I believe a handful of these currencies/tokens have the ability to change global efficiencies within Fortune 500 companies, which will eventually trickle down to the consumer. While I'm down ~30% on my overall portfolio (it includes some altcoins, don't hit me), I've thoroughly enjoyed my involvement here as well.
2	1522689386	2	We are very similar.  I was always on the sales and marketing side for the most part although my career began as an alternative investment analyst.  I'm in a new business as well.  We do energy projects and their funding.  I actually think the alt coins are here to stay, just in a different and more regulated format.  We are in the process of creating one.  Still in the beginning of the process, but it will not only solve a problem for the relative industry, but will have either have an equity component or be tied to the revenue of the ecosystem system.  The different coins used for the underlying technologies will be stable and tied to real world costs.  It will also be as compliant as we can make it, problem is nobody has an answer for that right now.  I also think you will see more and more coins tied to assets, purely because of the efficiencies the technolgy and liquidity that the virtual markets create.  Time will tell, but I am enjoying being here so very, very early.  We are at the beginning, not the end that is starting to permiate discussions on this and other threads.  Look forward to further discussions. 
1	1522686303	2	>11250The first time by it or the resulting bounce?
2	1522686553	3	Very first purchase on Jan 28.  Sad thing is I chickened out when it was 1000.  
0	1522655523	22	To be fair there’s probably been too many fake outs at this point to be able to spot a genuine reversal at least before it’s too late to truly benefit from. I am now realising just how difficult this game is to play 
1	1522655866	14	Buying bottoms works even in a bearmarket like this, as long as you use stop losses carefully and trailing stops to take profits. Just gotta stop trying to long 'breakouts' and it's not too bad. 
1	1522655626	7	It is always too late to catch a genuine reversal. That's why people try to catch the bottom.
2	1522655692	3	Yep and because of the risk you generally don’t benefit that way either 
0	1522672833	16	After a couple of bull flags since yesterday, we bounced off the downtrend line from $8K this morning. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.I've continually added to my short as we've spend time peeking above $7K but never breaking $7.2K. CA @ $7010 now. A whole lot of time and funding fees to get an entry I could have beat less than an hour ago, but sometimes that's the name of the game. I was about to flip to Sep futs, except now the funding fee is actually paying shorts. I'll keep holding it for now.Also added to my June futs long yesterday on that massive drop. CA @ 6440.https://www.tradingview.com/x/WyQ7FTGC/ We've got a very slight ascending wedge forming off these bull flags. The continued failure to break 7300 leads me to believe we haven't yet bottomed. This whole range of 6800-7100 is chop city, but I'm pretty happy to be holding a short near the top and a long from well below the bottom.Good luck all. 
1	1522673270	3	Played it nicely. Well done. 
1	1522673620	1	Good luck. Keep a close eye on that funding, it's so close to zero rn that it's flipping for me. Becoming quite a good sentiment indicator.
2	1522674008	1	Thanks man. I was getting paid to short most of the way from 11K down, so I'm not that concerned by the sentiment of bitmex cowboys. Still, I am surprised to see it flip despite a triple lower low: https://www.tradingview.com/x/qG610ls0/
0	1522659851	14	Take this with the usual disclaimers...My trusty set of Moving Averages are aiming at crossing on the 1 hour chart from the downside, maybe within 2 to 3 hours. Now since the 25th March we have been under the line, as it were, and have yet to cross back over. On average when they cross from the downside back up, we get an increase in price of around 4 to 5% lasting between 1 day to a week on average. The increase can be a lot more though.I'll watch and see if they cross over in the next 2 to 4 hours hopefully. A 5% boost though would see us cross the 7200 border many are keen on seeing broken, so we'll see. It could signal some short term relief.As a caveat to that, if we reject the crossover... we drop a large amount. The last few rejections have seen us drop around 10 to 12%, so here's hoping that doesn't happen.
1	1522660733	3	Keep us posted. 
2	1522660902	3	will do, as an update.. for the first time since the 25th March we have now posted an hourly candle above the slow moving average.Going to be an important next 1 to 2 hours to see if this hourly candle can produce the MA crossover. 
1	1522660525	2	Which moving average are you looking at? 
2	1522660773	2	I use weighted moving average set at 144, and smoothed moving average set at 5, with Heikin Ashi candles for bit more info on momentum.Use that alongside the ol Ichimoku, RSI and MACD trend lines, plus Bollinger Bands for spotting pressure build ups across the time frames. To top it off I use the DMI to help judge the trend a bit more fully, especially when it's running out of steam. 
0	1522647092	28	Scaling into longs from here. No rush. I see too many triumphant noobs about their shorts. They’re gonna learn the hard way

0	1522688849	10	Any comments about [this formation](https://imgur.com/a/wGdnj) with a surprising number of contacts on both lines?
1	1522689588	4	I would disagree with the other poster that it's a pennant. It's really more of an extremely shallow descending wedge or a descending triangle. Unfortunately, those are converse indicators, so not a huge help there. Edit: on mobile so I didn't see the scale. Yeah, I'm all about longer time frame patterns, but not sure I'd go into the "years" frame looking for flags/pennants. Support/resistance lines sure. I guess those really could just be the top/bottom of a wedge, though. 
1	1522689604	2	I'm not a TA dude, but that giant ass triangle can be drawn in many ways, like for the upper line: could use the 1st top instead of the 2nd top (in that 11.5k double-top), or for the lower line:  1st point is arbitrary and can go higher or lower. Also, triangles should be like up-down-up-down (?). But yeah, it looks like some sort of a giant triangle and/or a down-trend channel.

1	1522644156	14	Well, why wouldn't the bear ideas be a bit rational in these conditions? We have already fallen 70% from our ATH in 3 months. Would it be rational to say "well, we've already fallen 70 points, another 20 is possible (to return to the price where we were last year, and pretty close to 9 months ago). It is similar to in the middle of the bull run sitting at 15000 and saying "you know, I think 20k is possible."The guys suggesting that people will flee the stock market bubble to Bitcoin, and a bunch of fund money is about to roll in, and that retail hasn't been burned, and we will hit 40-100k soon, are probably worse.

0	1522668155	9	Seems as though the fuel for a decent pump isn't quite there yet. Was hoping this little burst could have got us to 7200 to test the fib area, maybe we can get there but i'd like to see it happen in the next few hours or I feel we'll fall back down. ***Update to my 1 hour MA crossover post from earlier..We are now very close to beginning the cross over phase, as said before, should we successfully cross over - on average we experience around a 4% to 5% increase in price over a few days or so.Should this crossover reject, expect a sizeable drop in price over the same period, around 10% on average over a period of days. 
0	1522673145	8	Seems like there may be some relief from the downtrend brewing, although that doesn't mean the real bottom is in yet. There's a lot of space for a short-term counter trend at the moment. If it were to unfold, here's how I would measure progress. Starting with the 6h, we can see that the tenkan line (blue) has turned support and we will soon test the kijun (red) resistance. Both the chikou and the kumo give a 7.6k target (approx.) without a trend reversal.6h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/0RqgLQQsMuch more to be done to translate that same move to the 12h chart. We're toying with the near vertical tenkan line here, but that should flatten out over the next day or two, and I'll look for a similar support and test of the kijun as with the 6h, the targets here are barely higher and more solid (approx 7.8k or above). 12h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/qIGMA2SiIt'd be an almost identical set of parameters on the daily (note how similar the charts are). The difference here is that if after a multi-week rally we hit the target of 8k, the herd might start to look for further upside, which may only lead to pain and misery. Cloud resistance on this chart is still weak, so there's a huge window to the upside. In addition we're still bullish on the weekly and monthly charts, meaning long term investors might position themselves early for a bullish kumo breakout. The bearish outlook on the 3d would make me exercise caution toward such a scenario. It probably won't play out like that on the daily. There'd likely be a lot of chop which would drag things out and then we'd get 'bogged' down in the as yet unplotted cloud sub-8.5k at best (if we even get that far).1d: https://www.tradingview.com/x/w3GZB4RFBullish daydreams aside, the assumption for now, however, is more downside with mid-term targets as indicated on the axes of the charts here. First the February low, then those of November, and [not shown] September and July. In fact, given that we may get to July before we repeat July's low, I'm not really going to entertain any downside targets that are more than six month's old (ie November low of 5.4k by May, which lines up nicely with the weekly kumo support, February's low by August, etc.).
0	1522686529	16	Opening a long here ($7,030) with stops below $6,900. It's risky, so I'd advise not to follow along. Buyers seem invigorated though. 
1	1522686817	4	long before the crazy amount of resistance from 71-7300. Bad trade mate
2	1522687166	7	Options are:1. Short here (rekt if breakout)2. Long here (small loss if rejected)3. Long after breakout (Bitmex will be a shitshow) I don't regret my decision
3	1522687605	2	1.) rekt if breakout? I disagree, shouldn't be too bad if its not overleveraged, but maybe thats how you trade.2.) small loss if rejected? I think this could go violently down just as fast as it could violently go up.. But yeah, you are right. It's a tight stop.3.) Don't try to trade breakouts on such a small time frame, mostly because they are often false but also cuz bitmex. You can get a safe entry with patience on real breakouts. with lower risk
3	1522687578	2	Why not tight stops on a short to prevent rekt?
3	1522688292	1	4. Don't force yourself into a position now AND don't FOMO a breakout. After confirmation of breakout, slowly get in to market.9/10 times a breakout in bitcoin don't just spike up and leave everyone missing out. The vast majority of them breakout, retest resistance turned support (or vice versa), and make plenty of continuation patterns along the way. 
4	1522688393	6	While I agree with you, this is one breakout that I expect to be more explosive than usual if it does indeed break to the upside. Like I said, it's risky. And people shouldn't follow me here. But I'm opening a long, so I posted about it. 
5	1522689135	4	Respect you for posting your trades and always enjoy knowing them even when I am going the other way as I am right now. At the least posting our thought processes makes one consider the opposing take
5	1522690025	2	For sure, just giving another option. You do you. 
2	1522687045	1	Perfect entry if this breaks through.
1	1522687024	3	I promised that I'm gonna go opposite, but I'm already short, so...
2	1522687184	2	Add to it :D
3	1522687236	2	I'm so confused about this movement that it's tiny short. Won't be surprised if Chevy is right here.
2	1522688462	2	I'm also long (but regretting it).  Let's confirm if every time i'm in a position and Chewie gets on the same position it ends up working well. I would add to the short if i was you :)I'll probably jinx Chewie's chances :)
1	1522690041	2	Wow, did not expect you to long from here.
2	1522691463	2	I generally take a lot of low risk / high reward trades. When I can anyway. 
1	1522688868	3	Seems foolish to be honest. Seems we have "double" topped at 7,100, waiting to dip down to 6,750 and probably below. I even think we'll see 5,800 before we'll see 7,300...
1	1522688054	1	Why do you think they're invigorated? All I see is buyers unable to follow through and stuck. Unable to take and hold 7k. 
2	1522688289	6	That didn't give up immediately after bouncing off $6,400. They've kept gradually inching upward for almost 24 hours now. Compared to their previous performances, they deserve a medal. 
3	1522688966	2	I'm short swaps at $7k, but long June futs at $64xx. I currently have stops on the short at $7340 looking for a potential breakout. That about track with your clear breakout signal target? 
4	1522689187	2	Anything above $7,300 would be time to call it quits on a short in my opinion. 
5	1522689301	1	Makes sense. Mex has trained me to add $25-$50 for overshooting wicks, but if we crack $7300, it probably won't turn around there after spending all this time failing to crack $7200.
4	1522690443	1	I set my short SL to 7350 fwiw. It'll be more loss than i like (CA 6950), but i think setting it less than 7300 is asking for a needless loss.Almost thinking of bailing out here near break even, but I've missed out on some great positions in the last week doing that... 
5	1522690708	3	I've amassed enough fees on this sucker I'd need it to dip under 6900 to be worth bailing on it now. I try not to be blindly biased (bearish is my lean), but I just don't see a catalyst for this market to actually reverse here. Bounces are obvious and expected, but after 3 days of lower lows and lower highs, are we really bouncing to 7500+? I've been much more concerned about my $6400 long than my $7K short, but BTC does love to troll.
6	1522691201	1	Agreed about the lower highs and lows. Yeah I've been staring at that long the last couple days thinking of closing it in the green.  But its not  big enough to be worth that, and it's great insurance against my short here if we were to jump to 7500ish after i eat the other SL at 7300ish. There's plenty of time to close out this long if it starts to look like a mistake.Gonna stick to the plan to ride out that long a bit more. 
7	1522691500	1	Plans are good. When I set up my current positions, the anticipation was a break below $6K, and my short is weighted accordingly. My long is designed to grow in weight down to 5600, at which point I'd cut the loss and ride the short, potentially scaling in a new long. I'd have to update my math on that. Sunday's dip set off another trigger for my long down at 6200, but I also added to my short over 7100 yesterday (that's pretty wild in and of itself). 
8	1522691799	1	Yeah that's an uncanny spread on those two positions.  
3	1522689089	1	lol, i think its just that kraken whale unloading his 1500 btc stash from 6.4k ever so very slowly but surely.the guys a baller. 
0	1522675248	9	We are now back in that old wedge we fell out of it, but it's grownhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/08lDsTXv/Old line in yellow dots
1	1522675413	3	This looks like a highly likely scenario to play out. Follow the wedge to just over 6k before a bigger bounce. This current one seems to be running out steam (although 7.5 is still in the cards, at least for a wick). 
2	1522675578	2	That would pierce the resistance line heavily. That would be quite the fake out. A lot of BTC would have to be used. 
2	1522676190	1	You think we break down out of it like we did the smaller one?edit: nm misread
3	1522676528	4	If bounce isn't strong around 6k we will probably start digging down there probably, God help us all except for those who are taking their shorts to the grave.
3	1522677693	1	Also interesting to see that so far we have had 3 tops around 7.2 and each was slightly lower than the previous. Playing out like 9.2 all over again. 
0	1522689192	6	Crypto is about to enter a wave of increased front end UI focus. Glad to see high quality, distilled educational solutions popping up:https://cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/6/It's amazing what a little front end work can do with these protocols.UI development qual/quantity = among the best leading price movement indicators.
0	1522669394	6	Maybe interesting maybe not... People posting what their current trade is, with exit points if they have them planned and general thoughts.Just to get a feel for where we all are. I'm currently...LONG from 6845I automatically exit at 4% profit on the way up, in this bear market, which I hit at 7119. Failing to hit the 4%, I exit when my MA crosses back down.I'm now waiting for the shorting opportunity when my MA crossovers combined with other jazz gives me the best chance. Probably in a few hours or so i'd think. 
1	1522669780	8	Have 66% of planned fiat into a two-year minimum long-term trade at $6,700. If we drop below $6,000, I’ll begin scaling in the remaining 33%, 11% at a time, and would be happy to average that entry down. I have other trading BTC that I will gradually sell on the way up over the next two years, if we go up. 
2	1522670480	3	Nice entry, especially if all done this year.  Decent chance that trade will kill it.
3	1522673922	1	Thanks bud, it was all this year. It's in my comment history, but I did the first 33% buy when we hit $6,700 a couple of weeks ago. 
1	1522670418	2	Out of position after a scalp short, waiting for some green candles or a break down to short, or for a pump to long. edit : if it consolidates probably long with tight stop
0	1522689069	6	During the bull market, this would be the “ Consolidation phase “ for the next leg up. God knows where it’s going now 
0	1522682064	15	During the bull run, Coinbase and other on-ramps allowed investors to buy BTC with a credit card. This is now much more difficult, if not impossible for many people. Has anyone considered that the money flowing in now from retail investors should be more "sound" than money coming in during the bull run? I'm not saying we can draw any conclusions here, just a thought about the backing of the fiat flowing in since then. It is, of course, possible to borrow money and buy BTC, but it's not nearly as easy for the average joe. 
1	1522683404	2	Good insight. Those credit card fees gave Coinbase a lot of wiggle room to manipulate the market as market makers. Now that people aren’t paying 5% fees painting the charts is a lot tighter for them i’m guessing.
1	1522682496	1	Is it much more difficult or much more expense? They whack you with cash advance fees thats all. 
2	1522685737	1	Some banks block the transactions entirely 
3	1522686392	1	not a huge impact. most people have several cards
2	1522689315	1	Both. In my opinion, the same person who would click buy on coinbase with their CC likely wouldn't go out of their way to get a cash advance. 
3	1522690475	1	You don't have to go out of your way tho, its just coded different in the background you see it in your billing statement. 
4	1522690839	1	My point is that it used to be very cheap, easy and convenient for people, and now it isn't. It is clear to me that this has decreased the amount of credit-based fiat flowing into crypto from the average retail investor. edit: I should clairify that you can't add new CC payment methods on coinbase
1	1522683480	1	Retail investors as a whole probably don't add up to much. The "Big Money (TM)" is not buying from online exchanges. Pretty sure the OTC market is still larger (could be by many many magnitudes) in comparison. If the commoner/retail investor who buys from online markets won't be buying and it's all whales buying OTC, then eventually the OTC BTC could end up on the online markets, which can be worrying if the whales can just push the thing in any direction they want.
2	1522685943	1	OTC is presumably still larger, but there is plenty of Big Money buying and selling on exchanges. I don't think that balance has shifted too much.
2	1522686104	1	OTC market may be huge, but the coins sold OTC have to come from somewhere. And besides, retail does add up to a lot, it's just fragmented and hence can't set the direction. What's more if institutional money wants to set the direction, it has to do so on exchanges. And what's a whale if it's not big money?
0	1522676287	16	It seems everyone is expecting $3k or lower including myself. Usually when everyone thinks something will happen it doesnt. 
1	1522676815	6	I'm bearish / neutral and even I think 3k will be a stretch.Let's get to 5k first, then we'll talk.
1	1522676841	13	Have you taken into account what would happen if the price collapsed that low? I ask in part because I do believe there is a floor for BTC, and that floor is the price at which mining BTC is not just unprofitable, but actually starts costing miners money. Along with the meteoric rise to $20K, came a surge in the hash rate causing the mining difficulty to raise to record high levels. If the ASIC farms in China stop mining BTC and switch to other SHA256 coins that are profitable, then the network is left with an absurdly high difficulty level and instead of blocks being found every 10 minutes, we are now maybe finding 1 block every hour or maybe couple of hours. It takes 2 block weeks for the difficulty to reset, all the while the price of BTC plummets because now it's really unusable. I speak from experience because I've been in crypto since 2011/2012, and I've seen my fair share of coins get destroyed when the difficulty is too high and it's no longer profitable to mine.
2	1522677516	4	Do you (or anyone else) have an estimate for the proportion of coins being sold on the market that are freshly mined?
3	1522677950	2	That's the trillion dollar question...
3	1522680328	2	Most miners are selling OTC, so the market doesn't come into play. The ones selling via market are selling enough to move the market.
3	1522679341	1	I don't know, but I would really like to know, and I am thinking about how to go about figuring it out.
2	1522677487	3	I don't think anyone cares about the death spiral anymore. I think most people would just wait the two weeks for the difficulty to readjust and then start mining it again. BTC will not be dethroned until another coin does something so progressive that everyone just goes, "yeah, that's better," and then BTC will be abandoned.
3	1522678055	4	Difficulty doesn't change every 2 weeks.
4	1522678184	2	Yes, you are right. My mistake.
4	1522678923	1	indeed. the "blockchain" doesn't have a timer.
3	1522677873	2	Here's the math:2 block weeks is exactly 2016 blocks. That's 144 blocks per day. In a perfect scenario 2 block weeks = 2 calendar weeks. In reality this isn't the case as variations mean 2 block weeks cause it to be shorter or longer than 2 calendar weeks.2 block weeks at let's say 1 block per hour: 24 blocks per day. 2016 blocks (2 block weeks) / 24 blocks per day = 84 days until the difficulty resets. That's approximately 84 days of not being able to conduct transactions on the network.
4	1522678056	7	I think the biggest threat of a deathspiral happened when BCH almost flipped. There was a lot of fear then, but it didn't happen. Now, I don't think anyone thinks it will happen.
5	1522678395	2	So, I used to be a miner years ago. We use automated monitoring software for our miners which include features like calculating the profitability of mining coins and automatically switching our miners to the most profitable one. Even though I don't mine anymore, I have no doubt that if the profitability drops below a certain threshold there will be many farms that will automatically switch coins at the drop of a dime.
6	1522688238	1	Would their profitability calculations all be the same formula with the same thresholds?
4	1522679506	3	> That's approximately 84 days of not being able to conduct transactions on the network.That's not how it works. First of all, there's no magical price where X amount of miners all pull the plug at once; secondly 1 hour block confirmations doesn't mean you can't conduct transactions, merely means they'll be slower and there'd likely be backlog accumulating, but yeah. 
4	1522678162	1	And what percentage of the hash power would you have to lose to get to 1hr blocks from 10min? 5/6? Or like 85%
5	1522678951	1	That is an excellent question, and I have to think about that and get back to you if I can figure it out on my own.
2	1522680553	2	There are plenty of miners with free or very cheap electricity. They already own the mining equipment and it costs them nothing or next to nothing to run it. They won't stop mining.
2	1522680760	2	We know from experience of 2 halvings what happens when the block reward drops by 50%. There is approximately a 10% reduction in hash power temporarily. Miners are more prepared than you might imagine to mine at a loss for a short time in order to ensure the long term survival of the coin.
2	1522689376	2	We have seen bigger than these % price swings before and difficulty adjusted  
2	1522680857	1	I feel pretty confident in saying that we will not see the hash rate plummet to 1/6 of its current levels because of a price drop. You're really blowing this risk out of proportion IMO
2	1522681152	1	Which coins? Never heard of something like that happening.Miners won't stop mining. Bitmain isn't afraid to speculate and blow away hundreds of millions to play games as 2017 has shown. Your scenario doesn't make sense if you play it to the end. Big miners can't let Bitcoin die, because if Bitcoin went into death spiral there would be no other profitable SHA256 coins to mine. Confidence in crypto as a whole would be lost completely and the entire market obliterated.
3	1522685979	1	Catcoin is an example:https://bitcointalk.to/index.php?topic=380130.msg4577427#msg4577427Thread referenced is about the time when the problems started for Catcoin. They later had to hard fork the coin to fix the issue with miners leaving the difficulty too high.
3	1522687920	1	I realize you weren't necessarily saying this, but if we're depending on miners to keep the price afloat then I think crypto really is a dead man walking.
1	1522676571	6	I have a tough time seeing to dip below $100BThe *real* bitcoin name alone is worth >100B at this point.
1	1522676590	1	But 99.99% of everyone in crypto including the most bearish here expect BTC to be worth more than 20k in 1-2 years and view a new ATH as guaranteed. Make of that what you will. 
2	1522676665	2	I think most expect increasing users/holders/growth/utility/funds (which is a high probability occurrence barring something like Proof of Stake dominance.)Not necessarily all time highs in the price metric.
2	1522676872	2	That's true. And I do think the price will ATH within 2 years, because the bubble wasn't that big when compared with the previous bubble in 2013. I managed to sell near the top, so id like to see price fall further before rebuying.
2	1522677026	0	That's because fundamentally this is worth more than gold. If we are to give Bitcoin the same market cap as gold it will be worth 400k a coin. That's where I think the top of this S curve lies. Now, whether or not the rest of the world understands that and is willing to pay for that is another question. 
3	1522677468	3	Fundamentally better than gold? What makes it so? 
4	1522677663	0	It has all the same properties of gold. The only thing it relies on which gold does not is the internet. So if you think a future without the internet is a non negligible probability than it won't be worth as much as gold. However, I think a future without an internet is so unlikely that we can assume it's value is equal to gold.
5	1522681563	3	> It has all the same properties of gold.Totally. Gold is created at an arbitrary limit by computer code which can be cloned endlessly to produce identical versions of gold.
5	1522678079	3	Why did you pick gold rather than any other precious metal?  Also, it obviously does not have the physical properties of gold though.
6	1522678409	1	What are the physical properties of gold that are valuable?
7	1522678855	1	It's lustrous properties are found to be very desirable to women, rappers, and professional athletes around the world.It also is used quite a bit in electronics for its conductive and corrosion resistant properties.
8	1522679490	4	If those were the only two factors driving demand, gold would be much cheaper.
9	1522679981	1	They are not, but also not to be discounted.  I'm omitting the obvious use of investment and store of value as you are aware of them.
7	1522679004	1	Primarily as an alloy in jewelry, but apart from "value" it's useful in a number of applications: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold#Other_applications
5	1522678088	2	It has all the same properties of gold except being a physical thing that people desire.
6	1522679269	1	Yeah. It's digital, which is arguably more (and increasingly so) desirable in today's society.
7	1522679839	5	Try giving your wife or husband a bitcoin engagement ring and get back to me about this. 
8	1522680596	1	What I said wasn't meant as a blanket statement. It's more valuable where it makes sense and offers efficiency.A ring's _entire purpose_ is as a physical symbol, so of course it doesn't apply there.
9	1522680833	4	I just think people need to take out all of the industrial and material uses of gold before trying to compare the storage value of gold vs. bitcoin.Also, your digital argument is debatable because a lot of the gold nuts like it because it can't be hacked or stolen or manipulated in the same way fiat / stocks / bonds etc. can. 
3	1522677369	1	Assuming there are no alt coins.  Which there are.  That high valuation depends on the market shunning alt coins, which is not likely.
4	1522677740	2	Most alt coins are worth nothing and will be worth nothing, imo.
5	1522679472	2	I wish. But not going to happen. If after massive sell of of alts and 80-90% drop since ATH, btc dominance is at 45%. 
0	1522659779	17	So it seems that many people who got burnt buying at $19k thinking we would continue going up forever, are now going to get burnt once more opening shorts.Believing this time that BTC is once again the gift which keeps on giving, but through a downward trajectory this time around.  You couldn't make this stuff up, playing with fire, some will get lucky of course, but when everyone starts to go one in direction, it's usually wise to start heading in the other direction.
1	1522660067	8	Yeah, I sometimes don't think people evaluate the market in percentage terms. At this point, IMO, it's a lot more likely we see a 25% rise than a 25% drop, and thus I wouldn't short this right now. 
1	1522661854	7	Same dudes who got burnt at $19k are more likely to be spending more money to buy the dip, than trying to short the actual bitcoin market on a risky exchange like Bitfinex. Because "it's not a loss until you sell", "average your cost down", "buy the dip" and "hodl" are the dominant narratives that are still being peddled around on all crypto-related reddits. And I don't even need to make this stuff up to know that I have a high probability of being correct about this. 
1	1522659863	0	People assuming the bear market is over and the trend has been broken after a 3% rise. "You cant make this stuff up".
2	1522659974	8	I'm not saying the bear market is over at all, if you read my comments you'll see I'm a believer that we'll go a lot further down over time.My point is more an observation that herd mentality and people opening shorts off the back of a 30 second YouTube explainer video is a dangerous game to play.  Seems we're going full circle from BTC buying mania, to people in the office talking of shorting BTC being the next big thing and guaranteed way to make money.
3	1522661356	3	> a 30 second YouTube explainer videoSo much this.
0	1522668704	5	Looking at BTCUSDSHORTS most of these ask walls on finex are actually shorts opening. I think this could turn into a big short squeeze if some whales decide to take that guy out. Pretty risky opening a short with 29k shorts already open, or hes protecting his bottom short, which is even riskier.
0	1522664955	9	1 april will forever be remembered as the day the based Kraken whale single handed saved bit corns <3
1	1522666363	6	That guy bought like 1500 BTC at 6.5k$? He almost made 1m already, what a beast.
2	1522666440	2	> That guy bought like 1500 BTC? He almost made 1m already, what a beast.He could sell at any time too.
3	1522666984	3	Maybe he was taking profit on a short? So won't be selling
3	1522667738	2	If I were him I would just sell a bit with every green candle... Or short and cause a dip later on with it for maximum assholiness.
2	1522669554	2	Yeah I wonder how I could become one of those. 
2	1522666455	3	so he has to sell i guess,which lucky sod is gonna buy off him is the question. most prolly he buys it himself and the profit is from the shrimps pocket.
1	1522665105	1	Or the perfect short entry, lets see. As long as i'm on the same direction this goes, i'm happy. But still bet on being down and not up
0	1522690982	11	## Moon Math Updatehttps://www.moonmath.winMeasures for volatility have not improved. I've considered downgrading the moderate buy recommendation to a hold recommendation, but you should be looking at these recommendations when you're considering your own DCA strategy. Volatility hasn't increased that much and we're still holding in a pattern that has a 65% chance of breaking down. If you're goal is to DCA through a potential dip, and your comfortable with taking initial losses, then this remains a good place to **slowly** add to a position **without leverage**. The noob DCA strategy has not been issued because volatility is still too high. If your grandmother has been asking about when it's time to buy bitcoin, this is not the time. There's too much risk that the floor will drop out from under us while weekly BBands are this wide in a bear market. The goal is to make noobs feel good about their investments for months, not scare them away with dwindling fiat value, or the constant looming threat of dwindling fiat value.## LBC Weekly Global VolumeLocal Bitcoin global weekly volume is continuing to keep pace with long-term trends. 1 billion USD a week by the end of 2019 is an unbelievable projection, but that's moderate to conservative based on these data.We'll probably see these rates of adoption drop as more established and regulated platforms for exchange establish themselves internationally.Label | 30-day Performance | 2017 - Present  Performance--- | --- | ---From Date | 2018-02-24 | 2016-12-31Starting Price USD | 56997685 | 17557937% Change | 132% | 427%Doubling Period in Days | 91 | 225Days in period | 35 | 455Compounding Daily Periodic Rate | 0.7880% | 0.3197%Over $79,432,823 on | 2018-04-09 | 2018-04-19Over $100,000,000 on | 2018-05-08 | 2018-07-01Over $316,227,766 on | 2018-10-02 | 2019-06-26Over $1,000,000,000 on | 2019-02-25 | 2020-06-21Over $10,000,000,000 on | 2019-12-16 | 2022-06-12Over $100,000,000,000 on | 2020-10-04 | 2024-06-03https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/ALL
1	1522691212	2	Thanks!
1	1522691618	1	So the question that I’ve never seen answered anywhere is, what actually makes a cryptocurrency market a Bear Market and HOW does it become a Bull Market and also how does a Bull crypto market become a Bear Market. What are the exact factors that create a bear or bull market that are specific to this particular asset class vs. others?
2	1522691704	2	Use google. There is a ton written about this and you should come to your own conclusions. There's more to be understood than is reasonable for someone to post. It's not black and white.
0	1522649814	11	Here's a bullish chart with a technical explanation.https://www.tradingview.com/x/ui3LtaKO/essentially price is/was in a down move. The first thing to notice is that the final leg down is shorter than the first leg down.The oscillator divergence reflects this relationship.Now the flag structure which ended with the head and shoulders is a huge distribution process. But for such a large amount of work price didn't fall far.You can see price first tested the break of my marked neckline  and then broke back into the area.So then why does such a large amount of distribution result in a bullish case?Essentially for every seller there was a buyer.This sellers are mid time-frame, the buyers are low and high time-frame. Essentially the distribution is ALSO low and high timeframe accumulation. The low is obvious as price moves up within the distribution.Now essentially what's happened is that  there's a large amount of high-time frame accumulation paired with that distribution. This is the bullish argument.I believe the high horizontal line on the chart marked is a key level.Should the lower time-frame slow down and distribute as it breaks the current high I'd think this level will pose rejection indicating more accumulation needs to take place (or possibly that the higher time-frame may be significantly distributing but this is unlikely considering how low price is), if the approach speeds up then the level will be ignored (I think this will be the case).
1	1522652496	2	What are your thoughts on 7.2k? Should that be considered a resistance point to really watch out for, in case the current rebound continues at this pace?
2	1522654239	3	If price finds resistance there my expectation is that it would be minor.
3	1522654381	2	Thanks for your insight!
1	1522652754	4	I have no idea what any of this means. Read it a few times and just have no idea what you're saying. all I can really say is that I don't think you can deduce there's any accumulation occurring from a 15m candle chart. Also, annoying nitpick, but you said essentially 4 times
2	1522654784	3	Accumulation and distribution are time-frame dependant. The idea is that if you have the knowledge of how these processes resolved, with the understanding of how time-frames relate to each other you can come to conclusions about how the higher time-frames are progressing.
0	1522647523	3	The price is all over the place, lately. I'm keeping a low leverage, playing the waiting game. I'm hoping that the price sets solid footing in the $6ks, that it behaves as a solid bottom as we chop sideways, avoiding a deeper plunge into the bear market... but it's much too early to tell.Also, I wanted to give a quick update on this year's [prediction contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7j8e7z/contest_where_do_you_think_bitcoin_will_be_in_a/) Submissions are closed, though.

1	1522649840	1	This is what people said when we got down to 15k. Then when we got down to 10k...
2	1522650628	2	>This is what people said when we got down to 15k. Then when we got down to 10k...True, true. However, we bounced off of $6000 in February, we just bounced off of $6400. If the price holds steady, I would say that's a bullish long term double bottom. 
3	1522652819	5	>  If the price holds steady, I would say that's a bullish long term double bottom.price has to break the neckline for it to be a double bottom
4	1522658080	3	Double bottom is the new H&S lmao
0	1522666750	4	https://imgur.com/a/ngyNI My lines have so far held but damn the buying volume is dead. I still doubt we'll be smashing down before at least another touch of resistance: 12h MACD is flipping bullish and RSI close to being oversold on the daily, which I think will play out in bulls' favor - as long as some buyers are found(Long) stops at breakeven @6850, 74xx and 78xx for profits and close
1	1522667519	2	It's the same pattern every single fucking time. High volume bull, high volume crash, low volume sideways for several months. Are we in the sideways channel now? I hope so.
1	1522667589	2	if this thin goes to 7.8k then it will head up to the mid  8's atleast.
0	1522686754	4	got stopped out on my 7060 long at 6897, lowest drop was 6880. Now we are recharging for the move I wanted to catch initially it seems,  have a breakout trade at futures 7100 buy  if this moves upfeelsgoodman.jpg 
1	1522687235	3	Not saying you're wrong just always interesting how we can be watching the same movements and I don't see it recharging for a move up at all but it failing resistance fairly unceremoniously. Did you get back in your long with this dip down?
2	1522687389	6	No currently not at a computerLearned expensive lessons trading from my phone..... 
3	1522687417	3	might end up working out okay for you anyway!
4	1522689363	1	And I agree with your point now, "recharging" was a bit of strong word, more stabilizing. Now what to see if the Bart formation falls down or not...

1	1522686916	1	why at 7100, if we break that there is still crazy 7200 resistance lol

Model price = 10^-0.638 \* (tx per day)^2.181 / # total coins.Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/yydIWs5.png) (last updated 2018-02-04) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.
1	1522653100	2	Wait a second though, you're predicting a 7-day average that is close to a 50% decline in value from where we are currently: $6915 as of 4/2/2018 7:11 GMT. In order for a $3415 7-day average wouldn't we need to be significantly lower than what we are currently at?
2	1522653464	3	"Based on TX rate"
3	1522654084	3	So it's a model. I get that, but even a model should scale. Does the model scale to our current price level and remain accurate?
2	1522653412	2	Wut. It's just a model, we don't have to be anywhere relative to it.
3	1522653790	2	What's the usefulness of it if half the time it's right and half the time it's wrong? For example, it appears that mid-2014 the model started deviating from actual BTC price and forming an inverse pattern. Am I misinterpreting it?Edit: Oops you aren't the one who created it. Sorry.
1	1522648528	1	I've been wondering what price your model has it pinned at. Thanks!Edit: If LN ever comes online and is used by many people in the community, I wonder if your model will deviate from the price or if on chain transactions will also increase since more people will start to use BTC.
2	1522663788	1	I hope we get to find out.
0	1522668179	8	Ascending bart simpson pretty bullish
1	1522671136	3	The ascending wedge he is drawing is bearish though. 
0	1522673130	5	**UPDATE on my MA 1 hourly cross over posts from earlier...The hourly chart is now half way through rejecting the crossover. It's not looking great as it currently stands. As previously posted, on average when the crossover is rejected we tend to experience anywhere between a 5% to 10% drop in price over a period ranging from 30 hours to a week if it's particularly bad.Unless we get a pump within the next few hours to take us up and above 7200 it looks very much to me like we are about to experience a pull back somewhere around 3 to 5%. Putting the price in an around 6700 within a day, maybe less. Unsure of the time frame really.
1	1522673479	2	There are lots of MA crossover bots out there, all with their individual settings. I think at any rate, some of them will fire off on the hour, which may cause a cascade. They were self-fulfilling in this sense to the downside recently, even if they did rek their owners. They're really quite performing in bull markets, in fact.
1	1522673716	1	[something like this?](https://imgur.com/a/vZpGL)
2	1522674267	2	alas no, I use a weighted moving average of 144 and a smoothed moving average of 5. I have collated months and months of data, what happens after crossovers on multiple time frames, what the average rises/falls are, how long they last on average..that sort of thing.What we need pretty damn soon is that climb up over 7200 or we're looking at a bit of pullback coming in. The pessimist would say a fall of at least 5 to 8% over the next 2 days, the optimist could say a few percent only over the next 4 to 5 hours maybe.
3	1522674709	1	The pump/dump should happen in less than 2 hours. Pump if the pattern repeats and dump if this was just another bull trap to put us right bellow the resistance.
4	1522674955	1	yea I agree. We're in the zone right now for something to go bang, either direction. I really wanted to see a bit more conviction earlier on that 7100 run to be honest. It flat-lined very easily and now we are in a bit of a precarious place, short term wise anyway. 
5	1522675144	2	Short bellow 6950 and long above 7050 should work fine. The problem is that a fake out should happen if this is to reverse to a dump so limit buy is a bit dangerous. Limit sell should be safer as there hasn't been fake outs before the pumps.
6	1522676079	1	same for me, i'm looking for 6950 to break with conviction and i'll be shorting. 7050 is also a good shout, I just really don't know if we have the legs to get up to the 7200 area let alone break it. From strictly a trading stand point the short here is easier to take. As much as I want the 7200 to break I honestly can't see it. Hopefully i'll be wrong though.
0	1522643614	3	We're up against the local downtrend from 24th - actually wicked over it temporarily. So we're either going to drop fairly soon or I might be short-term bullish. (https://www.tradingview.com/x/MjrbPQQP/)
1	1522645556	1	think we just got rejected again.
0	1522686990	3	precarious position right now. You get the feeling if we dip into the 6975 range again then we'll fall down a few % just like earlier.There just doesn't seem to be enough strength to break through the resistance line we are currently smacking into it. I'm a bit surprised really to be honest.
1	1522687375	2	I was also expecting to retest 7.2 but that little mini double top at 7120-30 seemed to take the wind out of bull sails
2	1522687726	4	yea exactly. Really feels now like the energy has gone and we are holding on with our fingertips again, trying to prevent the next wave down... The bulls tried but it doesn't look like it's enough at all. If you can't break current resistance..well the 7200 is never going to break as it stands
3	1522688211	2	Still though bears aren't exactly trampling, a big green pump out of nowhere is not out of the question
4	1522688446	1	absolutely. Looks like it's just a game of patience for the moment. Love to see the big green dildo out of nowhere, to quote my bishop, figure it'll just smack into 7200 and reject it but at least it would be an attempt. To fall from here back in to the 6700s or 6600s would be disappointing and certainly a bad sign for the near future
5	1522688714	2	yep :/atleast a 7.2 would set up nicely for a pump from 6k, a lower high here would  only set the cat amongst the pigeons. but damn that 7.2 and 7.5 and 7.7 have become frikkin rocks after the support they provided  earlier on our plummet down. 
6	1522689024	1	Reading sentiment I see less and less bulls providing optimistic scenarios the past week. The most common bullish sentiment I see is "you don't *know* that wasn't the bottom"
7	1522689243	2	naah,its the short squeeze from hell thats gonna take us to 20k in a coupl of days 
8	1522689301	1	oh forgot about that one
0	1522691917	3	God I have absolutely no idea what the price is doing right now. We can't break up through the pissy resistance we keep hitting in and around 7k, but we have enough strength to not drop lower than a percent or so when it looks like we'll fall.When this does go decisively in one direction it's either gonna be a big big green dildo or one hell of a blood fest down to the 6600s.Maybe i'll just call it a day, go to bed later and restart tomorrow after this has resolved itself.
1	1522692072	1	I think people will lose interest before there's a major break one direction or the other. I'm predicting extended price stability in this price range. Traders will give up trying to scalp trades and we'll complete a period of consolidation. We can go sideways for months. 
1	1522692355	1	this is what price manipulation looks likeit is trading within a specific range, it is controlled, but the big whales can still make massive profits in this $400 range buy pumping, selling, dumping and repeating the process"We will regulate, make bitcoin not wild, nor wilder. We'll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules." MelamedThis is what you people wanted
2	1522692494	1	To be fair, a stable bitcoin is much more attractive to people who actually want to use it for its purpose, as opposed to just an investment vehicle.
1	1522692052	1	The latter will probably happen, except lower than 6.6k
0	1522661801	6	Last 4 days have been insane, made my best trades ever on these chops.Mostly long 6.7k close and short 7.1k,rinse and repeat,  leverage 5x up to 25x when the moves intensifies.Up more than 400% lol, compounding every time.Giving up on leverage until we really dump. Debating hodling or cashing out. But definitely getting out of bitmex before doing a stupid move.Gl trading gents.

2	1522689424	7	The steemit markup works better for the post format, as you can easily embed pictures. Note that the posts are set to "power up" mode, meaning that 100% of revenue goes into Steemit voting power.And if you don't like it, don't read it.

0	1522674519	14	Well most of the other cryptos are still quite overvalued. Would be nice to clean up and finish the job before run forward. Seeing EOS, Cardano, Stellar, Tron as billion dollar projects is painful. Just means people aren't really in despair yet. 
1	1522675180	13	Most of those are down 70-90% nobody left to panic sell imo. Anyone holding is probably in it until the end at this point. 
2	1522676697	1	If you visit their subs many people are still buying this dip to DCA
3	1522678974	1	yes, and they are likely in it to the end and will not be selling any time soon.
2	1522678357	1	Yeah probably true.

2	1522675660	2	is gonna Dipple and Cripple
1	1522674893	1	Seriously, there's a shitload of people who have probably bought those shitty projects at ATH, a lot of them was stupid enough to buy them without proper research and only on FOMO. I think a lot of them will hold hoping for a return. And you know what, I'm not happy to say this, but I'm pretty sure at least few of them will go back to ath. Yeah I know that's sad..
1	1522674586	1	I don't think so.
2	1522675361	10	Some of the alts have very promising technologies. VEN is one of them. They would authenticate high end items at pos through blockchain. Don’t let primitive tribalism and greed cloud your judgement and lump all alts together. Wishing financial harm and suffering on multitudes of people you don’t even know for the sake of your own greed represents the worst in humanity. Crypto will change the world and hopefully some of these legitimate alts with great tech will contribute as well. 
3	1522676404	12	Why do you need a blockchain for that? And how does VEN ensure the physical item has been tagged appropriately? If it's using rfid tags or something (I don't know as I've only glanced at VEN) then what is the blockchain providing? An audit trail so that any tampering from factory to store can be approximately identified?Why does the token need to have a speculative monetary value associated to it for this to work? Especially if it is PoS based (i.e. the chain will end up with a handful of super nodes doing most of the verification work).What incentive is there for a large multinational company to audit their byzantine supply chain with a non-customisable third party blockchain token that's less than 1 year old (in its current incarnation), whose utility is suspect, whose supply is limited and whose price fluctuates?Answer: none. This is why you see companies like BMW playing with IOTA. They are not ever going to seriously use it. Rather they offer the project a "partnership" with their internal, tiny startup focused unit. It will go nowhere but it makes BMW look good and modern and it gives the project a sexy "partnership" to shill to their investors. Win/win (but not in the way bag holders think).
4	1522677150	2	Right on the money bud. And something people in the crypto space just fail to understand or choose to ignore altogether.There is no need for these coins (irregardless of how useful the technology is) to have a monetary value.They only do so because it essentially "funds" the project and then gives the early investors a "share" of the company without holding any stock... like seed funding. IMO it's total bullshit and a giant fad these "coin offerings". In 2-3 years we'll be looking back laughing at this dumb concept. If these entrepreneurs find solid use cases for blockchains, then create a REAL company out of it and make it successful, not this nonsense scammy crap. 
5	1522677309	2	The idea is if the coin/token gains adoption companies/people will need it to utilize it. They have to get it somehow, ie through buying it. So then it has a monetary value.Of course, its entirely dependent on actual use so super speculative and risky now (as is Bitcoin, just to a lesser degree).
5	1522681838	1	Imo some of that monetized token value business model is needed to incentivize development of decentralized projects without traditional fees or ads. Nobody likes service fees or ads. Use increases value. Develop a decentralized project without a centralized revenue collection, it's also much harder to sue or prosecute you. Binance is already making it work in a hybrid model. The utility token business model is actually an interesting one and might be here to stay even if most current implementations of it do not.  
3	1522678082	1	> Some of the alts have very promising technologies.Exactly. Did you reply to the wrong post? 
0	1522681312	6	1m by 2020 tho
1	1522683053	1	Maaaaan, it's so bearish ... I wouldn't be surprised if sooner.
1	1522687074	2	The thing is, that's very soon.
0	1522652338	4	If we would go up again to let's say 8k. Would that make a valid double bottom?
1	1522654092	10	12k would put an end to all uncertainty, ~9.2k would ignite some good FOMO (at least for me). 8k would be nice but don't mean nothing IMO.
1	1522655696	6	breaking the top between the bottoms confirms it.
2	1522656175	2	That makes sense, thanks!
1	1522652829	8	I'm not believing that the crash is over until we have broken $12k in my opinion.
1	1522654449	4	After everything we've seen since Jan.. We really need to see a break through 10k with conviction. Break that ATH resistance line and stay above it for a good week moving up slowly in the process.Otherwise I'm not believing anything.It's like right now. The longer we can't break 7k, the more shit we are in 
1	1522655051	4	Have to stop looking for 'confirmations' to go back up to ATH levels. Longer timeframes are absolutely unpredictable right now, just take it a day (or maybe a week at most) at a time if you're trading. Anyone claiming we'll be at X price in 3 months or w/e from here, or anyone calling any specific resistance / support as the line to break to go to moon / goblintown is delusional. There is not nearly enough data to be either bullish or bearish on timeframes longer than 1-2 months with conviction. 
2	1522657435	2	That's funny, because my charts on the longer timeframes (1D especially) show a clear downtrend, whereas shorter timeframes (4hr and below) are unpredictable because of the high intraday volatility. Yet so many people here continue to call up and downtrends based on 1 hour charts, or worse, 15 min and 5 min price action. 
3	1522658315	4	I'm not sure what the funny part here is. Long term charts certainly show a downtrend -- but that doesn't mean the price is just going to keep going down forever, does it? At the same time, people claiming X price would be a 'reversal' are a bit too high on hopium. Like, let's say we bounce and trend upwards for a few weeks from here, to 10-12k levels. Does that mean everyone's gonna pile in and buy buy buy til we're at 20k+ again? I don't know, I don't think so. My point is, given how far down we already are, I don't think being short 'long term' is comfortable any more, despite the clear downtrend on longer timeframes -- but likewise any kind of a move up can easily end up being a fake out or a temporary relief rather than a long term return to bull.
0	1522655863	4	Could we be breaking out from the harsh downward channel we were in from March 24th? [Chart](https://imgur.com/a/TCBa4)
0	1522664417	2	Is anyone able to offer me advice with using leverage on Bitmex? I've got my head around the concept but having trouble in practice.    I've been experimenting by using the [Bitmex Testnet](https://testnet.bitmex.com) to place some trades. Unfortunately when I've placed a leverage trade they don't seem to be operating correctly. For instance, I went long with 5000 USD (approximately 0.72 BTC) with 100x leverage (don't worry, I will never actually do this in practice) with an entry price of $6979 USD and an exit price of $7027.5 USD.     Now for a trade like that I would expect to have made a profit of approximately 0.4927 BTC but my profit was actually 0.0037 BTC  which is closer (but still undershooting) to what I'd expect to get if I was using no leverage? Obviously I'm doing something incorrectly but I'm not sure what. [Here's a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/htTZA) of another trade I just made with the exact same specifications. Maybe someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong here?   
1	1522664578	8	This is something new users of bitmex very frequently get confused over. I did too at first.Leverage determines your liquidation point, not your position size. 100x 5000 contracts means you put $50 on the line. If you got liquidated you lose $50.Your position size was only worth $5000 in btc. You meant to do 500000 contracts at 100x. Liquidation would mean you lose $5000 but your position size would be worth ~71 btc, meaning you make $71 for every $1 upwards (not accounting for fees)Please be safe and don't trade too much on leverage. 
2	1522665047	3	I never understood why then, if you can not reap the profits from a high leverage small position why do it? 
3	1522665883	3	Why hello csasker. Hope you're doing well.  I'm enjoying [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Market-Wizards-Interviews-Top-Traders/dp/0135560934) you suggested. Happy easter :).  
4	1522671925	1	Hi Big_Witch,Nice to hear, I also really enjoyed this to learn about my emotions and trading  https://www.amazon.com/Hour-Between-Dog-Wolf-Transforms/dp/0143123408 
3	1522689252	1	I'm confused what you're asking? 
4	1522689481	1	If the adjust leverage doesn't increase my profit, why would someone ever do it ?
5	1522690536	1	oh yeah I personally do not understand why people do that. 
2	1522665606	2	Ahh, thank you very much for this. It really wasn't very clear. And yes I'll cautious, I'm not even convinced I personally will use leverage but it's good to understand how to utilise it correctly. 
1	1522664614	3	You’re doing the same thing I was. When you increase leverage you need to multiply your stake by that amount. Check the cost of your entry and you’ll see it’s 100 times too low ;)I think they need to make it clearer as so many people make that mistake at first.
2	1522665720	3	That makes sense now! Thanks for that. You're right, it's not extremely clear. 
0	1522664896	2	I know this might be a little of topic, but perhaps someone on here knows the answer. Is it possible to source Hourly - Daily Price data for Top 10 Cryptos? I.e. could i get pull this into excel from an online source.
1	1522669599	1	I saw a post on the daily sometime the last 2-3 weeks that someone has minute-by-minute data going back quite some time and to PM for details. Might take good use of the find function to find it.
0	1522676199	2	My 7060 long doesn't feel so good anymore, was hoping to catch a bigger move to the upside but the falling wedges people posting here also looks quite probable. Moving upp my stop  loss to just below the last 15m bull flag and will then wait for better times if getting stopped outOn the other hand moving averages on 4h is converging towards the upside, so that could  fuel a move
1	1522676807	3	Falling wedge is bullish. I've got a small ascending wedge (bearish) on the 15m chart after the spike from 6425 yesterday morning, though. 
2	1522677150	2	Right, but then I would look for a lower entry. Now looks like BTC just sliding downwards 7k trendline
1	1522677522	2	If there's no move soon, I expect chop for some time. I'm not discounting another drop down, but I'm not going to reopen my position, which is similar to yours, but might add.
1	1522676756	1	I would wait 1 hour. It should be a pump there to try 7200.Stop loss @6950 should be safe
2	1522677152	1	6897 currently. 
3	1522677589	2	Long from 7000 with tight stop @6950. Time to put some money where my mouth is. Profit stops starting @7150, i can see a lot of resistance up there.Good luck to us.
4	1522679452	1	Got stopped out? :/ still holding hereNope there it goes
5	1522679957	1	Moved my stop down... 2 times already... Last try is 6869. My pattern dream was crushed so i have no idea what to expect. Don't feel safe shorting either...
6	1522680641	1	You made it
7	1522681004	1	Still pretty iffy... Looks like a bear flag pause before going down. Have bellow zero confidence on this, hoping for a small rise to close with a smaller loss, unless it rises with confidence.
8	1522686527	1	i would move that stop to 7010 to lock in profit
9	1522687061	1	Fees are about 0.4%, need about 7030 to breakeven. Price is ranging between 7050 and 7000 so i will be stopped if i move it above 7000.Will try close it on the next wave up (if there is another one, looking bad now...) Got greedy again...
7	1522683502	1	Stops moved to 6940, if i pull this off is thanks to your strategy to set stop loss bellow the previous flag value. If i don't make it i'll be stopped around my initial stop value so i won't lose anything more than my previous plan.
0	1522688400	2	Hmm...how is this formation we are seeing now any different than what we just saw during the weekend?? Looks almost identical.Only question I guess is how long we stay in this range Before the next move Do the ratio of open longs and shorts tell us anything about the next move up /down?
1	1522688573	-1	no they dont.if your 3x short in here, then your liqui would be above 9 k so being short is pretty safe considering that we have all kinds of resistance above while below?, the lesser said the better

0	1522670103	3	I do best trade in my sleep , everyone bearish and I had to add to my long from yesterday .
0	1522691384	3	final goodbye kiss of 7k before another drop?
1	1522691578	2	Bounce to 6500 incoming
2	1522691861	0	Inverse leg up
0	1522642285	3	7k.  I suspected worse from the Sunday dump.  What does April bring?  
1	1522643101	4	Its already Monday for half of the world, Sunday dump is over but i think we have more downside coming this month.
1	1522642492	1	12k by end of April I presume.
2	1522642660	2	pretty plz.
2	1522642541	2	Whys that?
2	1522669245	1	I hope soo
1	1522644678	2	Another big dump between the 9th and 13th of April when ETH has its Death Cross which dumps the alt market and BTC down just below 6 for more stress as Tokens take a hit. Then climbing out towards the end of the month on the back of some good news. By mid May we’re up at 8.3 to 8.5.

0	1522688831	3	DJIA getting hammered, down another 500. Don't see it avoiding a bear this year
1	1522689287	7	This is good for bitcoin, smart money will want to buy digital gold. On a serious note, I wouldn't be too surprised if this is just a dip and the crash isn't for a while longer
1	1522689680	3	But CNBC is back on the bitcoin hype train https://finance.yahoo.com/m/88aac55f-a590-3df0-95f8-514c9f71006e/bitcoin-climbs-back-above.html
0	1522689766	3	Hm... Lets just hope BTC does not go Rhodium's way http://www.infomine.com/ChartsAndData/GraphEngine.ashx?z=f&gf=110574.USD.ozt&dr=maxSeems like a good lesson in humbleness and humility.. Bull run to 10k, downer to 1k and staying flat for the next decade.
1	1522689944	13	Good thing this isn't my first Rhodium
2	1522690404	2	All Rhodiums lead to goblin town.
1	1522690867	1	Hard for it to do so. People trusted and still trust precious metals a lot more than crypto. 
2	1522691395	1	The one thing I think cyrpto has that precious metals don't is many hold the common expectation that one day again crypto gains will reach in the 1000's of %. Precious metals really come with the expectation as a store of value or moderate gains over many years. 
3	1522691673	1	and have a obvious ceiling based on mining profitability (when its affordable to use X technique to extract it), also happens with petroleum and fracking. Plus the risk (also shared with petroleum) of someone developing a new technique... On the other hand, with crypto the "only" risk is that demand disappears. Like it happened with uranium in 2005-7 or so. 
0	1522691726	4	Bull collapse is imminent. I just wonder how many people didn't learn their lesson at 9.2 and 8.2 and 7.3.If you don't know, now you know. But will you learn this time? Probably not, have fun longing the 6k bounce to 6.5. 
1	1522691969	2	Bears too confident , many stupid amateur shorts on board too I don't see it 
2	1522692163	2	Thing is, as much as I'm not entirely convinced that many shorting here have the slightest clue what they're doing (i.e. shorting the bottom), I'm really not seeing the huge push for the price to increase either, which is why I suspect it'll naturally decline unless some bull whales start pumping. 
2	1522692277	1	Heard this one a lot..being contrarian to the contrarians has been profitable since the breakdown from 11.7k
2	1522692387	1	Aren't they confident for a good reason? The price has done nothing but reaffirm that it is a bear market and it has more room to go down. Maybe you should realize this too if you have an interest in staying solvent instead of going broke believing in a fairy tale that this is not a bubble. 
2	1522692435	1	Bulls aren't too confident when they call for endless ATH bubbles to come but people shorting a collapsing asset are just stupid amateurs. It really is a foolproof syllogism you employ to deduce this optimal trading strategy : Friend goes shortFriend is stupid amateur Stupid amateurs are never right ErgoWe should do the opposite of your stupid amateur friend.QEDYou are a true professional trader, my deepest admiration sir. 
0	1522674206	6	Reading this forum is depressing cause during the current phase people act depressed like bitcoin won’t hit ath for years if ever... people say it’s stuck below 5k for a LONG time. Thing is... if bitcoin randomly ran up to 13k for no reason over the next week... the same people would start saying how it’s gonna he worth 60k in 6 months.
1	1522674854	5	It took over 3 years for Bitcoin to return to $1242. It could be years again until $20k.
2	1522675302	7	I dobit that we will have to wait “years”. Infrastructure, fundamentals, brand awareness, accessibility, regulations... everything is on much higher level now. And I didn’t even mention “the halving” which will happen in 2 years and will get priced in much earlier. 
3	1522675965	11	The only reason why bitcoin went 20K is because of mass hysteria, I think we can all agree to that. And now people take 20K as some sort of a normal benchmark. Its not. It was maybe a glimpse to a future where a substantial group of the population uses Bitcoin as a daily tool. Now, setting the bubble aside for a moment, how close are we to that, really? Why wouldn't it take years? Especially considering the fact that bitcoin still has to overcome the "small" hurdle of actually becoming useful for the larger audience. At the moment, there is zero advantages for an "average" person to use bitcoin over € or $. 
4	1522677783	1	Average people won’t drive the price 
3	1522679042	3	> everything is on much higher level now.But your target (new ATH) is also much higher now than in 2013.
1	1522674603	2	I have seen whole quasi-religions built on the worship of individual 15 minute candles or market statistics
1	1522674824	2	Are we gonna argue that both aren’t possible
1	1522675120	2	It's depressing to you because you don't even want to contemplate the possibility of Bitcoin not hitting a higher ATH. The truth is that a new ATH and BTC sub 1k are both POSSIBLE. If you disagree then you are too emotionally or financially invested in Bitcoin. 
2	1522677684	1	Lol well if I didn’t think bitcoin was ever gonna hit another all time high... then I wouldn’t deal in the crypto market.
0	1522647322	4	[deleted]
1	1522647513	5	Can you show it please?
0	1522661180	2	5 minute BBands are tightening up a lot at the moment so i'd expect movement either direction soonish.We are also sitting right on the resistance line from 24th March at roughly 8960, we've bounced and rejected this line a number of times so if we break down from here I expect a reasonable drop.Likewise if we can break above it, should be a decent rise to at least 7200.
0	1522672550	3	What is the fair mining value of Bitcoin? I read somewhere it costs around 8k currently to mine a single Bitcoin. So anything less than that is a buy?
1	1522672934	3	Not in China where it's 4k. Western world sure. 8k
2	1522675665	2	Calculation?
1	1522673166	1	I pay 0.15/0.16 USD per kWh and it is still profitable (debatable) to mine.  If I were to buy an s9 today at face value from Bitman though, ROI would be about 2 years.  That also assumes the s9 doesn't break, they only have a 3 month warranty.
0	1522673167	4	I noticed a pattern on this steps, so far working like clockwork.[Pattern](https://imgur.com/a/vZpGL)Should have another try at 7200 in 1 or 2 hours. Should provide a scalping long entry @6990Edit: Blue circle reached
1	1522673551	4	A pattern needs at least two repetitions?
2	1522674157	2	The previous step had a similar behavior but due to heavier sell pressure it makes it harder to see. I'm still bearish and feel that these pumps are being orchestrated, but it can go on like this for a while. The first real test should be on the next pump, it has to buy 1600 btc on bitfinex to get above 7200... 
1	1522674200	2	a bit more simple wedge: https://www.tradingview.com/x/4ztgPeaQ/with previous resistance at 7.2k 
2	1522674547	1	On bitfinex the wedge is not so pronounced, but i can see something similar to that yes.
2	1522675122	1	Ya I see it that way too. That is a very sickly looking formation, but a good chunk of people in here think it is the starts of a reversal. I think it’ll fail and we’ll enter a new psychological low
0	1522671371	4	BTC dominance 45.3%
0	1522671772	2	Google trends is down, spot volume is down, overall interest and sentiment is in the gutter. These are not 'buy signals', people are not fomo'ing into NOT giving a damn about crypto. This is genuine dis-interest and lack of interest is not a buy indicator no matter how many of your grandfather's are on bitmex shorting 0.5BTC on 10x leverage. Also, not all or even a majority of the money that left the space is likely to be looking to get back in at a cheaper price. Falling knives don't incite fomo for retail investors, it will just validate to them their opinion that Bitcoin is a scam. Grandma buying at 17k and panic selling at 12k isn't thinking "damn I can't wait for cheaper BTC". 
1	1522671965	12	if you are long term bullish, those are the buy signals when they flatten out...
1	1522672233	10	Agreed, but don't trust google trends. I used Google for bitcoin about three times.To find out the price, the exchanges and coinmarketcap.comI know all about bitcoin now. As do most other people!
1	1522671915	10	Sideline money who are not searching btc on google can easily get us to 12k. Lets see if the normies can resist 2x-10x returns from that point again. 
2	1522672304	3	It is April. I read the same thing for three months now. BTC can barely keep around 7k. So many normies got burned, you think they want to lose more money?
3	1522672560	2	They don’t want to lose more money, they want to win the lottery. Never underestimate greed while overestimating people thinking they figured if out from last time. Also there are so many who have yet to come in and just need a nudge. 
1	1522672216	4	apparently the main reason to go long now is to squeeze the shorts, coz shorts are at ATH.where did we hear this before?
2	1522675846	1	$10k before it dove to $6k
1	1522677715	1	Spreading shit and FUD for 3 months must be quite rewarding for you.Rest assured, when we're back in a bull market I'll be tagging your troll ass in every single one of my posts.But please, keep shorting thinking we're going to $3k. The quicker you go bankrupt, the faster this sub can be rid of you.
2	1522679059	1	Lick my dick you cross eyed gerbil 
0	1522659833	2	Up until last night the chart action was very similar to Sunday the 18th March (Sunday vs Sunday) just that it was 1k lower.5k in two weeks?
1	1522661374	5	i don't think all traders go to the same church.
1	1522661018	6	$0 per coin in 3 months.
0	1522684161	2	Resistance was sooner on this pump than the other ones in this channel, could be forming a lower high. Add a little bit more onto my short to raise CA a bit
1	1522684660	8	On my chart, we are exactly at the downward trendline from 8900. Breaking upwards from here with gusto could spark a larger run.
2	1522685619	3	This seems to be no man's land. Depending on how you draw it the line might be right bellow or right above...
3	1522686241	1	what is it above?
4	1522686435	1	The line from 8900, if you consider all the wicks along the way should put the line right above and in that case we should be grinding against it now
5	1522687103	2	Oh gotcha, I think overanalyzing whether it's slightly above the exact draw of the line can be misleading since they're more like zones/regions, I tend to think it's "at" resistance in either case however it's drawn. But we do have the same line
6	1522687779	1	Its a mental thing, if we draw it above we will be biased to short, if its bellow we tend to long. I put some weight on those lines to decide whether to set tight stops or to allow it to breath some more...
2	1522685878	3	It's this. We are hitting into this resistance line without enough strength to break through it.If it goes we should hit 7200 before encountering the next level of resistance. If our current positions fails however i'd expect a reasonable drop 
2	1522685103	3	Indeed, stops ready, mom's spaghetti
1	1522684566	2	yeah, should have gone at least to 7120 (top of descending channel from 7270) or up to 7200 (ascending channel from the pump from 6500)Will probably close my long and open a short around 7050-7100...
0	1522661387	2	First target slightly broken: https://imgur.com/a/aeWkp though not confirmed this is a good start. Looking for a small step by step rally from here.
1	1522661874	2	Step by step low volume rally?
1	1522664461	1	You can draw that putting the line right above where we are. You cut some wicks along the way. Be careful trusting it either way.
2	1522668191	1	I think caring about wicks it's pointless. At low volume a lot of fakeouts happen and it's not indicative by themselves of resistance being higher or support lower. Unless you really care about what happens in the wicks. Useful for daily candles
0	1522691077	1	Between the Bart, the abandoned baby, some guy calling for a Marge, i suggest we just rename double tops and bottoms to perky tits and saggy tits.

0	1522667640	2	https://www.tradingview.com/x/lo6xTA8c/Looking at the daily, we're coming off a TD 9 with a pretty decent reversal candle. We also seem pretty over extended, with 8 out the the last 11 days being down days. So some relief here in the coming days seems in order.https://www.tradingview.com/x/6OJPxLIo/Looking at the 4h, next resistances seem to be just just about everything above 7,2, with 7,5k, 7,8k, and 8,1k being lines to watch, imo.All in all this bounce doesn't feel very convincing and i'm not expecting us to test the downtrend line until we get a cleaner, more energetic bounce, probably at a lower low. Breaking 8,1k would be cause for reassessment.With all the resistance overhead i expect this to be pretty choppy, so i'll be staying out of position, looking for signs of a reversal back down. Shorting above 7,6 seems like a good bet.If we can't even break 7,2-7,4k though, this remains bear flagish and i'm pretty sure that lower lows will be coming pretty soon, pretty steeply. Bouncing off 5,9-6k seems likely, seeing how overextended we are. Though i see the next real support coming in off 4,9-5,1k, so not sure how much of a bounce it would be.
0	1522680587	1	Damn cme futures, has never been the same since.
1	1522681147	9	BTC won't always be shorted. They can only play that card for so long.
1	1522680687	7	We wanted adoption, this is part of it.
1	1522681299	1	That's like saying Bitcoin got to 19k because there wasn't cme futures..
0	1522681649	1	Being at the top of the wedge, put shorts in with CA of 6950, this little mini-bear flag on the 5m looks promising to break back down and retest the bottom of the wedge at the least before a wild Kraken whale appears.
1	1522681994	2	I already have the wedge broken down: https://www.tradingview.com/x/asrsHAWC/  Unless you're talking the longer term descending wedge: https://www.tradingview.com/x/J1OF2OpG/  Shorting the top of the descending wedge does make sense...just with stops at 7200 or so. Which reminds me...mine are still at 7800. Time to move them way the heck down. 
2	1522682130	1	Same, but it's sort of a listless breakdown.
3	1522682228	1	At this point I'm half expecting a huge green candle.  Or a red one to complete the bart. Makes me glad to hold the two positions I do. 
4	1522682839	1	¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯Neither would surprise me. Just an odd market lately. I think it's weird that 2K BTC were limit bought on Kraken (of all places) at $6,500 yesterday and 51% expect them they're being trickle sold back out.I hear talk of an 8k BTC spoof wall being flashed around on Bitfinex as well. That's a lot of corn on an exchange by one person.Lower local low, and a lower local high, but relatively sustained buy pressure feels like there's a lot of trickle unwinding long positions.
5	1522683242	3	Oh look, the aforementioned green candle.
6	1522683392	2	Let me know next time, ty
2	1522682356	1	Indeed was looking at the longer term one and exactly where I was thinking of my stops, though I am tempted to move stops to more like 7250 incase it wicks up to brush 7200
3	1522682499	1	The classic MEX overshoot probably makes that a good call. I put mine at 7340, but only because I have a long from 64xx that gives me some insurance/wiggle room. If my short ($7k) was my only position, I'd want them closer. 
3	1522684815	1	I'm looking to set a similar SL.  But i worry that 7250 still might be locking in a wicked loss, at least that's what always seems to happen to me. 
4	1522685310	1	Yeah 7280 should be safer, at that point we would probably be clear for liftoff higher
1	1522681906	1	iam just fed up not takin profits.think will close my short when we revisit 6k.ofcourse it will nosedive immediately after. 
2	1522682468	2	What I did last time worked okay for me--closed 20%ish when we stalled there, watched the 1m very closely waiting for a high volume green candle and immediately market closing. I'm doing this on kraken margin though and not bitmex contracts
2	1522682667	1	Be sure you got $$ to cover. No Nose dive.
0	1522692316	1	Fun fact: The Dow Jones index is now at early november levels while Bitcoin is also at early november levels. If you had invested a dollar in a Dow Jones ETF and one in BTC at 3 november you would be almost flat today. 
0	1522657564	2	https://imgur.com/a/NH3ZVLooks like a small ascending wedge on the 1h, which should resolve in 6-10h when it meets the 7200 resistance. Upwards movement very jerky and artificial.
1	1522657821	3	On the daily its drawing a bear flag. 
0	1522683433	-7	That $6500 getting further and further in the rear view mirror...
1	1522683867	3	It's been less than two days. Bitcoin can make that move in less than two hours.
2	1522684109	4	It was all of 24 hours ago
1	1522683620	1	I wouldn’t be too sure about that 
1	1522684074	-4	Salty bears downvoting any comments that seem bullish. Regardless of where the price is heading, the truth is bulls have been steering it for the last 24hrs and bears thirsting for <6.5k are nowhere to be seen. 
2	1522684385	6	Pretty sure it was downvoted for low-effort nonsense
3	1522685192	2	Yes fake out comments about all the shorts people are entering are so helpful also.
1	1522683835	1	We're not out yet
0	1522645587	1	What would it take to bring despair?
1	1522645626	7	Significantly less than $6k. My guess is $4k
2	1522646602	7	$4k doesn't seem nearly as scary now as it did 2 months ago, at least for me.
2	1522647943	3	I agree with 4k, possibly 3k briefly but that will be the despair part before we 'return to mean', and probably go sideways for a while before we recover.
2	1522645942	3	"Yay, 4k, we are up 4x from the same time last year."
1	1522645940	5	4-5k. I can’t see it going to 3. But slow bleed maybe. Low 6 high 5 buying will be huge if it happens slow or not. 
1	1522646198	6	A rapid break down to 5k.
1	1522647576	7	Apparently a lot less than $7k lol
2	1522649246	2	I think most the panic sellers are gone by now, mostly just people feeling the pain and seeing it going lower but probably not going to sell between here and wherever the bottom is because most can see 3-4k as a bottom so most likely it won't get there, the giant red panic sellers are gone.   We probably chill around here maybe a little lower until steam picks up again. 
3	1522653035	2	> I think most the panic sellers are gone by nowYou're underestimating the amount of paper millionaires and people with hundreds of thousands dollars worth of BTC who haven't sold yet. Depending on how low the price goes, they would sell at some point to realize gains. The price is essentially propped up by long term holders right now- if they decide to cash out, it would be a slow cascading sell-off when people realize they're not going to be able to sell t a better price.I don't think there have been that many panic sellers since the first $6k. This is just real people cashing out because they think it's going much lower after seeing the awfully bearish charts.It doesn't have to happen this way, but I don't think panic selling is required for us to go lower
4	1522664300	3	Plenty of long term holders with cash on the sidelines though.
1	1522646320	3	kobayashi-like will to push 20kbtc @6k$. looks like nobody is willing to take that risk.
1	1522655161	5	< $1,000 will be despair. I will get downvoted for this because sub $1,000 sounds ridiculous. But most people forgot that early 2017 BTC went as low as $735. We are talking about *despair*, many people are considering $3,000 a real possibility so that wouldn't constitute despair.
2	1522662298	1	The only despair I'll have at those prices is where to find more fiat. Upvoted for considering the outlandish. 
1	1522652787	1	For me we are all looking at one of two news based scenarios. The bear market is one news story away from delivering that final dagger to send us further into  the lower range. At the same time we could really use a positive adaption head line to begin our climb again to the top. With big players in the Financial world imposing their will on the markets its really hard to tell what’s going to happen over the next few weeks. On the other side it seems like everyone is eager for a bottom to buy in and also many are looking to get rich quick and sell a bounce. Right now there is still hope. I want to see people crying for mercy. That’s when I’ll take action. 
2	1522660444	2	I just don’t understand this concept, which I have seen many times over the last months. For one, one person’s ‘despair’ - which I take to mean a potential loss if you were to sell all - is still another person’s in-profit point. So we are not all going to feel the same at the same time because we all bought in at different cost prices. Secondly, history has shown that each time there’s a massive correction, the bottom is still way higher than last time, and if you believe in the long-term future ( which some of us here do, don’t we?) then the bottom we are seeking now , is still going to be in profit for many - as per my first point. So despair is no longer a reasonable sentiment to measure where you think the bottom is. When the margin of play was narrower a couple of years ago, it may have been a greater likelihood that 90% were going to be in negative from an 80% correction. But today, with the price in the thousands even after a 70% correction, and the market so much more populated I don’t think it’s true now.  I get really fed up seeing that statement  - not accusing you alone as many have said it, but it just doesn’t mean anything. The bottom could be 6k or 3k and still people won’t necessarily be in ‘despair’, also because ( third reason) - they believe in the long-term reversal anyway so it just becomes a waiting game . And at whatever price, traders will just carry on trading won’t they? ‘Crying for mercy’? I just don’t know what you actually mean by that in the context of all I have said above. 
3	1522671696	1	The biggest moves aren't driven by news, but just market dynamics.
1	1522673609	1	A month at or below 5k
0	1522675541	1	Keep some capital sidelined & ready.Has tether not printed any USDT in 12 days?
1	1522675712	2	For cheap btc or fomo and why?
0	1522660371	1	Damn so do I cover much of my hedging short or let it ride?   This market is confusing, but of course it's likely we are still in a general downtrend.But I still don't want to ride this up to $8000 being heavily short, even if it will probably drop to $6000 afterwards.But that is the game and what we signed up for.
1	1522661135	6	Wait for the 7200-7300 to break. That will mess up the daily bear flag. 
2	1522668269	1	I hope it will push trhough watchingit right now at bitfinex prices of coins is a little bit stagnant right now
2	1522668297	1	I hope it will push trhough watchingit right now at bitfinex prices of coins is a little bit stagnant right now
1	1522660862	2	We're only up $250 in the last 17 hours.$650 if you count that one 15 minute candle preceeding it. So if that $250 is an aftershock it's not a very big one.Happy / not happy to be wrong if it goes up to 7500 but we just don't know what the hell bitcoin will do.
1	1522660904	2	Good place to add to your short, these huge green candles are only there to scare you off.
0	1522667483	1	so anybody going long or buying here?what is the end game of these whales really, nothing is organic, everything occurs in bursts and then volume dies for hours on end,maybe one or two shrimps gon 50x or 20x on their longs here for a quick profit, but toehr than that what is the end game of holding up bitcoin in this narrow range?confidence to buy here in the 7k range has all but disappeared and ppl ar gettin twitchy to buy as we keep touchin th mid 6's, is this all being done to erode the confidence in buying up btc as we head lower.?just doesnt make sense. 
1	1522668116	2	It makes perfect sense   1. too many people are short, thus removing sell pressure and we cannot go down anymore   2. whales want to squeeze bottom shorters for their money   3. longer term indicators are bottomed out, justifying a bounce     market makers are not going to let you make free money, they're just waiting for capitulation either way then they run the market the other way. Thats what we were seeing yesterday with so many shorts adding. Thats how they make their cash. They want you to go 'wtf is going on' until you FOMO then they turn it around and squash you
0	1522689291	1	Anyone seeing a possible abandoned baby formation trying to play out? All this indecision is making me think this won't be a typical 6-18 month downtrend. Looking for a nice green candle before close to do some more gambling.
1	1522689589	5	Wow, had to google 'abandoned baby formation'. That is a new one for me. Nevertheless, still don't see it unfortunately. 
1	1522689933	3	I've never seen an abandoned baby on BTC's chart (admittedly I haven't looked much for one) because there is never a period where trading is closed. Getting the gap required for that formation on the "baby" candle is simply impossible on longer time scales (longer time scales being longer than 5 min...)
2	1522690457	2	Are you seeing what could possibly turn into a tristar doji on the 6hr and the foundation of a fucked up abandoned baby on the 5m that could be invalidated depending on whether or not we go up in the next few hours.  These are rare formations I know, and the rely on other factors. It's the indecision that has me looking at oddball things like this.Maybe even doji sandwiches forming and being invalidated across a few time scales multiple times. I'm just not sure what to think, surely Bitcoin can't keep giving me this easy short money.
3	1522690665	1	Lol are you actually looking at 5m candles for patterns? Stop. And why are you talking about "tristar doji on the 6hr"? The current 6hr candle closing in ~20 min isn't even a doji.
4	1522691290	1	o, 5m candles are perfectly useful for flags, wedges and pennants. 
2	1522691037	1	Just consider a range, not the exact price. if price varied 0.25% over 4 hours i guess that would serve well enough.
3	1522691288	1	It's still not an abandoned baby. The abandoned baby's whole point is trading opens well below the last close, then that candle is a doji that never reaches the previous candles close, and then the next candle opens above the abandonded baby doji's high.This never happens in BTC because on long time frames the open and close of candles is never significantly different.
4	1522691396	1	Ýea, i dont see it and honetly don't trust it. Im just saying that in this market you must have more tolerance for what a doji means. Anyway, such a formation doesnt make sense and its easier to be understood as a bear flag breaking up. 
0	1522667834	1	Nice effort for 7.1, but not yet apparently
1	1522668189	2	This wasn't the pump, if you check last step up, there was also a small spike mid step. Probably will go down now to 6950-7000 before the real pump
2	1522668644	1	Doesn't look so yet, we are still fighting for 7.1
3	1522672446	2	Mid step dump confirme, now a small rise, small dump and the pump in 1 or 2 hours if pattern really is repeating 
4	1522673471	1	I've seen this pattern alot of times when looking for alt-coins to trade, usually these coins would end up getting pumped alot. So it could be whales buying up a bunch of coins and whenever it goes down a bit, they add more to their stack in preparation of a big pump.
