The long term trend lines in log point to something just south of 3k BTC. But factoring in userbase growth, there are more people to split the same number of coins amongst. So 6k seems logical and that's also the price with the first peak during the bubble run up. 6k is also where we hit this year's low in early Feb. 
1	1522677153	2	agree 6k is a nice stable base
1	1522680475	0	Yeah think we’ll go to 6K or a little less and wouldn’t be surprised if we stay under that trend line going sideways the rest of 2018 before the next upwards growth for 18/12 - as those previous green dotted parabolic time price lines show we’ve done before (which were meant to be red for sideways, and green for upwards growth)!

1	1522656409	5	Thank you xenbomb - yeah a bit of optimism standing back and looking at the long term picture, amongst the doom and gloom of bitcoins latest crash. And extrapolation is not meant to be predictive of the future of course, but may be reassuring or food for thought I think. Google and Amazon’s falls in the Dotcom crash 18 yrs ago were worse than bitcoins now, but those 95% falls are a tiny dip in the long term 20 year chart with 50,000%+ gains from their lows! Wonder which blockchain platform and dApp will be the google and Amazon of the internet 3.0 to come? And whether they’re out there yet, or still to be thought up and released by clever developers - who give ownership and control of the web connecting us all back to the people where it belongs! Appreciate the comment!

0	1522658799	3	That macro regression chart is indeed fascinating. I don't think I've seen that before. If that chart is right, it looks like we're in for some sideways movement.
1	1522680056	2	Well spotted!! Yeah those dots on the graph are the Parabolic Time Price Lines. At first glance it looks like there’s a parabolic slowing of bitcoins rising trend line, but that doesn’t really make sense without market saturation or something -,and we’re well under 1% adoption of bitcoin by the adult world population, so plenty of room for a trend line to continue growing at historic rates. And those parabolic lines do tell a different story - with almost 3 identical three-year cycles one after the other from 2010 to 2018 on the chart when you play around with them. Each 3-year cycle has an 18 month rising line, and then an 18 month sideways line before the rising starts again. And if that pattern had held then the second half of 2017 would have been the start of a sideways 18/12, instead of the speculative run-up we got - so goes to show you can’t rely on these patterns to repeat exactly. So yes I agree with you that the parabolic lines suggest if history echoes then we’re in for sideways movement for at least the rest of this year, before an 18/12 rising period starting next year in Jan or July - take you pick! But as always who knows what the future holds, and extrapolation isn’t predictive of course - and I see it more as food for thought and reassurance to keep hands strong if you’re a believer! And I was feeling the market would take off this year in May or October, but it had made me think twice. And yeah the website where you can get this graph and do FA or TA with like 40 indicators is https://www.barchart.com - it’s fairly intuitive and you can log in for free with google or FB, and they have an iOS app. It’s a nice alternative to Trading View! Good cryptoing 
0	1522671832	5	equally as likely:https://imgur.com/oBL0bdu
1	1522677708	6	Because long-term interest and trade volume is tapering off forever.
1	1522681211	2	Yeah anything possible, and bitcoin might do a line down crashing and burning suddenly or slowly too. But those dotted lines on the chart are the Parabolic Time Price Lines, and they suggest that instead of that smooth parabolic slowing you e drawn, there’s instead repeated cycles of the red 18/12 upward growth and the green 18/12 sideways consolidation - which should have started July last year according to the 18/12 thing, but instead started at the end of the year. Shows you can’t rely on chart analysis hey! Yeah extrapolation isn’t predictive, but studying this chart has made me wonder if we’ll have 12-18 months of sideways price action this year at 6-8K - before there’s one of those red parabolic growth lines upwards for 18/12 starting in early or mid 2019. Just food for thought like all analysis I think. 
0	1522686464	1	Ahh I was trying to think on the fly of the Dotcom companies that crashed 90%+ and then rose from the ashes to be the giants they are now, unlike Pets.com and the others. Yeah Apples the other one often used as an example with Amazon - and then as you say google started up after from the tech developed during the Dotcom boom . Correct Sir 
0	1522687931	1	Yeah we can survive if it settles at 6K and trends sideways for 12 months like it’s done before, before a push upwards and the start of FOMO and a big run up. But if it got to 1-2K they’d be no bitcoin like we know it now, cause there’d be no mining with mining costs for 1 BTC of $5K in the US and Russia and about $4K in other Eastern European countries and $3K in China and India. 
0	1522678734	1	lol who the fuck knows...
1	1522679581	2	Why are you here
0	1522682860	1	It would be disastrous to drop much lower. BTC today isn't what it was a few years ago when dropping below the long-term tredline was justified because of multiple factors, like the MtGox disaster, low adoption, lack of businesses, uncertainty about its future because of governmental policies, etc. A severe and sustained drop below the long-term trendline at this point would put BTC future bull runs in jeopardy. It needs to stay above $6k because a relatively high base price is necessary to make jumps to justify the future price according to the trendline. No way it can drop to $1-2k range (basically back to 2013 prices) and continue this trend.
