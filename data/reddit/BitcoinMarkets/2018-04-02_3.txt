Market makers will often cancel their own orders before they can be arbitraged and replace it lower. Then no volume gets traded, but the markets follow. Thus the market leader (where the trading is actually happening - in this case bitfinex) causes the other exchanges to follow without any trade volume getting filled. Market makers who cannot cancel their orders quick enough get arbitraged, forcing the exchanges to follow it anyways. [EDIT] Other possible explanations are:1) They are arbitraging a place that you are not looking. An example of this is simply a 3-cycle arbitrage (triangular arbitrage). For example, you could buy 4000 ether, trade the 4000 ether to BTC then trade that BTC back to USD. Thus you will never "see" the other 4000 ether that you are looking for get traded. This *could* work for any n-cycle arbitrages (USD->ETH->BTC->LTC->USD). They may even "split" the paths and send half of it along (USD->ETH->BTC->LTC->USD, and the other half along USD->ETH->EUR->EOS->BTC->USD) or something along those lines. Because this is possible, and there are literally an infinite number of possible trade paths back to USD, it makes it literally impossible to trace if somebody is arbitraging the pairs this way or not.2) They legitimately wanted to open a 4000 ether position. It may seem like a lot, however consider the daily trade volume. There is over 12 billion USD traded in the last 24 hours. 4000 ether is ~1.5m usd. There needs to be $500m usd traded every hour to hit this daily trade volume. Suddenly a "mere" $1.5m doesn't look like much, as that volume gets traded every 10-15 seconds.
1	1522622312	3	Thanks! "Nobody wants their orders to be arbitraged - you are giving money away for nothing." Curious what kind of loss size we are talking and on what time horizon. That is, for what kind of trader does this make an effect. Swing traders probably won't notice, right?  Day traders? Or only market makers and HFT bots?
2	1522622725	2	Really only HFT notices these changes. Swing traders won't be effected. These changes are often corrected within seconds. Regarding losses, it is not very much. Often only fractions of a percent. If I had to estimate, probably $100-$1000 is extracted by this method per $1,000,000 traded. Most HFT / arbitrage will gladly take < 0.1%, which is $1000 / $1 mil traded. However, I would think that the amount arbitraged is actually much smaller, hence the $100 lower bound. These are all guesstimates though.
1	1522638944	0	I don't really see where you are coming from, arbitrage requires a seller order which wasn't on the market at that time. A 4K buy order sends bitfinex down 6.7%... I've check most of the other markets and there was no exchange out in front with that much book volume to arbitrage.
2	1522639959	1	You assume that a user would use a market order. If somebody placed a limit order 0.5% below market value, arbitrageurs would "appear" and fill the order. These orders would not be visible in the orderbook, as they would only appear AFTER this limit order was placed. Since 0.5% is such a large amount, it would be completely filled by these arbitrageurs within seconds, which is likely what you saw.If you algorithmically trade, you will notice that the current state of the orderbook is very often NOT what you actually get if you trade against it. This is because the market reacts to every order placed. An order such as the @above would cause arbitrageurs to be the ones reacting, and every orderbook would be changed. This is NOT something that you can watch with your own eyes. The algorithms can (and will) react in seconds (frequently even faster).[EDIT] I run arbitrage algorithms that look for these discrepancies, and from what I see, they often exist for less than 1-2 seconds cross exchange. On a single exchange, they exist for less than 100ms before they are corrected. There are open source bots that perform the @above action - react to market changes (invisibly - the orders are only posted once opportunities appear). This essentially means that the orderbook does not actually need the volume within it to catch the trade. See here for an open source arbitrage bot: https://github.com/butor/blackbird.[EDIT2] This also does not take into account market makers who will appear if the price suddenly drops, predicting a bounce back in the very short term.
3	1522645209	1	I saw Blackbird code many months ago and haven't checked it out recently. But I remember thinking at the time... no way it's an optimal way to perform exchange arbitrage. It uses REST API for fetching prices!  One needs websockets for this kind of thing.
4	1522645341	1	Not necessarily true. You can poll very frequently over a rest API (say many times a second), and if the discrepency exists for longer than the rate at which you poll the exchange, you will find it and can capitalize. Additionally, many exchanges only offer REST apis, thus everybody has the same limitations and it becomes possible. However, you cannot compete with a REST API against a websocket. You can compete as a REST api vs a REST api though.
5	1522646007	1	>  many exchanges only offer REST apis, thus everybody has the same limitations and it becomes possible.Yeah not much one can do about that one.> You can poll very frequently over a rest API  (say many times a second)I can't even begin to imagine. The exchanges I trade on have such tight API rate-limits. Those limits are just barely enough to place/cancel/amend orders and if one was to use the rate-limit quota for price fetching in addition to that, the limit would be exhausted too quickly. I'd say maybe 30-40 seconds tops. lolSince arbitrage is more about speed than anything else, even if arbitrage using REST API somehow made money, it would leave too much money on the table by not being fast enough (against websockets, which is there on most major exchanges now). Just my two cents.
6	1522646523	1	Often times you will find that public and private api requests limits are not related. You need to play around with them a little. Alternatively a (not so nice) way to get the public data is to simply mask your IP. It's public data, and is open to anyone. The only way they can really block you from accessing it is via your IP. There are ways around it.
3	1522645758	1	There's no volume in the trading books though, you can't buy 4k then sell 4k and it not show up in the trading volume on any of the trading data for other exchanges
4	1522646845	1	Maybe they did not sell it, and they legitimately bought 4k ether? As per my other comment, that is only 10 seconds of trading for the daily average. Perhaps it was simply a whale taking a position? There is nothing suspicious about it at all...What WOULD be suspicious is if it did actually push the market 5-10%. There is ~12 billion usd traded per day, and the markets move ~5% (on average) each day. Thus it takes over 12b usd of trading volume to move it that much. If they suddenly dropped 5% from a mere 1mil, that would be highly concerning.[EDIT] Also, what I am saying in the top level comment is that the market makers on the other exchanges are CANCELLING their orders and replacing them at different values to prevent this arbitrage from happening. It's just market makers acting as you would expect.[EDIT2] Also, they may be arbitraging a place that you are not looking? For example, If you buy 4000 ether with USD, you can trade that 4000 ether for BTC, then trade that BTC back to USD. You can yield a profit this way, but you will never see the opposite ETH/USD trade that you are looking for. Rather, it would appear in the BTC orderbooks. Did you check those? You would need to check literally EVERY POSSIBLE orderbook, as this 3-cycle arbitrage is possible and appears everywhere.[EDIT3] Edited top level comment.
5	1522658931	0	I think you are just trying to be right rather than fathom what I'm suggesting, not worth taking this any further. If you believe the probability of the situation being arbitrage then so be it. 
3	1522686356	1	Remember back when it was like $1000 differences between exchanges?  Man were those sweet days :-/
4	1522687209	1	Haha yep. You will likely never see anything close to that again. As the markets become more efficient, arbitrage and market making become less profitable. Swing trading also becomes much more difficult.  Since the institutions came around, everything got harder, and it's only going to get harder moving forward
0	1522609489	7	Arbitrage 
1	1522610006	3	4000eth.. that moves the order book over 3% on less than .5% difference
2	1522618544	1	I don't get it either.Could it be that some businesses are getting preferential fees?Could it be that the exchanges themselves are trading against customers? That would be very unethical.
3	1522640801	1	See my comment above. Essentially what happens is that volume will appear that was not visible in the orderbooks. https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/88t1vt/most_major_exchanges_just_copying_finex_at_the/dwnqnrw/
4	1522646056	1	again this is not to do with the order books, there is no trade volume, that comes anywhere close to that buy in the form of a sell on any other exchanges. 
5	1522646407	1	It is possible that there was no arbitrage. Somebody could have legitimately dumped 4k ether and no arbitrageurs could capitalize (the other exchanges reacted). Some market maker may have just been stuck with it. You are looking far too much into this, thinking that 4k ether is a large amount to these whales. 4k ether is ~$1.6m usd. There is currently ~12billion usd traded daily, or $500m every hour. This means that there is $8m usd traded every minute, or approximately $1m usd (worth of crypto) is traded every 8 seconds. This was simply ~10 seconds of trading using the daily averages. There is nothing suspicious about this at all.[EDIT] Edited top level comment
0	1522619574	4	It's not some big conspiracy man, there's just a shit ton of API bots skimming profits through arbitrage. That being said, this is why Tether is such a big problem, because Bitfinex can create more whenever they want and use it to margin trade and paint tape which effects every other exchange. 
1	1522638108	1	the buy orders were in 500eth pieces.
1	1522657214	1	We are getting a tether competitor tho; while tether leaves from 1:1 during periods of volatility; its hardly straying far enough to suggest any sort of risk is priced in.So long as some percentage of the market moves away from tether to true usd we shouldn't be in a goxxing postion in the near future
0	1522613127	3	theyre all different front ends to the same system controlled by the illuminazis
0	1522620765	1	What's wrong with it? As long as the money freely flows between exchanges, its' all one single global market. Arbitrage bots make sure the price gets identical instantly.In the case an arbitrage bot would buy from a wall on Stamp and short equivelent amount on Finex. So there is no difference where you sell, bots would propagate your order to the global market. This way you can sell 1000 btc on Stamp despite low average volume.An that's very healthy, otherwise you'd see  manipulations on lower volume exchanges: every idiot with 100 btc would try to manipulate.Seems like people are desperate because of the price and try to find manipulations when there are none.
1	1522640132	1	I'm obviously day trading so price isn't an issue. There was no short on bitfinex. 
2	1522661799	1	> There was no short on bitfinex. How do you know? Bots could short in small quantities.  And not only on Finex. There are also derivatives markets like BitMEX. And if bots were not pure arb bots, they could delay selling while the price was going up.It could also be that when a bot/human saw price rising it/he/she wash-traded it (bought own sell order) instead of removing the order. But this has ZERO material impact except fees Stamp received. In Japan they have exchanges with _zero_ fees. Unsurprisingly BTC/JPY volumes there are crazy and not even published by CMC (you can find them in the bottom though). And so what? This doesn't change anything.It's not how pump and dumps and other market manipulations work. Most of articles on the topic are written by people who have no slightest clue about the pump and dump theory.
0	1522639820	0	a lot of people claiming this was arbitrage... you need a seller to arbitrage, there was no 2k+ sell orders/book volume.the majority of this was at 380 @2000eth.. the price moves up to 382 (.75% movement up) on all exchanges... selling 2k eth would have send the price down around 3-4% on finex (based on book orders). 
1	1522640937	2	As mentioned above, you don't actually "Need" volume to be visible within the orderbook. It will appear if you give them a good enough deal. Market makers will also appear predicting short term bounce backs.
0	1522618915	-5	They are all owned and controlled by a single group of people. The volume is an illusion sadly.  Just don't invest what you can't afford to lose and take profits when you can.  
1	1522652980	1	And the earth is flat?
