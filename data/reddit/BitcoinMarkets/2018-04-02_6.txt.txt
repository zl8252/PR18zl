0	1522662288	11	Hi, i'm sorry to hear you're in this position, all traders have been in this sort of place at some time or another. I will advise as best as I can. I'm a mod on a technical analysis discord, if you want more advise then PM me and I'll point you in our direction. Also, obviously, this is not financial advice, just my opinion.As a precursor, here's a TA I did of $BTC price on the 29th of March, a day we considered to be very important for $BTC on the channel:http://www.seems-legit.com/technical-analysis/eilhart-bitcoin-technical-analysis-march-29th/As you can see in this, I point to two trendlines that intersect on that day. Since the fall below the uptrending line, we have attempted to break back above it on 5 occasions, the most recent being just two hours ago, when we tried to break above $7130.Volume levels still do not look strong enough to go on a run higher imo. If we fail to break above that 7130 level, then I expect a drop to the (1HR) middle bollinger and the 50 Moving Average at the 6800-6900 region. if we cannot break back above that after a drop, then we would be targeting the bottom bollinger at $6550.To summarise that, the areas to watch right now for indications of price action are: break above 7130 = further momentum up; break below 6850 = return to 6500. These are just ballpark figures of course, and anything could happen, but they are supported by some technical analysis. My advice to you. Do not think of yourself as being 100% in or out of a position. The biggest mistake a lot of traders make is that they feel they have to go all in, or 100% tether up, etc. In your position, I would stagger my exits. If you left your position entirely now, then you're hit with a 75% loss and that will really hurt your confidence moving forward. Alternatively, you could exit 25% of your position at a 75% loss, and then just be patient. If it goes up, then at least you took out something when it was lower, and your liquidation price should be higher now too. If it goes down, then great, look at the targets I've set, and liquidate another 25% at 6850, and another 25% at 6550. OK, you're taking losses all the way down, but it's better than the 75% loss you have earlier, and you still have 25% for if it goes lower than your 6480 entry price.That's the best advice I can come up with in my tired state at least. Sorry for the essay and I really hope it helped. Good luck friend!

0	1522664172	6	If you would not be in a position now, would you go short now?If not, close the position.
1	1522679736	2	This is the best advice and what I always go by. If I would feel comfortable opening a short now, then keep it open. If I wouldn't, then close it.
0	1522677513	2	1 - You **already** lost 75%. Its not something that might happen if you decide X or Y. Its a done deal.2 - Decide how you are investing your remaining 25%. Forget anything else. This is what you have now.3 - Consider reducing leverage to raise your liquidation point, not increasing it. Short positions are tricky because its impossible to push the liquidation price infinitly high, but in BTC aim for at least 50% of current price.4 - Not looking at you position, analise by you favorite method (TA, price action, order book, gut feeling, tea leaves...) if the price is going up or down.5 - Act on you analysis, not your balance, and move in increments of 5% towards it.6 - Consider moving to a 50% fiat 50% btc non-leveraged position immediately, no hesitation, no questions asked. 100% fiat or 100% btc are also fine as long as you are not leveraged. Note: Never naked short, if you have 10 BTC and you short 10 BTC you will never get liquidated. Its the equivalent of being in fiat. Its common for hedging shorts to get liquidated to protect a cold storage walled while having minimal exchange counterparty risk. Its shorting without underlying collateral that gets you in trouble.
0	1522667211	2	So you're using your entire balance to short or what? Your mistake is going all in, so you should close or reduce position drastically. The other option is just gambe you wont get liquidated, but that's retarded given your liquidation price.IMO the mistakes have been made and you already lost those money.

0	1522671142	1	I did similar thing, when we were at these levels previous time (around october 2017). I had some reasons for this short, but it's just details... First mistake I made: didn't close my short after 2-5% loss.Second mistake: I moved more BTC into Bitmex account to reduce leverage and "give my short more room to play out" lolThird mistake I did at the beginning: started trading with full account. Now I'm more like learning, practice with few hundreds $ until I will be sure I can make some percent each month. If after closing your short asap you will lose 75% of your account, I'm pretty sure it will be great lesson that you will remember for long time.PS: after you will close your short, market immidiately can dip to 5k. But statistically cutting loses fast more safe than hope that market will come back.
0	1522685272	1	Can't tell you want to do now. But if you manage get out unscathed then next time ease into a position.  You can never call the top nor bottom.
0	1522671113	2	What the heck were you thinking shorting the bottom like that??? All in and with high leverage? You have a gambling addiction, work on that. 
1	1522672865	2	> shorting the bottomDo you think he knew it was the bottom and decided to short it anyway???
2	1522673650	-1	If you think of the graph as a spring, you can see what I'm saying. You wait for it to retract a bit before shorting. You don't short the lowest price you've seen in the last two months.
0	1522659915	0	Lower your leverage to the point where you could tolerate the worst case scenario.  Never gamble with more than you could afford to lose.
0	1522659158	0	You probably should have done more research, learned more, and practiced.  Use it as a lesson for next time.  Also this isn't financial advice.
