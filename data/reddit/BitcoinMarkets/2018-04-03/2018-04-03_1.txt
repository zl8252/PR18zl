This is not a bullrun yet with such a low volume (compare to 6k in februar, it's shit) nor is it going straight 7.4 -> 3k.Magic Poop Cannon calling 3k imminent should have ringed a bell anyway, this guy is always wrong.
1	1522750341	2	I believe Magic Poop Cannon is a tool for spreading FUD really. If he was genuine he would have used his real name and face. Like this guy: https://www.tradingview.com/u/MarcPMarkets/.
2	1522750811	1	I don't know why or how people take an idiot named MagicPoopCannon seriously. It's probably a damn kid 
3	1522751347	1	A kid or not, that account has quite a following, meaning that it may be able to affect the behavior of clueless "crypto investors". 
0	1522776372	23	Sentiment indicator: my Tron holding coworker wants to learn about shorting
1	1522776516	4	That's why we are pumping
1	1522777212	4	Shorts were at an ATH. That's like the most bullish indicator you can imagine.
1	1522776685	3	Bullish
1	1522776454	2	yeah it's probably going to take a while for word to get out that the bear party might be over 
1	1522776781	2	I also have a tron holding coworker. He has almost 100K, and still believes in it
2	1522776910	2	Do me and you work at same place? My coworker as well 
3	1522778645	6	I have almost 100k Tron and my colleagues are making fun of me.Wait a minute...
3	1522778510	2	Idk, I think a lot of TRON Holders are still hopeful for a full recovery. He sent me a text, psyched that there was a tron ad in times Square NYC this past weekend. 
1	1522779025	2	I think we've never been in this situation before, where we have "shorting mania" and basically the opposite of the bull run where everybody's grandma bought whatever they could get their hands on. I'm curious how it will play out. The direction is probably up at some point, but how violent will it be? Will we go down afterwards?
0	1522759357	21	It does seem like we've broken through initial resistance and are holding it decently well so far. Macro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/1em4nzBm/  While we have resistance closer above us (7500), our next crucial test is the 7800-8000 range, where the downtrend line from 11.7K and the 6-month log support-turned-resistance line are currently converging. I do not see us passing that on the first try. Micro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/sKLYHh5f/  I'm licking my wounds from my stopped short, but I am still holding my June futures long, which I added to (very lightly) at 7290 this morning. CA @ 6517.I may look to scalp a short in the 7500 range, but I wouldn't consider re-entering until 7700+. I may add more to my long if we can break 7500 and hold it, as well.Good luck all.
1	1522760051	1	I also added to my June fut long but took my CA up a bit higher to 6.6.  I'll probably take some profit around 7800, and hold off on other TP for mid or upper 8s which is where a breakout of the [big falling wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Wa8haCM4/) could land, and keep some of it open for later.  What are your targets?Sorry about your short.  I scaled out 75% of mine around BE, and moved the SL on the remaining 25% to 7155 which got triggered.  A rare example of where chickening out didn't backfire.  Yay for risk management.(edit, I'm not saying it's a straight shot to the 8s or even 7.8.  Am prepared for further oscillation within that wedge)
2	1522760537	1	I'd like that June futures long to hold tight up to our ATH resistance line if we get there. I'm actually debating opening a separate long position (swaps) to scalp a push to 7700ish, which is where I expect heavy profit taking/new shorts to get serious. I should have done so under $7300 this morning if I was going to. This close to $7400 is terrible r/r for a long. Trying not to overthink or overtrade right now, though.  I was on the trollbox last night when some whale dropped a $5M market buy around $7050 on top of his $13M position at $6850. Should have bailed right then lol
3	1522760857	1	> I'm actually debating opening a separate long position (swaps) to scalp a push to 7700ishI did that but on the Sept futs, with an entry at 7300.  It's not big, I set it to be a little smaller than the June long.  Was embarassed to say so because it seems pointless to open 2 longs like that.  But would like to manage them separately.  If this scalp long goes bad, I'll take the penalty against the other long to not end up in loss.If I scalp short it'll be on swaps maybe.  Only time will tell if that was wise or not vs whatever the funding rates become, they keep flipping.
0	1522768139	49	So, bitcoin pretty much did the last thing anybody was expecting early this morning and broke through the substantial resistance zone between $7,100 and $7,300.Resistance at around $7,250 has been tested a few times this morning and (at least for now) is holding as support. This movement is potentially forming a [bull flag that would break to the upside at around $7,500](https://imgur.com/a/Qmbuq) with a target of around $7,800. It's a pretty small flag.Zooming out a bit, the market is still wedged pretty firmly in a bearish descending channel:https://imgur.com/a/i1XCzThe resistance line is at around $7,800, and I'd expect it to hold for now even if this flag does compete to the upside. However, if the market *does* break out, then we should see an attempt at the [log resistance line](https://imgur.com/a/UUKKG) that's currently at around $9,500 or so.All in all, it's a great place to have a long open from below $7,000 and a pretty precarious place to be opening a fresh long. The payoff could be substantial if the market remains bullish and continues to press upward...but disastrous if the market remembers that it's been in freefall since $20,000 and the trend is still very much down. As for me, I'm cautiously optimistic and still holding my long from around $7,030. I'd say the odds that I'm stopped out of my position by a test of $6,800 are pretty substantial. However, the risk/reward is very high if the market can maintain this bullish momentum. This could very well be the beginning of the end of the bear market. Which is a pretty exciting situation, even if the odds of that are a bit long. 
1	1522769967	7	> This could very well be the beginning of the end of the bear market. Which is a pretty exciting situation, even if the odds of that are a bit long.Please. God. Please
2	1522770521	10	I almost wish I hadn't included that portion.Look, $6,400 marks the 3rd or 4th "bottom" since $11,700 where one could have made the claim, "this could very well be the beginning of the end of the bear market."There's nothing more compelling about this bounce than any of the previous bounces. Actually, the bounce off $7,300 that made it to $9,200 was far more compelling than the current one. "this could be the beginning of the end of the bear market" in the same way that "this lottery ticket could be the one that solves all of my financial problems!"I'm saying *there's a chance*. But I wouldn't mortgage my house and go long on bitcoin here. I wouldn't do that ever, of course. But I really wouldn't say the bear market is officially behind us until $12,000+ honestly. 
3	1522772754	3	Haha! After looking at some of these responses I now finally understand why most politicians sound like media trained robots; just takes one loose sentence... :)
4	1522776125	1	great observation, you're absolutely right
1	1522768685	11	Glad to see you claiming the bear market might be coming to an end.I got a little worried at 6400. I really thought 8500 was the bottom, and then we dumped to 7500. 6400 got me thinking maybe it is all fucked.I hope we break the log resistance soon. If not, I can’t imagine BTC staying above 6k for much longer...
2	1522769357	9	I'd put like 100 asterisks and disclaimers around *might* there. Yes, the market *could* be done with the decline. However, we won't even have the beginnings of confirmation of that fact until $7,800 breaks to the upside. And again, that's just the **first** step of many important resistance zones that need to be overcome on the way to total confirmation that the bear market is behind us. The recovery will be resting on the edge of a knife pretty much for as long as it continues. $7,800 to $8,100 is a minefield. $8,100 to $9,000 is a clusterfuck$9,000 to $10,000 should be next to impossible (especially if there isn't any significant pullback between $7,800 and $9,000). And EVEN IF the market breaks $10,000, that log resistance line will most likely be absolutely HAMMERED upon after it breaks. And since it's gradually declining, that's going to be a really tough breakout to trade. For example, the market could break out at $9,500, rise to $11,700 and then collapse back to $9,000 in the span of a few weeks. All while still technically maintaining as a "confirmed breakout" above the log resistance line.
3	1522770278	3	I see us bouncing off 7800 if we even get that far. I think we have one more deep dive into the sea before we rise once more like a majestic dolphin.
4	1522770641	1	Like I said in my original post, $7,800 is right around the resistance line for the bearish descending channel. The market shouldn't really have the momentum to push through right now. But hey, the market shouldn't have had the momentum to push through $7,250 either. Yet here we are.
1	1522770232	2	Closed my long from 7000 @7315 when it started behaving like yesterday as i can't watch charts while working and already had good profits. If later on 7200 is tested and holds might enter long again with stops @7100 or so. And with a smaller position so i don't lose much 
1	1522768650	3	It's a weird sensation seeing you so (albeit cautiously) bullish. I myself am becoming increasingly bearish: the bounce is quite weak so far and volume is lacking. The $6k bottom in February felt and behaved like a bottom. This time around it doesn't look convincing at all. But I'll be happily surprised if we are able to break $9.2k the coming weeks.
2	1522768933	4	Well, if you follow my commentary it actually shouldn't be *that* surprising that I'm a bit bullish here.Generally speaking, I try to flow with the market and avoid maintaining a strong bias in either direction. I've gotten caught longing the top more than a few times between $11,700 and $6,400 as the market telegraphs a recovery that ultimately failed to materialize. I've also caught a few falling knives in the process as well (notably the bounce from $7,300 to $9,200. The market is bullish in the short term, so I'm bullish in the short term. If the market collapses at any point between now and $10,000 and resumes it's bearish decline, then my sentiment will shift as well.
1	1522771610	1	>This could very well be the beginning of the end of the bear market.  didn't you say the same thing when we jumped to 8800 two weeks ago?
2	1522772116	6	I'd imagine I've said the same thing on several occasions between $11,700 and $6,400. And it's just as true now as it was then. "the beginning of the end" is only going to be visible in hindsight. There will come a point in time where everyone will be looking in the rearview mirror and thinking, "damn, I wish I'd opened a long two weeks ago." Just as "the beginning of the end" of the bull trap from $6,000 to $11,700 wasn't verifiable until like $9,300. We all would have killed for shorts between $11,000 and $11,700, but at the time it was far too risky to do so. All one can really say about this recovery is that it shows some promise. A price point that was serving as resistance has been overcome in the short term. We'll know more in the next 24 to 48 hours as to whether this is just another flash-in-the-pan nothing burger or if there's some more significant momentum behind this push. 
3	1522773132	1	Fair enough.  But two weeks ago we had three green days and everyone was wanting to call it the end of the bear market.  Now we have another nice run up and everyone is suddenly high on moon juice again.  While I could see this going up for several more days I'm pretty sure we're not going to see a bear market reversal off a bounce without any period of extended flatlining.
1	1522772772	1	Nicely put chewy, I still think that opening a long at 7.3k is a good idea, stop at 6.8k with lower leverage.We just went trhough a fomo on shorting lately, so some will still figth the trend/defend their position, even if it goes to 7k before 7.5k it's still short term bullish.Opened a 2x long at 7035 also, will close bellow 7.8k. Then depending on the action looking for a new short entry with this time maybe a long term view on it and a resonable leverage.I still hate myself for closing my 6.7k 5x long, I will be rich as fuck now and conforntable but meh still a good trade.
0	1522763366	16	Holding from late 2013 to early 2017 was despair. Even though I'm still on the sidelines and probably going to start buying in soon, what this bear market has taught me is patience and that in itself has been a valuable lesson. 
1	1522764703	1	so true. I think that's really the main key to adding to the stack. As someone that new to the hold game, I can 100% agree. Each day is diff
2	1522765586	4	Any investor that got in late last year or early this year and in the red but stayed have become that much wiser now. However my only concern is it might be that much difficult now to reach or exceed previous ATH because people now know they can't be too greedy and begin taking profits sooner. The next bull cycle will be interesting.
3	1522766399	3	the next cycle will probably take 3 years and this will all be a distant memory
4	1522767032	1	This is my primary concern. Not if I buy in at $5k-$8K but if we stay sideways for years. 
3	1522766149	1	I think you speak for soo many people when you say this.This is definalty how I feel the market is rite now. Its best to get an ugly profit than settle for a pretty lost. I can see us being atleast 6 more month away from a bull market but I don't know since this is my first time around. But given the way things going its for sure going to be awhile. How much longer can you see the bears running things? 
4	1522767461	1	I have no idea and anybody telling you otherwise is lying. In Feb when we broke from sub $6K to over $11K and last month when we broke from 7.3K to over 9K it was euphoria for everybody outside of the TA guys. People have very short term memory in crypto. I am a bit biased since I literally sat on my hands for 2+ years during the last bear market and I just think it's too early for a market reset. Not saying price will go much lower or higher but we should stay in this range for at least a little while longer. A lot of people look at how much we already went down percentage wise and say it should be over soon but there were few instances during 2014-2016 where the same things were being said and we proceeded to go down. Again I have no idea what's going to happen but I do miss not owning crypto since this is the longest I have not had any in over 4 years. 
5	1522769501	1	lol yea I understand that seems fair. The 6k-11k bounce really me excited. Thought I was about to break even at least but then all hell broke loose. I hadnt been the same since. Crypto has become more and more apart of my day since then
0	1522728852	16	This is extremely interesting. 
0	1522752985	29	Over the past 6 months i have come here reading peoples comments daily.  And i have honestly found it to be somewhat detrimental.  For anyone out there thats a noob reading this. Learn to trade. Practice!!! Educate yourself!   Dont come here expecting real sentiment or an idea where btc is going.   Wayy to much bullshit in this discussion.   Its not all trash but there is a lot.  
1	1522753757	11	It's great for sentiment. People just miss the fact that you're supposed to countertrade people here.
2	1522754359	1	Sometimes sure.  But i mean there is so much negativity when btc goes down.   Or hate. Or trolling. Or people basically making fun other peoples trades.     Thats not how it should be.   And in all sure sometimes we get 3k comments. But that doesnt mean each comment represents a different individual nor does it mean that this is enough of a sample to represent the majority sentiment.     Sometimes i see a fine post here and there.   Lots of room for improvement here 
3	1522755978	3	Subreddits become worthless for discussion once enough users join i'm afraid. Upvotes are for confirming peoples' bias, not for content, that's just the way it is.IMO loads of new traders here with no understanding of their emotions. Of course they get mad when they lose money
4	1522757829	1	Very true, the I lost money so you should too attitude is very prevalent here, especially among the perma-bulls. Guys, you can still hold a bullish outlook long term but short term you should learn to be flexible.
2	1522758505	1	This, exactly.This sub (specifically the daily) has become quite a good contrary indicator.  I don't trade on it alone, but it works as a reliable confirmation of other signals.
1	1522754690	11	I have only ever lost money by listening to people in this sub.
2	1522757225	3	I earned a bit from listening to some people here, but only a few selected ones :DSpecially when i'm in a position and Chewy enters the same position, every time that happens it works out. Even when its against all odds like yesterday's long from @7000. It got beaten to death but stood firmly before knocking bears out for a while.
3	1522763019	1	I have only ever avoided losing money by listening to chewy. His longs don’t always pan out, but his shorta generally do
2	1522755085	1	And lost out on opportunities    Preach
1	1522753430	5	Half of what you read here is BS. The hard part is figuring out which half ;) 
2	1522753565	2	I agree! 
1	1522753317	5	Yes, I am ashamed to admit that I have closed good trades prematurely cuz i got affected by the noise here lol
2	1522754216	3	Yesterday was the first time I closed an indecisive position due to sentiment here and *didn't* soon regret it.  If I hadn't scaled out, I would have eaten a shitty SL over night.Though this time we were also already broken out of all the bearish formations I was watching (except for the pennant/flag on the 1D that was still valid at that time), so it wasn't fully indecisive, just hanging by a thread.
2	1522753544	1	Its okay you arent the only one.   We are human.  Its insane how much just chatter alone can affect us all.  
0	1522732493	11	I was a few hours in the middle of conducting my monthly buy when all of a sudden... I guess we just popped the weekly pivot. Daily Stoch RSI was oversold, my custom aggregate indicator was oversold. In a few days we'll be over bought again. My guess is a short bull run back to the low 8k at least, upper 8k at best, probably right into the middle at 8.4k which is the April pivot. That's where you bears should short, lower risk there, not here. This was a decent pop today.
0	1522761764	10	Definitely traded this one wrong. This is what I wrote after we pumped from 6500:"With the velocity of some of these pumps it so far lines up with what my gut was telling me. Debating opening a small short at 7200, and I will if it struggles there, but I'm thinking this has enough to go up to 7.5-7.7 with a chance of 8.2, and I'd rather not be underwater that low. I do think it will get rejected by the old long term log support at 7.8ish, and if it gets past that, I doubt it clears 8.2 log resistance.https://www.tradingview.com/x/xXoDWTju/"I ended up not following that plan because I overreacted to the resistance at 7k, listened a little too much to fellow bears, and made a short entry there. I scaled a little out of my position in that range but I'm still far more underwater than I like with what looks like could be a decent amount more room to go. I still think my initial take may end up being right and I still don't see us clearing log resistance from 8.2-8.4, but I don't think I can afford to ride out my whole short til then on the off chance we clear that.Need to consider a little bit more but I think I'm gonna have to swallow a painful bite of this short here and see if I can make it back up with some higher entries, or watch it plunge right back down and end up break even once it goes past 6.7 or so.Greed kills!
1	1522763627	5	On the other hand, the losing trades are much more valuable long term since they forces you to think what went wrong. I also have big respect for posts like this not just bragging about profits but telling your reasoning and the outcome of them. Many good traders are wrong 40-50% of the time anyway

0	1522760986	8	State of the market summary: Of course the market’s word is final, but it’s hard to trust it when, for the last few weeks, it’s been acting like your border-line homeless uncle who only shows up on holidays to ask for money over dime-store whiskey breath
0	1522767640	7	These algos are brutal lol. Definitely new players from this year. Better turn your timeframes up if you’re an impulsive trader like me
1	1522767741	1	I find this price movement absolutely creepy...
1	1522768398	1	[deleted]
0	1522779790	8	All the posters that were bears like yesterday and are now suddenly all bulls has to be a sign.
1	1522779936	1	My favorite thing about the "contrarian indicator" thing (which can be accurate) is that bulls pull it out when they're feeling extra confident at the first legs of a bounce, meaning we should be bearish again
1	1522780058	2	I'm consistently amazed at how quickly 90% of the people in this sub forget how many times this has already happened.I get it, I really do. This "could" be the reversal.You'd just think people would realize now that it doesn't simply go down forever and ever. 
0	1522735564	16	Well, at least now things get interesting.If we can hold above 7250 for a day, that would be good for Bitcoin
0	1522745509	16	Closed my $2.2m long from $7k at an average of $7380 as per my plan mentioned a few days ago here :https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/88g9fm/z/dwkgud5
1	1522745774	2	lmao there i am thinking you shorted it because the price dipped a little after you posted, nice call
2	1522747485	1	didnt theprice dip like 600 bucks though?
3	1522747931	2	>didnt theprice dip like 600 bucks though?I'm a swing trader and I plan my entry/exit points before each trade. When there is no news or major change in fundamentals, I generally stick with them. This trade had a 10% stop, with a planned profit take above 4%.
4	1522748267	2	holy crap, so it missed your stop by like 100-200 bucks?
3	1522748350	1	Oh yes, you're right. Well that makes me feel like less of an idiot then. Lol
1	1522747381	1	wait, you held your long all the way down to 6450?Also, what leverage ratio? Even at 10x that still means you had 220k in BTC on BitMex.  Didn’t know people felt comfortable depositing that many coins to an exchange to trade with
2	1522747732	2	>wait, you held your long all the way down to 6450?Yep. Stops of 10% would have hit around $6300. >Also, what leverage ratio? Even at 10x that still means you had 220k in BTC on BitMex.  Didn’t know people felt comfortable depositing that many coins to an exchange to trade with10x. I have much more than that on Bitmex, being used to hedge my cold storage position. 
3	1522748304	1	I would never be able to sleep at night with that much on Mex

0	1522773124	16	A quick note on Bearish and Bullish RSI divergences, because they've been actually quite helpful in telegraphing impending price movements. First for bullish divs, there's actually a very exciting hidden bullish divergence forming on the 1w. RSI has made a new low compared to the $6,000 previous bottom, however (at least so far) the market has failed to make a lower low in price. Unfortunately, this hidden divergence is only present on the 1w. As lower timeframes failed to make lower RSI lows. Moving along to bearish divs, these are all going to be hypothetical for now. *if* this keeps rising up to and beyond $7,800, then we will almost certainly see hidden bearish divergence on the 4h through 1d similar to what we saw when the market rose to $9,200 but failed to get higher than the previous high of $9,900. RSI will make higher highs on these timeframes, but price will make lower highs. So, just something to keep an eye on if this does continue rising. It's more or less doomed to fail if the market starts floundering in the $8,000s and momentum drops off.The bearish divergences will obviously be moot if the market fails to maintain upward momentum up and over $7,800. The market will continue to drop, but it won't be a result of hidden bearish divergences (because there won't be any).
0	1522744208	21	Ironically, nobody on altcoin subs complain about ‘being tied to bitcoin’ on the way up.
0	1522728806	6	Couldn't break 6500 for the second time. Interesting. I figured we'd crash through it. 
0	1522741201	6	But of course we rallied to 7300. Max pain:https://reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/88xw5k/need_urgent_help_to_make_a_decision_from_a_rekt/

0	1522755359	6	I believe we a due for a leg up. Just a feeling, but I've been wrong before, too. 
1	1522755573	1	You are right. some big sell legs last 1 -2 hours but well absorbed.Let's see.
0	1522731338	13	please more bearish predictions or I am going to exit my longs from last 2 days ;-)
1	1522732220	10	this is going to $30k
0	1522756555	13	I'd say we have made a convincing breakthrough of the first of three important resistance lines when we reached 7400 USD: https://i.imgur.com/dMAvRAv.pngThe second line is now at 7891, but it will probably be at ~~8000~~ 7k8 if we break through. The last line, which if broken will let ut out of the bear trend since the ATH in december, is now at 9641. Let's say ~~10000~~ 9k3 USD when we get there.TL;DR: If we can get above ~~10k~~ 9k3, we are out of the bear woods.EDIT: Corrected some rough calculations.
1	1522757627	2	Don't agree with your first line, which only touches candles once.However, I do agree with the second line, which is IMHO is important line for bulls, and if we manage to breakthrough it, we are good to go to 9k.
2	1522758167	1	You mean the line should touch the candles, not the wicks? Which line are you calling the first?
3	1522759305	1	I used the same line order as you did in the original post. 
4	1522759384	1	OK, so the first line could be drawn a little different. It's still broken though, isn't it?
1	1522756939	1	I agree with your lines of resistance. You may mean 9K tho?
2	1522757027	2	Hah, yeah, I made a brain fart there. The lines are sloping down, so the numbers will decrease over time. Correcting...
1	1522758592	1	FWIW, my notes have 7.8k marked as heavy support, but mild resistance, based on previous action at that line.  Though this time around I expect it to offer more resistance than previously.
0	1522729677	18	Jeremy Gardner saying on Twitter he’s seen requests for “Multi Billion” $ OTC trades: https://twitter.com/disruptepreneur/status/980940740564942848?s=21He doesn’t have a source, says he’s witnessed it.Obviously could be untrue/misunderstanding. But $1b is 135k BTC so would be pretty crazy if true.
1	1522733802	7	It’s true. I’m in the middle of a fairly large OTC transaction due to an acquaintance asking me to help.  The buyers are quite secretive but are among the highest elites of different regions. OTC trades are going heavy at the moment. If you know of any OTC traders you can ask them about this. Or just ask Genesis or one of the OTC desks (those aren’t even the ones to set up the bigger trades). 
1	1522730347	4	Why believe him? Who is he? He admits he barely even knows the difference between bids and asks :|
2	1522730404	9	A thousand times this. As awesome as it'd be if true, I really can't see any reason to believe this man. People see a verified tick on Twitter and assume "this guy knows what he's on about" I guess.Keep in mind it's very much in this man's interests in Bitcoin continuing to be relevant for the sake of his work. 
3	1522731267	7	He’s a VC and also founded Augur. Vitalik lived with him in California at one point so he seems quite well connected.However, you are right that it doesn’t mean it’s true. Anyone who benefits from being a “crypto personality” has an incentive to claim they have insider information and it’s only a tweet.Personally I think there’s increasing demand for OTC even if not true.
3	1522730636	4	guess we'll see if he's full of shit or not in a couple weeks.
2	1522731828	2	Unless he is just saying what he saw and really did see several multi billion in *asks*, and we should all be afraid of the coming OTC dump /s
2	1522755316	1	If he were lying/intentionally spreading hopium not based on truth, don’t you think he would have taken the time to learn the difference between bids and asks? The confusion of the terms actually makes me believe him more lol

Past that point, the orders drop-off exponentially. On the offer side, there is heavy resistance right above us. Seems like the market’s expecting to see $7800.  After that, no clue.. flip a coin. Either we’ll be going back down or people will be getting sh’rekt (probably both) &nbsp; *****  [^1](/u/The_OPs_Mommy) *Technically not accurate.

2	1522739658	6	Yeah, they’ve been there for a while too. Sometimes wonder if most of them aren’t just orphaned orders put there by one high-as-a-kite rich dude. I just picture the guy, back in the heady days of mid-December during the height of the mania, going full-retard, gleefully clicking orders all up into the stratosphere from 76k to a million bucks … before his final cocaine binge took a frightful turn for the worse...  
1	1522738942	7	This chart clearly indicates that the bears have the upper hand. Especially with the insane amount of longs still open, I anticipate that if we were to reject a resistance level, the buy side is not going to stack up too quickly.On the other hand, if we start gobbling up the ask side, then I anticipate there’s a ton of additional ammo to be put up.Personally, I think we will stay in this 7500-ish range for a little bit and then choose a direction. I doubt we will go to 11k or higher on this run, but the historian in me says that we dumped to 880 last year and started our recovery at the end of March, so history could repeat itself.Target for a sick run would be 50k this time around... fingers crossed
0	1522754792	6	My short got stopped out at 7320. Still holding my June futures long from 6425, but the short was heavier, and I'm still net down a few percent between the two. Seems to be an ascending wedge off the most recent 6400 bottom. I'm mobile for now, but I'll chart it when I'm at a computer. I did not expect this push through 7300, and I need to reevaluate my market sentiment.edit: not really much of an ascending wedge after all. It's extremely shallow, and could just be a channel: https://www.tradingview.com/x/y4V2ljjy/
0	1522761299	5	Have a bit of my new strategy, doing high leverage longs for smaller moves/breakouts/downs, then lower leverage longs for more "certain" price points like 6800 and so.Works quite well so far, since the theory is to try to be in a position and ride waves and use crypto as collateral for that. It's basically like adding or removing from your position, but just having two instead. Then I am also exposed to more upside with a 4x long since the risk is lower, but I can also ride it longer and lower feesThoughts on this ?
1	1522761597	2	> It's basically like adding or removing from your position, but just having two insteadI've just arrived at the same conclusion.  I'm thinking of it as having a low leveraged long term and a higher leveraged short term.But at this current stage in the experiment the short term one is also low leverage and smaller than the long term one, keeping the longer one as a backup to absorb losses on the short term one.Seems like it'll be cleaner to manage than scalping back and forth on a single position.
1	1522761392	1	Ya I’ve arrived at a similar strategy. Only thing is you gotta keep yourself honest about the prospects of your high leverage bets lol (I.e. don’t let your separate strategies start melding together)
2	1522761969	2	Yep, that's why I use 2 exchanges for that :)
3	1522762401	1	lol, same

0	1522730880	16	Smells like a recovery to me... This is the first time I've felt spooked by upward movement since I opened a short a few days ago 
1	1522732108	6	You have a short memory.
2	1522768706	1	Was just saying that felt a little different to me, wasn't just one mega pump... Was a few jumps separated in time without much pullback, and it crested some resistance points it had trouble cracking on its earlier bounces. The other pumps smelled like fake outs to me, but this one didn't. 
1	1522731101	3	Not until we go over 7.4k imo. And RSI is overbought on 1h, last time it was this overbought was March 21. And damn, I keep getting rekt by shorting, I'm done margin trading.
2	1522731687	8	You're gonna lose a lot at first when trading. No one learns by winning a bunch at first, they'll just lose it all in the end. Beginner's luck is terrible.If you're giving up because it's too exhausting then good- stay away, it's not worth it. If you're giving up because you think you'll never be profitable, then realize that even really great traders start out losing a bunch at first.
3	1522731915	1	Alright, encouraging words. Maybe I'll keep at it. I think I should open a short any second now but I've been saying that for 4 hours so who knows.
4	1522731999	1	Are you using high leverage?
5	1522732188	1	No.
6	1522732276	2	Then this is a great opportunity to add to your position if you're really bearish. Doesn't mean it'll work out, but the best time to add to/open a position is often when it feels uncomfortable to do so
7	1522732423	1	Fair enough, I think I'll do that.
8	1522732581	2	You could wait longer to see how high it goes, or just stop it out quickly (although you will incur losses from fees). It's up to you really, you have to develop your own trading style, and making mistakes and gaining experience will help you determine what that isIf I were trying to open a short here, I'd have relatively tight stops and just keep re opening til it was clear I got the top. After a few tries I would stop shorting so as not to keep losing money on fees. But that might not be in your best interest, it's just how you want to do it
9	1522732889	1	Thanks that's a good strategy. I'll see what works, I'm gonna be in the trading game for a long time I imagine.
1	1522776240	1	Zoom out. I see no reason to believe this isn’t just another bump on the way down. It already appears to be losing momentum.
2	1522776494	1	I was just giving my gut reaction to this one... it felt a bit different from the other pumps to me.  I mean I definitely wouldn't be surprised if it continued the trend and dumped, but for whatever reason this one felt like ti might have some more staying power.

0	1522750709	10	Personally I think this looks like a great reentry point into BTC for bigger investors.If you look at the longer term curve and previous price action we are probably getting close to a bottom now. My prediction is that institutions won't want to miss out and will get back in early. Once that starts to happen smaller, everyday investors will follow. Shorting has become too easy and although it feels risky to buy, these are good indicators of a change. but hey, take with a pinch of salt. This is just a prediction, I'm not claiming to know the future

Anyhow listen to this pathetic performance.  * Sold at 6792.  Re-Bought at 6697, decent little pick up. * Sold at 6816.  Re-bought between 6674 and 6710sh.  Nice little pick up.* Dip, dip, dip, seemed okay around 6500, gave my self a time limit and was out at 5619.  Sitting in FIAT since.  Contemplating crying but easter candy is nice. Good luck today everyone  
1	1522762268	4	Lost 3,500$ when we hit 6k in Feb. Sold at bottom. I forgave myself 
2	1522762622	3	You paid to protect your investment, there's value to that.
1	1522762692	4	Feel you.  I sold a lot at 9k bottom in between the 11.7 twin peaks, no leverage, was with the holding stack.  Rebought for a fair loss near the re-top, only to see it drop back down a few weeks later.In that situation it would have been less loss to have been in a leveraged hedge that got liquidated.  Not gonna short my "real" coins again.

0	1522736776	5	Scalping a quick short here, entered at 7330. Will close when shorter term RSI's cool off. Tight stops, thoughts on r/r here?
1	1522737603	2	7.3 was resistance, it needs to hold here for at least couple hours to confirm break. I'd say breaking 7.5 will be bullish.Also small scalp short but watching for now, looks like it lost momentum.
2	1522738466	3	7.25 was resistance. 7.3 doesn't provide any big resistance. It's an area for profit takers (longs) and scalp shorters. Ultimately there is a big volume gap here and above us and 7.8 will be the first real resistance. I've longed pre breakout and target 7.8-8. to exit my position and see what the market decides it wants to do.
3	1522738974	6	You're arguing about $50?
4	1522739097	3	For someone who's serious about his trading, yes. A 50pts off your support/resistance levels makes a difference in your PNL and the goal is to have a positive PNL in the long run. I'd even argue that 7.2-7.25 was more resistance than 7.25-7.3. I probably would have said nothing, if 7.2 was mentioned as key resistance.
5	1522739256	3	$50 can be a difference between exchanges
6	1522739275	2	Fair enough, that's right and I didn't think of that.

0	1522742289	4	I guess in medium term we gonna retrace from $7400-7500, which is the upper resistance of local downtrend channel going all the way from the beginning of March. So we could end up with $7100 in 12-18 hours. If we manage to breach $7500, then next major resistance is $7800, which is SMA100 for 4h timeframe.Have a good trade.
1	1522744457	1	7500-7550 also seems to be around the closing point of this ascending wedge: https://www.tradingview.com/x/sKcEMGZd/ 
0	1522746044	4	I'll be the first to admit I only have a very basic grasp of TA so I don't day trade too much, made a few good ones and a couple of really bad ones (although 1 was when I was using Kraken last year and I was unable to get my order through)Now to my question, why would a trip to 5.9K (or 4.9K or less) satisfy people. If the narrative is to be believed that the market is over-valued then even if we go sub 5K and get a bounce there will only be a few people (relatively speaking) who will get in quick enough before we are back to a possible 6 or 7K, what then? Everyone who misses out is suddenly going to go fuck it i'm buying? and what about people who are waiting for 5.5K or 4.9k or 3K? The same problem applies surely.Please ELI5 as i don't really grasp it
1	1522746416	3	If we go sub 5k there won't be any crazy V-bottom bounces leading back to ATH levels. Anyone who thinks that after this sideways bleed we could shed another 30% or more off the price and then see investors pile on to 10k+ levels is just mad with greed.
1	1522746367	1	Honestly if it goes to $5.9k again I'm fairly sure it'll fall through. A double bottom *could* happen but the sell volume is so high on the way down that I wouldn't be surprised if it just dumps through to like $5.5k and people's spirits break and there's no buying pressure left to sustain an upward push for the double bottom. 
1	1522748619	1	Ok, thanks for all you input, very interesting.So let  me tell you my thoughts FWIW. I haven't been in bitcoin as long as most of you, just over a year and a bit investing, but dabbled a few times before that (wish I had kept them instead though).Now, as I said I don't really have a grasp on TA, but (like Huggy Bear) I do know a bit about the word on the street. I talk to people about BTC and cryptos occasionally and couldn't really generate any interest from people last year.When BTC was <3k i was talking to my friends (who all earn more than me by quite a lot) and couldn't really get much enthusiasm, they had heard about it but didn't undertstand itInterest was starting to stir Mid October when BTC was still less than <6K just but I don't think any of them bought in because it was still too much hassle and they seemed to follow the 'Tulips/Ponzi' narrative because that was their bias most likely.They did have the sense to listen when we spoke early December and I said don't touch it as even I could see it was getting a little silly.Sadly although I followed my own advice to an extent by selling some I bought back in way too early.. Never mindAnyway TLDR.....word on the street is MEH....
2	1522749387	1	I'm confused. Your "word on the street" sentiment is from December? Haha how does that help us now? 
3	1522755069	1	No, word on the street currently is MEH but interest may be growing again a little now the hype (and the price) has come down.Just my experience, I can't help you in anyway i'm afraid.I think it is interesting that I only know of 1 of my friends is dabbling in crypto despite most of my contacts being in a much better financial position than me (i'm an artist so never going to be rich :) )Why are they not getting involved? thats the big question? and IF/WHEN they do we will really see the price/value flourish but a few major things have to happen first.
0	1522760302	5	Pull up a chair and get comfortable. Probably going to be here a while
0	1522775046	4	This is more of a fundamental question, but a lot of TA experts are calling for capitulation so we can reach bottom and start moving up again. My question is why is capitulation necessary? Can someone explain the market psychology behind the need for capitulation?
1	1522776005	39	There are a few reasons why one could argue that continued decline below $6,000 is necessary, but "capitulation" isn't really one of them.The primary reason is that the market has not undergone adequate price discovery in the area between $1,160 and $6,000. The market blew through that area with barely a second-glance in the rear view mirror on the way through it. Now, the counter argument is that bitcoin was wildly undervalued in the sub $1,160 range to begin with, and is still wildly undervalued within the $1,160 to $6,000 range. So additional price discovery within that range might not be necessary.The second reason is more psychological. Any market is a revolving door of investors. People buy at x price and sell to a new buyer at y price point. There have been several "waves" of investors at various intervals. $200 to $1,160 saw a wave of investors that redistributed their coins to new investors on the way back down through that range. $1,160 to $20,000 saw yet a new group of investors who are all still in the process of redistributing their coins to new investors. The way I like to think of it is that "expensive" bitcoins are relative to the wave of buyers. For somebody who bought at $20,000, $6,000 seems like it's the best price they are going to be able to sell at before shit really hits the fan.To a new investor, however, who missed the boat on the run up to $20K, $6,000 may seem like a bargain. $3,000 even moreso. "capitulation" is essentially just the movement of coins from "weak hands" into "strong hands." You're taking a coin from somebody who thinks they're lucky to sell when they did and putting it in the hands of somebody who is thankful they had the opportunity to buy when they did. To prevent additional decline, the # of strong hands needs to outnumber the # of weak hands. Somebody who bought at $6K+ would panic at $3,000. Somebody who bought at $6000 to $3,000 would be less likely to sell, and would potentially buy more to improve their average entry.
2	1522777394	3	>The primary reason is that the market has not undergone adequate price discovery in the area between $1,160 and $6,000.But we spent 10 months of 2017 within that exact range with very hard fought battles to break 3k and 5k, each preceded by a major crash. If anything we went very slowly through that range (by Bitcoin standards) and experienced excellent price discovery with prior tests of $1800 $3000 and $5600. The fact that we had as many pullbacks on the way up in 2017 is what really baffles me about all the bears calling for sub 3k coins when really everything under 7k has already been pretty well tread and tested.
2	1522777893	2	Going with your strong hand, weak hand theory. Could you not argue that strong hands could make up a much higher percentage of investors than the average asset class?I mean "HODL" mentality aside, I personally view Bitcoin as one of the greatest technological advancements of our time (albeit one of many in the past 20 years) and I believe that as time goes on it will truly become digital gold (or more depending on 2nd layer solutions).Given that although I didn't buy any at 20k, if I did I think my only action would be to buy the dip and wait (from a long term standpoint, of course I will trade differently). I can't imagine there are not MANY folks like this out there. My point being that if a long term holder was going to sell (a "weak hand") they would have done so long before 6k... accepting -70% is not much different than -90%...I like the mental model you laid out don't get me wrong but I have been openly bullish here in the 6000s and I don't see reason to not buy anything below 6800. Yes it may dip below 5800 but I would only also consider that to be more valuable.... low 6k/high 5k feels like the point where the strong hands DCA like madmen... 
1	1522775933	18	How didn't we haven capitulation? A 70% btc bottom and a 80%-90% bottom in alts. Anyone who hasn't shaken out by now is longterm hodling 
2	1522776768	1	Agree , alts are down like 80-90% sounds like a capitulation to me 
1	1522775438	6	My thinking is, its the point where the market makers aka whales, institutions, etc have decided this is the cheapest they can accumulate and are going to give up shorting the market and help pump the price...until next cycle. I know its not the definition of capitulation but it's what I see is being necessary for the next bullrun.
1	1522775140	6	Capitulation is necessary so a lot of people don't drop their bags the moment they have a chance. It's not necessary as long as optimism gets very high. Very rare after a crash.
2	1522775458	6	This. It prevents sustained downward pressure on the price during a market recovery.
1	1522779045	3	Capitulation is not a need, is an effect. There are several kinds of bottom besides a capitulation bottom. A flat accumulation bottom, a double bottom... each with different price action profiles.People want a capitulation bottom because its the most dramatic. A huge red spike down seemingly making everyone think there is no lower price for the active, forums fill up with desilusion in a single hour, news get made. Then suddenly out of nowhere price climbs back up half way leaving only the guys that where lucky to have their bids in the right place feeling like they are the best traders in the world, and the ones that had their bids below the spike like the cursed of the earth.And the price chasing begins, both the bids that near missed and the bottom sellers get back in. Then slowly over the next weeks people start realizing that everyone that wanted to sell has already sold, only asks from scalpers and "smart" traders that want to get out on the bounce and not on the bottom are selling.Each day the passes every one that sold and said "fuck this crap" sees the price creeping up, until one by one become bulls again and fuel the next leg of the rally. Eventually a top happens in the exact reverse way with lambos, 1Mil or eat my dick bets, your barber talking about the new hot crypto ICO he bought. Epics get written, movies are casted, heroes and villains are heralded by the unwashed masses...
1	1522779694	2	"TA experts"...lol
1	1522775280	3	Just a guess (i have no idea) but maybe it relates to a point when the fake run-up strategy (like the one we're in now) no longer works because market demand is just totally dead i.e. FOMO has gone. At that point I guess we return to a less manic/fear driven market that can then begin a long, slow organic recovery to higher highs.

2	1522757925	1	As long as r/bitcoin is buying dips yelling "HODL!", we have seen no bottom.
0	1522755635	10	In all honesty this pump looks solid for the bulls and waiting until 8.5 breaches and holds will cost me 75% of my trading stack BUT damn does that blow get softened from watching my delta portfolio shoot up. + I'm still weary from taking a huge loss a month ago when we dumped to 8.3 then shot back to 9.9 (I could have held the short open and not only avoided a loss but made a ton, my liq was 10.2 from shorting 8.6). Thats why I don't trust any bounce until I'm compelled to do so and I am far from compelled (I actually still feel fomo to add to my short but risk management says that's enough adding). I slept like a baby in an underwater short last night and I think we will still see 5k and then 3k before all is said and done. If anyone else is holding an underwater short my only advice is to never panic close when the macro trend is in your favor unless you're over leveraged to hell. 
1	1522757352	1	I dunno man the last time we pumped we had good news + bottom + volume , nowwe have none of those things well except maybe bottom I'm a confused bull 
1	1522757659	1	Can you explain why you think this looks solid? Didn’t we pump about 10% recently and still come crashing down to new lows?
2	1522758639	1	Well the lower the price we bounce off the most likely it is we bounced off the true bottom. This one had some decent volume and follow through so far for 3 days. 
3	1522759139	1	7.4 -> 9.2It took couple of days before we went down again and volume was also there.
4	1522759692	1	Maybe I've been oversold on this bounce lol. There seems to be a big shift in sentiment already. Everyone was a bear 3 days ago and now people are talking about escaping the downtrend at 9k. Lol
5	1522759817	1	Yeah. But it's kinda confusing. I didn't expect it to push it up here and now I have no idea. Going short may be profitable, but we may go back to 7.8 before next drop, if it even comes...
5	1522759929	1	You know how quickly sentiment shifts here. Trend is still down. Until there is confirmation on a reversal, trade on that. 
1	1522757849	1	I kinda like the low volume slow climb, it feels someone “ Natural “ and feels sustainable to me 
1	1522758156	1	Why do you keep your losses like that and not take profits 
2	1522759452	1	I've taken plenty of profits since shorting 10.8 a month ago. I'm only down profits right now. 
3	1522761179	1	yeah but still, house money fallacy
1	1522760679	1	you posted it yourself : https://twitter.com/SwenLink/status/979832264434610179?s=19
2	1522761668	1	Yeah looks like the fractal predicted a bounce. I should have followed it more closely and closed my short at 6.4 but I would have reopened at 7-7.2 already. 
0	1522751671	6	Doombois you should probably close your shorts, we are at a 5 month high on short volume, yet the market was sideways yesterday and up today https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDSHORTS/

0	1522732168	7	Speaking as a bull, I'm going to be really sad if we can't hold and this  next move is us breaking below 6k :/It seems that it is a vast majority of Bitcoin Skeptics who are declaring below 6k ---> 3kish and I'm just not sure if we will reach that level of "despair". Definitely biased, but I think we have enough fresh bulls to prevent that :P
1	1522732887	3	It's not impossible, but $3k should take some time to reach, with some serious "fake-coveries" in between...  Not a straight capitulation downward like we are on now.  That's how these bear markets drag on for months.
0	1522763352	17	It pains me to say I'm selling this bounce all the way to 8.2k. I just don't think the market is ready to reverse until a new low is made. It's a gut feeling having watched this market closely for a few years.

1	1522761745	4	I can't really estimate the probability accurately unfortunately. But fast? We have pretty much constantly suffered past few weeks with occassional bounces and in general whole Q1, so wouldnt call anything at this point fast.
2	1522761881	3	Don't bear runs usually end up with months of stagnation / side ways ?
3	1522762705	5	Define 'usually'. This is Bitcoin
3	1522762586	3	Yes.  There has always been a period were the price doesn't move much for weeks before the true reversal.  But that doesn't mean there won't be any giant dcb before it happens.
0	1522772029	5	Still holding an underwater long from waaaaay back (7450).Came within inches of just taking a loss and even closer to getting liquidated.

0	1522772545	9	as much as I'd love for this to be the reversal we've all been waiting for, I can't bring myself to accept that the correction is over within 4 months of the ATH. 
1	1522772833	5	I agree with that thought, but here's the counter argument...Market cycles are very similar, regardless of which market it is. However, what makes crypto so unique is the fact that it's global and trading is open 24/7. And crypto being so speculative is a unique variable that is nearly impossible to weight against any market cycle.I realize that there was a multi-year bear market that set a precedence that this can be very extensive length-wise, but you must consider that the cat has been let out of the bag, so to speak. Most people know what Bitcoin is at this point. They didn't during the last bear market.More spectators, more investors, and the other variables I discussed could speed up the typical market cycle time exponentially.Still, I'm skeptical. This is either a sucker's rally, or the "this looks like a sucker's rally" from the market cycle phase pattern we've all seen shared around here.
1	1522772943	4	Long way from reversal. Gotta break ~10k and hold it for that. 
2	1522774009	2	I agree. It's a shame that the ATH was pumped so high that we now have an enormous range of uncertainty to deal with.
1	1522772999	5	Quick point: In the past 4 months we have seen a revolutionary movement with what’s happening with crypto. It’s being integrated more than ever into nearly everything. There is so much potential in the upcoming year where we could have one major news outbreak and send us ATH levels again. 
1	1522772910	3	You’re mostly true that bear market is not over. But that doesn’t mean we’re going straight to 3k and stay there. There will be bull trap, disbelief rally...
1	1522772705	3	well, we don't have a mtgox event. that was one major reason why the bear market lasted so long. 
1	1522773233	2	I feel the same way. It's easy for people who didn't experience 2014-2016 to say bear season is over just because it dropped a certain %. As far as my non-TA naked eyes see it, we are just making lower highs with not much volume with the exception of a couple impressive buys here and there. I can't set a time frame on a complete reversal but I think it will take some serious manipulation to not only get people to FOMO in but also to keep those still underwater from selling when they hit their buy-in price. The thought that this is just another pump ready to get dumped on I am sure is lingering over most people's minds. I don't know maybe the shitty weather here in the NYC area is just making me feel even more bearish.
1	1522773003	3	Crypto time is not normal time, everything is compressed.  I'm surprised it took 4 months.
2	1522773256	3	It's not official yet. I'd love for it to be, but wouldn't be surprised to hang around $5K to 8K until August. 
0	1522745746	6	Beware it's a trap.
0	1522750581	9	oh lord, we’re at the same point we were last Thursday. Let’s all claim a victory!!! /sguys, either we get back above 8k or we go below 6.5k. Those are the only lines I’m looking at. Everything in between is just noise
1	1522751245	3	I'm absolutely amazed at the short term memory loss that some people in here have. At this point we have gone up about 4% since yesterday. That's it.Nothing has happened yet. Yes we broke the 7200 barrier that people were banging on about but that's it. Are people seriously FOMOing in right now or is that just a 'down with the kids joke'? Sure placing a speculative long at 7250 up to 7500 is worth a pop but that's just to see if you can scrap some profit here. Should 7500 break maybe go again up to 7800.Baring in mind the 1 hour RSI is now overbought and the 2 hour is approaching, plus the fact we can't seem to break 7400... i'd be very careful here. Not saying we won't just blast through 7400 but we could just as likely fall now down to under 7300 and approach 7200.Other than that I have nothing else to moan about!
2	1522752945	2	Not to mention that this entire rally has been done on poor volume. 
1	1522750905	1	That's fair, but keep in mind people are trading at different time intervals. Some daytrade, some trade by the 5min, and some trade by the daily or longer. No matter how you see it, you will be missing movement sitting out. There's nothing wrong with that, and uncertainty should keep you away from a position. But we are not all uncertain, and some of us will even be right.
0	1522767059	7	Funny to see people celebrating talking about bear tears. Like bro, I never said the price was going to go straight down. Just that it was an obvious bubble cycle playing out, and that the general trend was down. And I have been right. Bounces are a part of this cycle.Eventually I'll go bullish, and expect a true trend reversal. My indicator is when the dumb money has given up all hope of a new bull run. That's when the bottom is in.
1	1522767413	12	> dumb money has given up all hope of a new bull runhow do I sign up to get the email for when this happens?
2	1522767488	1	Honestly were getting close. u/binary-echoes has given up it seems. Just need a few more of the perma bulls in here to give up lol. 
3	1522767552	8	Terrible indicator, I don't give up. Still buying ... not going to stop until I see a squeeze.
4	1522769257	2	lol the reversal has been cancelled!
1	1522767266	7	Dumb money is shorting right now so the trend reversal started?
2	1522767343	7	Yes, there is some truth to this actually, but dumb money was buying Altcoins in December but that bubble still went on for another month. So... Just because there is dumb money shorting bitcoin doens't mean it can't go on for a while longer. There is a larger supply of "dumb money" than you think!
3	1522767884	1	Exactly. It's actually been "dumb" to short the market for a while. Tons of good news, etc. But the market can act dumb to the downside for a while, just like it was dumb in December.
3	1522768074	1	You need to buy bitcoin to buy most altcoins. 
1	1522767427	7	The bottom is in when all you noobs go broke from shorting.
1	1522767099	6	Need a tissue?

1	1522762539	9	MPC and Dark are just pushing their own agendas. Multiple charts + constant updates per day begging for likes only goes to show they're making money on stuff other than trading BTC. They're make money off headlines for their charts not actual TA. Notice all the new technical analyst on tradingview that use female avatars. Its becoming a joke
2	1522763255	5	Part of me believes their posted TA is contrarian to their actual trading positions.

2	1522729185	2	What's your target?
3	1522729494	4	Based on previous bubble bursts, I expected/expect us to dip down to $3500. That said I'm holding through it all. Edit: downvotes? Really? I explained my reasoning and used a specific number. 
4	1522748762	1	I wouldn't be surprised if they were just downvoting your username 
1	1522729687	4	Wouldn't be surprised to see us going up to touch the bottom of the log support-turned-resistance at approx 7.8 - 7.9k before turning downwards again. Will be looking to scale in shorts from 7.4k to 7.8k. 
0	1522729000	4	Did anybody see the 300+ buywall at 7280-7290 get pulled? Spoof or coldfeet?
0	1522731175	4	Bought in with my stop buy in low 7200s, bought in manually as a speculative add with half at 7060. Just for the record. Anyway...Eth led this initial dump, breaking down from 420 then 400. Wouldn't be surprised if it getting rejected from 400 with BTC at ~7500 halts this pump. Edit: just relalized it's currently testing 400 with BTC at 9350ish. Maybe sooner than later this theory will be tested.Maybe. Predicting a lower liquidity alt to lead because it led on the drop is pretty sketchy. Just a thought I had.Otherwise waiting to see it test 7.7-7.8k range.Setting stops at minor profit and letting this go.
0	1522777587	4	[This is what I am seeing in my 30m timeframe](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WRvJZ2ya). I am quite surprised this channel has held strong for so long, and I am not expecting it to continue that way, although I'd really wish it would.I think we may revisit 7.1-7k and will probably open a short at 7.6 if it gets there, with a really tight SL. I was going to open it at 7.5 but the channel has swallowed that number by now and I don't want to trade inside it.Why trade when the channel is breaking? because I don't think it can keep up.
1	1522778079	1	Nah bro that channel gonna take us to 25k, but by 2020. #permabullKidding.On a more serious note, I think we're in a [rising wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/fp06kgpS/) on the 1H charts and we'll probably break down once the bbands tighten back up which I think will happen within the next hour.
2	1522778607	2	I don't think it's going to break down so soon. It's a pretty steep wedge, but the lines don't meet until ~8.6k on my chart.A break down at 7.8k would make sense, coinciding with support turned resistance.
3	1522778877	2	Not to say that you're wrong but we saw this exact same fractal on March 18 to March 21 which broke down.Excuse all the random marks, just focus on the candles:[Today](https://www.tradingview.com/x/DtisUPDV/)[March 18 to March 21](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TLOzLDjd/)Not saying that it's going to play out identically but the steepness of the wedge doesn't really dictate when it breaks down.  Really, all it takes is one whale to get bored and decide to take profits at the near top of a wedge.
4	1522779163	2	Steepness makes it more likely to break down imo. Harder to continue a steep uptrend. Also makes me trust the pattern less though, could just go sideways out of it.Fractals aren't useful to me past some fun facts. You never know when a fractal is going to break down. For instance, look at the weekly chart. We were fractalling pretty consistently with the 17k DCB and crash to 6k until sort of last week and this week so far.And I don't really see the fractal you're talking about anyway. Looks like they're both just generic rising wedges.
0	1522779643	4	How much the crash's panic selling was driven out of fear of not being able to meet/optimize for income/capital gains tax obligations?Major realized gains in 2017. Capitulation in early 2018.The fear of not being able to pay one's taxes in full is a living nightmare & market influence.Investor/user context > charts.
1	1522779704	1	this was discussed not long ago, and the prevailing viewpoint on this daily was that the impact was negligible. I strongly disagree with that viewpoint.
2	1522779769	2	Has anyone here sold for tax reasons? I haven't seen literally anyone mention it. I feel like I'd have seen someone mention it by now. 
1	1522779788	2	Everyone was selling BTC for Easter eggs and Passover wine. 
0	1522735105	9	Wait a minute. We've gone up 4% and there are people saying we've recovered.. Return to the bull.Calm down, seriously. It's great to see a bounce up but it's nothing right now until it breaks the key resistance and stays there.Are people forgetting the last few months?! Let's see what happens over this week before getting our hopes up 
1	1522735652	8	No one's said BTC has recovered, but recovery has to start somewhere.If you believe in TA the "almost" double bottom is potentially bullishWhat's most bullish to me atm though is how much dumb money is in shorts. This kind of upswing wouldn't be possible without liquidations.
1	1522736460	5	Yeah and also people apparently forget that the market recovered by like 25% in May of 2014. We all know what happened through the rest of the year.
2	1522736836	7	I want nothing more than  the bear market to end but it's nothing right now other than a bit of light relief.Just as many times before, even this year alone, we could very well climb to 8k or 8.5k..most people get all hyped and the  we bleed down again. Back into the 7s and we repeat our most recent cycle.Short memories lead to small wallets 
3	1522736992	2	Yes I agree with everything you have just said.
4	1522737242	5	I'm a bit shocked to see some people here already acting as if this is the start of something great. Over a 4% rise after tons of down.Now if this goes 35% and there's genuine sentiment change across the whole space.. Hey maybe the bull is back then.
5	1522737420	3	Not even 35%, that might still be too small. Remember the 100% gain in Februrary from 6k to 12k? I do. I guess most of crypto has forgotten.
6	1522737571	3	I just woke up.. 35% was a quickfire maths guess! I'd like to see 11k then I'd be 80% bull at that point.That would break every key resistance point I think. 
7	1522737607	2	Yeah but there's also 12k. If we break 12k then I might be convinced.
8	1522738519	3	Either way.. There really is still some way to go! 
9	1522738896	2	yup
5	1522737650	5	Short memories, small wallets. Well said.
1	1522736951	2	I get hope from there not really being a strong bounce from the last days lows. When theres no hopium for the CO to sell into, he might as well just reverse the market.
1	1522735421	1	This time is different; 7.8k this week where a very lazy drawing on chart tells me is the important resistance level
0	1522739532	6	hmm i actually think we might test 7.8 here.but before that a round of stop hunting and taking out high levg longs should happen.if it doesnt and if we just shoot up from here, then something would be off.

I also don't expect an instant bull, but more accumulation around these levels or slightly higher, if we hold.

0	1522752229	5	I wonder how relevant/legit this info about big investors is https://twitter.com/Disruptepreneur/status/980940740564942848
1	1522752834	4	I suspect he pulled that information from the same place he shits from.Not sure what people get out of tweeting things like this - it's obviously not going to incite any fomo.
1	1522759647	1	For what it's worth, I've been hearing about big OTC buys coming through in a steady stream for a few weeks as well. Nothing verifiable but yeah.
0	1522773834	3	This is a post about Bitcoin. Bear with me.So Ethereum is currently discussing a "meta-joke" hard cap proposal, that was both a joke and a legit proposal from Vitalik on April 1st.  IMO this is a hilarious concept all around. They are basically trying to vote in a hard cap. That hard cap will be a "cap" as long as the vote is in favor of that cap. When there is another proposal for a higher cap, or lower cap, or no cap, or whatever, if the majority votes for that approval, "poof!" goes the cap.The cat is out of the bag. The discussion of a hard cap is a complete waste of time. That hard cap will be worth diddly. There is value to both Eth's and Bitcoin's approach to hard forks and implementing change. The value of Eth's approach is that changes/updates can be made fairly easily, which can provide some nifty updates without needing overwhelming consensus. The value of Bitcoin's approach is that when you invest in Bitcoin, you can be pretty sure that the Bitcoin you invested in today will remain the same for the foreseeable future, at least in regards to things like caps on supply. Bitcoin's ledger is actually immutable. That's something the Bitcoin community cares a lot more about than the ETH community. The DAO hardfork made that very clear.I have some ETH but I'll definitely continue investing in the one that isn't going to have every single rule of the system determined by the tyranny of the majority for the foreseeable future. 
1	1522775088	3	I agree with your sentiment about popular vote needn't determine the rules of the chain. But, I disagree with your opinion on hard forks.Miner led hard forks are fine. They are the ones invested long term in making sure the chain has value, the rest of us can dump our coins if we want, and move to any chain we want.I was not following ETH community too closely during the DAO fork but to my knowledge, that was sketchy because majority of miners didn't vote to fork, it was some "yes by default" type of poll, and anyway mining back then was very centralized, moreso than even BTC today.This faux-proposal is only a problem if the miners disagree and it happens anyway. Then, it would be violating ETH consensus rules. Also, it's very lame of Vitalik to half call the proposal a joke. He's either serious, or he's not. He isn't Jon Stuart/Colbert and shouldn't make a controversial suggestion and then if people disagree, say it's a joke.
2	1522775563	4	> Miner led hard forks are fine. They are the ones invested long term in making sure the chain has value, the rest of us can dump our coins if we want.I don't think all hard forks are evil. I think hardforks without an ABSURD amount of consensus from everyone are evil.Miner's aren't in the business of losing money. Miners don't dictate the protocol. If the whole blocksize hardfork fiasco showed anything, it showed that. Jihan effectively controls 60%+ of the hashrate, and is a vocal supporter of a hardfork to increase the blocksize, so why didn't he do that? Because he didn't want to risk his business becoming obsolete in a matter of weeks if the community did not support his hard fork.Bitcoin Cash didn't even have the fucking balls to hard fork without the emergency difficulty adjustment. They couldn't actually trust in PoW and that the community supported their values. They had to have an emergency difficulty adjustment in there because without it, the PoW system would have destroyed their branch of the network within hours, which is how Satoshi designed the system to work."We have SO MUCH consensus for bigger blocks! Everyone in the community wants it! All the miners want it! Anyone saying otherwise was brainwashed by censorship!"Then they go and implement an EDA because in reality, they knew they didn't have enough consensus on this change to keep the network running without that EDA.
2	1522777429	1	Bitcoin is really the only crypto well suited to be used as the long term ledger.  The store of value.  You don't want your decentralized stateless money to have its properties easily changed.This does not mean other crypto can't be useful... I'm just saying they aren't more useful as stateless cash.  They can serve other use cases.
1	1522775014	5	>  When there is another proposal for a higher cap, or lower cap, or no cap, or whatever, if the majority votes for that approval, "poof!" goes the cap.So basically all consensus driven protocols run by free software and node operators ever. Wow what a shocking reveal
2	1522775189	2	Well when the protocols are systems of money and value, it's not quite that simple. This isn't linux. The value injected into both networks come from different ideologies and value systems. Changing supply cap implementation on Bitcoin would be a 100x harder feat than doing it on Ethereum. Do you disagree?
3	1522775362	3	>Well when the protocols are systems of money and value, it's not quite that simple. This isn't linux.It in fact, is. If a majority of nodes changed to blocksize X tomorrow, it would be truth assuming the chain with most nodes or network power is the real one>Changing supply cap implementation on Bitcoin would be a 100x harder feat than doing it on Ethereum. Do you disagree?No, but this do not change the core of my argument. I don't even know why to compare them, it's like to compare gold with oil
4	1522775784	2	> it's like to compare gold with oilAgreed. Kind of my whole point here. In fact that is why I invested in ETH at all. I saw it as "truly not Bitcoin" or "not gold" as you put it. Every other shitcoin, from what I can gather, is basically "fake gold" or "gold 2.0". The radical difference in mindsets of the ETH developers, community, and investors was enough to make ETH something entirely different, and therefore I saw value in it that wasn't already covered with my Bitcoin investment.
5	1522776331	2	Yes some then actually have interesting ideas too, like siacoin or monero 
6	1522776930	0	If those ideas prove valuable or essential, Bitcoin can implement them. The harder feat would be shifting the mindset of the bitcoin community to that of ETH’s.
7	1522777878	2	On the other hand, ETH has already implemented BTC and LTC :P  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ebtcnew/
3	1522776966	2	Indeed it will be harder on bitcoin because, sadly, every technical decision is now driven by politics more than anything... I'm not so sure it's a good thing that bitcoin "will never change" technology does not like to stay the same for so long.. 
4	1522777084	1	It changed. We have Segwit and we also have Bitcoin Cash. It just didn’t change in the same way with the same approach.If blocksize increase hardfork had resounding support, it would have happened. It didn’t have that support. That’s why Bitcoin Cash needed the EDA. That’s why Bitcoin Cash is much less valued. 
1	1522774336	2	> Bitcoin's ledger is actually immutable.So how did we get segwit?
2	1522774530	5	Segwit was a softfork: Backwards compatible, opt-in system. This is precisely why it didn't need a hardfork. Furthermore, immutability of the ledger means "if a transaction occured on the network and was confirmed, nothing will change it." None of a blocksize hardfork, segwit softfork, or ETH hard cap implementation affect immutability. The DAO hardfork was the example that affected immutability.
3	1522776895	0	> None of a blocksize hardfork, segwit softfork, or ETH hard cap implementation affect immutability.It's extremely frustrating that this has to be explained.God damnit people, what the fuck do you think we are trading? Is this shit pixie dust to you all?
4	1522777266	1	The most frustrating part of the 2017 bull run was the influx of new people who were mostly clueless about what they were investing in. Not clueless because they are dumb, just because the technology and the history is pretty complex and they are new to it. It’s hard to have the patience for others to catch up. At least they are paying to play. 
2	1522774632	0	How did segwit change the transactions before?Homework: Read up the meaning if immutable in a dictionary. Spank yourself for failing basic english.
1	1522774949	2	We disagree on a lot. I'd say about 60% of the time we disagree, which I enjoy. On this issue, though, we seem to be in perfect alignment. I started reading hoping to find something to bitch about and I couldn't find anything. A little disappointed, honestly.

0	1522770247	5	Genuinely curious about what people are hearing from our newer retail friends. Are the Chads opening up new shorts here? What's the word on the street?Edit: hmmm the flurry of downvotes leads me to believe many are still short, interesting, and thank you.
1	1522770855	4	I'd generally expect weak-handed shorts opened below $7,000 to be closing between $7,250 and $7,400 and strong-handed shorts to be opening in that same zone. Suicidal yolo longs would also be opening here. It's a bit of no-man's land though.
1	1522770910	2	If this sub is a worthwhile gauge of retail sentiment (and it seems to have been) then the enormity of the flip shouldn't be underestimated. Reading this sub it feels all but inevitable that there will be a shot at ATH resistance.Chad is either liquidated and out of the market entirely or way long right now.
0	1522771647	4	Is it wrong that I want this to go down so I don't have to feel so salty about closing my underwater long at $6500? Had I left it open, I would almost be back even. Instead I lost 60% of my stack. I feel so defeated and discouraged.

0	1522760914	3	Lets take a look at the Bitcoin market versus Bitcoin going into the month of April 2018![You can find the crypto charts here](https://cryptosignals.trade/forums/topic/bitcoin-btc-technical-analysis-april-2018/#post-17198)As we can clearly see, Bitcoin managed to break out of the down trend channel again.Another bullish signal for me (providing we stay above 7000) is the fact that the price action pushed us back above the longer term bullish trend line.The bearish news is that we are still trading in the second down trend channel, the bulls will have to push prices past the near term resistance of around $7600.Consolidation above 7600 will be a healthy recovery.If the buying volume does not show up we will test the shorter term support zones, which in my opinion is around $7000 – $7135.Higher risk traders will be looking to go long or short here depending on which way the price action will swing.Should the bulls fail to defend the 7k zone, get ready for another dip and some more discounts.Feel free to discuss these trade ideas with us in Discord. Safe trades.
0	1522761795	3	Ok I said I wouldn't short below 8.4 or so but the RSI looks quite bad on smaller time frames, trying a scalp here from 7.4 to 7.2 with an eye on the wedge support (if broken I'll add), small position.
1	1522763540	1	Daily RSI is flirting with a break higher. If we don't make a new low, we'll have a nice bullish RSI div. on the daily. I usually end up making worse trades when I change my plans.
2	1522764428	1	Yeah the daily looks quite good, here it's just a scalp I already have a stop at breakeven
1	1522763801	1	I'm still in this trade from when price first hit 7.4, yawn things always take longer than I'd like.
0	1522774108	3	thinking of finally closing my short from 10k, on the other hand i think i'll just FOMO back in and get rekt, the decisions...
1	1522774779	10	Think back to $9.2K, think back to $11.7K. What's objectively changed since then? Nothing really.This run was kicked off by one big whale on Kraken propping $6.4K up. The move up through $7K barrier was fueled by short squeezing.We have simply found a temporary local bottom that lets bigger players re-load their shorts higher up. Market will continue to move down towards $5K (possibly lower) within a few days once this initial euphoria wares off and no big fundamental news arrives to keep the hope train running.If you're an MM/large whale, why dump the market all in one go when you can make more letting it gently float up a bit before bringing the iron fist down again.On the other hand, profit is profit and you'll always have this dilemma whenever you decide to close your short. Since you missed the sub-$7K range to close, maybe set a hard limit at ~$8K and close it then if BTC gets there?
2	1522775225	1	Yeah was thinking about a point where I’ll close it otherwise I’ll just wait , thinking about 7800 we’ll see 
3	1522775457	4	At $7.8K you risk closing at the top of a fake run up. $8.2K I think is closer to when we can start potentially calling this a real recovery.A 25% jump in BTC price from $6.4K gets us to $8K. 25% was the jump we saw from $7.3K to $9.2K last week.
4	1522776001	1	But 8.2 is also where we meet a fairly reliable log resistance line, so that could be closing the top too: https://www.tradingview.com/x/foQV0uAt/
5	1522776232	2	Looking left on the hourly chart at around the $8K to $8.2K level shows me massive order blocks and resistance. I would be amazed if we can penetrate through all of that.And if we can then I will swap to bullish for the medium term and assume we can get up to $9K+ levels.
1	1522774774	2	jeez you wait until now?
2	1522775316	1	Im a long term trader I don’t buy the bottoms or sell the tops I’m the guy who gets in between never losing on a trade but taking much longer to close it, I don’t use high leverage unless rare circumstances 
3	1522775914	1	I can respect that but your timing is unexplainable. Hey profit is profit so if you decide to close it congrats for not closing in the $9ks.
1	1522775251	1	Why now?
0	1522779792	3	It looks like a double bottom with the drop to $6000 in Feb is playing out. If the market can grab on to a bullish sentiment... I think a reasonable target could be another test of the $11K resistance. I'm not too sure about this, but if I were asked to put a timeframe on that, like I like to d with my predictions (here's an example:https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/876bdn/daily_discussion_monday_march_26_2018/dwbpfkm/), I'd say that in a month and a half is when that resistance is tested again. 
1	1522780133	2	Is it Your Intuition or Are You “Into Wishing?”
0	1522762795	5	Closed the part of my short that I opened at 7.4. I think I would rather open it at 7.7. Yeah I'm playing it scared/safe but I don't want to get too greedy here. Low volume rises are scary shit. 
1	1522762882	4	Only reason I'm holding off briefly is that we're overbought on 1hr
2	1522763088	3	Yeah I just saw an opportunity to close that part of my short for profit and took it. Only about 1/3 of my position. Realistically I should close my entire position on a test of 7.2 if it holds but I don't want to miss out on the bottom falling out at any moment. 
3	1522763182	4	first world bear problems
1	1522762964	4	Are they?  Just sell some of the rise.  None of this shit is scary unless you are playing with too much money.
0	1522770260	5	Crazy how it takes 1-2 whales and pushes to turn a bear market to a bull one. Of course this would be dumped after a few weeks but can't risk potentially reducing my core position. 
1	1522770906	20	Crazy how it takes 48 hours to convince people that 4 months of trend has reversed. 
2	1522771451	7	Well, the optimism isn't completely unfounded. The market reclaimed a very important support zone when it broke above $7,250. Although at least so far it's no different than the previous times the market has yolo'd above support-turned-resistance and then given up. $8,300 to $9,900 being the most notable. The market broke below critical support at $9,250 and then bounced back above it. And we all know what happened next.If I had to place odds, I'd say it's a far safer short opportunity than it is a long opportunity. It's just that the r/r is pretty abysmal for a short right now. The r/r for a short does improve substantially, however, if buyers fail to hold support at $7,200 or so.
3	1522773810	1	I personally will not be shorting here unless we make it to $8,500. I feel like we're too much in the middle of the channel rather than the high side of it, and short interest is just too high for me. If we don't get to $8,500 with this rally, I'll just have to wait it out on the sidelines until either it drops far enough that a buying opportunity presents itself or it rallies again at a later date.
4	1522774480	2	This is a very well-reasoned and intelligent approach.Those antsy for sub $6,000 BTC, don't really realize that buying pressure is likely going to increase as price drops not decrease.The risk of shorting anywhere in the $6,000 to $7,000 is already quite high. It gets a little ridiculous below $6,000. Because below $6,000, the bottom could realisticly be anywhere.
2	1522771075	7	Right?! Looking at the 1d is still scaryLike the next hill up on a roller coaster before letting gravity take over
2	1522771644	4	But a trend has to reverse somewhere. What is your timeframe for certifying trend reversal? 96 hours? 96 days? Why?
3	1522772077	4	A break out of an established channel. Trends can reverse all the time on shorter timeframes, but to say the bear market has turned into a bull market can't occur until the downtrend channel from the ATH is broken. It's been attempted numerous times and been rejected every single one. 
2	1522772393	1	Yeah. Personally I’m scared of not being able to buy back if this escalates to 8-9k. And of course a 15% push above resistance means something. 
1	1522771533	3	yeah those annoying whale cartels are everywhere!
0	1522771306	3	72 hrs before everyone here turns bearish and knew all along 6.3 wasn't the bottom. 
1	1522772426	3	If I had to place bets, I'd say there's a 75% chance you are correct and a 25% chance you aren't.
2	1522772966	3	Yeah that sounds right. If 8k holds and we close above it then I will accept defeat and reevaluate my bias. Might even open a long after that.

0	1522735929	3	Funny that still 6K and 3K is mentioned here.I call 8K ---> 11K. Time to recover from its current bear cycle. Also time for Goldman Sachs or other financial institutions entering Crypto.
1	1522738663	6	You're delusional if you expect institutional money to enter here while the stock market is going to the shitters. I'm sure they will advice their clients that it's a good idea to hedge in a speculative market that just crashed from ATH.This is just another bounce on the series of dcb. 7.8k is definitely on the table here but whether we get past the resistance or not is yet to be seen. I wouldn't call the end of the bear market until we get past 70% from previous ath.
1	1522736357	5	After a 4% rise you're calling an end to the bear market?
2	1522736663	9	No, you misunderstood, 2% is end of bear, 4% is where big money comes in.
2	1522736730	5	Ofcourse it's not the end, but the fact that it climbed from 6400$ to 7400$ (seems to be our limit atm) against all the odds is pretty impressive. If you wait for key resistances to be broken before FOMOing in, you risk missing out on alot of gains.
3	1522736956	2	You're advocating FOMOing in on the basis of 7000 to 7400?
3	1522739431	1	It didn't rise "against all of the odds".  There was significant probability that it would do just what it did.  High probability by some calculations.   A glance at the chart suggests a bounce was likely.
2	1522736918	7	No.. need more evidence. Need to stay here - 7K+ for 24 -48 hours. But it looks like it is a start.

2	1522745156	1	Anything north of that is my target entry, as it stands there is too many shorts. The amount of pullback is unacceptable in my opinion, but honestly we are clearly in a downtrend, it would make sense for shorts to reach far greater highs than we have now. Of course there could be a miracle and we break the top macro trend line and skyrocket to 20k again, but I will remain skeptical.
0	1522752814	2	Breaking under 7200 would in all probability end this current upward bump we've had. Seeing how tough 7200 was to break, psychologically as well.. it would sap the confidence of a lot of people to see us break under it. For me right now 7200 is going to determine the next weeks action. Avoid hitting it and rise from where we are right now and attack 7400 in a few hours, that would be great. Slither down now, sit in and around 7200 and fall through it? Fuck city.It's a coin toss for me. Will be shorting should we break under 7150 will go long should we break 7500 but only up to 7800 region.
0	1522773005	2	I took a break (for the most part) this weekend from the charts and overall enjoyed the vacation. Set some aggressively low laddered buys just in case, but didn't catch any knives, which is too bad but not surprising. The bigger issue is that I also didn't come up with a trading plan for what I'd do when we bounced. Psyched myself out yesterday of a long entry on the rebound from $6,9 and am just sitting on my hands right now.The "safe play" seems like it'd be to wait out a bounce off of $7,8, but sentiment in here is very, very bullish and I'm not one to ignore it all the way up. Did that before, and I was very frustrated.Advice? /u/_chewtoy_ /u/haserfauld /u/challis88ocarina 
1	1522773591	5	Do you think we'll see $8,100 before we see $6,800?Because that's more or less the movement we'd need to see to the upside to make a long entry here worth the risk. Personally, I don't see that happening. Opening either a short or a long in the range between $7,250 and $7,450 is probably not a very good idea. However, if you had to pick one of the two, short is less risky. But again, neither are wise.
1	1522773012	3	Oh and /u/sloppysynapses /u/L14dy
2	1522773255	3	I did the same as you. My stops hit at 7250, so I closed my long and I’ve been HODLing since.Thought 6500 might be a good long, but decided to wait it out.At this point I am just looking to short the tops. If it goes up, it should probably come down. If it keeps going, then just have your stops ready.Opening a long here seems insane, but sometimes insane is what you need eh?
1	1522774001	3	I'm with the others as well. Ate a hefty plate of crow with my short, but I do still have a long from just above 6500. I'm waiting on the sidelines for now. If we near 7500, I'm considering opening a small short (equal in size to my long) just under. R/R for a short there is decent. I cannot see us plow through 7800 on one attempt, either, and waiting to short there is even better R/R. But you'd be fighting 75% of the market for that entry. That's everyone's long target close and short target entry. $7460 or $7720 would be my initial leans for short targets, depending whether you'd rather have a good entry that will probably happen or a great entry that may not (for this cycle).Sidelines for me for now. 
2	1522776557	2	I just noticed that if you have a winning long from some ridiculously low price point, you can just open a short for another instrument at any higher price point to manage risk...Holy smokes...
3	1522776713	2	It's pretty nice, right? It's essentially like hedging your cold storage, though, except I don't have any cold storage anymore (unfortunately). That's what I'm trying to build again, though. I'd be thrilled (selfishly) with swinging $2k back and forth under the log line before a new bull market as the next halving approaches. My "accumulation" period is the next year haha. 
0	1522735353	3	Best, or worst, April fools joke ever?
0	1522765080	1	ooops, bears mighty again, some tough resistance at 7.4 :((
1	1522765225	3	Unless 7200 falls we stay in the same channel, not too worrying for the bulls for now.
1	1522765213	2	Not really, the real resistance is at 7.7-7.8. It's just bull weakness if we don't get past 7.4 but it can't be ruled out yet. It took a long time to get past 7.2 after many rejections. 
0	1522765330	2	The hard trade is the right trade: If it is easy to sell, don't; and if it is easy to buy, don't. Do the trade that is hard to do and that which the crowd finds objectionable.
1	1522765959	16	Sounds like selling at the bottom and buying the top to me.
2	1522766486	12	there is a sub for that, it's called /r/ethtrader
2	1522766103	1	Can be.  But considering markets trend longer than they revert it should on balance be “the right trade”.   
3	1522766510	1	What do yo consider "the right trade"
4	1522766631	1	Example:  Let’s say you capitulated and sold near the bottom.  Moments later the price pumps $200 on volume.  The hard trade would be to pay up and buy back, rather than concede and watch as the price runs away.  
5	1522767345	1	Thank, It's a risk and profit opportuniny

0	1522735247	2	Eh still plenty bear here. Shorting
0	1522737978	2	Doesn't look good for bears!
1	1522739319	6	It still looks great for medium term bears.  But no, not looking for 1m chart bears.
0	1522747090	3	Don't happy too soonhttps://imgur.com/a/EMY93
1	1522747255	7	Almost 3% more of profit, of course i'm happy 
0	1522776477	0	Bitcoin bottomed on Feb 6th at $5,861 on GDAX. We will consolidate for a while before the next bull though.
1	1522777234	5	What happened to you being the biggest bear on the planet?
2	1522777624	5	He finally gave in and bought some, and is now changing his tune? 
1	1522776826	3	Ok, I'll allow it.
2	1522777636	4	Woah! Hey, only I have the authority to allow or disallow it!... ^(Yeah, I'll allow it.)
0	1522746049	1	Added to my short at 7.4 but that's the last I'll add. Liq at 9.3. Wont cover unless we breach 8.5 and hold it for a day. Yeah my bar is high, bearish af. 
1	1522747467	3	You said we would go below 6.5 yesterday  dunno about your predictions 
1	1522747289	2	You’re all-in with a liqui at 9300?what entry? what lev ratio?
2	1522755196	1	I always use cross and match half my cold storage when shorting. Average around 7050 now. 
1	1522747958	2	I would have waited for 7.7 if I was you, but 7.4 should be good with those stops.
0	1522766138	1	In the last 4 hours the price hit twice a low of exactly $7,280.90, missing my long limit order by $1.10. It's like they know what my orders are
1	1522766615	5	they always know
1	1522766447	3	use 5 layered order 
1	1522766372	1	Unless you're trying to quick scalp a trade, always set your limit orders several dollars off the mark. 
0	1522767529	1	Kinda new got a question about margin trading.  If I have 2.5 eth and I short 4x for 10eth.  But I hold 2.5 eth, How do I get liquidated???  I have Kraken credit fees, that is why I am wondering.
1	1522768706	2	You get liquidated when the exchange sees that you are at risk of not being able to pay back what you borrowed from them (the 7.5 ETH). For a 4x short, this would occur after a 25% price rise minus maintenance margin. Don't margin trade if you don't know exactly what you are doing, start off with unleveraged trading.
