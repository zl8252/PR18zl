Bitfinex puts the risk on the lenders/themselves (it's not clearly stated whether in case of some disaster the lenders will take the hit or if bitfinex covers the losses, but they have covered in the past afaik)

If the order book cannot handle the sale of your position without you having negative equity, then bitfinex will seize your position (I believe) at a rate such that you have zero equity and will attempt to sell your position over time. This will result in an advantage to you because instead of having negative equity (owing bitfinex money), you have zero equity.
