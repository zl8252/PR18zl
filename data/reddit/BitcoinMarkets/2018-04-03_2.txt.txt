0	1522765735	7	5 cents per share?  Does this correlate with market price of btc gold?
1	1522767732	2	Don't forget their recent ish share spilt. 
1	1522770119	2	At the moment there's about $7 worth of BTC per $11.20 share.So this price is quite fair, yes.
0	1522771876	5	My enitre Roth IRA is in GBTC.  Am I dumb?
1	1522773230	5	Time will tell. But I jumped about 15 years of growth in the last 12 months by dumping my Roth in it.
1	1522772664	1	Only if you didn’t sell at the peak and rebuy and when BTC hit 6k
2	1522775063	2	That's actually my saddest crypto blunder.  I was trying to sell all my GBTC at $3100 at 1pm PST and the price was fluctuating between 3100-3200, put my sell order in, it didn't go sell for some reason, then the market closed at $3050 and it dropped heavily after.  I was so used to instant trades on GDAX or Binance, I guess Vanguard takes a while?  Anyways, still haven't sold, real bummed. 
3	1522780107	1	No, not due to Vanguard. GBTC is over-the-counter or pink sheet. So, the market for it is not as liquid as other stocks or crypto.
0	1522772339	2	The average sale price is around $50...which is pretty bad in my opinion.

1	1522778742	1	Well, you can easily sell 10 BTG at market price, but where can you find the liquidity to sell 172k BTG?Look at this crap: https://imgur.com/a/Gqt7A
0	1522774342	2	Smart.  It’s horseshit
0	1522775167	1	Buying this in an ira is a good idea.
0	1522766492	1	Thats not a lot but Ill take it!
