Altcoins much more so. You could even go so far as to call the altcoin space a glorified casino. Nothing wrong with that, it's just what the market decided.However, what will happen when financial disaster strikes?I seriously doubt people will sell stocks to invest in monacoin, so I for one am convinced the altcoin space will be toast.But what if after the market crash or along with it, banking problems resurface? What if people will fear a big monetary reset? This will ultimately be the #1 test for bitcoin.On the one hand, the risk-off climate would be so grim that I seriously doubt people will want to touch altcoins... but bitcoin? I think this might be precisely the type of climate in which it will thrive.It's used by millions of people all over the world and even if there is much to be done adoption-wise, it's still WIDELY used compared to altcoins which literally have zero real world uses other than being pump and dump schemes... low fees, amirite? :)So it's widely used.Nobody can declare a bank holiday on bitcoin.Nobody can close your account.I think people grossly underestimate just how much these things will count if (or rather when) the next financial crisis will be in full swing.

Now many of them cannot show results, so it makes sense that a lot of them get flushed out except for those who can still really stand out (eg Monero being the only one that is completely anon/untrack/fungible/trustless, and things like that).I think this year the crowded top 30 market cap will thin out considerably and leave maybe 10 currencies at the top and then a huge gap until the rest follows. Bitcoin will probably eat most of their their market dominance share.

0	1522768168	1	It should be noted that bitcoin dominance will always be more probable during a bear market due to the flight to safety effect that occurs **within** the cryptosphere. I wrote [an article](https://medium.com/@MC_Ross1001/why-increasing-bitcoin-dominance-is-no-good-thing-7a21a6f9110e) a few months back bemoaning increasing bitcoin dominance, the inference being that increasing BTC dominance is evidence of a bear market
