1	1522828801	27	i am already dead inside surviving 2014 bear market
2	1522836257	3	That bear was a beast! Thankfully in the past. 
2	1522863018	1	lol. that bear was one of the best things that ever happened to me. So painful. So many lessons. That bear market ripped apart my surface life and all that was left was a deep faith in bitcoin as a revolutionary force. Ride or die. A rebirth courtesy of the bear whale, that moment when the money didn't matter any more - give me revolution or give me death. 
0	1522824881	30	100k isn't worth dying over
0	1522825897	24	Losing millions in funky fiat money equivalents is just the new normal. Most old time Bitcoiners got used to it and keep on living.
0	1522832975	10	does it count to be dead inside?
1	1522847113	2	Just embrace your inner zombie.
1	1522856283	2	'The tragedy of life, is what dies inside a man, while he lives...'
0	1522834800	12	Most cryptoers are not midlife, 90% are probably millennials. If this shit fucks us, we have the rest of our lives to recover.
1	1522836742	-7	Millennials thinking they have any real shot at wealth comparable to their parents and grandparents with the current housing market and same wages = top kek Disney movie.
2	1522853123	1	The housing market will crash from the simple fact that there will be no buyers. Or we slip into oppressive feudalism as all real estate property is bought up and we're forced to pay outlandish rents.
3	1522853932	3	/u/rocksodr made one of the dumbest fucking comments I have ever seen on reddit, and I don't say that lightly. But you're giving him a run for his money. 
4	1522863118	1	Thanks bud. Care to address what I've said that is so stupid? I'd be happy to elaborate.
3	1522859224	1	there are plenty of buyers now.. that theory you're suggesting is complete bullshitWe are in a global economy. Any city actually worth living in, there are rich immigrants who's family net worth you will never even come close to touching who want to live in places like NY, california, TX, Canada, etc. Nobody cares that wages are low in north america and regular folks cant afford houses.There's blood money coming in from all over the world 
3	1522854243	-1	Yeah maybe the housing market will crash in your redneck remote town with zero services and goods. Anywhere else, big towns and attractive places it's not gonna budge. Been 30 years people are waiting, it's still going up over where I live.
4	1522862932	1	The housing market in big cities absolutely crashed in 2008. In fact, big cities suffered more than rural areas on average. So your point is pretty much worthless and nonsensical.Also, just to shut up your overtly pretentious and pathetically elitist attitude, I don't live in "redneck" rural area. I'm just not so severely deluded into believing that where I live makes me fundamentally superior and deserving above others. You have some serious self reflection to do. The increases in your area are most likely due to the re-inflated real estate bubble. Not your pure genius. Learn that fact now, or learn it the hard way later.
5	1522864713	1	Where I live prices are 2 time higher than 2008 low that about 80% at the lower price compared to before 2008. So please stfu retarded millennial lol. Hope you have a good inheritance cause that's the only shot you've got.
0	1522818208	6	Not even that much money to lose......
1	1522825206	3	still a networth thing. 
0	1522818682	4	I've watched two grown men lose their entire lifestyle in the past couple of years.It really isn't pretty.
1	1522824536	3	Due to bad crypto investing?
2	1522826192	6	sold the wife to buy more crypto. now has none :(
3	1522843133	0	> sold the wifewut, i don't think you can buy and sell those
4	1522855225	4	Blockchain makes it possible! 
2	1522826965	2	No, but they still lost their asses and got dangerously depressed.
3	1522857205	1	Did they lose their assets or their asses? What caused the turn?
0	1522833500	15	It's probably different if you spent a long time accumulating your wealth through a traditional job or career. When you buy your BTC at $100 and watch it go up to $20k, and then down to $7k, it's not so psychologically stressful.
1	1522833943	6	Mhmm. I bought btc at 250-350$ still hodling. But I ain't dead yet xD
1	1522843198	2	> When you buy your BTC at $100 and watch it go up to $20k, and then down to $7k, it's not so psychologically stressful.Can vouch.
1	1522855229	2	What percentage of current holders do you think bought at $100? I'm willing to bet very few. The vast majority of holders are probably underwater.
0	1522834911	3	Dead inside. Does that count?
0	1522835649	3	Just HODL. That goes for your life too.
1	1522854565	2	I'm still holding even tho lost most of the money I invested 
0	1522842878	3	No, wealth shock doesn't *lead to* death, it is *correlated with* death.The study says absolutely nothing about which causes the other.  Being diagnosed with a terminal illness frequently causes people to quite deliberately "shock" their wealth on purpose by spending it on medical treatment no matter how expensive.  **The study deliberately looked only at people aged 55-65.**You can't take it with you and not everbody has children.  Those who do might even try to "make their last check bounce" by going into debt on purpose, using the borrowed money to give non-reposessable gifts (tuition, for example) to their kids.  Or their kids might be better off financially and prefer a roll-of-the-dice chance at a few more months with their parents than an inheritance.This study is not profound.  The most likely explanation of the data is not news to anybody.
1	1522843983	1	https://xkcd.com/552/
0	1522847646	2	so basically when you get the kids college tuition bills.
0	1522842201	1	Try a loss of $100,000 in 24 hours.Get real faggets.
1	1522843277	1	get a spellchecker, numbskull
2	1522864232	1	Learn to capitalize your sentences, Shafty!
0	1522845106	1	Yes I can agree with this. My heart quite literally hurt yesterday. 
0	1522848214	1	I'd like to see them control for people who generated their own income and those who accepted income in exchange for labor. Very interesting though.
0	1522856801	1	lol 100k, what peasants
0	1522863328	1	I think this is more tied to ppl going bankrupt
