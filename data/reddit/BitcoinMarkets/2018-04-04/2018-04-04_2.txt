This is to be expected though especially when many of the people who have become millionaires over night are young, arrogant and believe they are now the greatest angel investors/traders. The communities will probably remain toxic for the foreseeable future, just try to ignore people.
0	1522809728	5	There is something about the anonymity mixed with the emotions relating to the financial swings that seems to bring out the absolute worst in people.
0	1522805068	11	There's a distinct culture that we try to cultivate here. It looks like you haven't participated in it much. Hang around and get a sense of the place.Install RES to help you keep track of people. There are all kinds of people. You'll learn who you like to talk with and who you don't. RES puts you on the path because you can take notes.Read for a while and get a sense of who is who; take some time to learn your audience before you post. I hold back saying some things because I know they will trigger a portion of this sub, or any sub for that matter.Short book recommendation:https://www.amazon.com/Demagoguery-Democracy-Patricia-Roberts-Miller/dp/1615194088Culturally, I think westerners are more conflict prone than might be healthy. I've come to expect that encampments of people who are culturally western have a hard time getting along with people they disagree with. I don't think it's just a trading thing. There's a real cultural shift.
1	1522828301	3	Interesting perspective about Westerners. Since I was not exposed much to any other culture, how do you see them dealing with situations/people that don't agree with them?
2	1522844464	1	The book I suggested is very short; maybe a chapter. The author states it better than I can.
3	1522853274	2	thank you for the book reccomendation and advice. I am going to look into it. 
0	1522805500	7	I agree with OP. Community would do well to get laid, or grow up. 
1	1522810949	7	Sex for EVERYONE  !!!!!
2	1522813078	4	How do I short this

0	1522813877	1	This absolutely describes the problems surround exchanges and trading communities. &nbsp;Funnily enough this one of the major reasons why we have decided to build a crypto peer-to-peer exchange that revolves around community integration. &nbsp;I recommend that if anyone is looking to get involved in a crypto trading community with everyone's best interests - check out LocalCoinSwap.com
1	1522853229	1	> LocalCoinSwap.comI will check that out - thank you sir. 
0	1522821794	1	I think it's a generational change, we're shifted further away from interest of others to more self interest. If you were imagine these variables polarized on an axis we've become skewed for self-interest. morality and how to treat other people is less important in 2018 and that's partly to do with the nature of online relationships having low value, but also just generally as tribes grow bigger there is less need for others. Same thing happens in big cities vs country towns. Combine that with the first generation arguable that has largely moved away from religion the moral code of how to interact with others has moved.  There are also just a shit load of angry people out there, who can shed wrath on others with very little social detriment that you would expect in a normal community. For mindset just remember that most shitty comments are coming from people who are in pain and they are trying to shed that pain onto other people.
0	1522822813	1	If everyone worked together to trade no one would make any money. For every trade you win there is a loser on the other side. This is a dog eat dog game I do not understand why you would expect cooperation and teamwork in this space.If you really believe Bitcoin/crypto is the future of money you might understand why this market is so cutthroat.
0	1522827767	1	What do you exactly mean by bitcoin spreads? Futures contract spreads on the CME/CBOE?
1	1522831575	1	Difference between bid and ask
2	1522843466	1	so, the OP is talking about market making? I am confused...
0	1522815601	0	Reddit is pointless for bitcoin trading, theres only newbs in it with no understanding of the market. Only relevant stuff is on twitter, some tradingview and a few rare telegram groups, whatsapp/facebook groups and reddit is populated by people who bought a few coins in 2017, made a few k at the most and now believe they are the gordon gekko of cryptoTruth is most people have no idea how to trade this market, and I think its pointless to follow the masses, so dont waste time on reddit and focus on your charting skills
1	1522825171	2	OP:> shitting on everything or just explaining how no one but them know anythingYou:> Reddit is pointless for bitcoin trading, theres only newbs in it with no understanding of the market. lol.ðŸ˜ƒ
1	1522824265	1	Which twitter, tradingview, and telegram groups would you recommend?
0	1522828629	-1	Yep, you are right OP.Those terrible comments and idiots all around, are because of this crazy 2017 pump year. It was probably peak of this cycle and peak in most of the markets, so they were full of themselves, and how good they are because everyone was gaining and nothing was losing. It was clearly sick situation and I hope this year will be a year to wipe these fools from markets, like 2009 was.
