1	1522842217	4	Ask him when Midas?
1	1522843304	5	When those 160k bitcoin get redistributed through the market...
2	1522844953	1	Perhaps the most fair method would be proof of burn
0	1522862387	14	You know the market is all messed up with Centra which was exposed as a scam by SEC and founders arrested is up 80%+ today
1	1522862672	6	Good lord, if it wasn't for my looking I wouldn't of believed you.
1	1522862503	2	Same happened with Bitconnect, textbook dead cat bounce and some pump groups of course
1	1522864137	2	not a bubble™
0	1522819563	50	Anybody else here thinks no one knows what they're talking about anymore?
1	1522820486	21	im still sure that in the long term bitcoin will surpass its ATH.
2	1522852949	1	The only true bull sentiment
1	1522820315	3	anymore? 
2	1522820673	3	nevermore!
3	1522821844	1	 I sense the proximity of souls…
1	1522826089	3	I have thought this from the first day I ventured into this sub and have been vocal to that effect.
1	1522827171	5	Yep, not a clue anymore.
1	1522820404	4	Once this action has resolved (couple of weeks?) then we will all suddenly realise how right we were back on that one day we said that one thing about what the price would do next.
2	1522820917	6	are you trying to say the next couple weeks are critical?
2	1522820609	1	that's the gist of it. nicely put
1	1522820413	2	Maybe? I don't know. 
1	1522820079	1	When we go sideways it’s anyone’s guess, current price action inspires little confidence from either side.
1	1522825719	1	Is the new version of first? Or a way to grab some karma points? Almost the same exact comment was second highest upvoted yesterday in this thread. Original content is appreciated much more than regurgitating content that is an already known common sentiment. Maybe propose a solution while you’re at it?
0	1522853421	19	Not going to speculate on whether this will continue to decline or reverse here.What I will say, however, is that the complete and utter lack of buying pressure is staggering.It really does appear that absolutely nobody is interested in buying bitcoin at these levels. And certainly not in the $7,000 to $8,000 range.If $6,800 falls, I could very easily see this breaking $6,000 today.
1	1522853790	3	Agreed. Are you planning to re-enter your hedge short if $6,800 falls?
2	1522853897	3	Perhaps. Although more likely I'll wait until $6,000 falls.
1	1522853585	2	> I could very easily see this breaking $6,000 today.@_@ Yes please.
2	1522853649	3	Lets get it over with. Fuck it go down to 1k
1	1522853740	2	Why buy at 7 if you can buy at 5? ;-)We're oversold. There should be some kind of bounce here...
2	1522854021	7	While it's true that the 3m through the 1h are oversold, the 4h-1d are still well above 30.While I don't think the market will push down through $6,800 right here and now, anything beyond a tepid bounce back to $7,100 is more or less out of the question in my humble opinion.
3	1522854106	2	Agreed, that's why I wrote 'some kind of bounce'.But 7k was good support, don't think it'll be broken just to go back down.
2	1522853840	2	Are we? 4 hour RSI is in the 40's plenty of room here to go down.
3	1522853915	2	Smaller time frames.Trend is down, RSI won't stop the drop but it should at least point out small bounces.
1	1522853756	2	If it reverses here volume will be even more tepid. Who will trust the whales pump now? That pool of guppies is dwindling. 
1	1522854429	2	It looks like this may have more room to run on the 4 hour, and the MACD looks like it may be about to flip. Thoughts?https://imgur.com/yTxAJIe
2	1522854947	5	Honestly, I'm off the opinion that buyers are fucked. But we'll see. 
0	1522843540	11	I think this downward pressure may have more to do with what the stock market likely going town today. I have no evidence to support this, just a hunch. 
1	1522843608	6	When the stock markets reaches goblin town,All of Crypto must be going down
0	1522855057	10	https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89o16y/im_mark_karpel%C3%A8s_exceo_of_bankrupt_mtgox_ask_me/Interesting.  Have people seen this?>I don't want this. I don't want this billion dollars. From day one I never expected to receive anything from this bankruptcy. The fact that today this is a possibility is an aberration and I believe it is my responsibility to make sure it doesn’t happen. **One of the ways to do this would be civil rehabilitation, and as it seems most creditors agree with this, I am doing my best to help make it happen.** I do not want to become instantly rich. I do not ask for forgiveness. I just want to see this end as soon as possible with everyone receiving their share of what they had on MtGox so everyone, myself included, can get some closure.Most important part of his letter. This would mean the original owners of the bitcoins would get them and Mt. Gox Trustee would not have anymore to sell, nor would they all be under Karpeles' control.
1	1522855582	10	The cynic in me sees this as him not wanting a hitman after him....considering what he has done to ruin people financially, it wouldn’t be hard to imagine that his life would be in real danger once he is released .
1	1522855257	4	Days before closing down:> Your coins are safeFool me once...
1	1522855332	5	> I don't want this billion dollars.Said nobody ever.He's either a saint or he's bullshitting.
2	1522855710	2	He know people are going after him, he is just doing everything to save his fat ass.
1	1522855452	2	The coins are being sold. He's hoping he can go through rehabilitation so he doesn't have to.
0	1522844615	26	My top tip of the day: the last 20 posts or so are wrong(Taken from my upcoming book “how to make friends online”)
1	1522847867	1	Please make a Kindle version.
0	1522837811	10	Dragged down by european markets and DJ futures today? Showing -1.5%This quote comes to mind :D > Trade wars are good and easy to winIf 7k holds today I will look for a new long entry
0	1522852867	10	Target Rising wedge met. I expect a a bounce to at least 70xx-72xx anytime soon.
1	1522853491	3	I admire your optimism.
0	1522861292	8	anyone else has received message from https://www.reddit.com/user/jmoore6786 ?
1	1522861512	8	No :( I feel left out.
1	1522861519	6	I was nice enough to answer ;)
1	1522861519	4	Yes, reported it.
2	1522862308	3	Me too.
0	1522835678	17	I quit margin trading last week because I'm not very good at it, don't really have time for it,  and get married to my positions / go on tilt too easily. Finding entries is easy, picking exits not so much.I decided to buy a HODL / cold storage stack. Spent 50% of my fiat at 6.8k, now I'm just waiting for a visit to sub-6k to buy in with the rest. I think we're in for a much longer chop / slow bleed at these levels than most peoole seem to think. It seems sentiment has turned bullish far too easily.The hard part is deciding where to start buying on the way up if it turns out I'm wrong. TLDR; I quit margin trading, but DCA is equally difficult to judge when acquiring a HODL stack.
1	1522836259	1	Are you planning to do smaller chunks with your next buys or unload the rest at once?
2	1522836975	1	Probably going to split it into 2. One at around 6k, the other waiting for a convincing enough bounce, or a breakdown from 6k.
1	1522837499	1	Same thing here. 25% left of my fiat to get in when we go sub 6k (target at 5.7-5.8)Long term this is a verry good price
0	1522837876	8	bitmex fills me 30 seconds after clicking market order.. so late that i clicked another.. then i try to get out and i end up getting whispawed against my will to try to EVEN my position.. BITMEX SUCKS! total incompetance that they cant provide solid interface.
1	1522838068	3	At least it fills you, I usually get the famous System overload those days
2	1522838419	3	Closing positions via market order is prioritized against other orders, so they usually fill.
3	1522838793	2	seems like it'd be smart then to hedge a position on swaps with futs and close whichever one you don't want open when you finally *do* want to open a trade
4	1522845079	2	Or have separate accounts, one for longs other for shorts. Genius
2	1522838509	2	At least? if you click again thinking it was 'overload' then guess what you end up getting in with amounts you didn't bargain for. this is WORSE than overload cause then you have to try to BALANCE it and that effort is on a delay. This is not professional at all. And these guys came from the banking industry LOL.
3	1522838736	2	You didn't wait for confirmation and clicked again. They show error as soon as you do market order, if it's not shown then you're in queue and it's gonna execute.
4	1522839312	2	Good point but IM using API so i will have to recode that very check in i.e. PRogram around the network INSTABILITY.
5	1522839514	2	So you're using API, send order and don't read server reply before going further? That's bad coding...
6	1522839713	1	Yeah I know was a bit 'rushed' as I had other techniques of verification but they were not instant like reading the reply. Plus I'm not sure of it immediately returns error on market order.. I will dig into it.    Edit.. yep i see the sys overloaded msg come back ok still in the end it doesnt change much, too unstable.
7	1522839869	1	On web it returns immediately when it's overloaded, it takes time if it goes into a queue and gonna execute.I know they're overloaded, but they did their best to minimize damage done by it.
2	1522838426	1	Is this just on the web interface or also on the API as well?
1	1522838552	3	Im having a crazy deja vú from all "The Krakening" during Q2-Q4 last year
1	1522838333	5	simple solution: change the plattform!
2	1522839401	2	I use Finex too maybe I will revisit using that platform more, seeing that the tether scare was more fear mongering by the youknowwhos here.
3	1522840229	5	Bitfinex lost $72 million of customer fund and never explained what happens.   Yes they seem very trustworthy, so use them.
1	1522841206	2	fyi, some traders time breakouts based on bitmex servers overload/latency
1	1522839204	1	use limit orders next time
2	1522839493	2	I do on 'at least' one side of the trade but it doesn't fit my trading algo to make the market all the time.
0	1522846540	7	There was one thing preventing me from entering a long and that was a descending triangle but we just bumped up past the previous high invalidating a descending triangle. I've put staggered buys down to 7k now but they are low leverage. If we start heading back up I'll add more at 7.2 and if we break below I'll sell for a small loss.
0	1522842068	16	Feeling good about BTC as it continues to hold up well above support of 5800.
1	1522847692	1	I agree very bullish.
0	1522825058	12	Closed my short for a small gain at $7,350 and entered a long at the same price point. $7,250 held. Will exit if it breaks. Edit: exited at $7,200 for a small loss. Why do I trade at 3:00 in the morning?
1	1522825219	4	Indeed. good to see we are holding the 7k  -7.3K area.3 day chartLets see.
1	1522825124	3	target price 7.5k or 7.8k?
2	1522825612	2	No targets yet. We'll see how the market contends with those areas if it gets there.
1	1522829502	3	On the 2h, could it be a potencial H&S?A little tilted to the right. Shoulders around 7400, head 7500, neckline 7250?I'm usually wrong on my predictions, just wanting to learn. 
1	1522837682	1	That entry wasn't so stupid for 3 in the morning.4k btc sold in 1h in 3 market orders was a bit unexpected.
1	1522845238	1	Noooo. Don't close shorts at 3am in bear markets man. Let the bulls earn your BTC by feeding you fiat. It's the ideal mentality in these conditions. 
0	1522851876	7	https://twitter.com/BitmexRektOver ~ 15 million liquidated in a few minutes. It is insane how over leveraged the Market is. This one had to hurt:>Liquidated long on XBTUSD: Sell 5,438,618 @ 6848
1	1522852230	7	I was told there would be an epic short squeeze
2	1522852423	5	And i was told the rise was organic. So organic that people thanked the Kraken whale for saving us. 
3	1522852569	2	But when sell walls are put up, it's "dirty tricks"
2	1522853021	1	Maybe they meant an epic long squeeze?
0	1522848175	13	Well I bought the dip at $7040. Is now when I start trying to persuade everyone that the “bottom is in” and come up with some other shitposting so that they will do the same ? /sDisclaimer: I did buy at $7040, 25% of stack. 
0	1522855858	15	Since I emptied my Bitmex account and quit margin trading, it's like I have a crystal ball.It's so much easier calling market movements when you have no financial interest in it. 
1	1522856074	14	Well don't hold back Merlin!
1	1522856047	8	What happens next? :)
1	1522857933	5	I wonder if you'd have the same feeling doing paper trades, still with no money on the line.  It's easy to just say generally where things will go, it's harder to actually hit the timing on entrances and exits.But yeah, once you put money on there, the fakeouts etc can really throw things off in how you manage the position.
1	1522856176	5	Crystal ball, eh? Username checks out. 
1	1522856198	3	Bu all means, do share your current predictions if that’s the case.
2	1522856802	3	Another drop to ~ $6.6k before the day is finished. A brief dip/wick below 6k by the end of the weekend before a short-lived FOMO bounce.*we were hovering around 6.9 at the time I typed this comment.
0	1522864668	10	I was debating scalping a long here with stops below $6,700...but the r/r profile is incredibly weak despite the fact that RSI is laughably low on medium timeframes. Mostly because the upside target is just as laughable. Even $7,000 seems incredibly optimistic for a technical bounce off of $6,800. But ya, the market *should* bounce in the not too distant future. EDIT: Translation: nobody wants to "buy" here, necessarily. They're just tired of selling. 
1	1522865012	6	It’s insane how weak the upwards price action got...But every now and then, Bitcoin does surprise
2	1522865113	3	And the funny thing is that a lot of shorts closed and longs opened on that drop.
1	1522865055	3	I keep waiting for a pump out of nowhere to at least propel this up to 6950 and grace 7k. But man the buying has just been absolutely anemic in this 8% drop. Any rises we get are just from bears getting tired of selling and being patient for better short entries.
2	1522865362	5	Well, do you want to buy here? Would you recommend to anybody else that they buy here? The market is pretty dumb, but it isn't *that* dumb. This is the 3rd significant bounce since $11,700 that's reclaimed a significant support zone and then immediately conceded it back to sellers. I can speak from experience (because I've been fooled by all of them) that I have absolutely no desire to long bitcoin right now.
0	1522818697	5	Bullish scenario:https://www.tradingview.com/x/tGNgkmge/There is bullish channel, from which we may continue last days upward movement. In this scenario, we have to breach that bearish channel, after which we may consolidate near SMA50 levels, which is $7800-8000 level. Bearish scenariohttps://www.tradingview.com/x/3ovqkeN2/On the other hand, from daily timeframe we can see that we reached resistance line on RSI and abovementioned downward channel upper line. This may bring us to sub 7k levels in day or two.Good luck. 
1	1522820587	3	Yeah don’t like that big red candle heading down to that lower support line. It didn’t get there in early March but looks like it will this time - and the likely thing is a breakout downwards I think. But I agree it will then come back up and prolly be supported sideways at 7.5-8K for a few months. Interesting. Thank you - and good luck to you in your trading and hodling or tethering or fiating too! And there’s a word coined too - or maybe I should have called it “FAITING” . Definition for when it makes the Oxford Dictionary - vęrb: ‘The sometimes sensible course of going back to Govt backed money, or what can happen with panic selling and weak hands, or a thing that inspires guilt and is hidden from fellow cryptorians - as in “you didn’t fait did you?” haha
1	1522819120	2	This is getting interesting.
0	1522837739	4	So far so good. I'll be opening a long if it holds for a few more hours or if 7.2k breaks first. 
1	1522838144	2	so good!

0	1522863326	6	Taking profits from my shorts opened at 7k yesterday that got stuck underwater and leaving the ones opened at 7.3-7.4. Think there's a solid chance we could make a tiny bounce up to as much as 7 or 7.1, where I'll be adding them back, or putting them back in under 6.7.
0	1522860143	9	1h oversold and a green tall  1h after some serious REKTosaurus on Bitmex, and in just the range for the move beginning a few days ago. This makes it enough for me to long from 6840 with stops below 6700 https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZRzedKa8Also my favorite long term indicator moving average(9,26) turned to the upside on 6h which makes me think if this is not a "fake" one like the one at 9.3k his could be the beginning of a nice move up mid term
1	1522860458	2	Well nobody can fault you for not being bold.The 1hr green has paltry volume though.
2	1522860682	3	Breakout trades or bottom pickers is a bit of my trading style, or shorting obvious super tops. If it turns the other way, then I just take my loss and wait for better times
0	1522852241	9	Placing the recent advance start at 6.4k and end at 7.5k, any retrace back to 6833 (61.8%) is still valid. It wouldn't be failure unless it closes below 6.8k. EVEN THEN, a crash back to 6.4k or less would just make BTC oversold on every time interval and trigger mass buying again, bringing us probably back to 7k or higher. So idk what either bulls or bears are getting excited about, there's not enough buying/selling pressure to push above 7.5k or below 6.4k. We are in no man's land.
1	1522852623	2	> EVEN THEN, a crash back to 6.4k or less would just make BTC oversold on every time interval and trigger mass buying again, bringing us probably back to 7k or higher.If there was new money coming in, maybe. But so many permabulls got rekt the last few weeks, how deep are their pockets?
2	1522853194	1	Say someone got rekt on the way down and cashed out at a loss. The gambler mentality (which let’s be obvious, is pretty rampant in crypto) is to try and make it back. And it wouldn’t even be that hard, just find better entry/exit point, e.g., buy when it’s oversold then sell when it’s overbought. Just look at this most recent run, buy at 6400 then sell at 7500. You’re already making back some of the losses. Rinse and repeat. You don’t need new money, just need the existing capital not to quit the game and exit. 
1	1522852594	1	Is it a usual to have a reversal pattern that has a bottom which chops in a range, instead of a "V" sharp reversal?
0	1522859586	7	I'm normally just lurking, but my trades recently are so bad I feel like sharing. fomo'ed in at 7503 yesterday, expecting run to 7800. Sold at 6775 just now, expecting 6400.
1	1522860454	6	The idea is to do the exact opposite of what fees right.You buy when you expect lower and sell when you expect higher
0	1522862001	7	Don't be fooled, you must not have seen the [latest bearish TA](https://i.imgur.com/q171DHv.jpg)jk, I'm a bull!
0	1522833834	3	5-6 AM Eastern Time like clockwork
1	1522833912	1	ikr, was ready for it
0	1522834323	3	Had added to my underwater short at 7400 and again at 7300 bringing CA up to 7200 from 7k, just added more onto it. 6.8 to 7.1 has shown to play as support and resistance recently, we'll see how bulls react to a significant punch to their efforts.
0	1522851920	4	I’m starting to think more there is a correlation between crypto and stocks. China announced the tariff stuff and we dropped like a rock.
1	1522852025	16	We were dropping long before the stocks dove, months before, and we've had many individual red days on Dow green days and vice versaThat said it's almost definitely not helping
2	1522852091	2	It doesn’t mean that it’s perfectly aligned but just roughly correlated.
0	1522857913	2	Looking like a classic breach and then recover of support imo, but we'll see. SL around 6.7 seems like decent R/R given how oversold we are here. Edit: Oversold on shorter time frames and should be decent support here at 6.8 - kinda expecting some chop between 6.8 and 7 for a bit
0	1522835375	12	Massive sells are biting, volume very frightening.

3	1522836937	4	This coin has made people lose their minds! Though maybe this Forum needs all comments to be written in song! Crypto the musical!
4	1522837062	5	Life is one big orchestra. It sings to you and you need to sing along with it or drown in the noise :)
2	1522836671	6	He's just a moonboy, FOMO in for meeee...for meeeeeee....
0	1522831971	8	Was long from 6.7 to 7.3, but to be honest I was a bit skeptic of the whole breakout. Just compare it to the previous fall to 6k on Feb 6th, its clear that the volume is very low. I believe that we'll hit 5-5.5k first, then possibly 9k in a few weeks.

1	1522847053	2	Ain't nobody going to put their money where their mouth is when it's Tether related.
2	1522848300	1	Nor would they have to.
1	1522847111	2	If tether really is a scam, CoinEx will be unaffected? Will they pay you?
2	1522847975	2	I think you need to hold a counter contract with someone else. So it’s zero sum. One of you wins and one loses.However, that’s a good point. Considering futures crashed on some volatility, could they cope if Tether went to zero.
3	1522851608	1	I doubt they can, and that's why I'd never trust this bet.  
2	1522847929	1	> CoinEx will be unaffectedRead the terms, Coinex does not take any risks, so yes, they would be unaffected if Tether collapses.
2	1522849938	1	great question, if tether is a scam, i think our whole space would be affected, exit scam left and right
1	1522852374	1	of course Bitfinexed won't do anything, he'll claim it is rigged or untrustworthy or something.  Easier to sit on the sidelines and complain endlessly.
0	1522851655	7	Honestly at this point I just don't care, trading this has been brutal. Gonna just put what I have in cold storage, wont be putting fresh fiat in until 0 hope left
0	1522843948	7	I hate to say it, but I’m seeing another H&S forming on the 1hrNeck line at 7k... this is make or break. 7k must hold
1	1522844351	7	Its already weak, failing to defend 7.3k was bad.Close my 2x long from 7k at 7.3k after hearing the trump china import shit.Back to fiat will take a break from trading and enjoy the nice gains.

4	1522845957	6	He has arms, thats why.
1	1522844550	4	If you can call it a h&s then 7250 was a neckline and target was at 7k.I don't know how you see neckline at 7k?
0	1522863595	10	Added more to my short at 6870. Significant consolidation/cool-off period without breaking 6900 or even attempting 7K. Added as much as I could to keep CA above 7K, currently $7030. Not planning to add more until we break 6700 and hold below it. At this stage, there is still potential for a bounce over $7K, but I'm not really expecting it. The velocity with which we moved from 7100 to 6800 didn't really give adequate time for that many shorts to open in the 6900s. Most newer shorts at this stage are probably either >$7K or <$6900. On the other hand, this downtrend line is STUPID steep. To confidently short, we need slower movements and better bounces, or else we'll end up with a very tight descending wedge.https://www.tradingview.com/x/2SiQyr4s/Good luck all. 
1	1522864745	4	I like your analysis of shorts not being able to open shorts at ~6900It could explain why 6900 is acting as resistance 
1	1522864525	2	I'd add that everybody is already looking at 6400 and thinking about the new low, so it would be very hard for the price to stop here. 
0	1522858729	11	People that keep screaming "go down to 2k / 1k / 500 / 1", do you not realise how retarded you sound? You want it to go down to that level to buy more cause you think it will bounce right back, but why the fuck would it bounce right back? If people see it go down to 500 they will assume something is fundamentaly fucked up and will not trust it for years to come or even ever again. You would be the definition of a bagholder.
1	1522858876	6	Dropping to $1,000 would be relatively harmless as far as the long-term health of bitcoin is concerned. Dropping to $500, however, would be a pretty big problem.
2	1522859108	3	why $500? I see the lowest possible point at $1200 (previous bubble peak). If it goes below that, BTC can probably be declared dead
3	1522859237	4	Well, $1,200 would be the absolute lowest point at which I'd expect the market to bottom out. However, I wouldn't be surprised if overzealous sellers made it as far as $1,000.Below $1,000 though, and one would have to wonder whether the market could ever recover.
2	1522859646	3	I doubt price would drop to $1k. Maybe $2k min. Which would be a great time to accumulate, especially for anyone who sold near the top.
1	1522859457	4	$2k would be a good level to buy. I wouldn't care if it takes a year to get going again. Did the same at $200.
1	1522861433	3	Goddammit cut the crap.Bubble pop in 2014 from 1163 usd to 152 usd bottom was a decrease of 86.9%A drop from 19666 usd to 2000 usd would be a 89.8% decrease.2600 would be a 86.7% decrease.So stop the bullshit and stop acting 2k is impossible and the people calling for it are crazy, it has happened before and it CAN happen again. It also makes a helluva lot more sense then muh ATH in June.
2	1522861791	2	Yeah but people are saying 500 and 2000 in the same sentence.
0	1522851893	7	We spent ~5 days undergoing accumulation in the 6.5-7k range, then marked up to what was painted as "re-accumulation".  Fit the mold almost perfectly & should have led to a small bull run.  Due to the price support failure, we are now back in the original "accumulatoin zone" - which is a horrifically bearish signal.  I was long, all closed and sitting out for a bit to observe.  Not catching any knives.  
0	1522827765	7	Haven't done a large amount of TA aside from the odd pattern or two iin awhile, I decided to do something for both the bullish and bearish side to give myself a littler perspective.First off, reasons to be short term bullish: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/WMroFVut-The-Bullish-Side/First off, this is only one side of the coin here; there's some bearish signs medium term as well that I don't talk about (possible hidden bearish divergence. Here I'd like to talk about reasons to be at the very least short term bullish . I've drawn two bull flags; the larger, purple, one has an uglier look but for a larger formation it's at least plausible. On the other hand, both it and the blue flag would break up on the same movement so maybe concentrate on that one first. The blue one still isn't perfect, but it's definitely more reliable looking compared to the purple one if smaller. The more convenient thing about these flags is where their normal targets would lay. The band I've drawn is the 7800-8200 region, which has consistently acted as a barrier to price movement more or less ever since the 11.8k double top . The main takeaway from the circles is to show how the price tends to be reluctant to enter these zones, with their edges acting as a resistance/support. In two cases, most notably immediately before the current crash, the price has been stuck in the area between the flag targets (sometimes it has gone right through though). The confluence there though coupled with it being a psychological resistance makes me think the price should be somewhat magnetized there to test how strong those two resistances are, in particular the bottom 7.8k zone, to at least confirm it. 7.8k is also the area of the 38.2% retracement of the 9900 DCB and the 50% retracement of the 9000 bounce: https://imgur.com/a/Dmq8f and https://imgur.com/a/iK13w. It seems like such a significant level that the market should magnetize towards to test before continuing downward. Also pictured is the 4 hr RSI bullish failure swing that preceded this move.Now, bearish side:https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/NnR0A8Yl-Bearish-Side/So we fell out of one rising wedge , however you can redraw it to have us still be in a larger ascending wedge if you like. Still some upward mobility there before turning to break down (if it's going to). More importantly, no matter where this turns around (even if it already has) there will be hidden bearish divergence on the 4 hr chart. If it makes it to 7.8k there could be it on the daily as well. Not to mention all the overhead resistances from fib retracements, log support lines turned resistance, and he ATH log resistance. Overall, the market still hasn't provided much reason to think it has turned/bottomed. We're still within the overall downward channel, let's not get carried away.TL;DR: like many, short term bullish, long term bearish
1	1522828644	2	Solid, enjoyed both perspectives and far as Ichimoku its given me similar thoughts, nice bounce up and then rejection, some serious resistance up there.
1	1522828524	1	Thanks for the TA it's pretty good! When you say 'long-term bearish', define long-term. A year?
2	1522828991	4	Not really. This bear market seems to be playing out pretty fast so likely not a whole year. But I don't like putting time frame on it because I'm going to more judge the bottom based on TA and indicators / some fundamental news rather than time. Hell if we smash through 7.8k, consolidate a while, and smash the log ATH resistance, maybe the bottom is already in.If I had to say how long I'm bearish for it's probably gonna be a month or two barring unlikely scenarios. I try not to get carried away guessing any longer out.
3	1522829213	1	I understand. Thanks for the TA again, it looks pretty solid, but I don't have any money to trade with right now anyways so idk why I'm even here on this sub today.
3	1522833786	1	guessing even a month or two out is absurd and just mental masturbation.
0	1522853733	8	Today is a day I'd avoid TA. There's no TA for a President doubling down on trade wars while sinking Wall Street. No smart money is coming this way in this climate
1	1522853796	11	Trump is shorting
2	1522854342	3	Market was overpriced so he's creating a better entry point for himself.
1	1522854505	4	I'd disagree. The sudden price drop from that news displays market weakness. Which has been here regardless. If we'd heard about that in December on the way up, we'd probably slump for an hour, and resume the uptrend and people would be saying how bullish that news was for crypto confidence.TL;DR If news invalidates technical analysis, then anything else that emotionally influences a trader to buy or sell invalidates technical analysis.Change my mind.
1	1522854401	3	how about TA as insiders shorted the market? or AI analysis predicted the president actions?
0	1522854456	6	lol at people who think this is going straight to your resistance line. remember: maximum pain. We are just consolidating as far as iam concerned.wake me up but only if we break 6500.
1	1522854725	3	A wise man once said that the market seldom makes it easy to hold on to a good position.
0	1522834198	3	Just when Bitcoin gets your hopes up! I went short at 7315 and now am not entirely sure what to do.. There are a lot of contradictory signals everywhere. Will the bulls let us break below 7K (if they can help it)? Breaking under 7k wouldn't certainly once again embarrass a lot of the famous TA wizards who i've seen pretty damn confident of 7800. Anyway, i'm going to exit my short around 7050 if I can. Then I'll wait and see if we break under 7k before going again. What a pisser Bitcoin is 
1	1522834243	6	> Breaking under 7k wouldn't certainly once again embarrass a lot of the famous TA wizardsThey are never embarrassed.  They just forget about it and arrogantly make their next sure thing proclamation.
0	1522834263	3	How is it correlated that the number of shorts fell below the 24hour low, and the price is falling too?
1	1522838107	3	it means no one's really buying  the corn
1	1522835092	1	its a weird correlation if anything and is a bearish sign
0	1522846085	3	For all those who trade with a trading stack and have a holding stack separate what's the split between the two for you? How much leverage do you work with in general?
1	1522846389	3	About 1%. I use far too much leverage. Don't be me.
1	1522846428	3	my holding stack is currently a fiat stack and my trading stack is 30% of it
2	1522846568	2	Same with me, which is more aggressive than it probably ought to be. As for leverage, I never go higher than 5x because I stay on kraken and off the bitmex crack.
3	1522847093	2	Same here, all FIAT on Kraken. Default positions are 5X leverage and 33% of the stack. That way i can double up to DCA or enter a hedge with the rest of the stack to make up for an underwater position.
1	1522848083	2	50/50. Zero leverage. Just go 100% in or out trying to get more btc. Been wrecked lately
2	1522849601	1	Too much risk.  I recommend trading stack to be 5% of holding stack.
3	1522849975	3	No fun in that
1	1522849885	1	75/25 holding to trading.  I'm considering bumping up the trading, but probably a good way to get hurt. No leverage. 
0	1522857843	3	Interesting place to knife catch. Shorts closing?
1	1522857918	2	Hey, a skillful knife catcher will stab a knife dropper right in the heart every time.
1	1522857983	2	6500-6600 may be a place to catch yourself under the wheels of death.
1	1522857999	2	Yes, probably shorts closing / longing knife catchers. I think there's going to be some cut hands on this, though, unless they're looking to scalp 67xx to 69xx. My knife catching long (sep futs) doesn't start scaling in until 6600, with buys all the way down to 5900. 
0	1522858853	3	Any info from Kraken as to their trading halt 24 hrs ago?  It marked exactly the top.  Why the huge green wick on reopen?

0	1522852665	5	Good thing I bought on 6.5 area and sold at 7.4k.  Although I only recover my 80% of my total loss from the previous dump.  All in all I am not making profit in this market.
0	1522859262	5	Ouch...and the 4 hour MACD just flipped. I think 5800-5900 is the true double bottom from back on Feb 6. Last one was a fake out to see who was really paying attention lol
0	1522862750	5	Am I the only one that thinks we will stay around this mark as there is some solid, pre-parabolic price history here? Seems to me that sideways(ish) is the most likely outcome for the coming months 
1	1522863284	3	BTC has one of its most volatile periods and you expect sideways for the coming months? Based on what?
2	1522863408	3	Based on the price sky rocketing, then correcting back down to when it was atleast a bit more of a sustainable trend.When I say sideways, I do mean Bitcoin sideways. I shouldn’t have to caveat that though 
1	1522863861	2	At this point in time last bubble we did stay at stable level before climbing back above 600 in may and then cointinued to fall.
1	1522863238	4	Everyone said this about $8k. Give it a few more weeks and see where the price is 
2	1522863927	3	Couple weeks ago it was also at sub 7k. So we went sideways since?
3	1522864626	1	I wouldn't say a V bottom for like 1 day meant we were "at sub 7k", really. I don't know why people act like we spent any meaningful time down there like we are now. Also, sub 7k was two months ago, not a couple weeks ago. 
2	1522863393	3	$20k?
0	1522864288	5	https://www.tradingview.com/x/Th0ZSNtJ/
0	1522864388	6	6hr about to close and looks like MACD might cross below the signal line by end of daily if things continue. 4hr MACD also crossed below signal and zero line not too long ago. Neither time frames look oversold enough to expect a bounce.On the other hand, there is clearly some support at 68xx (61.8%) and if that falls, maybe support at 66xx (78.6%). Still, I can't really see enough buying volume to suddenly materialize to bring it back to 7k+ let alone 7.5k. I think we either go sideways between 6.4k-6.8k for the next several hours while people scalp or just fall to a new low soon before next advance attempt. 
1	1522865286	3	I still think about the Kraken Whale that kept us from falling through 6.5k. Will he show up again? Or is he done after unloading his position for a nice profit?I dont know where the support would come from,  honestly. 
0	1522829833	9	Short $500k @ $7350. Expecting to profit from a 3-6% movement. Stops set at 10%. May add to the position. 
1	1522832220	3	Seems like you was right, What made you Short ?
2	1522833740	2	He wasn't necessarily right, although I agree with his choice.  And the obvious probably "made" him short.
1	1522834353	2	If you are expecting a 3-6% movement, why set stops at 10%? Seems like poor r/r
1	1522835843	2	>Short $500k @ $7350. Expecting to profit from a 3-6% movement. Stops set at 10%. May add to the position. Just closed it at $7065.

1	1522836527	5	Spoofy. It's showing and disappearing since that last drop.
2	1522837057	7	Yep, dirty tactics at play. I'm done trying to call this shit storm, I'm sitting this out for the long run... Going into cold storage like Han Solo
3	1522837132	3	Buy and hold and look back in 2020. This will all look silly.
4	1522837410	9	Great investment advice to hold and not check and manage your investment for the next two years, despite whatever regulatory actions, technical problems, etc crop up in that time.  You could end up with BTC at $100 for all we know.   But it is a lazy, stress free strategy until of course you take your head out of sand and go into shock.
5	1522837616	13	Meh, imagine if you had listened to every bit of bad news from 2015-2017 and sold based on that information. Would have been a terrible move too
6	1522838318	3	It was quite painful to watch the news in that period. However no news came close to any real danger to the operation of Bitcoin. Except for the 1m blocksize problem being brought up,  played out in full and then finally getting fixed. But there were a lot of other things going on to keep your Bitcoin. If something really bad would have happened to the technology and no fix was in sight, I would have sold quite fast. 
5	1522837572	3	As opposed to trading with leverage in a low-liquidity / high variance market? I feel like you're putting words in my mouth, but regardless the political climate is pretty warm at the moment and looks warm for the foreseeable future.
0	1522841854	8	Poor dushy and his 7k short .... 
1	1522841904	5	You said you’d start bashing when it went below 7k lol. You still have another hour or so :P
1	1522841996	2	Are we bragging about underwater positions now?
2	1522842070	7	Idk man, bragging about 3% moves seems to be all the rage :)
3	1522842658	3	Bear Market was pretty much over, but you had to short the corn into the ground! It is all your fault.
0	1522857037	8	Seems like no one even bothers buying anymore, people are tired of being thrown around by whales.
1	1522857132	4	To be fair that's pretty much my logic at this point. I know my flag is bearish and I admit I am a little, but really I'm just tired of trying to trade this choppy market and have been sitting out the last week. So far that's turned out to not be such a bad idea.
1	1522858009	4	I attribute the declining volume for a large part to whale (exchange?) games and market manipulation. Traders are getting tired of their shenanigans.
1	1522857397	7	I bought one BTC today :)
2	1522857623	9	And sold two?
1	1522858685	3	Indeed. If anyone asked me right now if they should by bitcoin, I'd warn them to stay away. I think the only people left in the market are whales, active traders and former small casual investors who are stuck because they bought in high and were too dumb to panic the last 50 times bitcoin crashed... not that I know anyone like that :P
0	1522855272	10	My friend, with whom I haven't spoken in months, texted me telling me he bought bitcoin at $19.5k and is "hodling until 2030." He told me to buy some now. Jesus christ. 
1	1522855376	22	If he actually plans to hold until 2030, he may just come out okay on that lol.
2	1522855654	11	12 years is practical for an investment.
3	1522856103	3	If he bought 1 coin at $19500, and BTC reaches $50k by 2030, he's got 150% return over 12 years, or >10% a year averaged. Not terrible. TVM, inflation, yada yada. Not sure the S&P would do better though :PI recommended a well-to-do acquaintance throw 2% of his portfolio at crypto in late January with the caveat that it might go to $0, but it might return significantly more than standard markets could. I told him to forget about it and to check in quarterly with a 3-5 year expectation before re-evaluation. Edit to add: I know recommending buying crypto is pretty taboo. But this person was clear on scenarios, including a real possibility of losing all of it. It was only a small portion of what the S&P had gained him in 2017 anyway. 
4	1522856473	2	This. I'm not recommending anyone invest long-term until there's more price stability.150% over 12 years predicts an unprecedented level of price stability for Bitcoin. If the price only changes by 150% in a single year I would be surprised.
3	1522857511	2	12 years is several generations on crypto.
2	1522856720	2	Where he was stupid is going all in at any price.  Simple slow dca would have destroyed his entry.  Also stupid is buying the top.  He could buy more here and really reduce his cost basis if he really believes in bitcoin.  Not many believers at this price so maybe wait.
1	1522855796	8	Hes in the game, and probably much more relaxed than us degenerates.

1	1522852529	3	Lol, these delusional bulls are the reason why market will take so loooong to reach final bottom. Few hundreds dollar pump and they act like woohoo new ATH is imminent. 8k longs already FOMO'd into recent bull trap.
1	1522852019	2	Be honest. You shorted with a few billions at 11.7k and every bounce is you taking profits. Hope you are proud of yourself.

1	1522851504	3	hahhah ooh god
0	1522834332	6	Couldn't even touch 7.8k before plummeting again. The bulls are getting weaker and weaker...
0	1522841728	9	in retaliation to Trump's tweeting, China has announced a 25% tariff on all imported Bitcoins.
0	1522851506	8	Sub $7k. Too bad it didn't hold. This means we will soon drop to sub $6k. 
1	1522851883	12	keep calling that sub 6k one of these times your bound to be right, right? 
2	1522852181	1	Thats exactly what I was thinking. People have been calling sub 6k since we hit 6k. Every single time we cant break a resistance, and I mean this literally, someone comes out and calls 5k. People did it when we hit 7k, 8k, 9k, 11k, called it when we were going down, called it when we were going back up and are calling it again right now. Since people are so sure we are going to go lower, there is actually no way we do. Too many people sitting on the sidelines waiting for a re-entry at 5,8-5,9k, we didnt even come close to 6k the last time we approached it.
3	1522853237	1	I agree it has been overstated here but i really don't think 6k is our floor. Its just a pretty solid support that has gotten bought up the last 2 times, but when (if) we do even slightly break it, we're going to freefall imo.
1	1522851560	11	I wouldnt get too excited. If 6800 holds, we should be ok.
2	1522852261	2	We're looking at the same chart?Lots of shorts took profits on the way down, there's lot of room and selling pressure is big.Yeah, we will bounce from 6.8 but I don't expect it to hold...
3	1522852987	1	I guess we'll see soon enough, no?
4	1522853155	1	It may not be so soon but yup
0	1522829043	7	I just bought one Bitcoin with cash that I worked forAt this point, I think I’m done trading until we see clearer. Maybe we go up, maybe we go down, but this range is weird and I don’t want to be trading.I think I’ll withdraw soon and not worry about the price for a bit.If there’s a dump, thank me later
0	1522820453	2	Oh short term chart analysis is quackery. Just buy and be patient.
1	1522821431	4	Yeah! https://imgur.com/gallery/9iF3t
2	1522824345	5	Your chart is broken and dumb, it crosses ~50k in 2020 as opposed to the much more obvious and clearly defined plan of '1m by 2020' 
3	1522829779	1	Hahaha. Yeah I became aware of the awesome ‘BTC to the moon rainbow chart’ put together by some of the good folks here at Bitcoin Markets recently, after I posted my primitive hand-drawn extrapolation of the long term BTC trend price at this latest time of Fear of the unknown and Uncertainty and Doubt and doom  - https://www.moonmath.win And their long term mean line seemed to match mine pretty much, but in the extrapolated figures at the bottom looking at July 2010 to present performance today they have BTC at 100K on 31/12/19 and at I million dollars on July 22 2021. A bit later than your call, but I think their figure has slipped from 2020 a couple of days ago. Volatility is the name of this game short-term hey! But yeah extrapolations are not predictive of course, but they are good to look at to get rid of all the short term noise and give you strong hands if you’re a believer! So anyone want 20 fiat bucks on 2021 vrs 2025 haha? 
1	1522820897	6	Yeah this is a hodling sub, trading is dumb
1	1522820732	2	avoid starting comment with word short...  became allergic to it ..In my train of thoughts was thinking how shorting is going mainstream is the equivalent of FOMO last December.... 
1	1522820820	2	It works when there’s momentum but times like now time would be better spent watching paint dry haha
0	1522835388	4	Well my bear fear respect yesterday was real, and happy I took profits. Sell the pumps and either wait for breakout or break down to buy in again or short directly if break out fails is still the strategy hereAnd today Dankush or what the name i I can't remember might be happy for riding out his short :DEdit :Dushmankush it is!
0	1522842353	8	"Dow heads toward 500-point skid after China fights back with tariffs"go tell me it doesn't correlate now.
1	1522842573	4	We have had plenty and plenty of red days during green market days and started tanking before the djia didThat said I don't think it helps at all, especially because our bear started first
1	1522843235	2	there is 100% a relationship, the extent of the relationship is the question
1	1522843502	2	If I remember, in Late Jan / Early Feb on a Monday the stock market opened one of its worse days, followed by Bitcoin tanking 2k+ that same day 
1	1522842659	3	BTC dropped about the same time S&P futures dropped. Coincidence or correlation?
2	1522842915	5	*Cue X-files theme*
2	1522843871	2	coerrelation
2	1522842935	4	Coincidence.
2	1522846723	1	The other term you are looking for is causation. 
1	1522846292	1	Well if there is at least I got half of it right by selling out cryptos. My stocks...
0	1522834706	6	7k to 7.1k is current support. For those of you who think this is going up now is the time to buy. If it does hold I would expect 7.8k within a few days, maybe even low 8's. This is what I expect to happen and then we continue on with the downtrend back to low 6. From there is anyone's guess if 6k will hold or not. If support doesn't hold right now then that would even be more bearish than I would have thought and we'd probably see low 6's soon. My short is closing in this area and if we hold I'll open a good sized long. If it doesn't hold I'll be reshorting.
0	1522842220	7	Looks like we might break 7K. Bulls beware
0	1522841690	5	So if we break 7k I'm guessing that's pretty bad, right?
1	1522841824	7	As long as we make a higher low I'm fine. 
0	1522852459	4	Honestly it wouldn't be a bad thing for crypto in the long run if the stock market crashed at the same time. At least there could be a scapegoat; it would be far more damaging to crypto if it collapsed in the midst of a raging Dow bull run. Not that I'm rooting for that, but a silver crypto lining.
0	1522856663	8	Can't wait for 2018 to end
1	1522857682	9	It’ll be one hell of a decade
1	1522857123	4	Well, I can.
0	1522835599	10	and this ladies and gents is why a few days ago, when people were pissing their pants at the 4% pump.... We don't get too excited!!We are in a big ol bear market, the grand trend is down. Yep we'll have peaks and spikes but the trend is the trend until it is categorically broken. It's shit because i'm sick of it now but I still don't think we are close to ending this situation. Summer time still seems a fair bet to me. Maybe June. Fuck knows, all I know is a piss load of longs just got smashed there. They won't be the last 
1	1522835670	15	You had that saved in notepad ready to post didn't you ;)
1	1522848238	1	This reminds me of 2014.
0	1522815569	2	is this range (low-mid 7000s) a short-term equilibrium or do we have another jump to make soon? (either way)
1	1522815990	7	I'm worried the bull rally has run out of steam
2	1522816124	3	Because the volume seemed low?
3	1522816272	7	That combined with the fact that it tested 7500 and bounced off pretty hard. Momentum over the long term is still with the bears. I think more volume is needed to sustain this jump.Edit: I am not an experienced trader, nor do I pretend to be one, so completely disregard anything I say.
4	1522816483	2	That's the 38% fib retracement correct? I suppose it makes sense. If we can find some buy volume we can probably break through but I wouldn't count on that in a bear market tbh
5	1522816593	2	Not totally sure, here's a couple links I was looking at. Look's like it's around 7480?https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ONPULxN4-Don-t-Let-A-Small-Bounce-Blind-You-BITCOIN-BTC/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/bJohD9QA-The-Bitcoin-Death-Cross-Is-This-the-Resurrection/
6	1522817426	1	Yeah I have my 38.2% drawn at exactly 7,491 so that's pretty close.
7	1522829243	2	I took swing high from the last viable daily candle, it was 9k. My 38.8 is on 7480: https://www.tradingview.com/x/oCNRf913/I expected us to come to 7800 maybe, but this could be the last bulls effort before another drop. If BTC manages to rise above 7800 and 8100 that is good for mid term bulls.I am still very long term bearish, I really feel like this bubble is going to pop harder and that many of the people will be surprised when we drop harder.
0	1522820909	2	Not sure I follow [this](https://twitter.com/peterlbrandt/status/981124346289774593?s=21) . Can someone elaborate? Thoughts here? Although a falling wedge is a reversal pattern (bullish in this case) Isn’t declining volume a bad thing?
1	1522821176	2	He is indicating a falling wedge, which typically has declining volume throughout and is a reversal pattern. To be clear, the pattern being a reversal pattern doesn't mean a full bear market reversal.
0	1522833302	2	moment of truth do we bounce off 7250 ish or go straight through it 
1	1522833456	5	My money is on straight through. It's been sitting post 7k for a while, not moved higher and due to bitcoins normal fluctuations it needs to move down to test 7k. (imho)Edit - and there it is.
2	1522833547	2	Bitcoin doesnt have normal fluctuations.

1	1522833997	1	stay away from sept futures unless you’re building a long-term long (1x)
2	1522834126	1	Thanks for the tip.  Actually have a long term long on *June that was started before Sept opened.Indeed should have put the swing long on the swaps though.
3	1522835199	1	You can slowly move your June long to September. Thats what I would do

0	1522848151	2	Short from 7325. Got a stop buy around 7150 not sure if this is going to have a bear flag for the next 6 hours or  drop further
1	1522848365	7	~7.2 should be resistance, it may go as high and bounce from there.
2	1522848956	2	I feel like 7.2 would be confirmation that 7k held well. I do think that we won't go straight to 8k and 7.2 will probably provide some kind of resistance but I think the buying pressure at that point would take over.
3	1522849744	1	Thank you both. I have adjusted to 72. Really hoping this breaks downwards
1	1522849967	6	I just closed my short, stops at 6900 and anticipating and upwards movement for nowEdit: God fucking damnit
0	1522853695	2	Can anyone recommend me some books/videos/resources to learn more about trading? Doesn't have to be specifically about crypto, anything that covers TA, FA, strategy and psychology is useful.I'm working my way through babypips and currently listening to an audiobook about Richard Dennis and the turtles, but will be finished soon and am looking for more stuff to learn.Cheers!
1	1522854182	3	Really recommend the book "Trading in the Zone". All about psychology, no TA or FA.
1	1522854045	2	Good reddit written before the decline worth a read.. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iuv6p/why_the_wall_street_will_short_bitcoin_to_crash/
1	1522855003	2	Check out u/jay1687 's posts. While he focuses on Litecoin, he breaks down and explains every tool he uses and how it's beneficial to TA. He has been posting them in installments over several weeks I believe, starting basic and adding in more indicators as he goes. You should check it out, very informative.
1	1522853768	2	Just follow chewy until you gain confidence to do your own thing. Worked well for me. 
2	1522854130	2	Nice idea, but I'm looking to educate myself before getting into any more trading. Also, I don't understand everything Chewy writes, which is obviously not going to help me follow his trades.

1	1522853316	5	Bulls spent all their power on the way up to 11k8. Every bounce since then is laughable.
1	1522853443	2	I agree that the problem is with bulls, I suspect many of them panic sell and take profits whenever they see the price stall or a big red candle. If bulls don’t hold and exit at the first sign of selling pressure, BTC can’t climb out of this range anytime soon.

0	1522858330	3	Wow, that Bitmex orderbook.Did you see that? 9 million contracts for sale at 6740s, while bitfinex was pricing 6780-6790s. That was eaten in a halfminute I guess. Closed my short relatively low thanks to him, but couldn't open long due to overload. But anyways, this seems bearish af in medium term. We didn't break that downward channel at 7400s, and now paying the price. 
0	1522862018	5	Whenever I see bearish price action I get excited about the CC market cap; there are 19 CCs with a market cap over 1 billion. Stacking CCs by asset over the last 3 months, we can see that BTC is slowly recovering but that smallers CCs are still increasing their market share.* https://imgur.com/a/ssX6a* https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/I believe that these trends will likely continue because these small alt coins have effectively become fractional reserve banking for the CC market. As the market drops in value these reserve currencies are able to buy up their own supply in order to preserve their exchange ratios. If I'm right, as long as these fractional reserve currencies (alts), currently 20% of the market cap, continue to grow in relative value I think the overall CC market will remain bearish.Edit: retracted a spurious claim
1	1522862558	6	At the moment there are 19 automakers with market caps above $1bn. That number should be closer to 5. Therefore the value of automakers must fall until this is true.
2	1522862818	0	Also, this ignores the substance of my argument.
1	1522862481	2	Hey Jared. Someone told me that swing trading between BTC to alts could effectively be done based on the Doge BTC ratio. When doge is over 100 SATs you sell alts for btc. When doge is below 25 SATs you buy alts with btc. Search: "bitcoin cycle"
1	1522862301	5	Has nothing to do with alts Jared. This bear market is a direct result of BTC not offering 7k worth of value. Simple. Fin. 
2	1522863334	9	I don't see why people separate bitcoin so easily from alts when the amount of speculation and greed surrounding both are very similar. The way bitcoin maximalists see alts is the way normal people see bitcoin 
3	1522863655	3	And the way alt holders see bitcoin is the way (ultra) bitcoin maximalists see the banking system
1	1522863175	0	I don't know why your post is getting so much hate
1	1522863412	1	Guess you're getting downvoted for talking shit about alts.  This is the indicator I'm watching closest.  Alts needs to give up more market cap % to BTC before we're anywhere near the end of this bear market and true crypto capitulation.  Folks that disagree are just holding bags and preying they'll get their money back.
0	1522821084	3	There is such low volume on this candle. Any experienced traders here think that means it's going down soon? Cuz for real I'm tryna learn here.
1	1522821575	3	Price has been in this range quite some time the past day, so a decline in volume is expected. IMO it's neutral. Watch out for a breakout to the up- / downside and look at that volume. Higher high on low volume might indicate a drop.EDIT: That said, we are in a (mid term) bear-market, so the odds are always in favor of shorts.
1	1522822817	3	Yes, this bounce was off the major support in low 6ks (previous bottom 2 months ago). The bounce was weakish and low volume. I'm not buying here.
1	1522825204	3	While the rally volume has been rather lackluster, I also see a conspicuous lack of selling volume, which should be the first sign of warning for the bears here.
2	1522827425	2	Meh, there have been several examples of bears lifting off the sell pressure since 11.7 and just wait for the next big resistance to resume the selling. Every time people claim "looks good, bears nowhere to be seen". It's just that they are being patient, and the price isn't rising because of convincing buying but because of a temporary relief in selling.
2	1522837764	2	Low selling has almost always preceded massive selling in this market. The bears go into hibernation to get the best price possible then unload all at once 
1	1522823117	2	Volume was very similar to the bounce off $7,300 so I expect similar results. The only real bounce we had with legs was the initial bounce off $5,900. Volume was much higher then. 
0	1522835278	3	....2000btc candle, and 1.8 or 1.9 of that was a single sell I think.

1	1522865890	5	I wouldn't call $6,800 broken yet. Buyers are still refusing to concede it by hovering between $6,700 and $6,800. 
1	1522866044	2	I have seen so many posts on how BTC is going to <6k that I find bears' persistence amazing.To me, it's actually bullish, but let's see ( : 
0	1522851687	8	There is one unbearable thing and cliché so many posters at this forum seem to repeat over and over. "Healthy pullback" (or retrace). Why on earth would it be healthy to constantly drop? Why this complete and utter disillusion persist here so much? This is just beyond any common sense. 
1	1522851808	5	lol ok, why would it be healthy to constantly go up then? lol. Dude really?
1	1522851937	4	Bulls significantly outnumber bears on this sub. Meanwhile BTC has lost 67% of its value. Tells you enough about the value of this sub's sentiment. Thankfully there are a handful of good people here with something valuable to say.
1	1522852026	4	Because they Talk for there own.... there own Porto.Short... they talk downLong ... you knowBut don't worry... this Chat room has no influence on price... Big guys are in control. Not the 1, 10 or 100 coins persons here. 
2	1522852365	1	:). Oh I'm not worried this sub has the influence on the price, cos it obviously doesn't (the likes of which bought these nearly 2000 BTC on Kraken for 6.5k have), just that I consider it boring and intellectually dishonest. 
1	1522851879	2	Because they watch charts instead of understand how people think, do you know anyone that wants to get in bitcoin right now?  Any relatives beating down your door wanting to invest?  That absence of interest isn't healthy at all and it gets worse every time bitcoin flounders like this.  I don't think many here realize it is entirely possible ETH or something else takes over once people get sick of this shit.  Bitcoin is not all of crypto.
2	1522852465	2	Yes exactly, That's why any further correction is definitely extremely UNhealthy for BTC and increases probability that it never quite recovers enough to interest average joe ever again. 
1	1522852672	1	Because that's how a market functions. A trend consists of 2 things. Higher (lower) highs and higher (lower) lows. The utter delusion is with those who thought yesterday the trend has reversed and are now opening shorts because we have retraced a bit. I'm more inclined to think this a short term drop to establish a higher low on the 4H chart than to think this is the drop that will test 5900. I can't really believe we won't test 7800-8000 before failing again.

1	1522851216	3	Not opening a short here but also not closing here
1	1522851292	2	Not this close to 6.8 but I added more weight on the scales at 7150I don't think it's terrible r/r to open a short here though, given that if 6.8 breaks, there could be a whole lot of air. I don't think many are expecting 6.5 bullwhale heroics again
0	1522853228	2	This isn't a bull or a bear market, it's a manipulated market. Organic gains or losses interspersed with big pumps and dumps. How can anyone trade effectively like this?
1	1522853955	5	It is a bear market. How is this not a bear market? Bear market does not mean an elevator to the ground. It means it takes buying pressure to maintain prices. It means any rises or falls operate within an established downtrend channel.I'll give you a hint--it's in blue: https://www.tradingview.com/x/XeOSI1Rh/

First time I haven't given into the urge to FOMO some in as it rose haha.https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ONPULxN4-Don-t-Let-A-Small-Bounce-Blind-You-BITCOIN-BTC/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/bJohD9QA-The-Bitcoin-Death-Cross-Is-This-the-Resurrection/
1	1522854671	2	how on earth did you even hold onto a trade at -90%, just seems like gambling at that point
2	1522854851	6	Not hard when you invest $10
1	1522855289	2	> I'm sure angry TA noobs will downvote me though because they magically know every single future move of BTC.Sure blaming TA is the way to go, now let me just roll a dice and hold onto a position and HOPE it turns into profit   /s
2	1522855407	2	Have you read this daily lately and seen the upvotes / downvotes?  It’s now filled with elitist assholes with so much hubris regarding their shit TA predictions that downvote everything.  Pretty sad.
0	1522858088	0	Can't we just go down to 3k and get this over and done with. Or 2k or 1k and $500 whatever.Only an idiot would buy now. 
1	1522858559	8	>Only an idiot would buy now. "Only an idiot would sell below 7k"Both of these statements have seemed reasonable at some point in the last week.
1	1522858532	2	Why do you think that those numbers would be a magic catalyst for people to buy. Sure it may bounce off of there but if everyone sells after they make a quick 10-15% profit, it will just keep going down. Its not like a whole bunch of people are waiting for those prices so that they can be holders. They are just waiting so that they can sell their coins to someone for a little bit more than they paid for them. Unless we get a new pool of people who are buying because they want to own bitcoin and believe in it for what it was created for, then pricewise theres no way it will ever go crazy up again. By all means trade it if thats what you want, but if you're hoping to see huge price gains, then regardless of what you think about hodlers, that supply drying up is necesary. 
1	1522858401	3	Honestly, I keep asking myself who is buying right now other than people trying to short. This market is overly saturated with traders and really lacks any kind of actual investors
0	1522830486	2	Painful to watch, I'll do the contrarian trade and open a short here because alts (looking eth and bch) have been painting a clear bear flag while btc was going sideways, and as there's only bots and no real buyers it will drag btc down if nothing is done.
1	1522830825	2	Feeling similar. Not so much about a bear flag, but after a large drop comes a massive overbought recovery and people usually take profits after.
0	1522833695	2	Just entered a small short at 7300, I think we will see more down side following this [Rising wedge breakdown](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eXk3mQYt)
0	1522833982	2	The market and the chart seems to be repeating the exact same pattern with DCBs, one after the other, but people don't want to recognize that obvious fact.
0	1522835018	2	Looks like a confirmed H&S on the 2h. Target 7000.Short from 7260. 
1	1522836353	1	neckline?
2	1522838150	2	Seems the volume doesn't match the formation. Neckline was 7250 counting the wicks, but most likely is 7300.[Chart](https://imgur.com/a/l49Qr)Most likely was just 7050 the target and already hit...
1	1522837036	1	No volume confirmation, hence incorrect analysis
2	1522837767	1	Thanks, still learning
3	1522843170	1	Volume confirmation means same pattern on the volume chart    /\/\/   \/\Basically this
0	1522839012	2	I traded a channel yesterday, shorted at 7485 and closed for a very nice profit.What I am seeing today is a VERY obvious HS pattern on most timeframes. [Here it is on 30m] (https://www.tradingview.com/x/VA5JVdzr) and [here it is on 1h](https://www.tradingview.com/x/icfYrwIP) and [here it is on 3h](https://www.tradingview.com/x/vOw6RerM).Mind you, I "drew" the pattern on the 30m and it fit quite perfectly on other TFs.For now, the base is holding, and my short is closed already, but not looking good lads...
0	1522842001	2	So then people, where do we see this ending? I'm a tad surprised we haven't bounced up a bit and held longer around 7100 or above but that's the way it is.Break under 7000, I have absolutely no idea where the short term low is. Unsure whether to short or not..Usually this means I shouldn't. So I guess I won't.Damn it
1	1522842370	3	I think one more visit to $6xxx or below feels about right. Barely holding above 7K as it is
1	1522842497	2	I don't know but I'm riding my short out until further notice. The bulls lose morale with every failed rise. 6.8-7 really needs to hold imo
0	1522851177	2	down with no volume..and off course when it is at 6900 we got some volume
0	1522850954	1	Well there we go.. We tried to hold 7k but oh well.Now let's just see how bad the damage is. No knife catching for me.. Just gonna take a break and check back in later tonight . Need to let the market settle down a bit after this mess.I would say onwards and upwards but well, we all know for now that's just not true!
0	1522853900	0	So, is it now the time I shall refer to my comment about prematurely  calling out people for their positions trying to make a point and maybe the market will change according to their plan or timeframe for that trade? (:https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/899akt/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_03_2018/dwrdyxh/ :))
1	1522854078	3	Crap
1	1522853964	2	That links to removed comment.
2	1522854060	8	yes, it was about everyones favorite shorter saying he is clinging on to his 7k short and me stating in response to that if you don't know the risk tolerance, strategy and timeframe for someone elses trade it's no point in trying to say "haha look at your stupid trade" until everything is settled
3	1522854180	2	Oh, I saw that one.Don't you think mentioning this again is just fuel for fire?
4	1522854382	2	Not at all, I think it will make people think an extra step before treating trading as a football cheering game 
5	1522854706	2	He was stupid to do that, you're stupid to do 'haha, I was right'.
1	1522854310	3	In my humble opinion any bounce to 7.1 should be shorted with extreme prejudice 
2	1522854399	3	how's that -700% looking now ?
3	1522854550	2	Pretty good thanks to my add at 7.4 but we're not even close to closing this baby.
4	1522854752	4	From new paradigm during the 11.8k double top to btc <1k now, you may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.

0	1522843621	-3	Bulls were cocksure we would at least hit 7.8 before a "healthy retracement". Looks like the pump couldn't even get past weaker resistance at 7.5. Seems to me like this bounce was the 6k double bottom attempt which actually exposes the real weakness of bulls. Anyone expecting another double bottom attempt in the low 6's is going to be in for a shock. Tldr: bulls need to ~~hold~~ close above 7k here or BTC is <6k bound 
1	1522845185	12	> unce was the 6k double bottom attempt which actually exposes the real weakness of bulls. Anyone expecting another double bottom attempt in the low 6's is going to be in ...LOL you simply cannot infer that depth of information from your source data.
1	1522843891	3	Looking at pattern:11.8 -> 8.4 -> 10 -> 7.4 -> 9.2 -> 6.4I was expecting at least 8k bounce here. Didn't expect that it'll stop at 7.5, but it may still bounce from 7k just to test 8k and go down.
2	1522846763	1	This is exactly my thinking. I'm fairly certain we go to 8k from here and then head back down to low 6's. But seeing as I don't have a crystal ball I may end up losing money here if we don't hold here. 
1	1522843851	7	chewy said 6800 is still within the realm of a healthy-ish pullback.If it goes below 6800, I anticipate we see sub 6k this week...u/_chewtoy_?
2	1522844055	4	Agreed. 
3	1522847750	1	You're hedging if 6.8 falls?
2	1522844064	4	'They can maybe sustain a drop to $6,800 without a total collapse of the recovery. But providing sellers with even the slightest amount of momentum is a surefire recipe for a horrifying decline below $6,000.''If it drops below $7,250, then $7,000 to $6,800 become viable targets. 'Sounds like you're right.
3	1522844219	1	Nice, thanks for digging it out
4	1522844413	1	Actually thanks for pointing that out, flipped to short at 7250, remembered that 7k is a strong support but forgot about 6.8. Good to know we can bounce there if 7k doesn't hold.
2	1522845980	1	6960-6830 are valid retracement targets in this bullish leg upwards and I am just waiting for that final spike down to hit them.https://www.tradingview.com/x/np13RpAx/
3	1522846713	1	as long as you’ve got tight stops to bail if we go sub 6500, should be fine
4	1522847138	1	I should of commented and said I am only looking for a place to close a short not open a new long. A word of warning to this would be we started with a leading diagonal if we consider 6430 as a valid pivot.Leading Diagonals (Raising Wedges) often retrace deeper to the 78.6% so that could take us as far down as 6650 and still be a valid retracement. A drop below this level would be a concern and a reconsideration of my short-term roadmap would be on the table.
1	1522844464	3	supply and demand people! y'all keep talking about patterns and lines but frankly 7k is neither atrractive bulls or bears. 2017 definitely brought btc to public attention and lots of people have fomo, but most 2017 joiners either are red and sheepish or procrastinators and arent buying too much right now. its now time to focus on real world use because that is the only thing that will stop the price from hitting triple digits
1	1522844575	7	You don’t need to add a Tldr if all you want us to know is that you’re short 
1	1522844105	4	Thank you for your "lesson" oh great mastermind.However 6.8 could as well be a valid support.Yes, the buying is weak as hell. However the mother of shorts squeeze could very well fuel it again.
2	1522844405	3	Shorts closing doesn't seem like the necessary ingredient for a healthy turnaround. At best it would be temporary relief. + Stronger bears won't be getting liquidated or panic closing anywhere near 7-8k. 
2	1522844218	3	A pump from short squeeze will be temporary relief, we need real buyers at this point. 
3	1522846737	1	This is the double edged indicator of more shorts open: a strong indicator that the herd is not close to believing in BTC to put their main stack back in
2	1522844464	2	Shorts are at the lowest point of the last four days. There won't be a short squeeze until we go much lower...
1	1522847911	2	shorts shorts shorts , you are trying to convince yourself?
0	1522841962	1	Drop below $7k would be disastrous for bulls, all bullish TA can then be thrown out the window and sub $6k it is. Crucial. This doesn't look good for bulls.
1	1522842327	4	Any reason why?
0	1522843206	1	Finished forming another Bart pattern, great...
0	1522850671	2	Closed my June futures long (from 6510) at 7090 this morning (futs price 7050). Currently have a short position open from 7133 (hedge against the long, same weight). This thing is sniffing for sub $7K, and....there it goes. I was planning to write up reasoning behind my expectations of a drop, but the market rendered that moot. We may bounce around $7K for a while here to cool off, but this is now strongly appearing like a lower low is coming, or at least a retest of the low. There's a reason you don't often hear about quadruple bottoms. $7250 failed its retest and $7000 just failed its retest. $6900 is important to hold, and it may short-term, but it's becoming clear the bounce was not a reversal.This is what I meant when I took issue with people calling reversal or bull market after 48 hours of climbing. The potential was there, but we were so far from any sort of confirmation. We bounced *well* within our downtrend channel. We didn't even make it past the halfway mark. We didn't even get to the downtrend line from 11.7K, let alone ATH. This bodes poorly for the intermediate term.https://www.tradingview.com/x/U0iT1MPD/  Blue: ATH downtrend channel  Red: 11.7K downtrend resistance  Purple: 6-month log support (potential resistance)
1	1522850708	1	Yup... Nice timing.
1	1522852129	1	> Currently have a short position open from 7133 I did too, already took 1/3 of it at 6.9 and another 1/3 profits at 6.8.I've had too many trades lately that I held during profit and into a loss, back to profit, and finally ending in loss.    Gotta lock in profits.  Hope I can break even for the week, currently in red.I'll probably increase this short by 50% after we settle somewhere, and try to catch some upward volatility.But already wish I did BE stops and held this heh.
