1	1522802723	7	Under $100Billion Total Crypto Marketcap? Under $50Billion?lol I hope so!!! There's been good news coming out daily since Japan declared BTC a National Currency in November. The $20K BTC Buyers have panic sold. Desperation is gone. It's obviously going up again. The question is when.
2	1522807773	4	>  It's obviously going up again.lol
3	1522821445	3	Found the panic seller
4	1522833893	-4	found the moron...not tough in here.
5	1522855773	1	Guess it's pretty easy when you think you're the smartest guy in the room for buying BTC at $20k and selling at $10k before it dipped even more. BTC is dead right? Derp!
3	1522807882	3	This whole "bitcoin will keep going up forever" mentality is fucking weird. It's not rooted in reality at all
4	1522807954	1	So many people in crypto, especially Bitcoin, live in their little fantasy worlds.   And they are surprised that some of us live in the real world and not interested in leaving it.
1	1522804644	5	I agree, but I'm not selling.
0	1522802374	6	Time... thatâ€™s what everyone needs to give this bear, it just needs to hibernate a little bit and outlast this unusually long winter.
1	1522859003	1	Um, no.  This is not winter.  Winter is lower price going mostly sideways and can last a very long time.  We are still in volatile times.  Crypto winter is coming eventually.  
0	1522810356	2	Thanks for taking the time to share this info, keep up the good work 
0	1522795621	4	Ever hear of a weekly chart ?
0	1522810603	1	We can see from coinmarketcap bitcoin was apparently overvalued a lot compared to its actual $ total market cap, hence the "crash". The past few days have been a reversal but for it to be a new trend it would need to keep up for a week at least.For all we know this could have been a coordinated move by whales to get those juicy liquidated contracts since people are so fond of shorting btc lately. Time will tell
0	1522824196	1	The trend has already begun from past few years, Now other crypto currencies are trending along !
0	1522794538	-5	We go up for 24 hours and the moonboys are already back in town. This is embarrassing.
1	1522796249	29	OP provides his analysis and the reasoning behind his conclusion only for people like you to call it embarrassing. If you're not going to provide anything for discussion besides calling him a moonboy, you might as well join an echo chamber and jerk off with all the apocalyptic bears who parrot the samething and call bulls retarded for not seeing the writing on the wall.Instead of name calling, at least comment with something that adds value. We're here to learn. Dissenting opinions are a good thing, and your first instinct shouldn't be to shit on someone for having a differing opinion. He made a sincere attempt to analyze charts. If you disagree so strongly, provide your analysis so maybe we can learn something from you that we didn't know before.
1	1522799222	3	We had almost two weeks of gains before we dropped further. 3 days in this small ride up doesn't confirm a reversal in the downward trend. 
1	1522799338	3	It's not embarrassing.  It just shows we haven't reached despair yet.
2	1522818832	1	We can still have valid technical analysis in despair. I agree that we haven't reached despair yet, but the simple fact that we have valid TA doesn't mean by itself that we can't be in despair.https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2sjia8/adam_and_eve_double_bottom/?st=jfkmxtel&sh=60ef0dbbThis is a technical analysis from January 15, 2015 (the bottom of the dreaded bear-market) that ended up being correct. If the absolute bottom of that bear market wasn't despair, I don't know what is.
2	1522806479	0	We'll have despair at 2500.
3	1522820150	1	Is anybody really feeling more despair at 2500 than at 6k? Nope.. at this point we're all greedy waiting for it to hit 2500 so we can buy more.
