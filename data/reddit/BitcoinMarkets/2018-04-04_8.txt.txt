0	1522859847	4	You’re crazy. They’re advising to diversify because the stock market is experiencing almost unprecedented volatility. Do you really think real investors will pull out of the volatile market to allocate that capital in to an even more volatile asset ?
0	1522846377	2	Bitcoin the asset that goes from 20k to 6k in no time. I can see them all pouring in. 
1	1522848675	4	ummm find another asset that is 500% year-to-year every year. actually see this and judge for yourself since you seem to be new here:Today	-$335.47	-4.52%	↓Last 7 days	-$854.79	-10.77%	↓Last 30 days	-$4,350.57	-38.05%	↓Last 6 months	+$2,856.49	+67.59%	↑Last 1 year	+$5,938.67	+519.23%	↑Last 2 years	+$6,663.00	+1,588.64%	↑Last 5 years	+$6,940.09	+4,876.28%	HMMM wait, is it a good buy?
2	1522849368	5	Hmmmm asset goes up 500% every year, must mean it will keep going up 500% every year. Strong logic. 
3	1522849462	3	first of all, show me a bit stock that went up 500% and we can also BET on it. But you started an argument that it's not good that bitcoin went down but now you say it's not good that it went up. so basically, you are the most pessimistic person every in all situations. well. it's a money market :)
4	1522863529	1	No, i said people who are worried about other markets crashing are not going to put more money into a unregulated crashing market.  I think btc will reach new ath in a year or two but just because it has gone up 500% every year makes it more likely it wont keep going up by those % gains
4	1522860571	1	i thought the import thing is to know what we can lose, not just what can gain.... nothing about optimism/pessimism, just being realistic... 
1	1522849325	1	and sorry to rant a bit more, successful investors do not buy when something is gone from 20k to 40k but they buy when it's from 20k to 7k. If you like buying ATH good for you my bear!
0	1522863087	1	Your optimism is nice, but completely unfounded.  If you look at the stock market chart, and the bitcoin chart, this year, they look very similar, despite their magnitude of drop being different.  Both are currently at a double bottom.  Both are likely to break through the double bottom and drop more.  Hopefully they don't.But if stocks are dropping big time, and crypto is dropping much more, then why would money move into the more volatile market that's on the same path.  It's just a way to multiply your losses, in a bear market fiat is king (or maybe gold, but definitely not crypto, not yet).  I see your post about the gains year over year, the problem is that past performance does not indicate future performance.  While I believe in bitcoin in the long run, the last time the market did what it did last year was in 2014, which triggered a 2 year bear market.  Again, past performance doesn't indicate future performance, but there's a bear outlook for every bull outlook.  Right now all we know is that the markets are all on a downtrend, and until that changes people should be reticent to invest further.  Perhaps we'll double bottom at 6k and pop up, end of the downtrend.  Perhaps we'll drop to 4k, or 3k, or even somehow 1.3k.  Who knows.  Nobody.  5 years down the line will 20k be a thing of the past?  I think so, but a lot of people think it'll be worth 0 too, it all depends on governments, society, markets, and all sorts of stuff that's beyond the scope of prediction.
