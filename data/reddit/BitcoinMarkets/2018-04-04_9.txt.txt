1	1522815205	1	Ah yes, makes sense. Thanks for explaining that.

1	1522808161	3	Thank you. So this also means that in order to make gains (in USD terms) with a short position, I need leverage greater than 1x then. Good to know. I'd not have thought it. Will need to study this in more detail. BTW, this applies on both Bitmex and 1Fox? Sorry, as I'm new to this I'm not sure if perhaps there are any differences between the exchanges.

Use futures if you don't want to worry about fundings or perpertual if you don't want to worry about expiry (funding has historically been more positive than negative so this position can actually makes you money but that is not a sure thing as we can't know how funding will evolve in the future. It could very well be very negative and actually it has been negative for like 2-3 months. If you opened this position in early febuary you would have lost 8%)Depending on how comfortable you are with the risk of Bitmex being hacked/stealing your money, you can use more or less leverage. If you deposit the full 3 BTC you can't get liquidated. Otherwise, put some of it in your cold wallet and the res tot bitmex and only send some btc is the price approches liquidation price.
