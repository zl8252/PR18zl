FRB would be like mt gox telling customers they have bitcoin, when in reality, mt gox doesn't have the bitcoin.I'm having trouble with your fish analogy, are you talking about demand for real bitcoin, that comes from people creating scams and then using that scammed money to buy bitcoin? From the market's perspective, demand from scammers and demand from honest people looks the same, it's still demand.

I know, I'll buy another fish from myself and put it in my other pond, again. Now I'll do that 9,900 times.What even does "buy a fish from myself for myself" mean? Are you saying alt coin developers/teams are participating in wash trading for their own token?Regardless, I'm not following how they then have more money to buy more fish from themselves. Or how at the end they have $99,000 when they were "buying" their own fish the whole time. At the end wouldn't they still just have 10,000 fish?
1	1522949392	1	If you buy a product from yourself and move it off the market you never lose your money and you remove supply from the market.$99,000 is an example of the change in market capitalization that is observed by outsiders watching the composition of your public pond change against the value of the fish you sell.Wash trading is performed by investors, not banks who issue notes.I may be conflating two different issues. Your questions are clearing that up for me a little. Thanks. The two issues I'm conflating are some form of counterfeiting/manipulation that I don't know how to define and this other issue that I'm trying to more clearly understand which are the fractional reserve properties of alts... which is really me asking how fractional reserve banking is similar and dissimilar to an ICO, and how one would model the leverage that's in play in the CC market at any given time.

Why do you have to buy it from yourself to remove it from the market? Or if it was on the market and you didn't put it there you aren't buying it from yourself you're buying it from someone else, correct?
3	1522950866	1	Let's go through a real world example to talk through some of this. I don't quite follow what you're saying and pretty sure there's some logical fallacies in there but maybe it's worth the time to go through it.So to start, say a dev team is running an ICO on ETH for alt coin ALT. They end up receiving 100 ETH in the ICO and issue 1000 ALT for them in addition to keeping 200 ALT for themselves. Trading opens on the ALT/ETH pair at 0.1 ETH per ALT. End result:Dev team: 100 ETH, 200 ALT ("value", though illiquid: 120 ETH)Public: 1000 ALTFor simplicity, let's say BTC is currently valued at 10k and the ETH/BTC ratio is currently 0.1.What financial activity here are you thinking constitutes fractional reserve banking?
4	1522951100	1	The 200 ALT are the fractional reserve.
5	1522951554	2	A fractional reserve implies they would have to borrow to pay everyone back if investors tried to access their funds at the same time. The theory doesn't track at all because the investors bought a product - the ALT. They have no stake on the ETH they gave to the dev team, and they own the ALT they bought with it. What obligation does the dev team have to the investors to pay back what was invested in them?
6	1522951724	1	They don't. This is a great example of how it's not like Fractional reserve banking. Exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.So, what is the 200 ALT that they are sitting on? It was valued at a price that wasn't based on the market's demand.What is the supply that is bought up at auction to fake volume?
7	1522952012	2	Volume can be faked through wash trading but that's a whole nother subject than fractional reserve.The 200 ALT they are sitting on contributes to the total supply of the ALT, but investors invested in the ALT at the ICO price knowing the team would have that supply.Once the ALT makes it past ICO and onto exchanges it's like any other crypto, valued at whatever the market thinks its value is. There is no fractional system for the dev team to prop up its value other than market buying it's own coin with the ETH from ICO which would quickly waste the development money they got.
8	1522952182	1	> There is no fractional system for the dev team to prop up its value other than market buying it's own coin with the ETH from ICO which would quickly waste the development money they got.This describes what's happening in the altcoin space. There are no developers on a lot of these projects. This doesn't describe all projects, but I do think a vast majority of the CC market is doing this and using those tokens to acquire other tokens/Bitcoin. This is what I'm trying to understand so that I can try to model it.
9	1522952635	1	This only effects the ALT's value though and has no effect on the greater market. Unless they incite FOMO they'll have a net loss when they then go back to sell the ALT they bought up.Would be similar to a bitcoin mining operation buying up a ton of BTC to inflate the price so they can sell their mined BTC at a higher price. It has nothing to do with fractional reserve and probably wouldn't work.I more view ALT coin markets as having a double pendulum type effect on BTC's value (where BTC is already a chaotic system).Without ALTs, pretend BTC is a completely definable and predictable system - obviously not true, but pretend. Adding ALT/BTC pairs puts another kink in the pendulum, making the BTC price (the tip of the pendulum) increasingly erratic.
9	1522953147	1	I think it would be more accurate to describe altcoins / ERC20 tokens as a derivatives market around a few base currencies.
3	1522950898	1	>If you owned the product why was it ever on the market?I don't think I understand this question completely. Why wouldn't you want to sell as many goods as possible?>Why do you have to buy it from yourself to remove it from the market?If you are holding an auction you put everything up for sale. If you want ~~sales~~ bids to track somewhat with market prices you have to buy your own underbid products from yourself at market value in order to maintain the value of the product you have up for auction.> Or if it was on the market and you didn't put it there you aren't buying it from yourself you're buying it from someone else, correct?In the example of an auction, you're biding against other people and you are paying yourself when the market is unwilling to meet your prices.
4	1522951268	1	>If you are holding an auction you put everything up for sale. If you want sales to track somewhat with market prices you have to buy your own underbid products from yourself at market value in order to maintain the value of the product you have up for auction.My point is WHY put everything up for sale if you're just going to buy it yourself? I honestly don't follow at all what you're saying. Say ALT/ETH is trading at 0.1 at market and you have some ETH and some ALT. You can only unload as much ALT as others in the market are willing to pay at 0.1. Using your own ETH to buy your own ALT at 0.1 if trading falls below it is literally the same as never selling it at all and wouldn't effect the market price of it.Also see the comment I replied to myself to.
5	1522951541	1	> WHY put everything up for sale if you're just going to buy it yourself?Because the perception of value in unsold goods makes the goods in your auction appear to have more value than the market would otherwise provide; marketing> You can only unload as much ALT as others in the market are willing to pay at 0.1Yes.>Using your own ETH to buy your own ALT at 0.1 if trading falls below it is literally the same as never selling it at all.Yes. But your market cap goes up because the market cap (Qty * Price) is a bad measure of value that everyone looks at. It also looks like there's more volume and activity than there actually is. It's like websites paying for clicks before going public.
6	1522951665	2	Yes but that's not fractional reserve banking, buying up your own sells and vice versa on exchanges is wash trading.Hell it's not even possible to do this on exchanges - if market price falls to 0.08 you won't be able to buy your own supply at 0.1 without buying up other people's limit sells to get to 0.1.
7	1522951804	1	So wash trading happens on both sides of the ICO, in the pre mine and in the auction?
8	1522952148	1	I don't know it's your theory. I don't personally think so.
9	1522952495	1	I'm not finding truly authoritative sources publishing on this, so I'm not sure, either.This seems to be an okay start:https://medium.com/@sylvainartplayribes/chasing-fake-volume-a-crypto-plague-ea1a3c1e0b5e
7	1522951949	1	Also, there's impact of driving down supply to increase the value of the tokens. What is that called? That's what I'm interested in modeling.
1	1522949877	1	There were edits. Sorry about that.
0	1522949030	1	Fish can have babies. 
1	1522949415	1	Yes, and miners can mine.
0	1522952490	1	Your ICO participants will dump on you so unless you have lots of FOMO you'll end up buying back your issued tokens at a huge premium until you run out of ETH/BTC.
