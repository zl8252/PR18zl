Sure Bitcoin could continue bleeding indefinitely, but those shorts will have to close at some point. My gut says that there's a lot more upside potential here, so I'm gambling here with a medium sized long position and plenty of cash to add a lot more if it dips lower (though obviously I have my limits and will not baghold if things turn ugly).
1	1523002107	9	I would add to the bullish case that the CME and CBOE futures volumes are growing steadily and the Coinbase just began its first custodial accounts yesterday.  The necessary infrastructure is just beginning to be in place for onramping institutional money.  That interest is there and it is similar to your friends who want to DCA to build a position, but they haven't had a proper way to do that.
1	1523003187	5	> Reasons to stay bearish in short term:* US, tax day 16th of april.> Reasons to stay bullish in mid term:* consensus 2018 in may. 
2	1523019315	1	> US, tax day 16th of april.Why is this bearish? If anything, it means most of this sell pressure is already over. People aren't gonna risk missing the tax deadline due to withdrawal delays by keeping coins in cold storage until last minute. 
0	1523011115	18	Sun is shining, heading for a 2 day party. Glad to leave this market behind for some time and just have fun. Happy weekend guys, cheers!
1	1523013791	8	See you tomorrow.
1	1523012772	5	Enjoy it man! Rainy and cold here, just like my crypto soul.
0	1523018084	20	After reducing my short position (CA @ 6760) yesterday at 6740 ahead of the (laughable) Coinbase news, I added it all back at 6725 (CA 6750) just after it turned out to be a steamy pile of nothing.Overnight, I set profit-taking stops at 6460, which I missed on this morning's wick by $20. I did have the clarity to add to my short on that ridiculous profit-taking/knife catching bounce, and was able to add at 6645. CA now at 6720.This does feel like the inevitable slog downwards is continuing. 6400-6800 is playing out very similarly to 7400-7800 two weeks ago. For bears with short entries above 6700, patience is probably your best option. For those looking to short, odds are you'll get a better entry than 66xx in the coming hours. Because....Of particular concern to me is what may be a falling wedge forming: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ifuFxAq2/  As such, I have a target to close 80% of my short just over 6500. I'll re-add if the wedge breaks up, or on a bounce if 6500 falls. edit: reduced 33% at 6575. Layered 33% at 6555 and 33% 6525. Final sell actually flips position to 33% long with a stop at 6460. We'll see if I catch the knife or this breaks hard one way or the other. Good luck all. 
1	1523018597	5	Interesting. Thank you!
1	1523018925	2	My 6820 short with 20% hit my profit target, small profit to be honest. I'm waiting for another bounce and see if I go heavier for the weekend, anything above 6800 would be golden. Might try to scalp a small long right now as well.
2	1523019281	5	Risk/reward on a long under 6600 is pretty good with this wedge forming and the solid 6500 support. If you can snag <6600 with stops at 6475, you've got a solid entry. 
3	1523022405	1	If we break up, I'll set take profits on 50 percent of our september long, spread out between 7k and 7.5k, and decide the other 50 percent later.  Going to go set those limits now.
4	1523022554	1	Not enough of my Sept long orders executed yet to make it worth it for me. I'm CA down at 6460 though lol. 
5	1523023073	1	I'm CA 6750.  The position is small but its enough that not taking half of it above 7k would be wasteful.  *At the moment*, I am glad I started to add to it at 7.1k.
3	1523023362	1	I'm sitting on a 5x long at 6525 with a market stop at 6469, took 25% out at 6618 earlier, taking another 50% out at 6649 and gonna leave the rest to see what happens.Still very much learning as I go but last 5 trades have been at least 5% profits, nothing big but profit is profit I guess. 
4	1523023958	1	I'd add a stop loss at 6475 personally, but that sounds like a good trade and a good exit plan. Well done. 
5	1523024891	1	I don't use multiples of 5 for stop losses, don't ask me why!
6	1523025309	1	Then I'd fudge down to your odd number of choice haha $6472.87 sounds good
1	1523020293	2	Nice catch. We've been mirroring this move from january and you can also see the falling wedge there : https://www.tradingview.com/x/zsibIOLZ/ 
2	1523020469	2	Part of me feels like I should just take the close here under 6600. If it's a falling wedge and it breaks like they have been, a 30 second green candle could push me to break even. Better to lock in some profits, perhaps. 
3	1523020715	1	I agree. I wanted to close my 6700 short at 6501 but i missed it by a few dollars on kraken, might as well close it around 6550 for peace of mind (and maybe open a long with a tight stop).
4	1523021148	1	Sold 33% at 6575 and layered the other two sells down to 6500. 
1	1523022235	1	I also missed the same TP this morning.  I've adjusted my plan nearly exactly the same as you.But I still have most of my profit taking around 6480, with just a small amount at 6510.  Maybe I should move some of my lower 6000 takes up to that 6510...A difference on the upward direction, I'm also closing out nearly 50% of the position if we get back up to 6700, to lock in some profits below the CA (which is now 6760).At 6760 I close out another 50% of what's left of that, and the rest of it closes at 6860.  Because at that point of upward movement I can make a new better entrypoint if I still feel like shorting.  (I'm still debating on perhaps just closing out all of it at break even, but I think the extra layering there will be nice in case of wick catching, and there is very little loss locked in with the rate at which I scale it out on the upward.)
2	1523022448	2	I've gotten tired of watching double-digit ROE positions reverse and close at breakeven. I realize now that I'm locking in profits, this will be the time 6400 falls, but I closed 66% of the position (6580 and 6560) and the remaining sell is down at 6615. Actually flips long with a stop at 6450ish. Still, feels good to have some locked in.
3	1523022695	1	> I've gotten tired of watching double-digit ROE positions reverse and close at breakeven.Put it that way.  Yeah, that's a wake up call, thanks.  Even looking at my position where it currently is, I have not claimed an equal amount to what I have already claimed, and it's in double digits.Going to adjust things to not have any loss at all on any stop, and move up my takes aggressivly, only leaving a small percentage to ride later.Gotta reverse the greed balance.
4	1523022894	1	I'm pretty much at break even for the month of April so far, despite having 3 separate >40% stack positions at >20% ROE (on 5x leverage). That right there is a kick in the ass from our favorite deadly sin. 
5	1523023210	1	I'm at a tiny loss.  If I close my short here and now, then I am BE since my last block of trade tracking since March 30th.
5	1523023826	1	I got tired of that so every time i get above 1% i'll start moving my stop loss. Every 100$ move i adjust my stop loss. I might get hunted, but at least i don't lose all the profits.2 months ago i started in Kraken and lost 200$ of my 650$ stack... Almost gave up. Slowly been getting better (or luckier...) and i'm at 865$ now. Trying to get to 1000$ to cashout 350$ (half my investment) and try to repeat untill i get all the investment out.Then i can play with profits .
6	1523024202	1	You can set a trailing stop, too, which I've used with some success. Works best once you're comfortably in profit, though. 
7	1523027012	1	On kraken i don't have that possibility, at least never seen it or don't know how to use it
0	1523029498	20	Only the very worst market crashes will crash by 80%. Assuming the *realistic worst case* scenario for BTC, it could fall a bit further, down to $4k. An important fact to consider though, is that the NASDAQ took almost *three entire years to bottom out* (80% drop) in the 2001 market crash. By comparison, just three months into BTC's crash and we've already fallen by 68%.The NASDAQ had only dropped by 25% after the first three months. We literally appear to be replicating a bubble cycle in months as opposed to years. Much faster moving. With this in mind, we are very likely to recover much faster too.So, realistic worst case: If we go further down and have a full 80% crash, then the timeframe things have unfolded thus far strongly indicate that the bottom will be in at around $4000 in approx one month's time. At this point there will be a gigantic bounce, some levelling off, and a solid foundation from which to start the next bull run later in the year.
1	1523030146	5	I agree with this.Overall sentiment seems to be we're either at the bottom, or Bitcoin could go another leg down to ~4800-5000 and level off with that as our new bottom. Either way sub 3K is looking unrealistic right now. We're discovering our new price, the bear market can only last so long.
1	1523030246	3	It has been a while, but bitcoin has had two corrections of 94%, plus corrections of 85%, 76% and 72%, according to this chart. Not saying it will happen again, but btc does have a history - https://contrarianinvestor.net/posts/2017/12/22/major-bitcoin-corrections-2010-2017
1	1523029962	3	BTC likes crashing 90%. Check the history. 
2	1523030317	4	It's not impossible, but that isn't as realistic imo, as the market has matured considerably since then. I wouldn't rule it out though.
3	1523030552	4	I do think $2K is unrealistic. I actually am tracking about where you are it...80% is where I'd be comfortable throwing all the discretionary money at it. 80% to 90% is an additional 50% drop, and that just doesn't seem plausible. Falling from $4K to $2K is like falling from $20K to $10K, percentage-wise. It can certainly happen, and greed knows no bounds, but I truly hope it doesn't. 
2	1523030186	3	no.
0	1523034793	18	I've got a feeling it's going to be like this for a whale longer.
1	1523035203	10	that was a killer whale pun
2	1523035470	5	Did you have to tail him that?
0	1523014814	17	This thread makes me chuckle sometimes. Some people seem to think there is a covert war going on between a big team of permabears and a big team of permabulls, fighting each other to move the price up/down.
1	1523015273	14	people used to think that gods had a soap opera going on up above the clouds, too.
1	1523014911	4	Leave us kids alone, life is simpler when you can take a side.
1	1523015711	6	There *are* big guys pushing it up and down... they just don't really give a big shit about which way it ultimately goes, change sides all the time, and make money in either case.The cheerleading is ridiculous.
2	1523020628	1	And the small traders are the speculators. Assuming who will win this war
1	1523019864	2	We're all bored waiting on the price to move.  Its a lot more exciting when you can pretend theres an ongoing epic battle being waged in the meantime.
2	1523021047	2	If that is true that would explain the elder scrolls flower collecting & cooking quests. A game for the most concussed of minds where a bit of root can be the most interesting thing in a couple hours.
0	1523033100	13	I've seen a lot of posts recently from people complaining about trolls, low effort/meme posters, etc. Guys, just hit that handy dandy report button, choose block user, and you'll never see those people again. You might miss out on some sick burns, but that's probably not what you're here for. Control what you can control, easy peasy.
1	1523033540	3	This ^
0	1523027398	23	It sounds like the majority of people here who think the price will continue to drop fully intend to buy BTC *at some point.* sounds like a pretty bullish long term indicator to me... thoughts?
1	1523029046	6	Well, the passing of time has always been bullish for bitcoin. It would take a piece of news that kills bitcoin to ensure it doesn't ever bubble again.
1	1523029302	7	People need to realize that there is a time and place for being a bull and being a bear. Prices going up forever is unsustainable  (permabulls) and nobody wants to just sell an asset into oblivion (permabears). We need a balance of both for a healthy long-term market 
1	1523029116	4	I think it is long term for a sizable bounce off a low, I have fiat sitting in Gemini waiting for reentry. But the problem won't be getting people like me back in once we get closer to 2-3x where we were last year, it will be getting the retail investors back in. Far too many got burned last year buying in at >10K and this whole crypto thing is becoming more and more synonymous with "ponzi" among my nocoiner friends. To them the 19K moon and subsequent crash didn't confirm that its the future, but that it was a bubble.
2	1523029521	2	The growth and crash from 6k to 20k and back down was caused by the normies and never meant to be. If we just cut out this period and stablizes somewhere around here we can argue that crypto is still in organic growth.
1	1523028051	5	I think the majority of BTC shorters (at least here) are simply doing so to acquire more BTC or to hedge cold storage stacks. People savvy enough to trade BTC (and not get instarekt) are probably at least cautiously long-term bullish. 
2	1523028195	2	I think you're right. I do wonder though if the concept of hold & hedge short is lost on a lot of the newer money who sees the shorts making profits, and wants to tag along (but doesn't own the underlying asset)
3	1523028432	4	Ironically, I don't actually hold the underlying asset anymore either, outside my trading stack. That was a decision I had to make for personal reasons, not because I don't think it'll go up eventually. Funds I didn't need became funds I did need. I was fortunate to sell over $11K though. My whole goal of my trading stack is to rebuild cold storage, and if I can do that with a CA under $6K I'd be thrilled. 
4	1523029169	2	I'll never forgive you for selling.In all seriousness, I'm sorry you had to do that, but you are not alone. Another bullish indicator is that I believe much of the recent sell pressure likely has come from "need to sell" (your situation, taxes, etc) as opposed to "want to sell" (I think it's going lower, lost faith, etc)
5	1523029427	3	We'll see. I do think most people that are selling under $10K are intending to buy back lower (and many of them already have). However, there is an entire subset of holders in the <$6K cost average range that haven't been threatened in 8 months. We could see a new wave of selling if $6K falls, and that's the biggest concern I have. I also haven't heard a compelling argument as to *why* the trend should reverse that isn't predicated on "because it will probably be worth more later." That's a legitimate reason, but it shouldn't be the primary reason. 
1	1523029752	6	Speaking for myself who held through the 2014-2016 bear market, the longer this current one draws out the less urgency I feel in buying whatever price we hit whether it be $6000, $5800, etc, if it goes that low. My optimistic opinion is that we will probably range sideways between $5K-$8K for months before we see any significant price action. While trying to catch the bottom based on TA is what a lot of people are trying to do, I'm looking for a change in market sentiment as I am looking for entry for a long term hold. Hearing that price should go up because of a short squeeze screams bearish to me. Even bearish than 2014-2016 because in hindsight there was so much to look forward to in terms of adoption and technological advances (segwit, LN). Well now that we've made leaps and bounds in that aspect, what's next? What's the next growth driver? We've clearly hit a serious bottleneck and I don't believe TA is going to get us back anywhere near ATH or even half that.
1	1523027882	3	>It sounds like the majority of people here who think the price will continue to drop fully intend to buy BTC *at some point.* >>sounds like a pretty bullish long term indicator to me... thoughts?Bullish from a lower entry point, perhaps. 
1	1523027525	8	> sounds like a pretty bullish long term indicator to me... thoughts?I would take it with a huge pinch of salt as an indicator, the people posting here are not the average jonny come lately who stores all his BTC on his Coinbase App and goes to youtube shills for his trading advice.
2	1523027651	2	I understand that it's anecdotal, and I wouldn't ever use just one indicator. It's one of many inputs, but it skews bullish to me for sure.
2	1523028461	2	Hmmm, sorry but since the mainstream rise, this sub definitely sounds like that. not all, but a lot...
0	1523011788	12	longing here since around 6450$ 2kBTC wall is still on kraken EURBTC and since the sell pressure is kinda low (ATH shorts etc) I doubt that we will even test it.
0	1522988715	8	For those that might have missed it (he posted them late), /u/ozone63 had some great charts in yesterday's Daily ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/89wnoa/daily_discussion_thursday_april_05_2018/dww6j9x/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/89wnoa/daily_discussion_thursday_april_05_2018/dww8wcm/)).
0	1522988939	10	No reaction to the India ban really.Trading on bisq might get better with more volume.
1	1522989099	10	That's good news. The bottom is going to be where fud and bad news don't push the price down. I'm not sure if this is it, but it's a data point
2	1522990692	4	Exactly, I really don't believe in news hype, but it does affect it short-term.   I think it's a useful tool to see how sensitive the market is, during the bull run even a China ban had a big drop but it kept resuming pretty quick.   If a China ban happened during our massive fall that would have really hurt.   So interesting to see how news affects the price in the short-term, tells you something about how the markets feel. 
2	1522993263	1	You got it!!
0	1522993806	9	Dear Diary,I checked the charts, and still did not buy Anyone having a guess at how long the downtrend/leveling will go? I’m daft throwing 3-9 months
1	1522995880	8	I'm thinking something along the same lines, 6-ish months of stagnation followed by a very slow grind up Before that though, one more major leg down to truly reach despair
1	1522995677	6	My Buy orders or now between 2k and 3k at random numbers, hoping for a Mega Panic after the Next Support Level Breaks Down.
2	1522996790	3	This. I have them spread out every hundred from 3 to 2. If it goes lower ohthefuckwell
1	1522994543	6	2 or 3 more months bottom around 5k I reckon
1	1522999768	2	I think at least 6 months of downward movement
1	1522995256	2	i am betting on the 3k region around june 2019
0	1523014023	11	Surprised at the sudden energy of that bounce.  Even more surprised at the rejection of that bounce.
1	1523014315	9	this market feels so.. degenerate. During that bounce, all the major coins moved in coordination and sync. Just like every movement in January, February, and March. Across all exchanges.. I probably counted 15 separate times across the last 3 months that all the coins moved exactly the same way, down to the second, across all exchanges. Ugh. NEO, LTC, BTC, every up and down is identical. For months. On all exchanges. Everything seems completely scripted. This is no natural market.
2	1523014377	6	Probably only because bots are trading all the coins
2	1523014441	2	Lowest market cap in a whillllle
2	1523014867	1	DiVeRsIfIeD PoRtFolLiO
1	1523014208	3	Could be in for another sequel of yesterday's rangebound choppy stalemate
2	1523014652	3	That's what it looks like to me too.   My short CA is now in the center of the previous range at 6770, after adding to it down here. Going to reduce the position by 50% in a profit zone if we go above 6700 or below 6500.  And nearly clear it out just above break even, because surely at that point I'll be able to build a new better CA (or stay on sidelines) if it comes to that.
3	1523014818	2	Similar thoughts here, also scaling down my short position from a similar CA. Was really expecting 6500 to not hold up this time, and it still may not, but it's gonna take a bearwhale push that I can't count on
4	1523015552	2	Yeah that last push down missed my next TP by like $15 :/Since I was watching and at the controls, normally I would just hit market buy in the case that it looks like the price is about to fall short of my limit, but on MEX that could have caused huge upward slippage.
0	1523017718	7	I just noticed this is the 2nd weekly candle that has (so far) found support exactly at the 52-week SMA (unless my app distorts the chart -> correct me)I think this is an important level to look for - on one hand, I'd expect most bullwhales and big fishes alike to find the 1-year average a good buying priceOn the other hand, this seems like a great opportunity for the bears to wreck most of the remaining confidence which is putting even more pressure on the bulls Personally, I doubt it will hold: every move up keeps getting rejected and the big-ass bear flag from 9k (12h chart) started breaking downwards, but all guessing aside - this should be a bloody battle
1	1523018447	1	Use the 60 week EMA and it becomes even clearer what's going on ;)
0	1522988687	8	Almost every major market on https://cryptowat.ch looks like it's improving over the past 24 hours... which probably means we're about to dump some more imho.
0	1523031877	6	This is boring... 
1	1523032740	2	weekend dip inbound though?
2	1523033115	2	everything pointing to 6k breaking this weekend...so it will probably pump to 8k
0	1523033545	7	Just bought a little. Now have 25% of what i want to hold long term.
1	1523034347	3	Nice, congratulations.   Good timing on the buy IMO. 
0	1523034725	6	BTC now has the price action of a low volume altcoin.  Except it doesn't know who to follow.
0	1523029813	13	SEC Quietly Puts Bitcoin ETF Proposals Back on the Table .I rember, a year ago ppl where predicting the price would go up to 3500$ if the bitcoin ETF would be accepted...
1	1523030209	10	> SEC Quietly Puts Bitcoin ETF Proposals Back on the Table .https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-quietly-puts-bitcoin-etf-005046446.htmlin my opinion, it's just a matter of time before they approveFor the lazy:The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has quietly begun considering two Bitcoin ETF proposals, public documents show.According to SEC documents dated March 23, the agency has instituted formal proceedings to determine whether to approve a rule change that would allow NYSE Arca to list two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) proposed by fund provider ProShares.ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF would each hold Bitcoin futures contracts, providing retail investors with the ability to indirectly invest in the flagship cryptocurrency — or bet against it — through a familiar investment product.“The Commission is instituting proceedings pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved. Institution of such proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change,” the order says.ProShares had first proposed these two funds in September — before CBOE and CME had launched their Bitcoin futures products — and NYSE Arca began seeking SEC approval to list these funds in December.However, as CCN reported, the SEC requested that fund providers withdraw their Bitcoin ETF applications and issued a statement expressing reluctance to approve these products until more investor protections are put in place.Last month, Chris Concannon, president of CBOE, penned a letter to the SEC asking them to consider Bitcoin ETF proposals on a case-by-case basis rather than as a product class. He noted that CBOE has successfully cleared several rounds of Bitcoin futures expirations without incident and said that the Bitcoin markets are rapidly maturing and could soon warrant a regulated ETF.Per SEC guidelines, the proposed rule change will be published in the Federal Register, after which the public will have 21 days to comment and an additional 14 days to submit rebuttals to other comments.Comments can be submitted through email or the SEC website, and commenters should reference file number SR-NYSEArca-2017-139 on the subject line.
1	1523030055	10	And it still might reach that price!

0	1522997431	6	Can't help but feel this is the prelude to the weekend dip. A test of 6400/6500 sure. But the carnage could happen tomorrow / Sunday.
1	1522997897	5	So optimistic. I suspect many underwater longs will use every little bounce to cut their losses.
2	1522998167	1	> So optimistic. I suspect many underwater longs will use every little bounce to cut their losses.Na, I'm totally neutral and think it'll go down. Just I've been watching the charts for months now and you don't usually get three days of downtrend without some bounce. Meaning this could well settle down, consolidate then the bottom could fall out from under it Saturday evening through to Sunday.
0	1522998627	7	held short throught 6500 and 6400, didnt close, didnt take profits, thinking "lets not be too hasty". price does not go down any more, instead starts slowly recoverying.close some of the same short (originally from 7500) @7300 "it could go up more, need more bullets". price indeed goes to 7500, but then falls sharply to 6600, im left emptyhanded (my add was @7800, which we never made).ok, oversold now, goes to 6800-6900, Coinbase news coming. must be a good time to close some of the short again @6760, "lets not be too greedy this time, take profits when  we can"'? nope, price falls straight to 6500.TLDR sell low, buy high, bitcorn does whatever it wants.
1	1522999815	1	Decrease position size and implement stop losses to cut away the emotion.
2	1523001202	1	I feel like I mostly made the correct decisions and the overall strategy to rely on the bear trend is correct. Have to work on my timing tho, missing the first 6500 dip to take profits was an obvious mistake, conditions were so clearly oversold. Selling some @7300 was debatable, as I still had ammo left anyway. Selling before the news yesterday was probably overdoing it, the uptrend was clearly broken and was false to presume it would recover quickly.Ive actually completely given up on using any stop losses and so far that has been a very good decision for me. Stack management - to have more bullets when going seems risky - and taking profits at the correct time is a way better method. With this chop up and down, stops just mean you aim to sell or buy at unfavorable prices. That said, I dont use any leverage at all, so my approach probably differs from the others here.

0	1523006007	8	https://www.tradingview.com/chart/YDnHyC4O/Posted this chart here yesterday. Wondering if it will play out.
0	1523028993	7	Closing half my short from 8.4K here and locking in profit, don't want to regret it later if this bounces up off the triple bottom plus estimated funding at >-.1% is getting heavy with no relief next round. This 6.4-5 level has proven to be a local bottom, and even though I'm sure half of it is spoofing there is still more buy orders down to 6400 than there are up to 7000. BTW looking at the combined order book its absolutely insane how much Bitmex has completely taken over the market.
0	1523029723	7	Not sure how to interpret it either way but this is easily the most time we've spent hanging out in the 6500 range. Our previous trips were short lived, for an hourish. So while sellers may "seem tired", so are buyershttps://www.tradingview.com/x/QkaUSak7/So we've got this small falling wedge we could be in (dotted purple), or a larger version of it (solid blue) that could have a ways to go before we find support...right at...6k.
1	1523030323	2	we have found the final price of Bitcoin apparently
2	1523030625	4	oh sweetie
0	1523036741	8	I exited the remainder of my short from 6750 at 6585. Average exit was 6560. I still have my small Sept futs long (CA 6410) with layered adds down to 6040. Without holding a short position, this concerned me a little bit, but I would be very surprised if all those executed between now and tomorrow morning. We've got a bear pennant inside a falling wedge, which is weird: https://www.tradingview.com/x/lfYMavol/  We somehow can't break 6500, yet we also can't really break over 6650 either. I haven't checked the bbands, but they have to be tightening like crazy on shorter time frames. I probably would have left my short position open, but I'm getting ready to travel for a bit here and won't be looking the charts for the next 24 hours or so.I'm leaning towards putting in a few laddered limit sells from 6800-7400, although I somewhat expect it to move the other direction if it breaks hard. The falling wedge is throwing me for a bit of a loop, though.Good luck all. 
0	1523013812	13	Finally chickened out and initiated a large (for me) wire transfer to my favorite exchange to get my cost average down. My thoughts are that it's looking really shitty at the moment. Bearish sentiment, charts painted with blood - and when I'm in doubt, I usually buy. We're a few months out from the big crash, may go a bit lower but I'm not expecting much drama. As usually happens when I decide to buy, the price will likely pump a bit, at least temporarily, before leaving me sitting on my bags.
1	1523014185	3	But what about the 2k doom Bois?I’m a permabull mostly holding xmr, but it’s starting to feel like super painful. 
2	1523015676	3	The whole thing is looking eerily similar to Apr 2013 play out. Replace 20k with $200, replace 6k with $60.What happens now is anyone's guess, but back then people were saying $20 or $10 was imminent. Obviously everything is different now - except it isn't.
1	1523014312	7	Cost average doesn't matter.  Entry price doesn't really matter.  All that matters is the price/value now and if you think it's going up or down.  I make that same mistake as well, but it really isn't logical.  
2	1523014578	4	The lower the price, the greater the "multiplier" I'm buying with the same amount of fiat. The lower my cost average, the bigger my potential gain. If I were using leverage I'd agree with you, you could buy at $20k and short and be massively in profit, but that's not my game at the moment.
0	1523021352	12	Market stays flat with little to no volume until a whale comes along and pushes it $200 in either direction.  Then it sits flat for another while, until a whale comes along...All this makes TA's value in this market highly questionable.  TA is meant to predict the psychology of a large aggregate group of investors.  But when you reach a state where the only thing really moving the market is a handful of individuals...Edit: posted this before I saw this comment from /u/DaFlyingGriffin saying basically the same thing:https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8a6k3w/daily_discussion_friday_april_06_2018/dwws8v6/
1	1523021787	6	Thanks for the shout-out! I just wanted to warn people to be careful about shorting the bottom right now. This could swing either way over the next few hours, and you don't want to be caught holding the bags.
2	1523022078	2	This is the bottom? Why?
3	1523022165	3	Short-term bottom. Nobody knows where the true bottom is yet if we're being honest with ourselves here.
3	1523023038	2	The short interest on Bitfinex is incredibly high right now. Something to be mindful of if you're short. We could get a hell of a squeeze if shorts start blinking.But I also mean short-term bottom.
1	1523021491	2	Agreed, but the whales seem to be using TA as well. Most movements happen at key points. Majority of whales are pushing every chance of recovery down though. They want cheaper coins.
2	1523021799	1	And they are faking everyone out on to breakouts thats does not happen until they move the price to the opposite direction, hunt the SL and than go back to where it should go.
0	1523034691	13	We are currently in the downtrend channel from ATH, and if we stay in it until June the 1st, the best case scenario for BTC would be 3,5k. At this moment I do not see us breaking that resistance, not even in the near future. Been using this downtrend for a longer time, but I have never actually checked where do we go if BTC stays in this channel. 3,5k in less then two months, scary... [Blue lines channel](https://www.tradingview.com/x/CEcnAsWO/)In that channel, we have even steeper downtrend channel, breaking that would be the first bullish sign for me [Purple line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v6z6vKQO/)My thoughts on this range, we have found very strong support [green dotted line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/B3PfQL5a/), this support so far seems incredibly strong, rejecting further fall three times already and still rejecting crash in this strong downtrend. While support is keeping BTC alive, there is lack of buyers at this moment, BTC stopped bouncing and none wants to risk their fiat for the small percentage of a profit in this manipulated market.Soros information from today can be of a crucial importance, that made me even more insecure about market movement. Although he publicly told in January that BTC is in a bubble and a lot of people are expecting that he will short BTC to the ground, something fishy is going on. Why not start trading and shorting BTC on ATH or at higer prices, why start shorting it now? Especially if you are one of the top investors ever.Today I am withdrawing all my crypto assets into FIAT and waiting for a stronger signals. I learned valuable lessons in this 4 months, invested in ATH as a complete noob, lost 20% of my portfolio, and managed to get it all back shorting on Kraken and buying the dips. I thank you all for your inputs here, if it wasn't for this subreddit I would be stuck with huge losses probably for couple of years. Thank you all and good luck with trading.
1	1523035233	3	Not sure about that downtrend channel from ATH. Many have it here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/qqe7nHmG/

1	1523034909	1	> invested in ATH as a complete noob, lost 20% of my portfolio, and managed to get it all backImpressive. Really.
1	1523034972	1	> Why not start trading and shorting BTC on ATH or at higer prices, why start shorting it now? Especially if you are one of the top investors ever.Because shorting isn't the only way to trade, perhaps. 
2	1523035040	2	Thats why I said that something fishy here is going on. I won't roll the dice and let the fate decide about my investment, which at this moment is nothing but a gamble
3	1523035559	2	You're going to sell the potential bottom or close to that? I don't see the point unless you either don't see Bitcoin and the markets to comeback in the near future, you need the money or you see it going way lower.   Non of them (except needing the money for you) make much sense, but if it helps you sleep at night that's good. 
4	1523035765	2	No, I am out until the situation becomes clearer, I had some alts from the drop couple of days ago, and that profit almost melted. Now it's unclear where do we go, and I'll rather catch a bounce later and miss some profits than risk a wrong move now
0	1523014273	7	Long from 6530, target at 6900 with stops at 6450. I will exit early if time drags (24 hours) and the month-long downtrend becomes a threat. If we spike hard I'll move up target to 7000. 
1	1523014495	4	Nice entry

I'm being more flexible on the potential sell target, but first TP would probably be 7k-ish, and I could even see holding onto this for months (though I could let it go within days).

2	1523024467	3	Soros is a great boogeyman.
3	1523025063	8	Watch his interviews if you haven't. He has no sense of personal responsibility when it comes to manipulating markets because "someone else would have done it anyways". That's all I needed to hear to figure out what kind of person he is.
4	1523025422	1	Oh, I agree. I don't mean to be flippant or dismissive. People are definitely manipulating the crypto mark8ets and I'm sure he sees an opportunity to do the the same. I just mean we already have boogeymen in the market when the price drops, so now we have another. And he has a history of being a tip tier boogeyman. I guess "boogeyman" is a bad term when he could actually be guilty of crypto market manipulation. Dude is rich, and it doesn't take much money to really screw with the cryptomarkets. 
0	1523026806	6	Last week when the price dropped to 6500 [for the first time after the big February drop] i used all my fiat to buy alts that i had kept to reinvest since January. Still not sure if it was a good or bad move, although I've been pretty lucky with my trades, most of which are based on my gut feeling + reading news + reading TA that are published by traders + [of course] reading this sub. Eh. It's getting harder and harder for me to believe that we are going to see a bull run anytime soon though.EDIT: by no means I want anyone else to follow my steps, just wanted to share!
1	1523026977	2	Do alts hit usually their bottom the same timeAs ETH and BTC or is there usually a lag?
2	1523027223	2	i've noticed that alts are being hit much harder than btc but they often recover much faster as well.When we went up to 7500 I've had pretty good gains (in both usd and btc) that i wouldn't have had if i kept btc only. Yet i didn't sell anything, most of the time I'm just a hodler due to the lack of trading knowledge. EDIT: i think i misinterpreted your question for some reason, sorry about that, too much caffeine today! i can see other people already replied to your actual question
0	1523036334	6	jesus christ,the no of shorts atm.i cant go short with the entire herd.i cant figure this market out.\have a very strong feeling we will retest 7.8 k since we didtn in the most recent fakeout.think liquidating a bunch of nooby shorts right now would be perfect for liquidity when we really drop down .have a supertiny short locked in at 6,6 k just t oget a foot in.am going out now and fully expect to see a random ass green candle 
1	1523036875	2	Candles are out of stock. Would you be interested in a long multi-color horizontal channel? But has to be a narrow one, we're also out of wide channels.
0	1523015620	10	[deleted]
1	1523016547	4	Yes, I realized that as I played. Now I limit myself to one or two trades per day, and it's been pretty successful so far. Low risk moves, tight stop loss, a little bit of TA (and fractals, those sweet fractals) and a lot of self restraint and you can make a good amount of money.
1	1523016589	3	I just stopped paying attention tbhit's a lot easier and nicer when you only look every few hours

1	1523020480	1	I agree with you. Although most of the traders have been loosing now awaydays if they have the patience maybe...
0	1522994764	14	*sigh*The direction is down. UGH. This sucks.
1	1522997088	4	1d chart is telling a pretty clear and consistent story.
0	1523025933	17	 I don't buy the idea it's going to $3K anymore than I did the run to $20K. The overly bearish sentiment in here in the belief that it's absolutely going much, much lower, is a sign to counter trade. Bull div on the 4hr and tons of shorts on the books can provide the fuel to move higher. 
1	1523026461	18	Being a contrarian to the market is all well and good, except sometimes the market is right.I've seen supposed trading gurus parrot this in different mediums for weeks now and it's borderline moronic "Everyone and their dog is bearish im bullish" - Price falls another 1000 dollars "I just think everyone is too bearish the market isn't going to just fall while everyone is short" - Price falls another 1000 dollars "I think market sentiment is too bearish we are going up"  etc etc.
2	1523027828	2	Yeah I think that's something that people miss when they say something like this is that they compare the current bear market to the bull run of last year as if being contrarian in that market was always the right move from the get go. People were insanely bullish calling for 20,30,50,100k for *months* before we got to ATH, just because a bunch of people are bearish and are calling for 1k now doesn't mean that the bear market is going to suddenly reverse only a few months in. It didn't when it was the other way around...It took more time.
3	1523029497	2	And just cause we never reach 1k....well even 'only' 5k is still a 25% drop from 6.5k, which I would like to profit on both ways. In the same way that 15k->20k was "just" a 33% increase instead of 4x +
1	1523026155	7	Please give me a reason why BTC will exit the 4-month downtrend that doesn't involve two indicators that a lot of people are selling and shorting. I'd love to hear one. Also, in order to exit the downtrend, we'd have to pass and hold above $9500 currently. Climbing to $8K is not a reversal of the market, it's a reversal of the short-term trend.Also, I'm not sure what there is to "buy" on the run to 20K. That happened.
1	1523026339	8	How can you think we will just exit this downtrend because of a bit of bull div and open shorts... We aren't dropping very hard but you know what's even more absent? The price going up... We are at 6500, in february this price had has us bouncing up immediately. Now? Nothing lol
2	1523026650	1	Well technically 5800 was when the bounce happened in Feb.
3	1523027033	2	True but we really blasted through the 6000 range and we had a short lived bounce at 6500. What I mean is that the price could not remain so low for so long. It either bounced or dropped, people were panic selling and catching knives. It was chaos, not this sideways apathy and uncertainty we have now. 
1	1523026130	3	Good luck, maybe this time it will work. People are trying this for weeks now and get absolutely rekt.
1	1523026236	2	I don't see any bull div on the 4hr. Even if we went to 3k it won't be straight down we could easily have 2-3k pumps on the way down
2	1523026652	3	Such big (2-3k) pumps/drops will become more and more difficult. 
0	1523021538	12	Today, /r/ethtrader has the most positive sentiment I've ever recorded for that sub.Also, /r/CryptoCurrency has the most negative sentiment I've ever recorded for that sub.Google Search trends seem to be flattening out after their huge drop-off./r/BitcoinBeginners has the closest positive [correlation](http://distributed.love:8081/correlation) of sentiment with the price, at 0.57. /r/Technology has the closest negative correlation, at -0.52.[¿What is this?](https://www.reddit.com/user/samjhill/comments/85lycx/what_is_distributedlove/)
1	1523022154	21	A big number of people on /r/ethtrader bought in somewhere between $40 and $200, held through the peak to $400 that dumped to low $100s, then sat through half a year of sideways grind around $300 all the while basically every other crypto posted x10 gains. The subsequent peak to $1000+ dumping back to high $300s is familiar territory to many, I'd imagine.Also, a lot of people that are heavily into ETH genuinely believe it's the best crypto project there is; I'd imagine they have as much if not more 'brand loyalty' as the most hardcore BTC fanboys 5 years ago did. 
2	1523022806	5	Pretty accurate read of the situation IMO as someone who was an early 2017 adopter of ETH and was on ethtrader regularly back then
1	1523021704	10	/r/ethtrader is deluded basically all the time. the degree just varies
2	1523022041	6	This is true, try telling them after they 100x in a year that maybe its a bit frothy and you are downvoted to oblivion while everyone remarks about being entitled to 1000x in a year.
2	1523024463	4	Honestly we just keep it more light there than here. I go to ethtrader for entertainment and to bitcoinmarkets to know how fucked my investment is
1	1523021606	2	guessing because ethtrader thinks they've found their bottom
2	1523022221	3	ETH has gotten wrecked, even compared to BTC. down 75% from ATH is lower than BTC has gone, and if BTC goes there, they'll pass 80% I'm sure. I'm pretty happy I sold all my ETH over $800
3	1523022596	1	I held way too long but still got out in the low 6's/high 5's when BTC was crashing. Timing sucked in the short term but ended up working out okay.If BTC does end up going to 5k, ETH could glance 300, at which point I will have to start buying again for my hodl stack
4	1523022659	3	Agreed, LTC under $100 and ETH under $300 feel like necessary adds, even though I'm not a big believer in alts. 
0	1523032341	11	Seeing some pretty odd market behavior here:https://imgur.com/a/MNvF1The market broke down pretty undeniably from a consolidation pattern, but stopped well short of its target. I'd have expected to see fairly rapid decline down below $6,000 following the breakdown of that formation, but the market is choosing to hover just above $6,600 instead. The ultimate direction should be down once support-turned-resistance is tested at around $6,800 (give or take). Or possibly sooner if the market continues to dilly dally in the $6,600s for much longer.
1	1523033402	5	Chew, this could just be recency bias, but do you feel like you've been describing market movements as "odd" more and more recently?
2	1523035273	6	Well, movements have been "odd" more and more lately, so yes. Every single pump and dump, for example, has been absolutely bananas. It's pretty strange to dump through a critical support zone, consolidate for awhile, pump back above that support zone, and then dump back below it again less than 24 hours later. I don't want to cry "manipulation," but I certainly wouldn't classify that sort of behavior as "normal."
1	1523033398	5	Are you still out of position? I'm going to be traveling and then sleeping for 18 of the next 24 hours, over a fri/sat no less, and I think fully exiting my short (6750) here and sitting on the sidelines might be the best place for me.A weird bear pennant type formation with two fakeouts inside a falling wedge...I mean...I still think the path of least resistance is down, but odd market behavior indeed: https://www.tradingview.com/x/fFAHprX6/
2	1523034699	2	> sleeping for 18 of the next 24 hoursI didn't know my dog was on reddit
1	1523033756	3	this is why i closed my short. opened at 6750, the consolidation made me think we would see a pretty big jump and i put a bet that it will be down. got the direction right but not the momentum so i closed at 6609.Considering longing but im not really in a hurry to take a position

0	1523029791	4	Hit some of my limit buys last at around 8500 CAD. Increased my position for the summer boom! 
0	1523034954	3	I've been experimenting with different types of volume manipulation and created my own OBV. Volume is indexed from BFX, GDAX, Bitstamp, and Kraken. I'm not trying to call a bottom, but with the available data I have, I don't see any reason to not start scaling into a LT position (albeit slowly). I think it's unlikely we'll reach sub-5k levels.https://www.tradingview.com/x/93ihvUMn/
1	1523035051	3	If you're not incorporating Bitmex, you're missing perhaps the most meaningful volume data.
2	1523035149	4	Bitmex actually accounts for almost 90% of the volume, but I left it out since you're not actually buying or selling bitcoin on that exchange.I can pull up a chart of Bitmex XBTUSD OBV later, if you're interested in seeing the result.
3	1523035937	2	That's a reasonable point, and I'd certainly appreciate that if you have time.
0	1523035255	5	Wow, this is insanely boring today. I don't think I remember day with lesser volatility since morning dump than today. Not even 100$ movement
1	1523035580	7	Yet why did I spend almost all day with an eye on the charts. I swear to god I watch the charts more when they're stagnant. 
2	1523036134	2	You know why - the more stagnant it apears, the more jarring the breakout will be. A quick finger on the button can save percentages.
3	1523036452	2	Yeah, that's basically it. It's a special kind of torture. The less exciting the charts the more important it is to watch them. I spent 2 months watching charts everyday of ETH consolidating at $300. Thinking everday that *this* will be the day. Well eventually that day came.
1	1523036298	3	I like low volatility periods. Something about stable market prices makes me think that bitcoin is more likely to gain legitimacy. 
0	1523036940	5	The daily is showing divergence [again](https://snag.gy/UFVf6e.jpg), last time we had a jump from 7.6 to 9.1 but to be fair divergence can go on for a good amount of time and it's only 1 indicator.    I haven't seen the [stoch on the 4hr](https://snag.gy/Ywz3bn.jpg) this flat and the MACD lead is flattening with BBands tightening.  Like I was saying before shorts at an ATH is a recipe for a target.   I feel the overall market sentiment leaning more and more to this being accumulation even with consistent bears, but until we move up it's not confirmed and it would make sense to ride the bear trend. 
1	1523037681	4	I don't think it makes sense to take a short position here for anything more than a scalp. It looks like we're somewhere near the end of both a corrective fifth wave and/or a corrective C wave. When the bottom is firmly established we're probably going to find ourselves in a slow rise that doesn't show clear signs of having escaped the bear market. It will be gradually harder to be a bear and it wont make a lot of sense why.https://www.tradingview.com/x/RJ3YKgEd/
2	1523037839	2	Ya I personally don't think it makes much sense but until we start going higher it makes sense to ride the trend even though I wouldn't do it. 
1	1523037411	2	> make sense to ride the bearThe 5 minute candles on Finex show the push for breakout with consistently being denied - like a raging animal that has been kept in captivity for years and is now seeing the bright light; but as you said still in captivity (bear trend)
0	1522996274	13	yeah, i would sell the bottom of the trend line too... if i was a fucking retard. 
0	1522998622	8	I swear to god if this pumps up again im gonna lose my shit
1	1522998906	4	pretty sure it's just bear flagging before the dump resumes
0	1523014298	8	Dead rat bounce.
0	1522994696	12	The Equilibrium pattern may have just started a bear break. Entering short now. Hope to ride it until support @ 6400.
1	1522995208	2	What is your entry? Im hesitant to short from here, the past two times its dipped its gone straight back up a few hours later. What indicates that we just started a bear break?Edit: theres my answer
2	1522995272	4	volume just picked way up and buyers are not pushing back
2	1522997364	1	Entered at 6650 when I noticed the triangle pattern broke to the downside.RSI isn't oversold yet. There's some more room to the downside before that happens. Bear flags during the descent will only delay RSI from getting oversold.
0	1522997517	6	so now you know where this thing will bounce to when we hit 5k's 6.7k should be the new 7.8k resistance.plan accordingly

1	1523024430	4	and after the chinese new year, wall street bonuses and LN network ?
1	1523023475	12	Shouldn't most people have paid taxes by now? Is anybody really waiting 9 more days in a bear market to cash out to pay taxes? Also didn't a huge chunk of the market just buy and hold last year and therefore not have to pay any taxes in 2017?This feels like a Tom Lee talking point to explain away a bubble burst.
2	1523023703	7	I think the tax pressure happened a while ago and now the market is largely being driven by TA downtrend momentum.
2	1523023684	3	what people should do and what people actually do are very different. the estimate for the total tax burden for cryptos in 2017 in the us alone is $25B. that money has to come from somewhere, and there are most certainly many people who still haven't paid
3	1523023795	2	Does anybody know how this 25 billion is estimated?
4	1523023889	1	a percentage of the total amount traded by US citizens? considering every trade is a profit for somebody.
5	1523024088	1	I don't think this would necessarily accurately gauge it though. If say 70% of people in 2017 only bought and never sold, and only 30% of people who bought crypto sold/traded at some point last year, there could be a ton of paper profits but only a relatively small amount of tax liabilitiesMaybe I'm missing something but it seems it would be difficult to estimate. Maybe Tom Lee has access to several exchanges' data, that seems to be the only accurate way to estimate which users sold for how much profit.
6	1523024820	3	This doesn't answer your question, but its information. "The projected tax liability is based on taxable gains for crypto of $92 billion""Fundstrat also said crypto exchanges posted record profit in November and December and are expected to have huge tax liabilities, which should add to further selling in crypto-currencies. Many of the exchanges have net income exceeding $1 billion in 2017 and keep their working capital in bitcoin and ether, the research firm added."https://in.reuters.com/article/crypto-currencies-taxes/u-s-tax-liabilities-for-crypto-currencies-in-2017-seen-at-25-billion-to-pressure-bitcoin-fundstrat-idINKCN1HC2A6

1	1523032929	8	My school of thought he is too cool to play by the book. Shorting the coin at this stage won't call for the best story 10 years later. However, what would become an epic story is to take this thing to new ATH and drop it from there.
2	1523033237	3	Well he likely won't be alive in 10 years but yes, he fudded at ATH and now he is going to trade it all of a sudden. Sounds coincidental.
3	1523033970	3	I have a Hungarian friend who is always talking about how Soros wants to break up traditional hierarchies / Instituions.Always surprised me he was against crypto - would make sense he just wanted to buy in cheaper. Hopefully that’s the case as would be great to have him on the crypto train.
1	1523032571	6	I am thinking the same, whatever he decides it's gonna be influential on market
2	1523033230	3	Yeah, if he goes long even without announcing it, he could start a bullrun if he invests enough cash. If he announces he's going long, all hell will break loose. Soros is a famously rich man. 
3	1523033271	3	It's already coming out today that his fund is going to trade it. CNBC and business insider.
1	1523032696	3	now that is interesting... three different industries that all stand to benefit from incorporating aspects of crypto, can't draw any conclusions yet personally but this is good stuff

0	1523006870	8	4 hour stoch rsi has been bottomed for over a day now, think a buy here is decently 'safe' but the lack of buy pressure is scary.. think we most likely will get one more capitulation wick before we bounce hard
1	1523007179	8	i am patiently waiting for the price to come down. no time to rush. many old time bitcoiners do probably the same.my partial exit this time was around $16k - so also plenty of time to get in if things turn bullish faster than expected.the last "real" knife i catched was from $180 to $150 ;)
1	1523008209	2	I think if you're going long you may as well wait for the actual 4hr RSI to become oversold at this point. Personally, I don't see real buying pressure returning until the daily becomes oversold.

0	1522997376	3	Old support turned resistance?
0	1523011582	3	Guys, do I get paid 5x the funding if I go 5x Long when shorts are supposed to pay longs? I'm assuming that since the amount we pay when we are supposed to pay fees goes up when we use higher leverages, the same applies to us receiving funding. Then is there anything stopping us from basically just opening positions 10 seconds before funding, then closing the position to profit easily? Edit: also, if I wanted to avoid paying fees could I theoretically close my position right before funding and re open afterwards? 
1	1523011758	3	You get funding depending on your positions size, regardless of leverage. The reason why opening positions 10 seconds before funding doesn't consistently work is because there are bots daytrading the swap vs futures funding (yes, futures do have implied funding, depending on whether it trades at a premium or discount). Check what happens on the 1 min candles after funding periods, especially if the funding is above roughly 0.1%.
2	1523011931	1	Oh so why it wouldn't work is because bots doing the exact same thing could cause price to go in the opposite direction of my newly open position, resulting in funding to not be worth the loses I incurred from opening the position? 
3	1523012057	2	Yes, simply said: you won't beat the bots.
4	1523012126	1	Got it thanks. So usually if funding is shorts paying longs immediately after the funding will the price go up or downwards? I'm assuming downwards because bots will immediately start closing those Long positions after receiving the funding. I just don't want to lose more profit on my open short by paying for funding again. I believe I've already lost quite the amount to funding on open positions 
5	1523012354	1	Funding strongly negative -> dump on funding, funding strongly positive -> pump on funding. But you don't have to trust my word for it, Bitmex has historical funding rates on their website, which you can cross-check with the 1 minute charts. Also, the impact is minimal if the funding is small - 0.1% is my rule of thumb, but anything above 0.3% *will* result in a significant price movement. It is best exploited on *other* exchanges than bitmex, since they usually follow if funding is large enough.
6	1523012557	1	Would there not be a pump beforehand if funding is strongly negative though? All the bots opening longs to scalp fees should theoretically cause a pump, no? 
7	1523013481	1	Yes, but the start of this pump before it is usually hard to predict. However, at large funding rates, taking the opposite position a couple hours before and then closing *before* the funding actually happens sometimes works.But test it out yourself, don't listen to strangers on the internet ;)
1	1523011752	2	Pretty sure the funding is on the amount of contracts and leverage has nothing to do with it. Don't often use perps though so might be wrong.
1	1523011839	1	Yes
1	1523011845	1	yeah, you can open/close the position to get the fees.
0	1523025137	3	ascending triangle on the 30m
1	1523025513	6	Sort of, but it's inside a falling wedge on the 1h/4h and both patterns break up, so I'll allow it lol
2	1523026072	2	it's enough to make me close out my shorts for a small profit and wait. I'm starting to get the feeling that we may need a substantial bounce to 8k or so for before 6.5k can be taken down. Too heavily defended on this run that I think support is pretty solid until there's another faith-breaking failed bull run. Thinking about opening a long here but stayin OOP for now
3	1523026481	3	$8K isn't really too likely without breaking 6400. That's a higher high on a higher low, which would surprise me and also shift the paradigm. 7100 is likely, 7400 is possible. If it goes over that I'd be concerned to be holding any shorts below. 
4	1523026982	2	True I pulled that number out of my ass without looking at a chartedit: I'd put upper likely limit on ~7800, where a reliable log resistance line would approximately behttps://www.tradingview.com/x/8zHe1jrr/

1	1523032562	5	When I finally started ignoring/blocking the bad actors it really made interacting in here a lot more productive. 
0	1522998015	12	this is genuinely starting to look like accumulation. Buyers are just being patient af and setting up huge buy walls and not letting it fall throughe: I don't mean A C C U M U L A T I O N with wall street bonuses and chinese new year, I mean it just really looks like buyers are willing to put up massive walls at $6k so it doesn't fall through. Like...ya know, accumulation, lol. Didn't think this would be so controversial. I just am surprised it hasn't fallen through yet. I wouldn't be surprised if it fell through still, but this is probably the most "unsure" I have been in it falling through $6k. I am probably overthinking/getting anxious due to a lack of follow through from sellers. 
1	1522998263	3	Do you think this is the biggest exchange of value from weak hands to smart money that the world has ever seen? I’ve heard it is...
2	1522999549	5	lmao yall memein 
3	1523001380	2	I can’t help but make fun of you perma-bulls ;)
4	1523001530	1	lolo I hope you're joking because I am anything but!
5	1523008192	1	Yeah was a joke ofc
4	1523005616	1	Sloppy is a perma bull? Lmao
1	1522998326	3	Did you forget the "/s"? I thought you were always bearish.
2	1522998524	8	I'm offended you think I can't change my mind! :OI've been bearish since $10k up the first time around after $6k, but I know that shit doesn't always go down.I'm just getting antsy because1. this is where 2014 bear market turned around and bounced up to $11.7k2. they also consolidated for like 10 days straight around this price level3. the volume has been slightly lower (indicating a wyckoff double bottom)4. we're also in a descending wedge (which has a volume profile that gets lower towards the end of the wedge)5. a bounce up to $8-10k or so would truly crush people's spirits and allow for a sweet drop through $6k with little to no support on the way down. I'm not sure people are "broken" enough to allow for a drop through $6k yetI haven't really worried about my short too much but here I'm beginning to get antsy. 
3	1523000222	2	By what measure are we where the 2014 bear market was?
4	1523001483	2	% ath, around this time they were at our $7.5k
1	1523003541	3	I would feel extremely uncomfortable shorting here because I notice some genuine buying for once, too. If anything the buy orders will have to be thinned out to resume the dump, and the best way to do this is to go up, and get those people with buy orders to market buy with maximum fomo.Too pussy to long tho :P
1	1522998552	2	If you posted that two hours ago, then still wouldn't make much sense, but a bit closer.  Are you looking at the same chart that I am?I'm not looking at the order books though...only the chart.  Anyway, you are usually right on the mark, but not sure about your state of mind tonight.
2	1522998645	3	oh just a passing thought, I didn't think people would take it so seriously haha. I just am surprised it hasn't fallen through yet. We've been here for like what, a week now? And the buy walls are massive on finex. Maybe I'm just getting too antsy :)
1	1522998218	2	The fakeout pumps are what gives it away to me tbh. Every now and then someone bought just a little too much and causes a fakeout pump.They then sell their coins to bring us back down and keep buying
2	1522998360	3	There's just been so many damn coins bought here. Someone is accumulating the fuck out of $6k coins. If it doesn't fall through within like a day or two I'm just gonna close my short and wait until $6k breaks or something. We'll just have to see I guess
3	1522998520	3	I mean, let’s be honest Do we really expect it to fall below 5.5kI mean, there was next to no hype when SegWit2X was cancelled. No one would get their free coins etc.We were at 7k a few days later.I cant see it falling through, and Im sure the ones buying don’t either
4	1523000109	2	I really don't know anymore. If we get rejected from another large pump again then yes, it will definitely fall through. Right now? Idk tbh. these doomboiz really need to put the sell pressure on or it aint gone fall through
3	1522998949	3	It's certainly possible.  It was pumped and manipulated upwards so whales could make profits and that's part of why it's dropping now.  When it becomes more profitable for them to pump it again, that's what they will do.
4	1522999076	1	I mean that's mainly what I'm "worried" about. I think someone's accumulating and planning on pumping it a la 2014 style back to $8-10k or something. The charts are also suggesting a possible double bottom/wyckoff style accumulation phase.Idk, I need to look into it more. I'm just surprised it hasn't fallen through already, really.I have overthought things before, just want to make sure I'm checkin myself before wreckin myself is all
5	1522999356	1	Yes I hear you and that danger is there, especially with a large short. I have a huge (for me) hedging short...probably my biggest position ever on BitMEX and I can certainly see getting rekt if the price spikes 10% when I'm asleep.  I guess I should go back to setting alarms, but just don't know if I want to go back to that lifestyle.  But better than broke and homeless lifestyle, which is always a possibility with me.
6	1522999777	1	Alarms are terrible. and have never really proven worth it to me. If I really need to close, I'll set a stop. Otherwise I've been fine sitting through pumps so far. I don't know if I can live like chewy trying to trade at 4 am waking up in the middle of the night
7	1523000436	1	I don't trust stops and better to do it manually if possible.   But yes it's no fun getting woken up at 4am to the sound of losing lots of money.   I'll probably have to get back to doing that at some point, but not looking forward to it.
8	1523001655	1	I just really hate waking up to that sound of losing money. It's truly awful
9	1523002198	2	Yes but better to wake up to that than to wake up a few hours later and have lost more.  Ideally, the best way to trade would be not to sleep and do it 24/7/365.  Of course that's impossible.  The worst way to trade is to buy and hold forever and not look at the market.So everyone must decide for themselves where they want to fall in between those two extremes.   I used to work really hard when I was younger, but just don't have the energy now and also got too fat (with profits) and lazy.  But lost a lot of my profits now, so hopefully will get hungry again, but not starving.
2	1522998691	2	> They then sell their coins to bring us back down and keep buyingI wouldn't know how a hedge funds works, but I doubt they would do something that reckless while in accumulation phase.
3	1523001988	1	Maybe not a hedge fund, but what about the guy who sold a couple million in shitcoins in Jan?
1	1522998101	1	I'm sure it's true, but what makes it *look* like accumulation to you?
2	1522998224	5	Massive buy walls that pop up *immediately* after they're broken. 4.5k btc to $6.2k...think about how many people have bought btc at $6.4-6.8k by now. The buy walls have been fucking massive.We've just been sitting here for days now. It's been like a week in this range and we can't fall through. I'm thinking there may be an explosive move, and whoever accumulated here might have it in their interests to run up the price very quickly and then sell back on the way downit just needs to fall through soon or it's not going to look like it's worth selling/shorting here because it never falls through. I guess you could say the same of longing at $7k tho
3	1523001828	2	Making a lot of good points overall here. On the other hand I think you may just need to be patient if this ends up being a slow bleed long bear run. On the other other hand, if this is a REALLY long slow bleed, a rise up, it could immediately have a stupid pump to high heavens to 9.3k and still be under long term log resistance. So maybe our short term bottom is in.Leaving my freshly opened shorts in for now though
1	1523004129	1	hmm, the real question then is what happens if it falls below 6K.  If many people are indeed accumulating here, do you think we could see a bunch of panic selling if these people start seeing themselves in the red?
2	1523004458	1	yes probably. or they'd hold til a bounce back from $5k
1	1523026721	1	I'm impressed dude, didn't think I would hear this from you. Regardless of if it is true or not, I'm glad to see that you're taking a rational approach to this. NOW CLOSE THAT DAMN SHORT so that we can start the bull run :P

2	1523024149	2	There's an irony in that the people who repeatedly post "capitulation is still far away judging by this sub" are likely to be the ones who, if the price does crash to $1000, will get super angry if anyone suggests BTC isn't actually for real this time dead at that point.If the price goes super crazy scary low, you can bet these guys will be in here saying BTC is worthless at any price, that being involved with it at all is stupidity etc etc.The irony, in short, is that the ones who mock the sub for not capitulating, will be the first to capitulate.Though not you of course /u/ChrisMrShowbiz, because Exceptionalism.

4	1523009874	1	>What do you think about a Bitmex-esque platform for stocks? So it would allow users to collect fees by setting limit orders; those who utilise market orders will pay the fees.Bitmex is a futures platform. We already have that for indexes, but wouldn't make much sense for something that's only traded 35 hours per week. 
5	1523010008	1	Bitmex is a futures platform, but the same thing is available for the derivatives such as XBTUSD (XBTM18 etc are futures but XBTUSD isnt).We already have that for indexes? Is there a broker that would let me buy SP500 with limit orders and give me a fees for doing so?
6	1523011185	1	>We already have that for indexes? Is there a broker that would let me buy SP500 with limit orders and give me a fees for doing so?Yep. I receive a small credit as a maker for ESM8.Bitmex offers this to everyone in order to add liquidity to their order books. Doesn't quite work the same with stocks as you aren't trading on your brokers internal order book. In that case, it sounds like you're thinking or CFDs? 
7	1523011394	1	yes im thinking CFDs but you just said ESM8 does it so why doesnt it work with the same with stocks?
8	1523012201	1	>yes im thinking CFDs but you just said ESM8 does it so why doesnt it work with the same with stocks?It does, but market maker rebates aren't available for everyone as they are on Bitmex. You can register to become a MM with NYSE ARCA, for example. You can also be hired by penny stock companies as their DMM. 
9	1523012987	1	Okay, so what prevents a company to make CFD trading for stocks which allows you to collect fees if you set limit orders?
1	1523004549	2	May i ask for your reasons here? Also thinking about DCAing into a low leveraged long but still fearful. My simple motivation here is a potential short squeeze tbh. Thanks in advance. 
2	1523009769	2	>May i ask for your reasons here? Also thinking about DCAing into a low leveraged long but still fearful. My simple motivation here is a potential short squeeze tbh. Thanks in advance. News regarding India wasn't used by manipulators to smash the price. Expecting a short squeeze. 
3	1523010131	1	Thank you kind sir. I'm still new to this and will try with a small long aswell.
1	1523000504	1	Which exchange do you use? Don't see any liquidity to sell into on Bitmex lol
2	1523001833	2	>Which exchange do you use? Don't see any liquidity to sell into on Bitmex lolBitmex. I'll probably end up creating a series of smaller walls to close. Or make one giant hidden sell in front of a giant buy wall. This should be an exciting trade. 
0	1523014791	4	i dunno man, i can totally see a bounce to 7.5before that we will dump to 6k or thereabouts to get some fomo shorts in and then bounce i feel,maybe 5.8k even but i can totally see a bounce with the big money invovled in this game. traps everywhere.25x tiny sized 15 min scalps is the best way to make money in this market i think lol 
1	1523015062	3	I think you're too optimistic lately. This wont go to 7.5 before closing the daily sub 6k
2	1523015967	4	You're funny. For someone who throws out such a volume of predictions, one would expect, simply on the balance of probability, that you'd be right occasionally... and yet... At least the comments of yours that I've read - you've been wrong every single time.
2	1523015250	1	lol thats exactly what i meant.we will dump to 6k, a bit below that possibly, 5.8 to 5.7 even ?but then there will be a bounce, just the no of shorts leads me to believe that a tonne load of bitcoin will need to be bought back.a bounce to 6.7k minimum is on the cards.unless there is a pump now?
0	1523004914	12	This dump feels like horseshit, until we get a new local low i'm fully expecting this to start pumping back up to 6800

0	1523019246	14	I just want to take a moment to ~~sincerely~~ thank you, the doombois, for spending *so* much of your valuable time trying to protect the bulls in this sub. I’ve never seen so many selfless acts and you should all be very proud of yourselves. edit: ~~sincerely~~
1	1523020366	7	Someone that is bearish and posts about not buying has no intention on saving any else money. Let's be honest their only goal is to make money. They only reason they are posting is because they are looking for reassurance. If you're bearish for the foreseeable future and you know its going to be a while until we hit the bottom and you buy/sell or trade why visit reddit sub everyday to post about how much further the price has fallen or to guess how low it will go? It all human nature in my opinion, but when it comes to money it shows how manipulative people really are. 
2	1523026871	1	The most accurate statement I think I've ever read on this sub. 
0	1523006704	7	I don't know about you guys, but I'm buying. We're going to have some kind of return to normal phase sooner than later.Off course I don't know if this is the exact bottom, so I keep a little ammo in my pocket to buy even lower, but I'm 70% in.
1	1523008031	1	Hasn’t the last 4 months been the “return to normal phase”? Wouldn’t normal be well under $6k?
2	1523013329	1	> Hasn’t the last 4 months been the “return to normal phase”? Nope. But the bubble chart is kinda bullshit TBH.

2	1523016809	2	Bulls are in hiding, that's why it's so quiet in here. Watch the bulls jump around like crazy after the next $250 bounce.
3	1523019750	1	Bulls are quiet because they get down voted and yelled at. Typical bear market stuff. Bulls sure seem antsy to get back into this, though.
4	1523020252	2	The massive downvoting of everything one disagrees with is pretty annoying. Shows most people on this sub are immature and not open to discussion.
5	1523021101	1	It gets like this after bubbles. I almost rage quit every time before mods remind me that I just need to down vote and report. Hang in there.
0	1523036610	8	I'm not sure how everyone is bearish here... we are failing to make a newer low of any kind. The idiotic market sellers have been dumping the market brutally. whales have been shadow buying it. I think we are pretty close to marking the bottom.
1	1523036938	4	Not everyone is. But we ARE in a bear market that is trending down to a likely figure of at least 6k. There's more reason to go down than up at the moment and sentiment mirrors that.
1	1523036825	7	I'm not sure how everyone is bullish here... we are failing to make a newer high of any kind. The idiotic market buyers have been propping the market brutally. whales have been shadow selling it.  I think we are pretty close to marking the bottom.

1	1523012949	2	you spelt pump wrong
0	1523012926	6	Bears still cannot break 6500.  After the Kraken whale defended it for 7 million or so, it just won't fall (been opening longs whenever we hit it, as every time we bounce).  
1	1523013648	6	It will fall before the weekend is over.
1	1523013152	3	The more times 6500 is defended the more margin trading helps defend it via more people seeing it as an opp for new longs and closing shorts (it's also cutting off rebounds at the knees)
2	1523013466	0	that is not what is happening. Shorts are increasing and longs are decreasing. [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS)[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDlongs](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDlongs)
3	1523013694	4	Good. We need lots of shorts to end the bear run. 
4	1523018166	1	we hope it will do in reverse. this market is getting boring right now
3	1523013622	5	Actually longs just started increasing right as we hit 6500 based on that 
1	1523018281	1	With billions in daily trading volume, I doubt a puny $7 mln wall is going to halt the train. Ask the bullwhale who defended $8k with millions of dollars how well that went for him!
0	1523006569	2	Question to the US folks: is the tax pay day that big of a deal and are people selling their crypto stacks to pay them?source: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/05/wall-streets-tom-lee-predicts-massive-outflow-from-cryptocurrencies-ahead-of-tax-day.html
1	1523008403	2	If you think about the US volume and how it compares to other countries push and pull on crypto i dont think itll be catastrophic or anything
1	1523009429	1	the smart us tax payer makes estimated quarterly payments. i make monthly estimated payments.
2	1523013078	3	Its true.  But lets be honest, the majority of alt traders didnt think they needed to pay taxes on coin transitions for the majority of the year.  They are all likely underwater for their assumptions.
3	1523013860	2	true, I also think Tom Lee is spouting shilly BS though because nobody wants to call it a bubble
1	1523007290	1	It's not like it's one grand holiday. It's lame but people don't make a big deal out of it, it's just a regular occurrence that people obviously don't look forward to. I feel a decent number of people will try to avoid reporting anything related to crypto, the big players that started out really small, or at least skirt around it. I don't feel it will affect the market much at all but who knows, this kind of thing is hard to make a prediction on.
0	1523025481	2	All we need is simple $500 dump which was all common the past weeks to find the bottom  and somehow seems difficult...no idea why. 
1	1523026051	3	Cos at the moment we need around 9,000 coins to be sold to do that. Thats a shitload. (Finex)
2	1523026298	2	Until the walls all get pulled and you suddenly only need a couple of hundred coins to cause a big move.
3	1523026368	1	Cant see many huge single walls. lots of little ones which fills me with a little more hope. 
4	1523026986	1	Yeah, staggered orders make me think people actually want to buy at those levels rather than just trying to prop the market up.
0	1523037733	2	anytime we don't move up for a long period of time we tend to go down 200 dollars in a minute. I'm still long from 6500 but getting nervous.
0	1523037824	3	I think BTC wants to break upwards but the overall bearishness sentiment exacerbated by the global economy looking shittier and shittier is keeping it down.  The amount of short positions is fucking insane - I'd be surprised if we don't see some kind of short squeeze push us up a little higher before it falls more.  This is a no-trade zone for me. 
1	1523038140	2	BTC does not have desires. It's moved by market sentiment. That's bearish, as you stated. It's not some free spirit that bears are pinning down. The further down it goes, the more people will flip their sentiment--but it's a moving target. Lots of people in fiat right now swore they'd mortgage the house if it went under $8K. Suddenly, $8K becomes the dream target to exit. But eventually, more people will want to buy than to sell. Is that at $6K? $4K? $2K? I said earlier today I'd start buying up what I could afford at $4K. What if we hit $4K on Sunday though...would I then? Probably not.

1	1523031619	3	You can only really confirm divergence like this  when you break up above the previous high. Then a continuation up is likely. Until that happens it it meaningless.

0	1523018078	3	My psychological bottom is about $4800, I'm not worried about falling to $5k right now. Just my 2¢ of sentiment.
0	1523019021	3	Massive buy/sell walls between $6500-$6600. Whales are battling, and some massive bullwhale clearly is accumulating below $6500. I seriously doubt we drop below that point today.
1	1523019625	10	This is the opposite of Technical Analysis.
2	1523019929	6	I hate to say it, but TA has been mostly out for me for the past few days, with stop-loss hunting and whales (such as aabtc from the other day) pushing the price one way or another, it's been hard to trust which direction the market is going in the short term based simply on TA. Too many people have quit trading in the short-term, emptying the order books and making it much easier for big players to exert their will on the price. Things like BBands, horizontal resistance/support lines, triangles, wedges, and head/shoulders have been mostly reliable, but I wouldn't bet your house on them right now.
3	1523020235	3	A more reliable indicator for me lately has been selling pumps and taking profits early, especially when traders are massively over-leveraged. Stop-loss hunting has been a source of easy profits for whales, and I don't want myself getting caught in the crossfire.[Here's a great source for determining short/long health](https://datamish.com/dashboard/db/btcusd?refresh=20s&orgId=1).
1	1523019309	2	yep
1	1523019301	2	How the hell could you seriously doubt we drop below that point? Just look at the charts. At this rate you'll be lucky if we don't drop under 6300 by eod. Those buy walls are clearly fake and have been getting assblasted through since last week.
2	1523019434	2	We could absolutely drop below $6500 over the next few days, but it seems we may have another DCB in the books. We're looking at a solid rejection of $6500 so far.
3	1523019800	2	I doubt we will only test it once though. Im thinking of closing my short with a smaller profit close to 6.5 soon and sleeping peacefully.

0	1522992326	4	I'm looking at transaction data related to LocalBitcoins.  During the peak in December the entire site did 129 million dollars during Christmas week.  Presently LBC this past week did 76 million worldwide:  https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/ALLWhat is interesting is the data from Canada.  Which shows that this week is the ATH for Canada at 8 million per week and that number appears to be growing 30 percent per week.  It stands to reason that Coinbase is probably doing really well in Canada right now at numbers that are much larger than the more expensive LBC option.  It appears that the Bitcoin craze has just arrived in Canada because there was no large increase in December there like most other places.  https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/CAD
1	1522992668	3	Canada stopped credit card transactions or something along those lines.
2	1522993382	7	Yeah, there has been issues with our banks and fiat on ramps. Our biggest exchange, quadriga, has been having all sorts of issues.

0	1523023404	1	Many think this is the guy giving us the bart patterns, and he got rekt in the last few hours. Lost 80 coins since yesterday. Maybe even more...https://twitter.com/ActualAdviceBTCScroll trough his timeline if you like.

1	1523023633	2	Jesús. $480,000. That's about three times what my house is worth. 
2	1523024107	3	He has several big accounts. 480k seems like peanuts to him. Dont know what he is about, found him yesterday on twitter...
1	1523023672	2	He had a $20m long up in the 6800s yesterday he posted in the troll box. So....
2	1523023865	1	That is my usual stake too ;)
2	1523024873	1	Isn't the max position size 1100 BTC (worth of contracts)?
3	1523025260	1	Unless there's a way to cheat the troll box I don't know about..it was 19.3m IIRC.
1	1523023675	1	if so, good
