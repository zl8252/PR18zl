I’ll let you buy one off of me and I won’t even charge any fees for it! Just gimme $7,000 and it’s yours. Foh acting like these guys are running a charity. What is relevant: Jim Breyer is involved with one of these two. He is not involved with the other. That’s a pretty good starting point. 
1	1522991474	1	Dude, did you even look at the data? Do you think a .0033% difference in price is even worth complaining about? That’s lower than literally any other option on the planet. To reiterate: Robinhood’s buy price for BTC was literally $6 higher than the market. 
2	1522991908	1	I like data. I don’t like exaggerated/opinionated/misleading commentary. Then again I’m on reddit, so it’s my own damn fault. I’m also not super into a post that starts off by co-signing the idea of leaving your money on an exchange. It’s unnecessarily stupid and a terrible thing to read for anyone new to crypto. GET YOUR MONEY OFF THE EXCHANGE

If anything it should have read “minuscule market difference,” as “slightly” is too big an adjective for what I found. For the sake of argument it’s basically nonexistent, at least for Robinhood. Circle takes a slightly bigger cut. But as I stated I already had a bad experience with them so they’re out anyway.
