Crypto is like an infant compared to those markets in terms of maturity. Most exchanges are not even 5 years old.
0	1523032195	2	I hate it too, but considering how many exchanges have tiered fee structures, the people that dislike the fees the most are the ones that matter least.  It's just frustrating to know that at most exchanges, you have to have a gain of 0.5% just to break even on a sale.

0	1523035225	1	My local broker charges 0.8% per trade limit or market. you guys on the US have it easy.
0	1523029651	0	I’ve been trading on GDAX and I pay no fees for buys/sells using limit orders.  Not quite sure why you’re using market orders.
1	1523030312	3	Well for one. If you are using a stop loss, it is a lot safer to use a market stop than a limit stop. There have been too many nightmares I’ve had where limit stops never got filled due to lack of liquidity. Too much of a risk.
