It is now emerging that some banks are actually able to circumvent the RBI guidelines and provide services - but this will take some time to be finalised as the second circular hasn't been issued yet.

On the chance they'll come for the exchanges, keep your coins in a wallet offline and register for Binance.For new people who want to buy cryptocurrency with INR they should do over the counter trades, but need to accept prices higher than other places.
