Suspicious until proven solvent is how I'm playing this.In addition to stealing content from competitors and making fraudulent claims about their volume, they have also been caught shilling against competitors in the BitcoinCA subreddit. According to this article, the exchange launched without being fully prepared and the author could not even get his eth deposit address to generate. But it's cool because support quickly replied stating that it should be ready in a few hours? Yes, competitors should definitely take note of this superior exchange which is on its way to becoming #1... which Coinfeld already claims to be, despite one day of public operations.
