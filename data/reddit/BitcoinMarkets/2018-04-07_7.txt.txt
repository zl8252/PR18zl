1	1523059993	1	It seems like a good idea, there has been no market and the children are trying to keep it at 6,600 every time it falls under the line.  It's on about try number #50 right now.  All I see is weakness and someone who keeps buying too much thinking someone is going to save them.  It pisses me off that it thinks it's anyone's fault but its own.And to anyone convinced I'm on part of some "team bear" and I'm a permabear that never changes: get real I was buying bitcoin last year because it was hot shit but now it's not.  I'm not some millionaire that's trying to get revenge, nor am I a millionaire at all.  Even if I wanted to help I don't have any money to spare and any dipshit on here who follows me around or thinks I've gotten too many predictions right and wants to try and prove me wrong by shoving more money up the markets ass  can take a hike.When you die here you die.  This ain't kinder-care.  I'm not going to be nice anymore about my comments when things start to get unsafe and stupid.  The SEC will most likely contact them in the future I'm hoping because lets face it, those kind of buys are manipulation and it's crossed the point where it's funny anymore.

1	1523078316	1	There's nothing weak about selling.  Personally I consider sellers to be stronger people mentally because they are able to grow up and look past cult mentality when times get tough.  Hopefully things will get better for you, it's probably the worst market I've ever seen right now.  The only decent money there has been lately is Tron and a few altcoins on Huobi.
