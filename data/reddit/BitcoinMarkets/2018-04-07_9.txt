In a bear market, instead of sitting at the crypto you bought at lower price you sit at FIAT gained for selling at higher price, that's just way too simple to do. a bit more complex is scenarios where the deposit and withdrawal of a coin is disables so it's price on that exchange usually becomes much lower in that one .That's a coin flip because when it gets reactivated again it could go to that price or to the market one . for example, this happened with bitshares recently in poloniex : https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_btsIf you put the monthly chart, you can see a lot of people must have made massive profits  just in that one (although, things said, this one was a bit more complex, as technical problems was just a lame excuse and everyone knew it was just because their lawyers werent particularly happy about a section in the documentation)
