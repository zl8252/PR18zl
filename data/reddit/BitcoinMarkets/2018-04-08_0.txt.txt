0	1523144694	14	Whiile i belive this is kept down by bearish fomo and we are in a sort of "enthusiastic despair", do you have proof?
1	1523167747	12	No proof, they’re just underwater and want others to be too
1	1523175044	-4	just read the news man what do you mean proof?
2	1523177524	5	This doesn't mean they are buying your coins. Soros made his money by destroying currencies... Go look him up lol. Hes probably shorting it just like any other sane person right now. And when I starts to turn around he'll buy. 
3	1523192064	11	Soros didn't destroy currencies. He made bets that currencies would be destroyed by bad monetary policy and happened to be right. It was the central banks of those respective countries thatthate responsible for the destruction.
3	1523181497	1	And bitcoin is also making its living destroying fiat currencies. I would be shocked if Soros was not at least hedging into btc, if not taking on positions against fiat 
3	1523177780	1	sane persons are not shorting something that tends to go parabolic in the most unpredictable times because they get rekt. regardless, soros can pump to the moon and back before he shorts.
4	1523198161	4	The "insane" people just made 70% return in three months from their shorts.  You can stay sane and broke..have fun.
4	1523182707	2	If we have learnt anything from Wall Street entering the market. They destroyed us. They can't ban crypto, so they lower morale (other than simple bubble logic), I think this applies too. Socio-economics hitting where it hurts. 
4	1523177985	4	Sane people follow the general trend... It would have to gain 233% to get back to its all time high (assuming 6k low and 20k high). And a 233% gain wont happen with Bitcoin over night - not anymore. Besides at that point if youre still holding the short youre stupid. Seriously, if you're a moderate swing trader there's buckets to be made. 
5	1523178177	-1	actually successful investors do not follow the general trend. anyway it's a long discussion I don't believe shorting something that goes up multiple times per year is sane.You find it crazy for bitcoin to go up "not anymore" while a few months ago did a 6X in a matter of two months. Holders are long term investors. If you think this strategy is stupid I can't convince you otherwise. Darwin said it all. 
2	1523204382	1	He means proof: evidence sufficient enough to establish something as true.Key words there are evidence and sufficientThe zero evidence you have used to support your claim does more to discredit it than you know.
0	1523156655	6	I think it's really interesting that they are now saying they may buy. The question is what their motives are I guess. Edit: perhaps I should say, how do they think they are going to make money off of this?
1	1523206567	2	When a billionaire says they are buying something they are actually selling / shorting it.
1	1523201635	1	Pump the market cap to a could trillion then start throwing out Fud, manipulation, etc and short the market 
0	1523161483	9	Or maybe selling because this is a bear market
1	1523171201	1	Or shorting because bears want to make back the money they lost.
2	1523171283	1	Bears didn't lose any money this year
3	1523172161	1	I'm talking about former bulls in late December 2017 who are now bears.
1	1523174967	1	haha sure
0	1523168156	4	Just want to say that David Pakman from Venrock is a real cool guy. Never thought I'd hear a 50 year old guy talk so passionately about catching Pikachu in Pokemon Go near Grand Central.
0	1523172486	3	Soros will not release information of him buying until he has had his fill. 
0	1523151682	16	miss me with that Soros bullshit. 
1	1523152549	22	you are not a bull you're a tourist 
2	1523152653	5	The fuck are you even talking about? 
3	1523153072	7	Its from a rap song :( King’s Dead by Kendrick Lamar with Future and Jay Rock. Nvm y'all are fucking oldEdit: for the record, I agree with you. Soros is a piece of shit. 
4	1523153322	-4	is that the rap? 
5	1523153419	7	Well, it's "miss me with that bullshit/you ain't really wild, you're a tourist" in the song... 
6	1523154339	-1	[deleted]
7	1523155806	4	Yeah, good call lol goodnight 
8	1523156788	3	Sorry, even though I didn't catch the reference, I have to give you a kudos and upvote. I mean Lamar is a Grammy winner. (I'm wicked, so there's no rest for me)
3	1523187613	1	LA DE DA DE DA.  SLOB ON ME KNOB.
0	1523176783	2	I mean he might also have some active strategies to put in play on crypto.  Anyone with experience algorithmic trading on equities markets can make a killing doing the same thing on the crypto markets.  The opportunities are massive.  Even just some really basic strategies like market making and geo arbitrage are profitable.  They don't need to take out a $100M long position to trade crypto.
0	1523192254	2	If they're selling due to TA they're not very good at it.
0	1523133325	6	how underwater are you?
1	1523134449	21	From when? Jan? sure underwater. From 2015? moon
2	1523193286	1	if you have been in since 2015, how was 19k *not* moon to you?  Did you really think it will just steadily keep going up from there or that we'll be back to 20k in no time?Bitcoin already mooned.  The only opportunities to make money on it now is by trading.
3	1523194576	1	My opinion you already know. It's not on your camp. I believe bitcoin will almost replace gold and many currencies and as the Twitter founder said will be the internet money. I have been an internet pioneer since 1993 and Bitcoin too. I think the moon will totally surprise everyone but it will be at least 6 figures. You want to bet when this will not happen (shorting). I want to bet that it will happen. I don't care how long it takes. In the end if it happens for sure I will have more money vs shorting all the way. The only possibility that you will make more money than me is that you correctly predict when to short and then when the (most of the times totally unpredictable bull run) happens you will go long and hodl. If you don't believe that it will moon more then that means it is a failed experiment. Nobody should trade failed experiments for too long. My opinion, no hard feelings
4	1523198809	2	understood.  FWIW, I don't short.  It is just my opinion that it is counterproductive to hold an asset after a 10-20%+ drop.
1	1523138996	0	t. guy who was liquidated this morning
2	1523155286	3	What is t. ?
2	1523154381	1	I think you're on the wrong site
0	1523143442	2	dude, we get it, you hate TA.
0	1523181301	4	Soros' kill team will buy in OTC and install their next-gen HFT bots to leverage volatility down to  +/- $1 price movements and literally drain the life out of this already inorganic market. They will be making millions on volatility in any price range, not on the premice that the asset itself goes to the moon. If anything, they would want to suppress the price for as long as possible to accumulate. So how is this bullish?
1	1523196943	3	loolol
1	1523182411	-2	you seem to know exactly what Soros has in mind. You should be extremely rich by now and a talented algorithmic trader. Or not?
2	1523183418	4	We're all mostly small fish in this pond. These guys won't bring anything resembling dumb money and suscribe to the religion of HODL to maximize the marketcap. They are here to profit off of an unregulated market. They will make money on volatility regardless whether btc is 1k or 100k. 
3	1523184991	1	that and maybe they will do as normal investors do and bet on a technology. You know when VCs buy stocks in startups they are not profiting on volatility. 
2	1523188543	2	literally could say the same about your post you dingus 
0	1523174361	1	I am pretty sure they buy otc
0	1523189413	1	Soros has said he believes bitcoin will go down, he has now said he will start trading bitcoin, there are 2 ways to trade, you can bet something will go up or bet it will go down, why do you think he will bet it goes up? 
1	1523191054	1	lmao ikr, there's no evidence they are buying 
1	1523192844	1	never heard of funds getting into trading bubbles before. sure it can go either way but they sure believe in its future otherwise they would just buy top and dump and that's it. my view
0	1523196408	1	If you think Soros is going to save bitcoin, you are going to be disappointed. He's going to make money shorting and then they'll keep the price in a range of their choosing. It doesn't matter if bitcoin is $500 or 500k these guys will make money and it's a lot easier to take the price to $500 than 500k.
0	1523197107	1	Only 21 million bankers can borrow a whole bitcoin at once to short it.
1	1523199143	2	You mean 16.5 million bankers.
2	1523207661	1	And really only about 70% of that. #LostCoinz
0	1523200053	1	For every bear that successfully trades and wins out, there are 4, 5, 8 others who are losing their stacks to bigger whale stacks. House always wins otherwise casinos wouldnt be a business
0	1523143404	1	None of these people are buying, they might trade crypto and they will probably short it.
1	1523154468	4	Might trade crypto? That's buying...
2	1523160523	2	>Might trade crypto? That's buying...Or selling. Wouldn't that be a twist, they short! 
2	1523170766	1	Nope, he can (and will most probably) short.
3	1523171577	3	I, for one, would love to see Soros shorting and getting totally rekt.
3	1523192765	1	And a short is a buy in the future when it is covered.
0	1523173845	1	Isnt this all just coincidental, nasdaq on the cusp of a bear market. If it happens, QE4 likely on the way = hyperinflation near 0 rates goodbye bond market. This is just one way these guys will diversify if it all goes to shit, picking up assets, gold being another (it's being suppressed though).Hint, take a look at countries of the world's gold reserves being piled up in the last 2 years
