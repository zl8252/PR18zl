1	1523153423	1	So how does it work exactly?          So you say the indicator hits that zero point, and then in a week or 2 we go up to 15,000?         Why do we know it's going to shoot up? What makes it do that? Thx
2	1523198108	1	We don't know. It's just been a good contrary indicator *so far.* We've seen significant jumps after it reaches that critical point, but that doesn't mean we will again. This is also a very short timeframe to judge its efficacy. To say it's going to 15k is just optimistic guessing.
