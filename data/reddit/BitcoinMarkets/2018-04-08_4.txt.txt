Submission title: Trading exchanges need more competition. There is a serious lack of good UX in the marketplace right now. It is creating a funnel where all new traders rely on a single one like Coinbase.

1	1523133050	4	I am sure there are plenty of team out there who can build a solid exchange. I myself considered building an exchange. But the compliance and regulation required to interface with the banking system is mind numbing. It takes capital and a lot of legal expertise.In theory, you could do what Bitmex did and build a 100% crypto derivative exchange. But then you need to be in a friendly juridiction, and it feels like Bitmex already cornered that market.
0	1523142241	1	We dont need coinbase or any fucking competition! We need to make people aware lf the real need and thats DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGES! 
1	1523149024	2	This is exactly it.DEXs. That's really all we need. Built truly decentralized, there is no way for them to steal, no way for funds to get locked, any screw ups occur due to user error.The issue though are the on ramps (and off ramps). You can't buy with fiat on a DEX. And truly, there are plenty of options besides coinbase, so OP already has what he wants.
