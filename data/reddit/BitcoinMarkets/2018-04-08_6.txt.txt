You'd probably be required to maintain a fiat balance of some kind , and would be limited to a small percentage of that as a lending limit,  i.e. (10-50%)  depending on how trusted you are.   Shorting is one of those things where it really does take a lot of money to make a lot of money.

1	1523199993	2	People can short to hedge their positions, hedge their mining proceeds, etc., not just because they want to capture the price going down.
1	1523194073	0	Maybe not on the hour or the day but yes overall it is.
0	1523157723	1	BitMEX and Kraken.
