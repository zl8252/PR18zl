There will be selling pressure well past April 17 assuming the market is flat otherwise as the daily compounding interest take it's toll on hodlers.EDIT:  it's perfectly legal to deliberately not pay tax due so long as you pay the penalty and interest.
1	1523210448	1	Serious question - if someone pays tax due with penalty and interest, why are people arrested for tax fraud?
2	1523210676	1	for trying to conceal taxable income,  deliberate efforts to conceal,  in the old days,  'cooked books'  , 'two ledgers',  that sort of stuff.
0	1523208401	1	Ok. Thanks. I’m a Brit so little knowledge of US rules. I just hoped it might be true but I guess there’s always a ‘but’ ........

1	1523209241	1	How underwater are you in your short? 
2	1523209590	1	If he went short anytime in the past 3 months then probably not much. 
3	1523209772	3	Of course, but look, this is just reminding me of december but the other way around. and i hate people who can't look themselves in the mirror.
2	1523209638	1	Just like the bull run last year, it was hard to lose money in any coin. Shorting this year, it was also hard to lose money./#didnthodl
3	1523209868	2	And just like last year, when this comes to a halt a lot of people will get REKT.I have traded in the way down, particularly the bounces, i have almost doubled my stack, but i honestly think that trading now is just high risk - low reward. Will start trading again when we are above 7.8k.

5	1523210339	1	that sound good indeed. But you have to check this scenarios. bitcoin pumps hard and stop losses get triggered en masse . Result: Massive slippage, significative loses. Same with a dump . 
2	1523210295	1	I don't do margin trading. Crypto gains and losses are already wild enough. 
3	1523210363	2	And i agree. For the moment.
