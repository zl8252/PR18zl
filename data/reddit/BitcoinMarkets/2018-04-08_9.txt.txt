1	1523143225	2	I'm buying at half the negative prices your buying at
1	1523126570	-3	>And I guess that downtrend continues until 2019 reaching negative prices....>>?If you look at the chart you see that it has logarithmic scale. If you are educated you know that this scale never becomes negative, no matter how much you go down on the y-axis.>Btw, temperatures are rising now in March, and will rise in April again.>I forecast in the 250 degrees By mid December... It is clear that any trend stops at some point. You always have to put TA in relation to fundamentals and psychology. T.A. ALONE is COMPLETELY meaningless.As far as fundamentals are concerned, I see no reason why the price should be above 1-2k. Also market psychology shows southwards (google search results, public voices, ...). Also last bear market lasted 2 years. The psychology is comparable now, because the market participants are the same species (human).In summary I see all reason to expect a prolonged bear market that goes well below 4k, likely below 2k, during which technologies and eco system can mature (LN, MAST, SCHNORR, sidechains ...), public focus returns to technics rather than price, and authorities feel comfortable as price continues to tumble.Then another (maybe final) bubble may form taking btc 6-digit, before the final battle happens (almost world-wide legal(!) ban, or world-wide adoption). But that's not before 2020, likely 2021 or later.So people wanting to get rich need patience.----edit: this subredfit is 'broken'. This thread is proof: A post that provably does not understand log scale and mathematics gets upvoted, and a post giving detailed explanatiobs gets downvoted. So people here do not want the truth, they want to downbote everyone who does not join the hype.This indicates to me that the journey southwards will be even more intense than what I originally expected.    
2	1523127689	2	>Also last bear market lasted 2 years.Just over a year - basically all of 2014 it was falling. It didn't take off like a rocket in 2015, but it was a steady upward trend. 
3	1523127880	0	Take the number of wallets: and you will see that 2 years in 2015 = 6months in 2018The market is different today. Things move faster.
4	1523129967	2	I wish I could agree with the things move faster part.
4	1523134183	0	you must have secret knowledge to see this related to nb of wallets lol 
5	1523137934	0	HahahahaMaybe ;-)I try to listen_to/read l everything Ari Paul, Chris Burniske and Jack Tatar say/write
6	1523139195	3	I am rather trying thinking for myself than listening to self proclaimed gurus.So we have different approaches.
7	1523140026	1	Seems to. I do like to listen to a lot of things and try learn a ton before attempting to think for myself. Points of view are always interesting, especially when you disagree with some. Btw: French?
2	1523127824	2	 I was “challenging” your analysis. ;-)Careful with trend lines. They are bound to change direction sooner or later.Fundamental positive news are coming. From regulations, custodianship to big funds investing (soros...)-> the context is fundamentally positive for cryptos.As for BTC, I don’t know. On one hand you start to have mass adoption, and the LM tech helps. But this will increase volatility.And it seems that funds and regulation move more towards “alts” not BTC.That plus the future fiat pairings don’t cast a positive shadow on Bitcoin’s outlook.Scarcity will not be enough to sustain prices of $20k imho.But support is clearly at $5k to $6k now.New products like ETFs will help.$2k? I do not believe it will go that low.Anyway, i liked your answer. UpvotedP.S.: I don’t own any BTC btw... not shilling my stack
2	1523143253	1	> You always have to put TA in relation to fundamentals and psychology. TA has psychology built in....also fundamentals.  Unless there is news that changes fundamentals, then you don't need to factor it in.
0	1523125469	3	read this: lately to make money you have to wait until you feel like the buyers are getting pissed off.  Eventually they try to make a symmetrical uptrend and buy stupid amounts of bitcoin really fast after it goes down a bit like today/yesterday.  ***This is just bitcoin related though.  Other markets are different.I think op is right for the most part. It could go either way but it's still a manipulated market that is being kept here with fake volume. I'm sure everyone's noticed by now.  You only have about two chances every week to get one or two candles.
