GDAX generally is a follower not a leader. And when we hung around 6.6k for so long, the volume on Bitfinex was actually fairly normal for consolidation periods just constrained to a tight zone. Lots or 100+ BTC buys that hardly moved the market, and lots of 100+ BTC sells that hardly moved the market.I'm not going to go through commenting on the majority of what you said since it's basically all just conjecture and highly subjective.
1	1523295649	3	> Bitfinex I'm seeing exactly what I described on Bitfinex.  Are you looking at line chart or candle?
2	1523295969	1	Candle. The volume on the 4 hr candles for the time period you described ranged from 4-6k BTC. That's a little low but not at all much different from other short price consolidation time periods.Edit: for example, there was a time period just before we fell off from 8k down to the low 7ks where there were three 4 hr candles all below 3.5k BTC volume. The time period you mentioned is not overly significant.
1	1523296678	2	I miss the days when Coinbase was a leader, because that meant new people buying in.
0	1523295901	3	> All it takes is one bad article, real or fake, to affect market prices. So everyone must remain vigilant against social media trying to manipulate you. (hint: /r/bitcoin is compromised)  Feels very different to me. Good news, bad news, Bitcoin price does whatever the fuck it wants...
1	1523296115	1	I've seen some very large sways in price based on articles that pertain to regulation, adoption, banks closing accounts, etc...  I think they have a big impact on the bitcoin price, and realistically, they should.  
2	1523296211	2	Granted, my experience is based on the 2015 cycle, but there were weeks of good news with the price stagnating, or dozens of "china ban" news without the price going down. I think what you're seeing isn't necessarily causally linked.
3	1523296568	3	It's kind of hard for me to go out and find a FUD news article like the China ban and point it to the moment in time when I saw the charts go down in response. I know it happened, and watched that exact scenario play out a number of times, but match it after the fact is a challenge.  I hope you understand that.  Let's perhaps agree to just look at it going forward and keep an open mind?
4	1523296660	1	I'm with you that /r/bitcoin is a trash fire.
3	1523297094	2	This is the experience of anyone who's been in bitcoin for a long time: the price is so very disconnected from anything we've ever been able to clearly connect it to.  The only remarkable thing about it is how similarly (if an order of magnitude higher) each bubble and bust period are to one another, and why they keep repeating in this manner.
0	1523295402	1	Itâ€™s a market like every other market. Nothing new about the participants. 
1	1523295483	1	I was hoping the bit about the GDAX chart would be helpful too.  Some good data there as far as I'm concerned.  
0	1523295316	0	Yawn. This should be in the daily thread. 
0	1523295390	2	Take my upvote.
0	1523297023	1	I think it is well understood that the speculative demand is far higher than the industrial demand 9for daily transactions) and hence, speculative market forces, sentiment, etc. dominate price action causality; We're not trading in pork bellies here.I also agree that whale action causes instability, or short term volatility: this is also not a huge surprise... I think Bitcoin probably has an actual user base of low hundreds of thousands, and the coin distribution among these users is probably super-pareto biased to old-timers/ogs/Satoshi, etc.... This is what I would expect given the history of the project. As time goes on, and entropy affects the coin distribution, we will see a gradual reduction in volatility as fewer individual actors will be able to move the market.For many of us in BitcoinMarkets: this volatility is a big draw--for investors, sure, it may be undesirable for everyday, "mainstream" investors... but I think it's delusinoal at this point to pretend your grandma should be getting Bitcoin exposure.
1	1523297452	1	> As time goes on, and entropy affects the coin distribution, we will see a gradual reduction in volatility as fewer individual actors will be able to move the market.This seems contradictory of what we know about bitcoin and how money works in the world in general.  Entropy really only applies to physics, not money.  I think the tendency is for bitcoin to be aggregated into whales with good backing as they can endure downturns a lot longer.    If I make an investment in bitcoin, it may pay off quick or maybe long instead.  But I am a simple man, have problems, and sometimes I need to cash out what I have in savings to pay for things. For example, real world problem, I recently had to sell my stocks to pay for a car accident. Life happens, so to speak.  Now, if I'm a big whale with other money, a car accident isn't going to make me drain my accounts.  But if I'm a little man with little savings, it's going to be different.    So the whales, as long as they have a positive outlook, will be like a magnet for bitcoin.  And if their outlook changes, they'll dump back into the market and maybe then it will spread out a bit, but that money will, over time, go right back to the whales as condition improves.   
0	1523297588	1	So as far as the moderation in /r/bitcoin it is has changed for the better. THe place was an out of control shit show trollbox for a couple months. THe daily thread is uncensored from what I can tell and you can talk about price and whatever other non-sense shit show all day long. It has greatly improved my reading of the sub as it was unusable prior trying to find content that wasn't the same price thread 1000x 
1	1523297828	1	That seems to imply that they made 1 post that is uncensored and everything else is potentially censored.    The tactic they usually take is to simply remove the post or comment without notice and the only way to tell is to open it in an incognito window. Meaning the majority of users probably don't even realize they are being censored.   Censorship is one thing.  But disguised hidden censorship is shady as fuck and should only be reserved for the worst of trolls or spammers. 
2	1523297973	1	Its not really hidden though it says right there don't post about price. Don't post about other coins. I mean how hard is that? Also says in the daily everyday:> Your price screenshots and repetitive submissions are being removed, so please stop submitting them!
3	1523298240	1	It is possible to talk about market trends without price being important. My post above is a fine example of that.    > Your price screenshots and repetitive submissions are being removed, so please stop submitting them!    Where are you quoting this from?  
0	1523296755	1	Yep.A good way to keep in check on what's current with r/bitcoin is by having a look at r/btc regularly.
1	1523297157	1	/r/bitcoin mods view /r/btc in a very negative way and one mod openly admitted that they were permitting the trolling of /r/btc.  That is, there is a -100 comment karma account being allowed in /r/bitcoin and the mod excuse what that they got to -100 by shitting all over /r/btc.    Now, I don't know much about /r/btc, what they may have done to deserve flak, but /r/bitcoin was certainly encouraging harassment.  And that is enough to make me question the ethics of /r/bitcoin mods.  
2	1523297517	1	The worst r/btc does is get angry and become incoherent doing so. Sometimes newcomers get yelled at. I'm an angry r/btc'er too, but I like to think that I keep my anger reasonable and rational.If anyone thinks r/btc being angry is arbitrary, I'll tell you I'm definitely not backing down on my anger, and neither should the rest of r/btc: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7mg4tm/updated_dec_2017_a_collection_of_evidence/ Read this with your own skepticism and feel free to refute anything you like. Would be absolutely great if I was angry in vain.
3	1523297703	1	That's a big post and I'll need to review it.    Only thing I can say is that the better subs on Reddit have rules when it comes to being respectful and civil in discussion, no name calling, trolling, abuse, etc...  But I'm fine with general disagreements. 
4	1523297976	1	You're right. I think the mods on r/btc go for the fully uncensored approach though. They only remove comments that have unnecessary profanity in them.
5	1523298109	1	Profanity is one thing, but when conversations devolve into "you're a moron" "no you're a moron" everyone in the sub loses, as far as I'm concerned.
