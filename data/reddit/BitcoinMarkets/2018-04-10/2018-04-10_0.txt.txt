0	1523336269	38	Wanted to throw up what my current view of the market is. A lot of its similar to what others are showing. This will probably be the longest post I've ever done so buckle in.Album I'll be referencing this whole post: https://imgur.com/a/Q5fG2So the first chart is on the logarithmic day chart (BFX). I have two descending triangles drawn; it's worth noting some may interpret it as a symmetric triangle. That said, the larger one is the largest formation I'm currently looking at. If it breaks down, a fair target would be maybe 5k before reevaluating. Per pattern rules it would have an eventual target of 2-2.5k but I'm of the mind that with the such heavy support likely in that range it may never get there. I also think that the support is so strong in this area because of the presence of that line, we were probably even dealing with that band around 6.6k. This support closely connects the November correction, the 6k flash crash, and the previous 6.4k low. Even the October correction only wicked it.Still, based on the number of times we've dipped down to this area now (also see: number of shorts opening, longs closing), bears are really trying to break this down *right this second*. That time frame is more in line with the current resistance line since 9k, which is currently around 7.2k.So does this break down right now (would be incredibly bearish)? I'm not so sure. Moving to chart two, we can see bearish divergence (purple) on the hourly that clearly indicated the massive drop. However, with the most recent bottom we've formed a hidden bullish divergence. Now, normal divergence is used to indicate a reversal and hidden to indicate continuation. That would only be true if we were in an uptrend and, given the higher lows since the flash crash to 6.4k, we may be in one on shorter time frames. So that's slightly bullish short term. That said, it's a small opportunity cost to wait until 7.2k breaks for good confirmation with the daily so I'm waiting for that before trusting this uptrend.On the third chart, we’re looking at a more intermediate time frame with the 7.5k local high to the 7.2k local high. You can see a symmetric/descending triangle with a small bear flag (not terribly happy with how fit looks but still valid for now). The issue with this triangle is that the trend from 9k wedge will likely break before this one; however, it does provide confluence on a shorter time scale that 7.2k is significant resistance.The flag is another reason I'm waiting on 7.2k to break. It obviously could break up but it still makes me hesitant and it could be a fine formation until 7k or so. Longing if that breaks up around 7k then is pretty high risk/low reward since we may just bang our heads off 7.2k again. More obvious confluence making 7.2 important, it also corresponds to the last local high and would confirm a double bottom if broken (possible double top if not). This support (6.5) and resistance (7.2) also closely corresponds with the 4 hr BBands.If I were a margin trader (I’m not), I would probably be longing 7.2k and shorting 6.5k or below with stops depending on your confidence level and sitting out until then due to risk / reward. You could maybe start scaling in earlier if you lean a little bullish personally. That said, I’m currently sitting wholly (cold storage and all) in fiat after getting stopped out for a small gain in the low 7ks. Not buying back in until after 7.2k (broken record).Now I’d like to mention some things I’ll be starting to look at once 7.2 or 6.5 breaks.If we do go test 7.2k, say we break through. I could see us getting slight resistance at 7.5k (possible double top) that I don’t think would really turn us back around. We’d then test the 7.8k-8.2k area, a place that’s been a sticking point for sideways action and has also acted as a lot of support/resistance. I’d reevaluate there but I wouldn’t be surprised if we went up to test the large descending triangle resistance (the ATH log resistance) in the mid-upper 8ks.If we don’t go test 7.2k, or do and get thrown back, it’s incredibly bearish. Would expect support at 6k from double bottom but compared to what we’d have just broken through I think the momentum would continue us through it. Maybe a technical bounce/some relief at 5.5k? Not sure, 5k would be fair as well (from what I said before). Would start to get interesting somewhere in there though. Daily RSI would go oversold, which never seems to last long so there’s that. Could throwback somewhere in 5k to go retest that support we broke and confirm it as resistance before continuing down.That’s as far as I’m willing to project some decently likely scenarios (and in no way are they the only ways that this could go – it’s obviously an ongoing evaluation).TL;DR: Long above 7.2k, Short below 6.5k. My position = currently fiat.
1	1523341539	4	Feel like throwing up, too xD
1	1523339673	4	Mandy: You got it!!
1	1523340721	6	is there a reason you didn't touch on how ETH going up might effect BTC? Because the bulls seem to be consistently stronger on ETH over the last 48 hours. If BTC was in a vacuum I could  see it breaking down below 6000 but I don't see that happening if ETH keeps trying to go up.
2	1523341114	4	I personally agree, I think it's a bit more speculative/subjective than what I was going for in my post though.Eth has been wrestling with $400 for awhile. I'm not yet convinced it can hold it. Last time it passed it it got up to $420; we'll see what happens.It's important to remember most alts have already dropped much more than BTC has off the ATH too, so them holding a little stronger now wouldn't be much of a surprise.
1	1523339686	3	lol. that's the worst thing you can do.this market has punished the breakout traders severely.
2	1523340254	3	When?Most significant breakouts/turn arounds have been clearly rewarded. When 7.8k bear flag broke? Great return. Short when 11.8k double top confirmed at 8.8 (or from 11.8k when we were rejected from the log ATH resistance)? Great return. Long when 7.2k local low bounced insanely hard? Great return.It's all about considering the time frame. Obviously I'm not going to buy in until the resistance/support is confirmed broken for the relevant time frame (likely daily, start heavily considering on 4 hr charts).
2	1523340389	1	Maybe those placing aggressive entries but it's been good to me. Taking conservative positions and waiting to see if a 30 minute candle resolves outside of an indicator or resistance before placing an entry has been pretty solid. Anecdotal evidence of course though haha.
1	1523350665	2	Solid analysis, thanks for posting!
0	1523378228	40	Point and Figure  https://i.imgur.com/CnqCmww.png  We have confirmed a column of 8 O's.  The only outstanding 50% long pole retrace for 2018 is from March 27.  A retrace of the March 27 long pole would bring us above $8,173.We are due for a large break out:  Here is a graph of the column heights over the last 70 days: https://i.imgur.com/XrSjwkt.png  Our columns have been getting smaller and smaller for about 2 weeks now, as you can see from the black line.  This tells me we are due for a larger break out move soon.  Looking at the full 70 days, we have also seen a decrease in pole length.  This corresponds with a decrease in volume and a wedge forming on daily timeframe.  That may come as a relief to those of you who have been getting chopped up for the last 1-2 months.Daily Chart https://www.tradingview.com/x/KzOHuQXN/  Sorry there is quite a lot going on here.  Let me point out some things:  **1.**  We are forming a very large wedge, and seeing a decrease to our previously large range.  **2.** Margin longs are down and margin shorts are up.  This is finally back to November 2017 levels.  But price is holding above the November 2017 price.  A lot of people see too many margin longs as an indicator that we are overbought and need to correct downward, so it is nice to see this level out again.  **3.**  Major support is at 4000-4200 and at 5800-6300.  **4.**  Major resistance is at 8100-8900.Daily RSI Bull Div on 4/7  https://www.tradingview.com/x/fuSodWFT/  Yes, it is 3 days past, but this bull div gives some hope to the bulls.  Arguably it has not completely played out nor has it been invalidated.My thoughts:  More sideways here would be bullish.  I also really like the 1 day bull div and the Long:Short ratio finally improving.  If we don't make new lower lows, I will slowly become more bullish.  But until this happens the play here is a short, either when we break through to new lows or short off major resistance (which is very far away).
1	1523379371	4	Appreciate the balanced analysis, thanks. 
1	1523380149	6	my TA senses tell me a correction up is around the corner .
1	1523378682	4	WhaleCalls shows us that long v short has minimal impact in the market... no matter how much this sub jerks off to it.
2	1523378989	9	I haven't read what WhaleCalls has said about it but I will say that I've spent over 10 hours attempting to integrate long and short data into a trading bot and was unable to improve existing bots nor create a new bot using the data.  It seems undeniable that it can be used to get trader sentiment but I would not take a trade off it.
3	1523379386	7	im building a bot to follow REKTs from bitmex and it is working great, when short get liquidated he enter state of buy mode and buy, and the opposite is true when long get liquidated he sells once the price go down.
4	1523379615	2	I like it :)  Brave little bot.
4	1523379667	1	Built around the basic idea, yet sound like an intelligent bot. Would love to know it's progress, successful implementation and outcome.
5	1523379810	1	still tweaking it, im not a good programmer so it takes more alot time to tweak in little things and have to wait for a friend most the time to correct my mistakes.
6	1523380672	1	The good part is the learning experience you are gaining. Whenever it is ready, you will be ready too to run it successfully. All the best!
4	1523380252	1	So, am I reading this wrong?  I'd think you would want to buy the dip after liquidated longs or short on liquidated shorts.Maybe the trading period you are targeting makes a difference.  I'm thinking in the 1 minute candle time-frame.
5	1523380366	1	when price go down and longs get liquidated the bot already in buy mode and waiting for the price to go up a bit(bounce) to buy then enter sell mode after short get liquidated. repeat. 
3	1523379158	1	So when there are more shorts the bot should buy and vice versa?
4	1523379517	2	I thought the potential for the data to be used:1. Buy when there is a sudden increase in longs to shorts (ie follow the herd) because there is probably a high volume break out.  This actually works for longing before Dec 19, but pretty much any bot that only longs worked before Dec 19 due to the strong bull market.2. Use as a qualifier for an existing bot to help prevent the bot from buying when 'overbought' (too many longs) or selling when 'oversold' (too many shorts).  Like most bot ideas; it didn't work.
5	1523386186	1	I'm tired of my algos failing 
3	1523386963	1	pretty much this but with over 2 years of data to prove it.
1	1523380678	1	Whenever I see that someone is drawing divergences like that I assume they are wrong... Can someone explain to me what are your rules, sometimes people are drawing it from the wicks, sometimes from the bodies. I learned only using wicks...
2	1523381139	8	Although I am a believer that it is more reliable or 'strong' when you get both in combination, the right answer is the bodies of the candle when looking at RSI divergence.RSI is calculated using open/close.  Wicks are totally ignored for RSI.  RSI Divergence arguably should be charted using a linear chart (as opposed to candles), but I am too lazy to change it to linear and I like to note the wicks.Some people will say that trendlines also play a role.  Ie, if the trendline lines up with bodies then bodies matter more, if the trendline lines up with wick tips then wicks matter more.  But I do not buy that.  I feel like those people have a misunderstanding of RSI.  They place too much importance on trendlines and we can see in the last few months (since institutional investors have taken to market making instead of us little fish having our way) trendlines are of very little importance.Divergence Cheat Sheet https://i.imgur.com/wVw4L6h.pngI have some more resources re: RSI if you are interested you can PM me.
3	1523382142	1	Thank you for this cheat sheet! Every time I see a possible divergence I have to google it to make sure it actually is a divergence, because I keep forgetting which is which.
3	1523383260	1	Thanks joyrider, great sheet.
2	1523380939	5	For RSI, bodies is correct. RSI is calculated using the open/close price of candles so using wicks is not the way to go - when the price was actually down at the wick the RSI would have been much lower than what it closed at.
0	1523365275	18	Long at $6727......
1	1523365839	5	I’m long from just about this. Didn’t get stopped out on drop to mid 6k’s yesterday. Feeling pretty good about this long right now 
0	1523345043	15	Reinforcing what I said couple of days ago - I'd be bearish if it weren't for 36k shorts open on Bitfinex. Holy sh!t, it just keeps growing. Just 1/3 of those shorts can wipe out the whole ask side of the orderbook, obviously it won't happen, but it shows the lack of liquidity and cascading margin liquidation is just a sneeze away. I'm also certain that some of those shorts are "hedged" positions to cover people's cold storage, however they'll have to claim or close those shorts anyway and not everyone will be able to do that if things turn ugly for bears. Plenty of time to open scalp short if things go down, but reversal should be explosive at this point, especially if 8k breaks. Still in a medium sized long position here... which means I'm biased and take my words with a pinch of salt.I'm also keeping an eye on stock market as it's not looking good and continued dropping would certainly remove some money from cryptos.
0	1523386624	13	Still not trading, and really enjoying it. I think few traders appreciate the mental toll it takes on them. It's like you're a computer with 16 GB RAM but 8 GB is always consumed by trading. It seems okay but it makes other life tasks less enjoyable. If you think this isn't you, ask yourself, how many hours of the day go by where you aren't aware of the price? Other aspects of my life have considerably improved since taking my trading hiatus. It's hard to see when you're in it. Trading destroys mindfulness.[Anyway, here's a chart showing current levels.](https://i.imgur.com/pFQjoRh.png)A break above red would be pretty bullish. I don't think a break down out of the blue triangle would be terribly bad -- there's big support at 5600, some support (including psych) at 5000, and even bigger support at 4300, but 4300 seems far-fetched.If you just look at the zoomed out shape, timing, and magnitude of the last two bubble crashes, we're just about due for some relief, whether that's a false break-out and DCB to 10-11k before more bear trend or sideways, or a resumption of the bull trend.This "feels" like it could either play out as an Adam & Eve, or we could just be consolidating before one more shake-out. Hard to say ahead of time. If I had to guess, the cynical part of me is bracing for a hard dump to 5k then a fierce bounce.
1	1523387062	3	Kudos. I definitely feel the strain of trying to trade. May I ask if you're effectively "out of the market" either by (a) being in fiat and/or (b) having cold storage hedged with a matching short? Or, did you simply make a really good entry (such as ~$6500 several weeks ago) and simply haven't been concerned with it. I ask because I tried moving completely to fiat for a couple weeks simply to take a break, and found myself nearly as stressed as before... concerned that I was going to miss the "big" move.
1	1523386735	2	Totally with you man on the first paragraph. And it's not more profitable for me to overanalyze and overtrade anyway. Just worse decisions chasing mediocre situations.
1	1523387711	2	>I think few traders appreciate the mental toll it takes on them. It's like you're a computer with 16 GB RAM but 8 GB is always consumed by tradingWell yes, in a way. But on the other hand, we need to see this as a good learning opportunity and embrace it. After all, that is what makes a good trader, embracing any market condition and adpat to it. It's like martial arts, never turn your face away from the hits because they you know for sure you will get hit/killed. Instead try to learn how to fight backI also think it shows how early this market is because very few people talk about trading psychology and mindset, and that there is not so many posts about it here, but for me those things has helped me 10x more than all stupid memes about "Hodl", "invest in the team" and whatever
1	1523386903	1	I entirely agree with your forecast

0	1523363607	20	Went long at 6728, went to sleep at 6728, woke up to 6728, came out of the shower to 6728. What a life!
1	1523363671	13	bitcoin the world currency, stability for everybody
1	1523364384	13	Wow you’re extremely over weight. 
1	1523363862	2	Haha. Relatable.
1	1523366951	2	6750 is the new 6728
0	1523351574	28	Been giving the George Soros event a bit of thought and a hypothesis is beginning to form..  Some 30,000 ft ideology of Soros’s investment philosophy:  He runs  for the most part a macro hedge fund, making macro bets on assets & currencies.  He enters relatively early in the market cycle of the event he expects to unfold.  Typically these opportunities are against major market sentiments i.e when the market is focused on A, he uncovers B which is overlooked.  He at times combines multiple assets/ currencies in a trade. Eg: Shorting Japanese yen while going long Japanese equities (circa 2012). Most importantly, he enters only when there is an expectation of a major market movement (no short term trades). That is the asset/ currency will either collapse or take off.  Now with respect to Crypto, his ideology would give the following clues:  If he’s entering now (and not at the peak) with a short, what is unlikely is that we will go down to an expected level (say 5k). Reason? Most of the crash would be over and done with, doesn’t tie into his strategy. What is more likely is that he would expect prices to collapse from here (not what we want to hear…but sub 1k for sure).  He could, conversely be looking at this as a macro play..most of the global markets don’t take crypto seriously and are dismissive (hence a contra play), and would be caught by surprise if we do see a 200k BTC price= big pay day for him.  Further, he may build a trade using BTC if for example, he’s bearish on global markets or expects a devastating global trade war, he could short equities while longing BTC.One could delve deeper to uncover further possible trades in line with his investment philosophy..above is just a thought experiment as of now. 
1	1523351897	9	You also forgot the part when he shorted since December, and now publicly declare he will start trading
2	1523352938	5	Agreed..Specifically left out that part as a quick scan through news clippings states that even though they got internal approval over the past few months, the fund managers are yet to make a trade..if that is a fib, then that is the age old tactic of positioning first then publicity.. 
1	1523351929	12	I'm tired of hearing about Soros non-stop for days, but your reasoned and thoughtful analysis is infinitely better than the memes and FUD. Thanks!
2	1523353783	2	Thanks! Glad it helped :)
1	1523352168	13	Institutional investors probably won't short from here. There is not enough liquidity to make any significant money for them on the way down. Unless their intention is to destroy crypto, or to have a slightly lower entry point.
2	1523356080	5	I personally believe that these big shots don't tell us when they are moving in. I believe they are already in(hence the crash) and now stating it publicly as they feel it's their entry point and need fresh money to flown back in.
3	1523358490	1	Its all a rich mans trick
2	1523353430	2	Soros jumps into a trade when he believes the market trend is following an incorrect assumption..here, it's us believing it's digital gold. If he disagrees, he'd believe the trend will unravel over time and BTC will come down to the true value.  The other angle is, as you stated, a lower price point..If he does short, it won't be for a slightly lower price thats for sure!I would tend more to the long bit as its a little too obvious he'd the kinda guy to short something like BTC esp. since he declared something to that effect in Dec/Jan..plus it would fall into his strategy of coming in 'early' into a relatively new currency/asset that's the global underdog..R/R is atractive on a 18-24 month horizon  
3	1523354276	1	if he would short Bitcoin \(and does not own them\) we would see it in the data. 4k got shorted here, that corresponds to 27M USD, not so much for a mister Soros. 
4	1523355868	1	Something about Soros shorting on Bitfinex or Bitmex just doesn't seem right..lol . CME? CBOE? Dark Pools/OTC markets?  But you have a valid point..do any of these hold enough liquidity to whet his appetite..
2	1523361142	4	You have absolutely 0 clue what institutional money is doing. Why pretend you do? 
3	1523370347	1	Hey, maybe /u/kanzen22 is an institutional investor.
4	1523381721	1	maybeeeee
1	1523356633	7	You're missing the forest for the trees. Yes there are some big trees making individual decisions, but who knows what 5d chess they are playing, what their endgame is. It's too facile to say 1 person makes 1 decision and executes this decision in 1 event, eg: Soros is going to buy on April 20th at $5500.The forest for hedge funds is that bitcoin is an [uncorrelated asset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ImlgTl3BPU) (not anti-correlated, ***un***correlated), which is extremely rare now, and provides great diversification for any portfolio - the volatility itself is attractive to some. Personally I care more that is that it's better at storing value than anything else humanity has ever come up with - the long term price rise is attractive to me. I think this is a more important and predictable aspect than its uncorrelation. And because the long term is more predictable, I think DCA is the smartest philosophy for bitcoin.
1	1523358398	8	I would say Soros is bullish on crypto especially after pumping $100 million into Overstock.
2	1523363668	2	He also owns a bunch of Caesars Entertainment. Crypto and casinos will go together like peas and carrots imo. 
1	1523357126	3	He could also be trying to secure some of his fortune against government reach, and it has nothing to do with Bitcoin mooning.
1	1523355589	2	If i had a lot of money and want to make good deal of money out of bitcoin, I would short futures and buy bitcoin, which i call set spring strategy. After accumulated a lot of bitcoin, I would stop shorting close all short positions and market buy bitcoin on several exchanges to create another bull run over time. The key is to store a lot of btc to dictate when the bull run will be over. It is a new market and has a lot of opportunities for big money people.
1	1523356258	0	Soros was last week, now it's Thanos.
0	1523364847	20	Closed my short at around $6,750 for a pretty decent profit. I opened it at $7,100. Edit: just not certain which way this is going to go in the short-term, and I'm fine opening a short again below 6400 if this breaks down. But don't want to be in the way if it breaks up.
1	1523366413	1	I've had this thought rolling around for a while, and it's probably the wrong place to ask it, but... on the topic of "*if* it breaks down"Do you think the OKEX futures cascading liquidation meltdown to the mid-$4K's 1.5 weeks ago was a realistic model for what a breakdown of $6k might look like on the spot market, or was it completely due to a lack of price controls and unlikely to play out similarly?
2	1523366601	9	Most people in this sub have probably never seen a cascading liquidation meltdown in spot, since we haven't seen one since the final dump from $300 to $160. It's pretty horrifying, and the action on okex is pretty indicative of how that might play out here *if* the market does make a confident push below $6,000. 
2	1523368147	1	Can anyone share a chart of OKEX from that time period?  I only knew about that meltdown based on the comments here and never looked.  cryptowat.ch doesn't seem to show it.
3	1523368606	2	You can kind of see it on the 1 hour, but the lower time frames aren't visible (at least on the default settings I use)https://cryptowat.ch/futures/okcoin/btc/usd/quarterly/1h
4	1523369260	1	Ah thanks much, perfectly visible.  Seems I was looking at the wrong chart.Damn that's scary.
1	1523367395	1	Had the same short, closed it last night at 6700. I don't like to sleep with open positions even with stop losses, and as you said this can go either way from here. Waiting for clearer signals or a breakdown to enter again
1	1523371241	1	3 failed attempts at 7.5k with lower highs. Where do you see the bullishness here?I doubt that we will see 7.3k before 6.1k.Short didn’t really blink in the previous dcb. Longs will close if we go any higher than 7k, not even shorts.
2	1523372368	3	I never said I was bullish. Just that I'm uncertain. I'm not suggesting the market is suddenly going to blast off to $10K. It's just hovering for now. Which is never a particularly good time to be holding a position or entering a new one.

1	1523373999	1	It seems like your moves have been absolutely spot-on for the past couple weeks.  The short from 7100 was just hours before a several hundred dollar drop. And then you closed it at the right moment too.  What are you using to decide it was time to get out into and out of that short, just hours before the price starts moving.

1	1523341576	6	Good chart mate. Long term support has been showing strength over the past few days.
1	1523341589	2	If it does anything like the last wedge did after ath, look out below

3	1523360386	5	Well it is the bottom (5.8-6) for the last 3 months so its a fair point. Although, its only a bottom until its not.
3	1523360409	0	its a bottom between 11K and 3K
2	1523365736	1	major short squeeze incoming?
1	1523359145	1	To be fair it really should be quite obvious that this would happen in the bear market following BTC's ATH. What I find more astounding is the number of longs still open and the time it took for shorts to reach ATH. Unfortunately the data we have to work with doesn't trace back very far so it's difficult to imagine the upper limits and averages of long/short positions a BTC bear market dictates.
2	1523360703	2	Low lev longs are basically impossible to squeeze so not that astounding.
3	1523360784	1	I’m just comparing this dip to the one from February where longs were devastated but not so much now
3	1523367210	1	Can confirm. Still sitting on one from $7.3 and not terribly worried about it.
1	1523358909	-1	It's not 1 BTC=1 trader. Big players might be hedging and they rightfully should be. The real question is who is still going long and risking a double whammy on their trading stack and cold storage. Those are the people that are most likely to panic close on a drop under 6k, not the hedged shorts on another lower high to 6.9. 
2	1523359394	0	The only data we have is the amount of open shorts. If somebody hedges his BTC and the price climbes he has 2 options to avoid getting liquidated: 1. He must transfer all his BTC to the exchange and accepts to give away his whole stack for his hedges price and 2. He accepts to make a loss with his trading stack on the exchange. Regarding an upwards movements to and above 8k would be a mid\-term trend reversal and I doubt all the hedgers want to sit only in fiat.
1	1523359667	1	If a buyer wanted to wreck a majority of the shorts what would it take?
2	1523361211	4	Clearly a Soros throw away account. :-p

0	1523368500	6	I frequent this sub mostly lurking and I sat out of crypto from mid-January until this last week and a half. When I first got in (late october 2017) I had a pretty solid strategy for accumulating more bitcoin by trading the litecoin ratio. I rode the bull wave up in litecoin and made some outsized gains like everyone else in December only to see it plummet once I started trading alts in an emotional panic. It was a hard learning experience and I was lucky in that I didn't dump my capital all in at once. So now I've returned (the prodigal son?) and am exclusively trading in ETH. I use bitcoin chart action to help guide my decision making with ETH movement and am doing my best to accumulate more ETH or at least maintain my stack (very minimal trading maybe one to three times per week). How many of you utilize bitcoin movement to inform your decision making for ETH? I've really made a concerted effort to ignore all of the news and operate strictly off of the chart action I'm seeing as well as the underlining volume and established trend. I thoroughly enjoy the discussion on this sub and the transparency that some utilize when trying to formulate their trading strategy. I hope to continue to grow and utilize my stock market experience to help me grow in the crypto market place. Happy Tuesday everyone. 
1	1523372514	1	When I stopped trading ETH all I was watching was bitcoin. Then I realized that in terms of monetary value there was no reason not to trade bitcoin instead. Eth followed the pumps and dumps of bitcoin but performed worse over time. I reached that decision when it went from 0.1 ratio to 0.096 ratio. Now ratio is just below 0.06
2	1523376779	1	Bitcoin has more liquidity as well
1	1523373423	1	I think this is really wise. My stack is by far mostly ETH (although I’m looking for a BTC entry) and always find it comical when people try to chart ETH independently. ALTS are so tied to BTC still I’ve never understood why some folks look strictly at ETH charts expecting it to detach any time soon.

2	1523366270	1	6600 held, and I anticipate we may test it again but fall through momentarily
0	1523370449	5	Been very busy of late and haven't been able to maintain discipline on my daily analysis. It sucks as I've had a nice long open for a while now which I would have liked to close yesterday at the channel resistance. I'm not mad tho, as it's still ITM, it hit a few take profit limit orders and there's been some juicy funding of course.It's all sideways action anyway. There's a weak bullish cross due on the 6h and thinning cloud, but recent attempts to get anywhere near 7.5k show that this is little to be excited about. According to the chikou, it could go either way. but the cloud immediately above now is thick, thick, thick!6h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ErY4n0VKThe view from upstairs is the same, so there is potential for a change as we move forward and barring any further downside. The chikou is trailing its 6h counterpart, but looks headed to mingle with the chop of the last week or so. The longer we do go sideways, the more likely this is to bottom out here and the bullish targets are already dropping below 8k for month end.12h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/O5h5Q4heThe window of opportunity is still wide open on the daily. With downside momentum also petering out, with the tenkan and kijun lines turning to the horizontal and the chikou bottoming out, there's probably a lot of eyes on the prize rn, which is still 9k. The kumo seems to have stopped thickening, but I doesn't look like it'll twist again until late May or later. 1d: https://www.tradingview.com/x/eAqXRFIpWith all this I'm neutral. I've made a couple of trades recently (including the current) both long and I managed to take profit with about 30% of the trade size only to close out the rest OTM, so I'm aware that the bearishness is far from behind us, but the continued lack of further downside cannot be discounted.TL;DR: lately, when I see BTC anywhere near 6.5k I just knee-jerk buy.

1	1523350167	4	Cheap bitcoins soon?
1	1523369407	1	Limited supply.
2	1523379324	1	That's not a valid bullish case. Firstly, the supply is greater than when the price was at 19k, and secondly, I could just retort that ANY supply was bearish
1	1523352187	1	too much buying pressure at 6.5-6.6k. too few traders willing to sell 6.5k. Last Feb, it was Kobayashi who didn't mind pulling an 18k trigger at that level..
1	1523351279	0	People are starting slowly to DCA. Which means if it goes lower they will buy to lower their DCA. And before you know it you have a reversal.
1	1523355050	0	We have not broken 6.5k . And not for lack of trying. We are sitting in a trend line that will colide with the downwards channel in a few days. Last time this happened there was a huge dump, but it looks like the momentum of the market it's much weaker now.
2	1523379503	1	Fair enough about the long term support that just happens to be sitting a little below us at 6.5k now, but weren't we at the low 6.4k's last week? 
3	1523379645	1	All of those got rejected very strongly. As long as 2 consecutive 4h candles stay there i don't consider it violated. 
0	1523382937	10	Its quite interesting to compare the 2013/14 bubble with the 2017/18 bubble:[https://imgur.com/a/Cs6MJ](https://imgur.com/a/Cs6MJ)A period of low volatility also occured after a drop to around 35&#37; of the ATH and lasted than \(with one down\- and one upspike\) till mid of Mai. The drop to this price level was almost at the same day in the year \(24th vs. 26th of March\). Check the chart to see what happend afterwards. As the bubble popping lasted much longer in 2013/14 the stabe phase lasted longer. Hence, if we follow more or less the same pattern I expect the phase of low volatility will last less in 2018.
1	1523384116	2	Great post, thanks
1	1523385262	1	What we need is more memes over at /r/bitcoin
1	1523384386	1	How long do you expect it to last in 2018 then? 
1	1523385440	1	Haha if this plays out similary the downtrend line will be broken around 8.5 or so, everybody will call moon again and then around 10k, tadaaaa

Would have hit my original target (6799) if i stuck to my plan and would have made 10 months fucking rent. Fuck me. You have to accept the risk of a loss in order to win. If you make good plans, youl win more then you will lose at the end of the day and thats what really matters.
1	1523375720	12	It’s funny, I have absolutely no money to put into Bitcoin but I still find myself reading this sub every day and watching the markets😂 Any other lurkers out there like me?
2	1523376702	7	Howdy! I lurk here because people actually seem to put skin into their analysis - - also like the low-key vibe to learn in.
3	1523376824	4	Me too, I’m hoping to invest one day when my life’s in a better place and I scour through all the crypto subs but this one seems more down to earth than the others, even if it does make me jealous😂

2	1523375752	7	put ten bucks in, double it tradinggdax.com (no fees)we all started somewhere 
3	1523375929	7	I agree with this, and tbh its way easier to trade with 10$ then it is with 1000, 100000, etc etc. meaning you can trade fearlessly and without emotions, so youl probably see great success. Watch out that might get you hooked tho lol
4	1523376000	5	I started trading in 2017 with 0.1 BTC (at the time 100 bucks) that I traded up to 1BTC. Then added 4 BTC and been trading with 5BTC ever since and always move profits to cold storage
5	1523376110	2	Wow, nice work!!
6	1523378587	1	You will do it too
7	1523378715	1	Man it would be a dream to have that kind of money! But yes I hope so:-)
8	1523379032	1	dude, ten bucks.You can put ten bucks into Bitcoin. You know you dont have to buy a whole one
9	1523382361	1	I know lol, still haven’t paid the last two months fees for my daughters nursery!😅 Don’t invest what you cant afford to lose, I can’t afford to lose ten bucks😂
4	1523376234	2	well the point here is rather that you should downsize until you feel that, regardless of position size. if you have the slightest gut feeling that you are overinvested, just get out and wait. Took me  a long time to learn but really helped. You also need to learn to love to lose
3	1523376394	3	There's no fees on GDAX?  Take my money!  I have some BTC sitting in Coinbase that maybe I could play with.  Do I need to create a new account on GDAX and then transfer?  Sorry for the N00b question.
4	1523376781	3	Do not need to create separate account, use the same one, very easy to transfer. GL!just go to gdax.com, sign in w/ coinbase account
4	1523377042	2	Thank you, both.
4	1523376617	4	yep, but only limit orders are free.Make a GdAX account using your coinbase login.You can transfer between GDAX and coinbase instantly for free too. You should be up and running in 5 minutes
1	1523375540	2	I picked up a journal yesterday to start my trading log so I can learn from these mistakes and replay these trades in my head, a tip from an expert prop trader on how to increase how fast you learn from the experience you do get. By repeating trades in your head and going over them you can turn 1 trades worth of experience into 5
1	1523375795	2	Same happens to me all the time, i should just use stop losses and be patient instead of selling instantly when it starts to go down. Missed out on a lot of gains because of that :s
2	1523378174	2	If you have a clear strategy that is sound, it will be way more easy to be patient and to manage risk/emotion!
1	1523375566	1	Likely can write stories during JUST this chop, where could have made more money than in first three months of the year.
1	1523375662	1	Yeah, but you don't really know it's solid until after the fact!What *was* solid was your risk management, considering that you didn't lose anything.  So don't be too hard on yourself.  (though completely exiting a position due to cold feed isn't exactly great risk management... but it's better than losing!)But I did the same thing but in reverse, abandoning a short just before the nice drop a few days ago.  So I totally feel ya, and still wish I could have decent risk management and still make profits.Next time I am in that situation, rather than getting cold feet, I'm going to set some limits to *scale out*, so that if it does go the way I originally wanted to go, maybe I can still have some of the position.  But if it does go against me, still escape.  (Though still, I prefer to setup scale outs within a profit zone and not a loss zone)
2	1523375760	2	I see what you are saying, but if you have good reasoning/ta/analysis behind ur trade, you can say its solid, even if it does end up going the other way. It was a solid plan, even if it fails, you know? 
3	1523375814	1	Good point.  I consider those cases to be "no regrets" situations.
1	1523375706	1	buy/sell, set stops, walk awaycome back when in profit
2	1523375989	1	manual stops are way better to prevent the fake breakouts from getting you, but I guess just open a smaller position and have the stops lower.
3	1523376335	1	I usually set stops below support, so hard to get faked out, but it does happen
0	1523347091	3	The amount of shorts to longs is getting pretty intense now.Still, I wouldn't base your trades on them but when the shorts get this high to longs ratio it would be wise to use as a supporting indicator as a move upwards can be explosive if fomo kicks in, safe trading everyone!
0	1523374144	5	Just chiming in to say that if approximately 6.85k (maybe 6.9) holds then the bear flag on the 1/4 hr charts starts to look a lot more well formed.
1	1523375370	1	you mean a long wik to 6.9k? 
2	1523375886	2	Basically. The 4 hr candle closes in 2 min (and obviously the 1 hr candle too). The current high wicks of the 4 hr and 1 hr candles line up with the bear flag's boundaries almost perfectly. Makes me a bit more confident that we're currently in a flag (still could obviously break in either direction).
0	1523382641	4	I'm still waiting for the short squeeze. During that mini pump 700 new shorts were openend, not closing my long from 6720 for now. 
1	1523382828	3	Where can we see total # of longs vs shorts on bitmex?
2	1523383067	2	I was referring to bitfinex open shorts. Would also be interested if you can see the bitmex stats anywhere.
1	1523382882	3	Me neither, you'll never make real money closing too early. I have a stop at breakeven tho.
0	1523383054	4	Can anybody point me to an article that predicts an ongoing bear market through summer 2018? All I can find for bearish articles is one guy saying it's gonna be bearish with no Reasoning, and someone writing fluffy crap around that one quote to meet a word count quota. I've found a few that give reasons for a bull market, but it's the usual "event that is happening that will lead to more fiat coming in". The whole tax season ending thing comes to mind. However, we had similar periods recently that didn't result in anything good. Look at the "wall street bonuses" being spent on crypto back in January, that was a dud. That's why I think this whole tax thing is a crock.I just want to read about technical reasons why a bear market could last 6+ months. I don't day trade, and I'm more Interested in long term trends. My gut tells me that since an overwhelming amount of bulls believe the bull run will start this summer, that the opposite of a  confirmation bias will occur and nothing will happen, which will panic bulls and send this market into a year long bear.I would love for a bull run to fire off this summer, but I am very skeptical, I would say I am legitimately bearish. I do like to read both sides of the spectrum though.So basically, anything that you can suggest for good reading regarding why this bear market is here to stay for the next 6+ months? 
1	1523383234	12	Read this sub from the same date and month but in 2014
2	1523383490	3	At first I thought that was stupid, but honestly not a bad suggestion. Thank you, I'll check it out. Can't hurt. 
3	1523383898	1	Lmk what you found. 
4	1523384083	7	people saying the  same stuff, talking about fundamentals and how the bubble cycle is going to be shorter than expected and a recovery is imminent any second now really all it takes is a gander in the old dailies to sober yourself up to the reality of what's possible 
5	1523385271	2	6 more years of winter then.
5	1523387506	1	with the difference that in 2014 the exchange with 85&#37; market share went bankrupt and people had no accounts on other exchanges to buy Bitcoin....
6	1523387654	1	so why are we lower now than we were then? in terms of %ATH and time elapsed since ATH. In a more liquid market with better fundamentals..? 
2	1523384158	2	So you're tellin' me there's a chance.ʕ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°ʔ
1	1523387072	1	My scientific wild ass guess it is a several years long bear market. No TA. 
0	1523387765	3	So this "double bubble" has become a meme but* so has the "double bottom" and also the "we are here" from the 2014 chart. Do we have enough good news coming out to sustain this price? Meh. Not yet.Do we have enough bad news to drive us to the doldrums that 2014 did? Maybe. The remaining gox coins are on the horizon in some way-shape-form. Has the general public become familiar enough with crypto for us to double bubble? I think so. It seems crypto has caught on in a huge way in the run up and now that the everyday person, moms and pops, and the technologically challenege have become familiar with the terminology on a basic level and are able to buy crypto now. I do believe it's possible with a solid push higher to test above 10k, there's the opportunity for this to have been just the first push of the big push to higher. I'd like to hear the counter to this and maybe hear why btc won't be able to sustain or why btc should enter a longer bear market and correction? I'm watching the Zuckerberg youtube video and the chat is constant crypto shilling... eye opening to see this take place in a live stream of something that has nothing to do with crypto.
0	1523376677	10	Doesn't matter if your outlook towards the market is bearish or bullish (terms that divide us), still there is one thing that unites us, which is the common goal to make profit.I personally have a bullish outlook (I like the idea of prices going up rather than going down). But with time, we need to adapt. I learnt this by shorting and realized having a bearish outlook is just as same. If I feel the price is going to go down, I will adapt bearish outlook.As I predicted previously (I have my reasons to believe), I think the price is going to go up. I have had 5 successful past closings all with leverages, first two shorts and then three longs, the current one being the sixth (caught up during the dip and impulse took over, opened a long at 8459) I am still a bit away from break even. I have already decided not to sell since I caught this up, and as of now, not for the next 3-6 hours at least based on the behavior of price unless something radical happens.This is my outlook, what is yours? Are you bearish or bullish at this very moment (knowing the fact that the market has been bearish since 20K dip). Do you feel the price will go above 7300 this time and continue to do so until at least 10K?
1	1523378854	8	I would say that the only thing that really unites us is this weird ass thing called bitcoin

2	1523379442	1	hahaha. I have a colleague who always say that Bitcoin is built around speculation and there is no intrinsic value to it (which is a whole new topic to debate on), what I tell him is that you have never tried trading Bitcoin, try it once and then we'll talk. He's getting convinced day by day to invest small portion of his dispensable income. Call it a trap but he will like it. 
1	1523377389	4	As long as people leave low buy orders intact and don't start to market buy in fear it might never gets there, I'm bearish. A short squeeze is fun but nowhere near enough to sustain momentum. I think we'll see at least a last capitulation leg down, which would be preferable to months of slow bleed after a slow run to 9k or so, but it's impossible to tell. The thing is, I remain open minded, not excluding this could be the bottom, so I'm cautious long or short but prefer to try to let my longs run in case a bull run is kickstarted somehow, whereas I don't hesitate to take profits quickly on shorts if I don't have a super high entry.
2	1523378828	4	I think you are very clear about what you are doing, which is absolute necessary, you know what you need to do and having that sense of realization is really important in a market like this. > think we'll see at least a last capitulation leg downI thought exactly the same during the last dip from almost 7200. Now I don't. It's will play out as either you being right or myself. haha. But yeah, once we both know the direction, I think we will go in together for certain.>prefer to try to let my longs run in case a bull run is kickstarted somehowThis is wise of you, you never know what might happen the next minute! 
2	1523379874	1	> I'm cautious long or short but prefer to try to let my longs run in case a bull run is kickstarted somehow, whereas I don't hesitate to take profits quickly on shorts if I don't have a super high entry.excellent strategy imo
1	1523378020	1	I think that $6k ish is the bottom and will stay the bottom. We will see movement between $6.5 to $8k for a while till there is more public interest in bitcoin again and the price slowly goes up...probably a lot in the next few years especially 2020 when mined bitcoin halves again. People that got burned since $20k in January will eventually forget....
2	1523379213	2	I can't be sure of 2020 but yeah I agree with you on $6K ish being the bottom which is here to stay.
3	1523384285	1	I agree with both of you unless we take a dip down to 4.8K which would cause a violent swing back up to where we are now, resulting in no discernible difference in the long term. 
1	1523377052	2	I'm neutral. I can see bitcoin being range bound between 6 and 8k for months to come.
0	1523345537	7	Shorts are nearing 37k which I believe is an ATH for finex, and if demand doesn't pick up then they might be on the right side of the trade. Edit: more than 37k now.

0	1523353387	13	Good morning Guys and Gals, lets take a look at the Bitcoin market at the start of this week.One of the most dangerous occupations in the volatile crypto markets is “calling bottoms”.With that said, it is impossible to enter new positions if we don’t look for the change in the trend, and the eventual breakout.In my opinion the Bitcoin market has started a little bullish trend (and possible bottom) on the very short term, since the start of April.The flip side to this coin is that there is also a bear flag in the short term to contradict the recent price action.For me to remain bullish on the short term we need to stay above $6600 with good trading volume.Short term resistance is around $6800 and I would expect the market to give some direction soon.Should we fail to break the resistance and fall through the current near term support zone, I will look to the bearish side, a possible test of $6000 – $5500, and according to some analysts on YouTube much lower.So far the market has responded well above the 6500 support zone and I will keep an eye on what happens should prices consolidate below this price level.Should prices consolidate above the short term resistance, we will most likely see a quick retest of $7200 – $7600, and perhaps a push into the 8k zones. Fomo depending it could go much higher ofc.I will post another report should we face a breakout situation.[You can find the chart wizardry here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptosignals/)Feel free to discuss this trade idea with me in Discord, safe trades.
1	1523356873	9	So you're basically saying if it goes down a bit you expect it to go down further, and if it goes up a bit you expect it to go up further. This is why sometimes I'm not the biggest fan of TA..
2	1523357586	1	Well you can take it like this:If we go above 6800 (possible long to 7k) - above 7k (possible long to 7600), etc.The same goes if 6500 fails, possible short to 6000.Still up x10 (and more) from $400, so this is how i give my analysis.
1	1523357010	7	Low volume can also mean sellers are exhausted at the price point. It doesn't always mean bearish trends. We can also climb with low volume. 
0	1523334418	7	BTC has been unusually stable in the last 10 days, stuck between 6500 & 7500.
1	1523334841	8	Only in crypto a $1000 spread (15%) is stable lol. But I do think that range is noise at this point and probably most of us are waiting for a proper breakout either way.
2	1523337342	6	> Only in crypto a $1000 spread (15%) is stable lol.Haha yes. We've been spoiled with generous volatility.
1	1523338571	4	Yes. right. I'm adding.. piece by piece.. because on long term ( 3- 9 months ) we will be higher.Because i think the " big boys" do the same.  If they want it more down they can do it... So far this range - 6500 - 7500 is OK for me to add. Always my 2 cents
2	1523342567	2	I used to think otherwise, but now I begin to think 6500 is not a bad place to slowly start DCAing for LT holders. And there is evidence that quite a few people are doing that (on ETH too) Good luck!
2	1523340297	1	thats pretty much where I'm at. certainly has been a brutal sack of weeks though

1	1523346858	5	Short squeeze... Bitcoin's great white hope
1	1523348162	3	I’m confused, i thought a lot of shorts indicate trust in downtrend?
2	1523348432	7	Sure, but if the downswing does not come, they are paying interest, and if an upswing comes, they are losing. When shorts eventually close, they will have to buy back the coins they are short, so the larger the amount of open shorts is, the more potential rebuying there is.
2	1523350422	0	edit:seemed wrong
1	1523348123	1	What was Mike’s target to sell this time? 
2	1523348434	2	Around 7100. Let's see if he is right again, he seems to be pretty on fire.
3	1523348599	1	i hope he is right this time again, but doesn't 7100 look very optimistic right now in a short term?

0	1523351807	5	All the pro traders here who short as a way to hedge their cold storage, I have a question for you guys. Do you still believe in bitcoin long term? Will you add more at the "bottom"? Are you interested in increasing BTC stash eventually or would you be happy with the fiat you make? 
1	1523354768	10	Yes, BTC is the first step to end federal reserve banking, centralization of  payment censoring(see Wikileaks blocked by Visa) and inflation as a way to steal from the poor without assets and only cash.BTC and blockchains is for money and decentralized storage what Internet and email is for freedom of speech and democratization of knowledge and technologyThis is the reason being a coin maximalist is extremley stupid, and especially the ETH or BTC guys tend to be that
2	1523362144	1	> being a coin maximalist is extremley stupidWhy do you think that ?

0	1523382837	3	This recent price action gives me the strange feeling that the big players are slowly rounding up the bears in a corner, before springing the trap and slaughtering them. I can count at least twice where we have broken down from downtrend continuation patterns (once on 6th April from a symmetrical triangle on the 1hr, and today from a rising wedge on the 1hr), only to have the downward move stymied arbitrarily before a reversal. If you count yesterday's high volume dump from 7200 to 6600, that would make this three times where we have almost approached the critical price levels between 6k - 6.5k, only to have the selling pressure abruptly "switched off". It is a strange phenomenon from a bear's perspective, because as a big shorter, you would know that you could rely on a cascading wave of further selling (caused by stops being hit, liquidations of underwater longs, and breakout traders trading the price to the downside) if 6k is breached to make your short profitable. Why would sellers stop selling near 6.5k, when the momentum is clearly on their side? Buyers have also shown little strength (based on the volume of recent rallies), whereas sellers have shown yesterday that the market will allow them to knock the price down almost 10% in 1 hour with a simple "how do you do".I am hesitant to call 6.5k the bottom, just because of the weak buying volume and the amount of time we have spent at these price levels, which suggests that buyers aren't very strong. On the other hand, I am open to the interpretation that large-scale accumulation is occurring at these price levels. I am already seeing signs of that occurring in majors like Eth, which may portend the same accumulation happening in BTC (since cryptomarkets generally move together). Looking to hear from the bulls and bears here (especially bears) on their thoughts regarding recent price movements.
1	1523383481	4	> the big players are slowly rounding up the bears in a corner, before springing the trap and slaughtering themI know this market is manipulated on individual and small whalepod levels but I just don't buy these grand narratives. I think we are just riding a strong long term support that has been there for 6 months. We still have three potential large descending triangles close to forming and I haven't seen any kind of buying strength to indicate that one of them won't break down.That said I am keeping my short entries to when they meet these resistances, as the margin of error for shorts is very low this close to the support line.https://www.tradingview.com/x/DImhZ4qh/
2	1523383914	2	> I think we are just riding a strong long term support that has been there for 6 months.That support is epic, my thoughts are also on miners, is it possible that they are keeping this price to keep mining profitable?
3	1523384221	3	and what do they do when they need to sell? hope that people start buying? 
0	1523348403	3	Being right above support and having so many bottom shorters the most obvious thing to do here is so to go long, however we have a descending triangle on the 4h. Plus whenever the funding for shorts is empty someone instantly replenishes it with 3k coins at very low rates. Someone definitely is trying(and has the means to) to push this market down, which is why I'm really hesitant to open a long here. As long as the shorts have funding it doesn't really matter how many they are. Best thing to do rn is nothing imo. Maybe open a long with stops at 6.5k.
1	1523349475	7	> Someone definitely is trying(and has the means to) to push this market downOr trying to suck in more shorters only to liquidate them.
2	1523349720	2	The thought did hit me, but it seems too hopiumish that someone would do that when the market is as bearish as it has ever been.
1	1523349687	2	he is giving low funding to the longs too
2	1523350284	3	Yes, but thats nothing new though - this instant replenishment of BTC on funding is new. Normally we would've run out of funding a long time ago and we would get short squeezes. Now it seems someone is trying to delay/kill the short squeezes before they even start. I might just be paranoid and more people know about it now though. But that doesn't explain why the funding is so cheap.
0	1523349969	5	Closed my [short](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8afnvv/daily_discussion_saturday_april_07_2018/dwz4kdl/?context=2) (7035->6665) that I held through the peak at 7200 and opened a long from 6675 on average. This is more of a scalp and I'll exit at 6800 unless there's a massive bump in buying. There seems to be no clear indication and I'll admit this long is mostly a gut feeling. Nevertheless, the last two weeks have been very good and I feel like I can afford a higher risk trade. Manual stop at ~6600.
1	1523350513	6	Looks like a pretty standard bearflag. Looking at the similar fractal 18-25 March, this has preeeetty high downwards potential.In any case, I'm surprised how many posts here are bullish. Is it really probable that we go right up again after yesterdays definitive breakdown? Doesn't it make much more sense that we will have to find the bottom of this short-term fall first?
2	1523351519	4	I'm not exactly bullish but what I'm seeing is a trendline that we broke through at 5k and held at 5.5k, 6k, which we are now sitting on.  Not sure how strong it is really but so far there hasnt been much attempt to break into all these orders around 6.5k and with shorts at ath and still not even close to breaking that resistance it's hard to really say which way this will go...  pretty much just have to wait for these whales to decide for us plebs, and really are any whales going to want to try dumping into it when they may have a hard time filling up their huge orders slightly lower?so yeah I'm just flat atm but slightly optimistic
3	1523352160	1	There's no need to be bullish to believe that shorts squeezes are a real thing.
2	1523350798	2	What I'm seeing is some upward momentum on short-term MACD (edit: 2h, 3h, 4h), and dumps being fairly violently rejected (edit: on microscale). These are weak indicators that matter to me, and without something stronger to go on enough to put in for a scalp and quit the short. I personally put no trust in fractals, and my opinion is that the market doesn't either to such a degree that I should. Also I wouldn't categorize myself as bullish, I was vehemently bearish throughout the latest pump.
3	1523354644	1	What are your strong indicators? I watch MACD, RSI, EMA, SMA, SRSI, BBANDS etc...
4	1523357430	1	Volume, 2h+ RSI, longs vs shorts appear to be strong indicators for more than scalps. 
1	1523350277	3	reasonable trade, if these shorts dont start seeing some more down movement there could be a decent squeeze
0	1523373355	3	What kind of weak shit is this... cashed in [my long](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8b4twg/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_10_2018/dx497fg/?context=3) 6675->6820 and out of position. I'd scalp a short back to 6700 except I don't think it's worth it with risk, fees and interest.
1	1523373406	4	Yeah, pretty disappointed with this pump.
1	1523373985	2	Ah, you 1 minute candle chasers. 
2	1523374561	1	Well, yes, as long as you don't confuse it for being finicky or easily spooked. I did state it was a scalp and my target was lower than when I actually closed. Since I'm no longer reasonably certain of the direction, the best position is no position.
3	1523376670	1	Alright, I thought it was being easily spooked, see a lot of that, your reasoning make sense. 
1	1523373703	1	I did basically the same. Let's see whether we go up again or, as I suspect, back down in a short period of time.
0	1523374198	3	[Chart](https://i.gyazo.com/6d8a20f85709b532bb6c8d42bdc3b960.png)Seems like $7090 until we hit log resist line again.

1	1523358100	1	there is no single order book, each exchanges order book is found on their trading site
2	1523358244	2	ye well, if im looking at the chart of finex id like to see the orderbook there
1	1523360198	1	Yes they are there: https://prnt.sc/j3ajsy
0	1523362622	2	Exited my long from 6657 at 6745.Target of 6795 was actually hit, spot on but i fucked up my alarms once again so i missed it. on a happy note, i know what ive been doing wrong with them, ive been setting them but not confirming lol.Anyway, im on side lines now, still getting tighter and im busy at uni all day so wont be able to keep an eye.Cos we're getting so bloody tight, i think next move is gonna be a major one and my gut is telling me it'll be up but what the fuck do i know...anyway, if you are trading today then good luck, this is some really risky business now.
1	1523363300	3	Instead of alarms why not set a limit sell at your target price?
2	1523364354	1	Yeah for take profits definitely set limits.  For stop losses alarms can be better.  Because in the former knives are desirable but not for the latter.
2	1523366921	1	I have tight stops and don't wanna get chopped out by random wicks but thinking about it now, probably better to have profit take hard set and then alarms for stop losses as the guy below said
0	1523364697	2	Looks like we are in a slight [symmetrical triangle](https://www.tradingview.com/x/iBEzOP5u/). With lower highs and higher lows. Could break either way, but R/R looks better for a long here. Then again it also looks like a bear flag and the overall trend is down.Opening a very small long here just because I use Bitmex and it'll shit the bed one we have confirmation. SL right at bottom of triangle, 6580.

0	1523385342	2	Still having my June futures long from 6645, and this little move was nice. However I just have this feeling that in this treacherous bear market, taking profits while you can is always a good thing.  Putting stops quite close to what to me looks like a bull flag on 15m, still seems the market haven't decided for sure yet and do do horziontal level swing trading with bigger positions and less leverage (instead of opposite in trending markets) is the better thing here

Might just stay in USDT for awhile and wait to see if sub-6k ever happens. Trading in a market with barely any liquidity is just stupid.  
1	1523364166	9	Bogdanov watches for comments like this
1	1523364566	10	You got stopped out by a 2% move, that's not the fault of whale manipulation. Your stops (>6.6) made no sense considering that 6.6 was yesterday afternoon's low. You're either overleveraged or lack the confidence to be in the position you took and you should stay out of position for now. 
1	1523364304	8	Your stops are too tight You want to put your stops below the 24 hr low and generally also below support lines. The latter can fuck you hard, but generally once we dip, we go lower anyways
2	1523364725	1	exactly this, a stop around 6.4 would be good, a touch to 6.4 and we might really go down
0	1523375724	2	Anyone else expect some consolidation/sideways  here before the next move? We pretty much hit the top of the bear flag on thar wick with a target of 6869. Shorted this and believe we are headed back to mid 6700’s 
1	1523376104	2	So you closed your long on that move as a scalp?Still holding mine, maybe I'm getting married to that position.  But it's worth so little so I won't close here.  Still think I'd hold this and just add to it if we go lower.Your short plan seems decent at least for a tiny scalp to the bottom of the bear flag, maybe for more if you are lucky.Edit: btw, congrats on your first trading being successful.  You seem to be doing it pretty disciplined.  Continuously longing and shorting the range of this bear flag might bite you soon though, be careful.
2	1523376294	2	Yes, what’s your target/ what are you looking to close your long at? 7.2k is crazy resistance and last run up we hit 7199 and got rejected. I would have felt more comfortable shorting over 6.9k-7k but this bear flag is making me think we are gonna be put back into the 6750 range. And thank you. I’ve been successful on my first 4 trades with a 1-4% profit on every trade. I’m bound to get burnt eventually ( knock on wood ) but so far I’m taking it slow and trade by trade 
3	1523376660	2	Current limits are taking profits just under 6900 (30%), 7000 (30%), 7100 (15%), and 7200 (15%).  The remaining 10% will decide later.  If we go past 7200, it'll help keep my CA down a little bit as I add to the position. 
4	1523376750	1	Can you justify your reasoning for keeping position open / why do you think we will reach those targets?Sorry for the questions, hearing different perspectives and approaches will help me be a better trader in the long run. 
5	1523377095	2	You can see the percentage of takes decrease in line with what I think will get hit.  The 6900 one was just missed.  Not confident we'll get much past 7k so locking in 60% of the profits by around there.It's just based on hitting the diagonal resistance line that we've been repelled from lately when we got to 7500 and 7200, which is now around 7100 on my chart.  
1	1523377587	2	Im hoping for a bump to $6900 ish so I can close my long from $6727 for a small profit.
2	1523379135	2	I'm worried there are a lot of people in your situation 
1	1523377965	2	It's a clear tightening pattern that's been going on since 30 march. Wouldn't be surprised to see us go back to 7000, drop again to 6700 and then gravitate between 6700-6800 for a couple days. It's going to be boring, but there's going to be fireworks after that. 
0	1523385753	3	A bearish failure swing (RSI) could be taking place on the 15 min. It's 15 min and it was only overbought on one close so may invalidate or not mean anything but I'm bored and thought I'd note it.
1	1523387328	1	Not sure why this is being downvoted. While it hasn't been every time, more often than not in the past few weeks we've had a dip once the 15 min macd crosses negative, which just happened. There is bearish divergence on the 15min from the past several hours as well.

1	1523367993	1	> but why would whale games be fractalIf they are playing the same game repeatedly.  (not that I support that theory)
1	1523371938	1	You can have an upvote from me. I'm not sure I would call it "whale games" but this is not natural market movements so I don't know why it would behave according to analysis such as fractals.
1	1523383351	0	I'm not seeing that. I can see 5 comments right now. Let me know if the issue persists.

0	1523333392	8	First? I’d love some good karma Edit: what’s more likely sub 3K or above 12K by June 18’, also EOY? All I need to know. Thanks in advance 
1	1523334199	17	I think the post is going to yield modest gains for the next 5 minutes, before a bit of a pullback and consolidation in the mid 10's.So, sub 3k I guess, but that number would be an astronomical valuation for a first comment post in this sub.
1	1523334081	9	I know things move faster now than the last bear market but I can't help but think we will be in this same $6-8K range in June '18 which is about 1.5 months away. Too many people impatiently waiting for price to either plummet or start bullrun this week. 
2	1523334143	9	I think so too, but accumulation is happening and I definitely think 12k happens before 3k would
3	1523334346	6	I'm on the sidelines still waiting for a long term entry instead of just scalping here and there but I don't want to see $3K simply because that could mean lots of trouble in crypto space and could mean beginning of the end of 4 digit bitcoin. With that being said I don't expect it to ever fall that low.
4	1523351757	1	> could mean beginning of the end of 4 digit bitcoinI understand the sentiment, but that doesn't necessarily follow. In 2014 people thought breaking $300 could mean the beginning of the end of 3 digit bitcoin. In reality, it stayed in the $200s after that (except for two very brief flash crashes to the mid $100s), though of course it was hard to tell that was the bottom at the time.
3	1523336387	5	I fail to imagine a scenario where we would break out of the downtrend line from 19k to go back below it afterwards and return to 3K.
4	1523351558	2	During the 2014 bear market, there were a couple of downtrend line breakouts (along with the requisite FOMO, ATH incoming, etc.) only to fizzle out and drop again. It was no problem...we had plenty of pixels so we just redrew the downtrend line with a slightly gentler slope.
2	1523335052	4	I agree
3	1523336418	3	Yesterday you said you thought the bottom was in? What made you change your mind?
4	1523338423	2	Going sideways would not invalidate his statement.
5	1523338689	2	Ah, well yes.
6	1523339458	3	Yeah, that's what I meant. I think we will meander around the bottom down here for a little bit. I doubt we go sub 6400, but if we do... no bueno
4	1523336748	0	A 7k btc dump in the morning?
1	1523333779	7	If anyone knew they'd go all in and ignore the charts for 6 months 
1	1523334200	8	I'd guess 12k is more likely than 3k, but honestly I think we'll be stuck between 6-8k for a while
1	1523335173	0	Who knows for EOY but I see 5.5k in the following days, if we can't bounce, then low 4k to 3k.We need a trigger for a reversal/bullrun.
1	1523347077	1	This just goes to show...ppl love to speculate. What the point is idk... but it seems to keep the locals going. As you were... 
1	1523349517	1	 12k june 3k EOY
1	1523336397	-1	sub $3k more likely but june is too soon for that.
2	1523337515	3	To sub 3k it's another 60% drop. Never.
3	1523337672	4	i would say we are lucky if it doesn't go below 3000.Were you here during the 2014/2015 bear market? it went from 1250 to 160.I am a long term bull but also a realist and bitcoin always goes for maximum pain.
4	1523338641	7	Yes I was there. Back then the largest exchange was hacked and no one knew if Bitcoin ever would come back. Now the only problem is a correction and when (not if) the next bullrun starts.
5	1523338728	2	I hope you are right.
5	1523345668	1	I agree. This crash is nothing like the others for so many reasons and we shouldn't expect too many similarities. 
5	1523346854	1	Events usually don't matter much in a bull or bear market. If it goes up, it'll shoot up, if it goes down, it'll burn hard.
1	1523334120	-1	Both unrealistic but i guess 3k. Eoy definitely 12k
0	1523366012	4	This could go either way so i've reduced my short position to 1/2 the size it originally was when i opened at 7.1. I don't want to miss the breakdown but i also don't want to get steamrolled on a run up to 7k. Will add the rest at 6.9-7.05 or at 6.4. Still think we could hit 5xxx by today's close and that down is more likely than up. And with that im done chartwatching for today.EDIT: of course, dropping 10% in any 10 hour period is unlikely but i'm not betting on a 10% secular drop. Any lower low <6.6 is likely to lead to panic imo and anything under 6.4 is goblintown for sure and that's what im looking for.
1	1523369082	2	Yeah, well, that's just like, your opinion, man
1	1523370006	1	Did you miss ATH shorts opened?
2	1523372281	1	I assume strong shorts won't close at least until a higher high. 
0	1523374606	3	This just looks like a repeat of past weekend's action but with even less volume on both sides. There doesn't seem to be much organic buys, rather whales buying and selling into larger orders, which may be their own, to create volume to squeeze longs and shorts and create FOMO/FUD... I did well longing for the first time in a month over the weekend but this feels like a no-trade zone for me since I don't want to get dumped on. I think I represent the amateur retail investors' sentiment.*tinfoil hat on: It seems to me that the whales are running out of ammo or getting tired/exhausted. If I had to guess they will dump this one more time below $6K and hopefully organic FOMO rally will take us into a new bull market once it finds a bottom. I think if they use their last bit to pump it, they run the risk of it not sustaining and then falling back into a downtrend and losing control.
1	1523374835	3	They will milk every iteration of a thousand like they have been since 10k, this iteration is finally running out of steam, another leg down would reignite the engine. But hey, that's just a theory haha. No way to tell the future but I'm still under the impression exchanges are making more money going down than if they were to push the price up at this point in time.
2	1523375145	2	Yep I'm reading a lot of theories that exchanges=whales which would make total sense. Companies like GDAX and Gemini are based in the US where regulations and punishments can be far more stricter so maybe they are responding to low volume by raising trading fees but in the wild west world with no regulations, companies like Finex can do whatever they want to create volume for more fees.
2	1523375270	1	They’re running out of steam because day trading is slowing down. They can do this indefinitely if there’s constantly day traders feeding them free coins. 
0	1523358046	4	Why anyone thinks a chart of significantly (2-3%) lower highs and slightly higher lows (0.5-1%) in an overwhelmingly bear trend is going to suddenly rocket to Pluto is beyond me. 
1	1523359596	11	Because the sell order book is thinning out and thinning out and the shorts are opening and opening and the price doesn't move down and down so guess what will happen once it runs out of sellers?Dude you sound really arrogant lately. Hope it doesn't get you rekt at some point.
2	1523360321	0	Buyers should have no problem running up the price to a higher high at 7.3 then. Sell side order books do look thin so go ahead and buy it up, make me close my short. 
3	1523361462	1	They weren't this thin during the last few runs to 7.2. 
4	1523361566	1	Perhaps thats true but i wont make much of it until we hit a higher high.
1	1523358375	7	Because a BTC bull run can start at any moment 
2	1523360591	5	Same can be said of a dump.
3	1523361168	1	Holding bags is less stressful than moon gazing...
1	1523358587	5	No one is catching a rocket. They are guessing a bottom, temporary reversal, or DCA.
0	1523353254	2	Hello, does anyone know of any block explorers where I can list multiple addresses at the same time? I have an HD wallet and have gone through loads of addresses, I'm looking for a complete list of all transactions (including to each other) in one place.I'd then want to export to csv as well.I have electrum but their export function does not include the addresses, only the transaction hashes. It would take me ages to manually get the addresses for each hash.I'm trying to do my taxes!!
1	1523354923	2	If you're not afraid of a bit of programming, you can make it yourself using the blockchain.info API:https://blockchain.info/balance?active=1AJbsFZ64EpEfS5UAjAfcUG8pH8Jn3rn1F|1EzwoHtiXB4iFwedPr49iywjZn2nnekhojThis shows the balances of two random addresses (not mine) which are included in the URL, separated by |. It's in JSON format which looks terrible but is easy to deal with in Python or Javascript or similar language.
1	1523357883	1	If you only need to pay taxes on trades, why would you need to track where you sent/received bitcoins?Edit: ah yes there's that US rule about paying people with bitcoin is also taxable, makes sense.
1	1523363392	1	Blockseer.com
0	1523384170	1	So if you were able to identify the bottom within a few hundred $ and opened a medium/high leverage long (say 25x, which should allow for wiggle room of a couple hundred bucks with regards to your liquidation point) - if and when BTC goes back up you're filthy rich, right? Am I missing something obvious here? Will contracts be liquid enough when we hit that magic low price?
1	1523384827	7	25x is extremely high leverage, anything above 10x should be considered high leverage. 100x is just insane. You aren't missing anything obvious, if you time the bottom perfectly then yes, by all means go 25x long with 100% capital. /s (seriously do not do this).Edit: let me know when this is tho cause I also want to be rich :)
2	1523385163	1	I'm definitely a noob, just started using bitmex and am trying to get a feel for it by reading the FAQ and using very small amounts/low leverage. Noob question:I see that you can update your leverage - I'm a bit confused, does this update apply to the initial contract? So if I buy at 6500 says and my liquidation point is at 6300. If a week later the price is at 6700 and I'm confident we're not revisiting 6500, I can update my leverage to a higher amount, pushing my liquidation point to, say, just under 6500? And the new leverage amount applies to prior gains? Or only future gains? I feel like I'm completely misunderstanding.
3	1523385361	3	contracts determine positions size, leverage just tells you how much money you're putting on the line, it determines your liquidation point 
3	1523385588	1	Sorry mate, can't answer that cause I don't know, I use the fixed leverage on poloniex...but why don't you comment here and I'm sure someone will answer, good luck!
1	1523384220	6	you call x25 a medium leverage? In theory, yes. But in practice, maintenance fees and not getting liquidated should be major concern to your future profits.
2	1523384690	1	> you call x25 a medium leverage?it's a tell that i'm going to get liquidated in the near future :p
3	1523384996	2	sorry if these are noob questions, i've just started testing bitmex with very small amountsI see that you can update your leverage - I'm a bit confused, does this update apply to the initial contract? So if I buy at 6500 says and my liquidation point is at 6300. If a week later the price is at 6700 and I'm confident we're not revisiting 6500, I can update my leverage to a higher amount, pushing my liquidation point to, say, just under 6500? Or have I completely misunderstood?
4	1523385602	1	no you're right, but it takes out the same equivalent in btc back to your account. So you make the same amount of money, it's just less capital at a higher leverage from that point onward, but if you got liquidated you would still have that initial capital you pulled out. 
5	1523386274	1	so if i'm close to liquidation i could lower my leverage to have a lower liquidation point (assuming I have the necessary amount of BTC in my account)? And the further away I get from liquidation and the more confident I become in the price going in the direction I want I can increase my leverage to lower my margin cost? With the advantage to the latter being that if I increase my leverage, it frees up my balance to buy more contracts?
6	1523387625	1	Right 
1	1523384445	6	Yes it really is that simple.The hard part is not being human during the process. Godspeed. ;)
2	1523384996	2	Ha! If only we could turn off the amygdala while trading.
1	1523384679	2	Yeah, good luck identifying the bottom though. Buying anything in the middle of a dump with 25x leverage is a risky play.
0	1523347879	3	I'm not a fan of setting stops but I've shoots to do today and hesitantly bought in with 50% of my fiat. I'm still betting it'll go down but am really in mixed minds if it'll go past 6500 on the first attempt.The number of shorts that might close on a bounce is why I bought in. I don't want to miss out on the opportunity.
0	1523367295	1	I'm long from 6750 with a stop at 6525. Tight enough? Or 6400?
0	1523367488	1	Some big sells over the last 2 days....we gonna get a pump...or a 3rd dump?
0	1523372593	1	Sorry for stupid question, but where do you find total longs and shorts opened for BTC? I am really interested in analyzing price/longs/short correlation. Thank you

0	1523387263	1	Tax question!  Has anyone tried filing their crypto to crypto trades using the 8824 like-kind exchange form?  I read that since the law is ambiguous for 2017 it might work (I know it's clear for 2018 that crypto to crypto is not a like kind exchange).
1	1523388009	1	Nobody reputable will give you an advisory letter saying that you can do a like kind exchange.If you want to gamble that you will get interest and penalties, then go right ahead and try it.
1	1523388127	1	NO! Speak with any accountant and they will tell you the same. You might as well not report than use 1031 (like kind exchange rule) since it is a lot more complicated than it seems. Simple guidelines: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/like-kind-exchanges-under-irc-code-section-1031I have bought and sold multiple properties and deferred taxes using 1031
0	1523347229	1	If I secure my wallet with a password, is this password stored on the blockchain?
1	1523347997	3	No. Once you create a wallet nothing at all is stored on the blockchain. You just created a public/private key pair. Once the first incoming transaction is happening, your wallet address is recorded on the blockchain as output of that transaction.
1	1523347335	1	No, probably shouldn't be stored anywhere, apart from maybe a piece of paper
1	1523347365	1	Your password is just used for encryption so no.
0	1523364931	1	If the sell side orderbook is so thin why does a 108 coin market buy move the price up by $1.5?http://prntscr.com/j3bqyp
1	1523365047	5	Because they ate an entire wall put up at 6,750 with one buy.
2	1523365079	-2	Must have been hidden then. If the big guys are putting hidden sell walls is it bullish or bearish?
3	1523365259	3	If the big guys are buying entire walls to avoid moving the price is it bullish or bearish?My point is that there are a lot of ways to interpret any given trade.
4	1523365464	3	Would be bullish, ostensibly. Im not reading too much into the orderbook but just questioning the claims that the sellside is barren. 
0	1523373486	1	Imagine getting squeezed by this pump. Price went under my alarm before I could open bitmex on my phone. Could still go to 7k so that's where I placed my other sell offers. 
1	1523373551	2	I went from relieved that I closed out my shorts at 6750 just in time to annoyed. Staying out of position though
2	1523373702	1	I had my first sell at 6875 but got bull-fudded and moved it to 6915. It would have filled on the wick....RIP

2	1523374136	4	I'm supposed to be on vacation lol. Been trying to stick to 1 trade a day but made like 4 swing trades instead because I'm a trading addict.
3	1523376072	1	only 4. you are lucky. Don't ever install the binance app
1	1523373774	2	If anyone got squeezed here I'd reckon they either have very little reserves, are over-leveraged or made an aggressive short-entry right on what they thought was breakout in a market that's been really finicky as of late. None of those being good moves to be honest. Now we will see if this is a "bart" or a flag, my money being on the former.

3	1523374486	4	Not arguing that they didn’t haha, just saying those that they entered under very risky conditions. If you’re going to enter a high leverage position at least wait for a trend, going sideways is a terrible time to do any gambling.
4	1523374982	2	Agreed. That's a huge loss for that person liquidated!
3	1523375242	1	What does that tweet mean? Did he have to market buy with 2627858 USD for an average price of 6813 USD per BTC? 
4	1523378340	1	That's my understanding - that he placed a short order, and when the market rose he was liquidated (which means he was forced to buy at market price to cover the short). https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt
0	1523368584	-1	Call me naive, but I'd rather hold my coins to zero than give them up to Soros, Rothschilds, Rockefeller, or Bogdanoff's. I'm bearish short term, but bullish as hell long term.  This is simply a game. Following the majority isn't going to be profitable because not everyone will win in a game like this. Go against the grain and that's how legends are forged.
1	1523372473	1	Tell that to anyone who went short on the runup from 1k to 20k. Also I love that you included the Bogdanoffs in that group.
2	1523373137	0	anyone who shorted just sold. They didnt lose fiat unless they sold more than they owned (leverage) or fomod in in typical buy high, sell low fashion
3	1523373973	2	Selling is not the same as selling/going short which is almost always used when the seller does not own the underlying.
4	1523374140	2	Re read my comment. I address this.If you short mroe than you own, then you leveraged a short, so you’re a big boy and can live with the loss.If you hold the udnerlying and short less than the notional value fo your portfolio, you do not lose fiat value on your short
0	1523360220	1	High volume = prixe drop.  Weak volume = wont move.  Is it ok to enter now and return 2 months later?  Seems like its not that easy to aim and wait the exact bottom.  I think big players r still w8tng or what?
1	1523363658	1	>  Is it ok to enter now and return 2 months later? for sure
0	1523370020	1	Already taken a big shit, but still one dump left to flush everything out.
1	1523372924	1	Capitulation. The shit we’ve all been holding on to for way too long.  It’s time to go, folks. Just fucking take it already so we can move on.
2	1523381623	1	Exactly. It's not healthy to hodl it in.
0	1523371722	1	2 hour looks like its about to break either way soon, but don't expect any big move tbh
0	1523380671	1	Probably time to get out of my $6727 long....nice bump up followed by the usual drop $6600 soon...my opinion
1	1523381537	3	Closed for a 2% profit...
2	1523381958	1	I closed my long because of this post. Crazy how by reading this subreddit it really influences your decisions. If I hadn’t checked this thread I would have led it ride. We’ll see how it plays out.
3	1523382074	1	Sry man. I'm just careful and like to make small scalps when I am home after work. Sure hope I call it right for both of us.
4	1523382738	1	Still holding. Same behavior as 24 hours ago, ETH leading the bull run.
5	1523382950	1	any news about why eth leading the run? I was expecting ICOs to sell their eth 
6	1523383749	2	No news. Only looking at charts. Confirmed triple bottom and took significant beating during the sell-off (esp. with EOS team selling a lot of ETH), we can say it is returning to its 'bearish' mean, as it is also gaining on the ethbtc ratio. Target 0.08
7	1523383807	1	ok thanks for the detailed response, I appreciate it, thanks
6	1523384631	1	That already happened.
6	1523385198	1	I think its just because ETH is so oversold relative to BTC, ETH bulls are just a slight bit more bullish currently.You can see it on the ratio, appears to be rallying a bit.
5	1523383957	1	Bull run, are you joking?
0	1523372552	-5	Looks like we're breaking up. It seems as if 6600 is the bottom. Just bought back in, I think are we going to 8k within the next week.
1	1523372780	11	He bought. Continue ze domp.
0	1523373144	0	Are the altcoins leading BTC these days? Seems like alot of them bottomed
0	1523374304	-5	What is this the third/fourth time that we've tried to break below 6600 for any length of time and failed?Disappointing that it's holding so well.
1	1523374614	6	Not really disappointing at all. Making a beautiful descending triangle.
2	1523375027	1	I think most people are seeing a symmetric triangle.  Either one has similar prognosis anyway.
3	1523375443	1	[yes](https://www.tradingview.com/x/lEbkjANR/)EDIT: it looks more like a descending triangle actually
4	1523375917	1	Yeah actually it does look like one, I guess some wick cuttig is needed for the symmetric case.But descending triangles are very strict on having a flat bottom.Guess we can't really make a play based on either, not well enough confirmed.
1	1523374762	9	Homie shorted below 7 lol
2	1523375246	4	Homie is sitting in fiat wanting cheap coins
3	1523375584	6	6k not cheap enough?
3	1523375370	1	i think the real question is once you get your cheap coins will you hold or will you sell after a decent rise in price? where is your bottom? 
4	1523375431	1	Hold until a multiplier, everyone has their price I suppose. My bottom? you mean where i'd consider too cheap to buy in? Don't think I have one.EDIT: If you mean me guestimating where the bottom is? - Either right now at 6.6k or between 4.5 and 5k.
5	1523377015	1	yeah i meant where you think the bottom is, because if the next dip is the real bottom i’d agree buy cheap and then hold. I’m still trying to decide whether to sell when it rebounds (if it will drop further in the future) or to hold (if a new bull run actually starts)

0	1523335720	-21	I think the only real buyers for Bitcoin are those who are buying it to buy alts. Others are just traders and manipulation. Fiat pairs for alts will seriously reduce real buying for BTC, and the price will go even further down. When BTC price reaches the area that its no longer profitable to mine (sub 5k I think), I don't know what will happen next. What do you guys think?
1	1523338193	9	Why are people buying alts again? If you say anything other than speculation you’re wrong.And why do you think people won’t speculate on bitcoin... It’s arguably the safest bet in crypto, the most liquid and highly limited in supply. I think you have no clue what you’re talking about
2	1523341292	2	People won't speculate on Bitcoin?The entire market is complete speculation... 
1	1523335797	9	cool story
1	1523335847	10	> I think the only real buyers for Bitcoin are those who are buying it to buy alts.The only purpose of alts is to get more BTC, most liquid market.
2	1523341477	2	A bold (and incorrect) generalisation to make, didn't realise you were the global crypto spokesperson. I've done well enough riding alt pumps and jumping in and out in short time frames, never with the intention of accumulating BTC.
3	1523358849	1	Why would you hold shit for the long term? Lik
2	1523338764	-1	That what an old school trader thinks. New ones want to moon and they don't see BTC doing so. And branding is important, BTC is still "drug money" and "a bubble", while alts are announcing partnership with household names.
3	1523339490	5	Yes and the old school trader will be taking the new school traders money until they learn the game
1	1523336242	7	just look at the charts!Literally every alt has been crashing way harder then bitcoin since the bear market started. If your story were true then alts should have gone up relative to btc.Just bought a t-shirt over LN. alts should be very worried.
