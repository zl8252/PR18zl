0	1523385679	2	I remember reading that the first time in amazement and awe at the sheer stupidity of human beings with regard to greed and gambling.  It is a useful tale to read and try to recognize similar tendencies in yourself.

1	1523386503	1	Exactly what i just said. Dont gamble with your money. Stick to your plan.

I don't trade (because I'm at a loss right now like many others), I'm not even close to holding 1btc, but I've seen enough during these past six months to know not to get carried away. Don't feel sorry for him, lesson learned I hope.
