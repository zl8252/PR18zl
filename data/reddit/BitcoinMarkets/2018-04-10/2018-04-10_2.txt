0	1523375802	1	well, you got a link?
1	1523376933	2	I wish I did,  I wish you could get yahoo stock message board archives from 1999-2002.  Anybody know how?
2	1523379898	1	It looks like they're gone forever. Was this guy's advice actually insightful in general or only in that specific time? 
3	1523380674	1	it was very timeless at times,  a few things I remember him explain have held true in the crypto market,  but for the most part he assumed a transparent short market,  whereby you'd get cues.  Not that way now it seems.
0	1523378308	1	Some says he's still shorting to this day...
1	1523379207	1	Some say he turned out like most gamblers and is a waiter or homeless...
2	1523379329	1	Are you literally trying to denounce this guy for shorting to promote Bitcoin on a anecdotal story post? Lol geezus...
0	1523382669	1	This sounds exactly like a guy I met at a temporary RV park in SW Missouri around 2012/2013~ish who was balls deep in bitcoin.Guy was kind of a modern anti-establishment hippie, but used to be a hardcore wallstreet guy until he "woke up", pulled all his money out and decided to travel the country.He's the one that got me into BTC all that time ago.I'm not saying its the same guy, I also have no idea what happened to him, but was some interesting campfire chats in back-country.
