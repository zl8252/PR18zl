They buy/sell from you at a discount and sell/buy on exchanges, but when they do, they do it more professionally than you: they split the amount among multiple exchanges and multiple orders, so the buying/selling does not create panic. Also some traders use OTC markets to cover their shorts/longs. This way they won't move the market back up/down when they close their position.
