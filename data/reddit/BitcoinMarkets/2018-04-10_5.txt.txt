0	1523332181	29	It's obviously not as big of a bubble in dollar value or participants the real estate market or dot com, so this writer must be talking about the percentage drop.But it's not even as big of a percentage as previous Bitcoin drops.So a more accurate title would be " Bitcoin, the Biggest Bubble in History, is popping *again.*"
1	1523335500	6	Yeah, at every major ATH ever, there as been a "Bitcoin bubble is popping, going to zero" article; 20k, 1k, 30, etc...
2	1523336155	3	It's a series of bubbles each pop higher than the last. 
3	1523336348	3	I agree, but when the media says bubble they try to compare it to tulips or Enron which popped and never recovered.
0	1523332993	10	> The greatest bubble in history is popping, according to Bank of America Corp.gee, i wonder who has a vested interest in making sure a decentralized economy doesn't spontaneously create itself after 10+ years of development (and strife)

0	1523333208	7	Bloomberg trying to throw fuel on the fire to stifle any recovery.  The media is just one huge market manipulation scheme today.  If anything, this article should be a buy signal.
1	1523334251	11	Bloomberg just wants clicks, I doubt the article has an ulterior motive beyond that.
2	1523344620	2	Agreed. It’s so short and contains so little information that I don’t know why they bothered. 
1	1523334863	0	Oh absolutely. Fake news ... I mean c'mon...

1	1523365527	1	Bitcoin dying is not the same as the bubble popping. 
1	1523360624	-2	You will die sleeping! Get real
0	1523348043	1	very informative and indepth article.
0	1523359010	1	it has popped before and it will pop again, it is more accurate to call it a Rebuble or a Multibuble. Pop, pop, pop!!!
0	1523386185	1	Good to be reminded when it's time to start to collect the pieces.
