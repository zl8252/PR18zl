0	1523469471	1	And we're back! thanks /u/jarederaj and /u/skywalk819 for getting admin help. :)
0	1523420006	69	I just want to say thank you  to everyone who participates in this sub. Considering a lot of people have families, full time jobs, etc, a lot of people take  precious time out of their day to help others and put their 2 cents into people’s analysis and general opinions. I’ve grown a huge liking to this sub over the past month. Everyone is generally positive no matter the conditions of the market and everyone always has a good head on their shoulders. Even though sometimes we can all get off topic,  a little comic relief is often needed in times of despair and sideways movement.Talking to your family, friends, co workers or the average Joe at the supermarket about BTC trading isn’t an easy topic. You often get responses like “ Oh that’s cool” or “ Seems fun “. But at least you can come here and speak your mind about how you’re feeling in today’s market with people who are like minded and all want to achieve the same thing. All in all, I look forward to reading this sub everyday and thanks to everyone who has helped me along the way.

1	1523427081	10	it’s funny because I posted almost the exact same comment in April 2017 ;) When BTC was 1500 and we were all in disbeliefTo another good year!
1	1523429059	4	/signedI'm not even a trader but it's the only crypto-related subreddit here that's not complete garbage. I hope it stays that way.
1	1523430508	4	yes. I have an almost unhealthy infatuation with some of the top posters here. always happy to read from Mike chewy, sloppy, lady. I miss degen and Yolo 
2	1523442976	2	STREEEEETTTPPPAAARRRAAAADDDDEEEE
1	1523430357	2	> “ Seems fun “Well, about 5% of the time it is! :D
0	1523448957	24	I just typed 'shorting' in to Google (incognito) and 'Shorting Bitcoin' was the number 2 suggested result.What could go wrong.
1	1523450908	5	Here is what it looks like on a VPN: https://i.imgur.com/hrAIJV2.pngEDIT: Just saw that OP wrote "short*ing*". So here, even via a clean browser and via VPN, it's second: https://i.imgur.com/BXsR5tR.png
1	1523449258	5	Look back in December for longing, it's a good indicator when we are close to upper/lower limits
1	1523449703	3	can't really see it in google trends, peak in december thoughhttps://trends.google.fr/trends/explore?q=shorting%20bitcoin
2	1523449952	1	Compare It with the Bitcoin trend.
1	1523452434	3	Wow this is actually legit
1	1523450401	2	Number one result here in the netherlands
1	1523449440	4	You do realize that Google suggestions are based on your browsing history and data Google has collected from you, right?
2	1523449652	24	I tried the same thing on my grandmas laptop. And lo and behold, "Shorting Bitcoin" is the second suggested search result.UPDATE: She has another tab open and its BitMex. She is currently short x10. FML
3	1523450433	3	[Of course you're "The Bitcoin Bearz" guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/88o7xx/daily_discussion_sunday_april_01_2018/dwmqo10/?context=3)
3	1523450289	2	google also uses your ip to track you. Try searching for "buy" instead. Most likely the first suggestions will be crypto related too.
2	1523449752	6	That is why he used incognito mode.
2	1523450461	2	depends if that's your settings or not
0	1523463713	20	I think /u/wtf_yoda account has been compromised, I was just removed as a moderator here, not sure what is happening
1	1523464080	4	I've been following this. I'm in touch with some other mods.
1	1523463874	5	Everyone else got removed too. Open up another Sub just to be save?
2	1523465085	1	116,552 traders, you think it is that easy?
3	1523465240	1	No, but i think if a known moderator of this sub opens a new one, we know it is trustworthy. If they can regain control, nothing is lost. But it would make sense linking to the back up sub now, as long as the moderators have the chance to announce it.
4	1523465552	1	Agreed, the mods can create a new sub as a preemptive measure just in case.
5	1523465706	1	We're waiting on reddit to respond to support requests. We'll get this worked out.
1	1523463794	2	Everyone was removed it looks like.
2	1523463837	1	nothing I can do here. if he really was hacked or something we have no way to get control back unless yoda manifest himself and recover his account and fix everything, that is really bad.
3	1523463898	1	I can see bitcoinmarkets is still moderator and /u/testname has access to that account I think im not sure what is the exact name of testname if someone can tag him
4	1523465416	2	Unfortunately I never gave u/BitcoinMarkets permissions to change mod access so I think this would need to be fixed by u/wtf_yoda or admins.
5	1523465458	1	/u/wtf_yoda was probably hacked, so only person who can help us at the moment are reddit admins.
4	1523464055	1	/u/testname33
5	1523464443	1	Looks like his last post was five months ago. If he doesn't reply soon, we should see if Reddit admins can help.
6	1523464844	1	We definitely need to take this to admins. I'll message them. Looks like other mods are setting up requests on the other boards.
7	1523465200	2	I just e-mailed the Reddit admins. 
7	1523464980	1	OK, there appears to be no way to just message the admins anymore...wtf is going on with this site anymore?
8	1523465282	2	There's a contact@reddit.com e-mail I found for support. I explained the situation. 
9	1523465365	1	Yeah, I just found a way to do it through the site, too. I guess we wait now...If anyone wants to start a back up sub I'll help. I don't want to be the main person, though.
2	1523463877	1	Yup!
1	1523464379	3	This is very strange. This is a very big community, if the account is compromised, who could be behind it and what could be the possible motives? Big players, exchanges, or what, I wonder...
2	1523464470	7	probably something much more mundane
3	1523464805	1	I hope so, and that it gets resolved asap.
1	1523464351	1	https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/faq

2	1523469325	3	Shorting panic. Admins are on it.
0	1523435049	11	This calm before the storm is quite intense. Whatever way we break it will be quite dramatic.

0	1523468927	11	If you need to calculate capital gains from a GDAX fills.csv, I have created a PowerShell script to do the calculations. That is provided either all transactions are done on GDAX or you manually input any transfers and their value when they were initially bought or finally sold. Check out https://github.com/weedoveropiates/PowerShell-GDAX/releases.Enjoy!

1	1523466782	2	FYI r/techsupport is more for end user support not reddit support
1	1523466943	2	2fa all the things
0	1523437649	8	Bitfinex planned maintenance has started, expected to last an hour.http://bitfinex.statuspage.io/
1	1523437959	24	Now effing GDAX bots don't know what to do - they run wild without their parent being around.
2	1523438667	4	lmao this is hilarious.
2	1523443736	1	Do bots need to be restarted after it comes back up? Because it's back up and the bots still aren't doing anything.
1	1523440504	2	30 more minutes... http://bitfinex.statuspage.io/incidents/bgpt2m648jqc
0	1523466285	9	I posted [this the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8avoxb/daily_discussion_monday_april_09_2018/dx37irl/) making a cautious case for a reversalRight now we're getting very close to [breaking the local downtrend line from 3/5.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/apr5BU09/)  It'll be interesting to see, if we do in fact break up, if we get some accelerated momentum. u/sloppysynapses  I think we'll need to break $7500 to confirm direction change. There is potential in this phase (next 2 weeks) for a break from the 4 month bear trend, but I'm under no illusion that we're not still in a bear market.
1	1523468763	2	Attention, we could break it, go to 10k, and start the slow bleed to 3k. This is what happened in 2014, remaining skeptical here.
0	1523466730	8	According to our Sub banner we just crashed 10k. Talk about a flash crash.
0	1523427410	8	Shorts keep finding a way to keep growing. ~5000 more short than long.https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS
1	1523429540	13	39k? srsly?I feel like allot of people are going to lose their money if this continues, we have been flat for a while now
1	1523429542	3	How do I read this and what does it mean?
2	1523430570	3	People borrowong BTC to sell them.
1	1523432107	2	I don't really believe the following, but it is a possibility that exchanges/whales are inflating the open positions to try and get traders to open opposing positions. Again, not really a strong believer in this theory, but it is still a possibility to consider.
1	1523428510	1	Those are some THICC BBands there. Although im not sure if they mean anything in that graph. 
0	1523460287	8	So all day the experts here have said ooh the BB is tight which ever way it goes its going to go BIG.  Not even $100.
1	1523460542	2	Because many people thought that a breakout incites FOMO either way... Lets see what happens when we drop 1,5%.
1	1523460572	2	they are still tight.
1	1523461056	2	get off the 15 min chart.BB is tight on medium time frames and if we tighten high time frames this will take months to play out. 
0	1523461318	8	Heads up for new margin traders, bitcoin.tax does not calculate margin trading but cointracking.info doesEdit: also a reminder to do quarterly estimated taxes
0	1523452910	16	BBands are much like rectal muscles; the tighter the clench, the more explosive the release
1	1523453279	8	A surprisingly graphic but accurate analogy...
2	1523453318	5	Especially from the bottom (calling it)
0	1523460327	22	Slightly meta, but I just wanna say that i appreciate the objectivity on this sub. It's one of the only subs i visit anymore because all the specific coin related subs are litteral cults, where the subscribers can't even take the slightest bit of critique or bearish sentiment in general. It's all baseless 'moon' bullshit, and it's getting old.
1	1523460614	6	I would 800% avoid the cryptocurrency sub then 
1	1523461517	4	I don't even visit the other crypto subs any more. /r/cryptocurrency is decent if you want to get basic facts about shitcoins, but even that's suspect. I love how accountable everyone keeps everyone else here if they make a dumb or inaccurate statement. I think it keeps me from getting too high or too low on the markets.
2	1523462107	1	Iron sharpens iron, rekt sharpens rekt
1	1523460585	3	as a (usual) "reader only" of this Sub i agree.I dont trade but i like the seeming objectivity here too, might be because people here (can) make money on the way up and down.so, cheers guys, i am out again
1	1523462711	3	This sub was absolutely fucking awful during the run up to $20k. Anyone posting charts got laughed out of the building by people who claimed TA was worthless and how Bitcoin would fly straight to $100k. It's gotten a lot better recently now that a lot of these individuals got washed out of the markets.Ethtrader has gotten better over the past 1-2 weeks but I suspect once Eth is over $600 the moonkids will be back with their astronomical price projections. 
2	1523464118	1	Yes it is still awful in here but probably half as awful as it is during a bull market.
1	1523463732	2	This sub is as guilty as the others at times.  It is a bit better than most subs for sure though.  Play safe.  I come here for entertainment purposes mostly.
0	1523435238	7	Could it be said that if we break up, it will be a lot more violent than if we break down (due to the shorters locking in profit and cushioning the drop)?
1	1523435347	2	Yes
1	1523435562	2	I don't see how this can be measured. Don't forget, there are also a large number of longs open and we're nearing our previous capitulation wick price. If 6.4 does not hold, I don't see anything for bulls to hang onto. Of course, there will most likely be a big bump up if 7.2 is broken through, but to say that it will be more violent isn't guaranteed.
1	1523435650	1	yes
0	1523457080	8	I'm a trader. I don't really care if the market chooses to go up or down from here. I just want it to be a decisive choice. Not a fakeout. Really hoping we don't see a fakeout from this symmetrical triangle/downtrend line like we did back in January. That's max pain there. Get a bunch of longs in after 2 bullish breakouts, then a drop to hell.https://www.tradingview.com/x/DgEgeDE0/
1	1523457763	3	Completely agree, but each times i've mentioned that fractal here i've been downvoted. 
1	1523457318	1	I think thats likely, but I'm also not sure the market has the momentum to even make it to 7250
1	1523457681	1	I'm watching[ those lines as well](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xot9P0c0/), don't see the excitement until we get to that green zone and stay there or go higher.
0	1523457443	7	Overbought on 1hr RSI has been pretty reliable and the blowback from 7k was palpable. Opening small short here
0	1523463140	7	Our ticker says $16,889 lol
1	1523463749	3	Something weird is going on, all of the mods (myself included) were just removed.
2	1523463995	1	Weird. WTF
1	1523463570	1	I've noticed when the automod links to the new daily thread from the previous one, it always lists the price as 16889.97
2	1523464307	1	Remind me next time you see this, I will close my long. :D
1	1523463847	1	I almost had a heart attack there.   I expected it was an error but possible that I was liquidated on my short about $8000 ago.
0	1523463840	9	Whale from 1000 BTC on bitfinex just broke up his wall in multiple 100 BTC walls. Trying hard to push this down. 
0	1523419972	14	Based on [my chart from last night](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8b4twg/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_10_2018/dx4502r/), I've built out a Bull Range/Bear Range based on dates and long-term support from the dip/bounce on 10/18/17. Within six days, we should know which way the market is heading.I've updated the chart and am properly publishing it through tradingview...     Here's the [zoomed out, macro version](https://www.tradingview.com/x/piECGM3W/).     Here's the [channel we're in now](https://www.tradingview.com/x/yfSAV3iy/).     Here's the [bull/bear range](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HUbqUzER/).     For the Bull Range, any sustained movement north of that number will mean we are trading above the channel, indicating a possible reversal into a sideways/bull market.     For the Bear Range, any sustained movement south of that number will mean we are trading below the channel, indicating a possible continuance of the bear market.     Here are the numbers:     Date/Time|Bull Max|Bear Min:--|:-:|:-:04/12/18 00:00:00|$7027|$650504/13/18 00:00:00|$6933|$651404/14/18 00:00:00|$6839|$652304/15/18 00:00:00|$6745|$653204/16/18 00:00:00|$6651|$654104/17/18 00:00:00|$6557|$6550NOTE: I'm reposting this since I just realized I posted it in Tuesday's discussion thread @ 11:59pm EDT. Let me know if this is a no-no.
1	1523420283	8	4/17, the day the earth stood still. 
2	1523420554	9	Bulls and bears mate to create a new alpha predator.
3	1523428551	1	Sharks will die if they ever stop swimming
2	1523422489	3	4/11 the day bitfinex shut down (for maintenance)
3	1523422814	3	4/11, the day whales collude to break this stalemate one way or the other during the downtime.
1	1523420148	2	Thanks!  So, what happens on 4/18.... :)
1	1523422106	2	Do you think there's a chance it'll mildly break thru this wedge and price action will stay suppressed until middle of next month when it's a wedge from ATH?  Like this one.  (Charted from mobile, sorry).https://www.tradingview.com/chart/enh2wsdU/
1	1523424095	2	FYI, 4/13 is a Friday
0	1523445589	12	So we have an interesting situation: Crazy high amount of shorts but price refusing to go down despite that.1. either they get fucked as they "sold" the market and have to buy higher.2. or they know something we don't and the market is about to dumpy dumpy.bringing popcorn and be right back.
1	1523449123	5	Tax season almost over, people had to sell to pay for cap gains. Not a good time to be short.
1	1523447548	1	Mass effect.
0	1523445003	6	This is what the BTC market without whale impulse looks like.
1	1523445390	17	Yup. It's like sheep trying to figure out where they'll run next, ignoring the fact that it will be decided by the farmer and his dogs.
0	1523460231	7	Gemini now has a daily withdrawal cap--$100k. I guess they are trying to be more like Coinbase.
1	1523461263	1	I've always had that cap for ach.  Was I missing out? 
2	1523461583	1	I never had it for wires until now.
3	1523461840	1	Oh, you had a wire limited to 100k?  Never seen that before but haven't done a wire for that amount in quite some time. Their site doesn't mention any limit on wire but it's going to make me sad if they did
0	1523467772	6	No mods, yet still no 'I had a poopy' comments.
1	1523469308	4	Sometimes you gotta step up and be the change you want to see.
0	1523454595	11	Still waiting for 7550 to break before entering, better to be safe than sorry. Not chasing these green dildos.
1	1523456071	2	I'm waiting until above 12k to confirm double bottom. Until then trend is down and I only enter shorts or stay flat
1	1523455417	1	7,2 for me.
1	1523455473	1	IDK man, I could see this hanging out for a bit, while you sit on your hands.  Then it liquidates some shorts, starts a bull run, you FOMO at 7550, then watch all the longs from 6900 cash out, shorts move back in, then you ride the train back to 6500 where you wish you had just been long from the beginning...
2	1523456125	1	both of you have a solid plan IMO. Since no one knows what will happen, either one of you could be right. That’s why risk management is so important
1	1523455831	1	while i'm basically "all-in" if I was giving some advice to someone today i'd probably recommend what you're doing. ....which is in part why I think we have like zero volume in either direction, but that doesn't make it wrong :P
0	1523465770	19	[removed]
1	1523466072	4	Got a chart?
2	1523466448	6	2 inches down on the 5 min chart. Too much downwards blood pressure. No potential to go long after that squeeze.
0	1523466287	17	If the hackers can hack r/bitcoinmarkets what's stopping them from hacking Bitcoin? We need to sell before we lose everything guys 
1	1523466549	12	Good thing I sold everything at 6600. 
1	1523467018	8	I heard Bitcoin CEO uses Mcafee Antivirus, we're good fam. 
2	1523467492	6	I think the marketing slogan was "it's hackproof or I'll eat my dick" or something 
1	1523466902	5	🤔
2	1523467803	3	It hurts.

0	1523467785	5	I keep seeing good market buys on ETH, while BTC seems to be dropping on the very short term.  Also, the ETHBTC ratio has been tracking BTC, multiplying BTC movements on ETH.

1	1523450413	3	ehh in 2014 it stabilized at these price levels a few times before exploding up or down. I'm hesitant to say we're just gonna sit here for any more than another week or two 
1	1523451530	1	Well, it depends. Rsi says nothing at all, bbands in the 4h says the same, but they are very tight in the hourly. Resistance and support says very big move up or down in the next 2-4 days, Elliot waves seem to say its time to go up too . Stoch rsi very oversold in the 4h but with a heart full of neutrality in the 1h... So no fucking clue really.

1	1523452844	1	Delta hidden divergence?
2	1523453201	3	Delta is the net difference between market orders at the bid and the ask. Basically I am saying lots of people were using market orders to sell compared to buyers. But if everyone is selling why isn't price going down. Because limit orders are eating up all the shorts.  Downward movement was not going to be possible as long as those limit orders remain.

1	1523465842	2	Mods account got hacked tho.
1	1523465868	1	My expectation is that if/when BTC moves back into a bull cycle, alts will trail (ratio), then catch up when BTC pulls back (most cycles have worked this way). People tend to chase the winning coin.Right now alts are way down (they may go down even further), but it's not a bad place for accumulation if you seem promise in some project.Risk long term is that most alts are vaporware/ephemeral and so I'm expecting that between now and 2021, as the space matures, most will simply die off as the real-world value propositions of the more sturdy alts will become clear.  The lesser redundancies will wither off the vine. 
0	1523459596	15	Predicting that we will see <6.5k before >7.5k because:* It's been 2 weeks since we last saw 8k.* Last 2 breakout attempts rejected at 7.5k/7.2k (38.2/23.6 retrace resistance from 9k>6.4k). * Daily RSI is at 14 day high and we are still sub 7k. * If daily RSI stays at current levels, there will be hidden bear div (lower high price & higher high RSI)* 3 of the last 4 times that daily stochrsi was this overbought were followed by multiple red candles 
1	1523460124	6	How is it overbought at such terrible volume moving just in a sideways range? I'm confused by this indicator because its completely counter intuitive.
2	1523460637	2	 It measures the speed and change of price movements. Meaning that if we are in a range for a long period of time, say 6700-6750 a price change to 6900 in terms of average ups and downs is a big movement for the rsi. It measures momentum relative to previous price changes basically. Maybe someone can clarify better than me. Good luck!Edit: check this out for more info https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/technical-analysis/technical-indicator-guide/RSIEdit 2: don't let the terms overbought and oversold fool you, this indicator does not take into account volume
3	1523460959	3	So its safe to use its increasingly useless the lower the volume goes.
4	1523461251	2	Yeah it becomes alot noisier, or if there is alot of volume in a small price range, say bulls and bears really fighting it out between 6700-6800 with alot of volume for a long time, if one wins and moves towards 7000 and rsi becomes overbought, it does not mean you should sell, cause it can stay in overbought a long time. I don't personally use it in small time frames, only 4hr -> daily for big trend decisions. It helps to average out choppy days like we've been having.
2	1523461406	2	Overbought is relative to the time period you use to define it. For example, if you change the default (14) to 28, it's no longer considered overbought. Since many people (and probably bots) use the default parameters, I think it has relatively reliable predictive value.Regarding volume, I agree that indicators in general are probably less helpful and predictive when it is low, but what else is there really?
1	1523460205	3	Looks like we are looking at the exact same indicators, this has been my exact analysis as well 
0	1523426683	5	Put in a scalp short at 6855 mostly (only?) based on the relatively violent rejections from 6900 and declining volume to continue pump. "If it can't go up it must go down." No real target, probably at the bottom of a 15min MACD trend at -8. Manual stop at 6900.

0	1523455075	19	It's good to see how quickly our bears are adapting to an ever-shrinking pool of profit to anxiously slurp from. As Winter wanes and the buds of Spring bloom anew, the bulls start to smell roses.$6.5k might not be the bottom, but, as we've learned, the R:R simply doesn't favor a short beyond scalps these days. Why make $500 when you can make $5000? Since Monday, I've started accumulating BTC and a select few alts in preparation for the sentiment plateau leading to our next run. If the trolls win out, I'll continue purchasing each step down to Goblin Town. But let's be honest, folks, not even /u/DushmanKush is short, here. That tells you how far we've come.We may be in for months of uninspiring action, but my pain has ended. Another fire, another scar. Onward and upward.Bullish.

1	1523448616	6	Never underestimate the ability of greed to over ride common sense and previous bad experiences. I totally believe this is happening as lots of trading groups on Discord are talking about shorting 'being where it's at' where usually it was pump n dump.Which is why I'm more bullish.
1	1523447466	6	suddenly i regret shorting, eh
1	1523448028	4	It will end badly for many of them yes, but that can happen today or in a month...That's why i start moving my stop limits when i'm in profit, to catch a ride but don't get caught when it reverses. Might be stopped more easily, and that sucks, but its safer that way.

0	1523452239	9	stable price means eventually you are going to be running out of either seller or buyers, and when that happens the price either drops down or goes up so yes a spike is coming, the question is which direction. I'd say the fact that it doesn't appear people are willing to pay above $7K here is an indicator that it'll most likely break down. Additionally, and this is a big one, there are a LOT of indicators that the whales running this show are starting to come back. Lots of coins that had shit buy support the last few months suddenly doubled the order book on the buy side, those same coins have also had about 25% taken off the sell side. And this is pretty much universal.Now normally people would see this and start thinking that its going to go back up. But I'm not 100% convinced yet, the fact that with all of that bull support, and the price still hasn't cracked $7K is bearish in my book. So my trading suggestion is as follows. If you don't want to miss the train, you can DCA about 10-20% of your stack at this price point. Sooner or later we'll def be hitting these numbers again even if this breaks down, so you won't be stuck holding this bag for too long if you get it wrong. I would then save the rest of your stack and buy if this thing gets above $8K once its confirmed that the whales are ready to take this thing back up again. 
0	1523426637	13	I hold BTC, ETH & a little Monero long term.Everything else I feel has little to zero dev community, use or substance. And long term, frankly, if I'm honest with myself, I can only objectively reason my way to holding ETH.Most importantly, the power law/compounding effect among developer communities is extremely pervasive. I say this as a full time dev/low level engineer.When Plasma implementations are live, the demand for quasi-public chains like EOS et al. will tend toward zero.How might one justify holding other cryptos? (beyond selling to a greater fool on a pump-cycle).What catalysts make a strong broader dev community materialize ?
1	1523427069	3	I like OmiseGo and Factom because they're backed to the hilt by mature companies, and each demonstrates a very clear valuable use case. But you're right in that each needs to propagate a wider dev community to ultimately succeed.
2	1523427994	1	Devs/engineers are the only truly lasting moat.
1	1523428284	3	The most important thing (for platform coins) is accessibility, not many devs want to spend the time to learn Solidity (also the applications built on ETH are for the most part terrible at this point in time). The coins I hold are mostly so I can tinker and develop on their platform, but are all striving towards making developers lives easier and providing them with incentives to develop on their platform. I would name them but I'm against shilling. Just my opinion but currency coins that aren't BTC will fail, except for a select few that actually serve a niche that can't be solved by side-chains.
2	1523428633	10	> not many devs want to spend the time to learn Solidity Have you ever developed with solidity? Any dev with experience using a statically typed language can start writing it immediately, same day. No bullshit.https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/solidity/If you like Python, ethereum has Vyper.If you like highly memory/compute efficient code, Ethereum in-line assembly/eWASM. And the options continue to increase.Tack on ever-lowering compute/scale constraints, it's extremely dev-friendly.
0	1523457461	12	Ok so its been green over the past 24 hours and the sentiment is bullish as usual.  I just want to say this is not looking good for a recovery.  The pumps are getting weaker, the volatility is shrinking as well as the volume, and the RSI has finished recharging to the point where we had the last major dump.  This is not what you want to see when looking for a reversal.  You want the pumps to be bigger and hold instead of being smacked back down to 6.5k.  The fact that we haven't broken 6.5k yet doesn't give me confidence we don't break it soon under these conditions. Imo the r/r favors a short here.  If we do have a reversal we're looking at a 400$ or so jump that holds for over a day.  While if we drop we're looking at about 1000$ drop and possibly more over several days.
1	1523458047	5	Agreed. I've been scaling in sells as we've moved up the past three days. I have serious doubts that this will make it past the short-term downward trend line. [What I'm seeing](https://www.tradingview.com/x/fjCe8qGu/)

0	1523451405	3	Low interest rates on bitcoin shorting and backwardation on futures. If you trust the exchanges, you can make money selling bitcoin short in finex and buying quarterlies. If price recovers you can make 2-8% almost risk free.This might explain the big short interest. I know there are hundreds of millions interested in such a trade. There is already half a billion of usd collecting interest, so lots of money chasing low rewarding trades with little risk.
1	1523451497	3	> If price recovers you can make 2-8% almost risk free.I have been trying to understand this future / carry forward whatever strategies that are common in other markets in BTC, but isn't this the big IF here that makes it hard?
2	1523452608	2	Yeah I don't get that "risk free" part...
3	1523457650	2	Maybe "least risky"?
2	1523453410	2	If you're not leveraged then it's a guaranteed return.  Let's say right now you go short on finex at $6932 and at the same time buy the same time buy the June future at $6839.  That difference between $6932 and $6839 is guaranteed profit no matter which direction the price moves - be that up, down or sideways.  The main risk here is opportunity loss for even more profit should the price move dramatically while your money is tied up in the carry forward move - although you may only be willing to risk a tiny amount of your stack on speculative trading while you can trade a much larger amount on the carry forward trade since it's guaranteed profits.  This leads us to the other risk here which is counter-party risk and thus why the OP included the "if you trust the exchanges" caveat.
2	1523453082	1	You can also lock in the future discount by buying the future and selling spot, it's an arbitrage trade, no risk *if* you have enough margin not to get liquidated and you trust the exchanges. Or just trade the interest rates (futures have an implied interest rates), but interest rate trades are arguably harder to execute profitably than "simple" naked shorts/longs. The risk is lower though. When someone writes in this forum that they go "long swap short futures" it's exactly such a type of trade (interest rate).

1	1523452694	11	> This time, we will test 8k.Premature much?
2	1523452998	6	if calling 8k is considered premature i will go ahead and say that calling a sub 6k bottom is the exact same thing. especially after proven support on 6.5 multiple times since the 6k bottom
3	1523454511	3	The more times we test this support the weaker it becomes. 
3	1523453879	2	Primary difference being that we have been in a clear bear market  for months now and our bounces keep getting weaker.
4	1523454988	2	Just ignore that.  8k.

1	1523453304	2	Look. First look out for 7.2k, then for 7.8k, then there are 2-3 lines where we will probably struggle but we need to beat 11.8k . Last time we collided in sideways with the bear trend we dumped very hard. I don't think momentum points to that but don't get overexcited. 
2	1523453650	2	I took off my bear flare since I am this price action that doesn't seem overly manipulated and I might begin to DCA in but the decreasing volume has to be concerning for those looking to break major support above 8k region. I mean if this can't break 7.2K after several tries then the lower high is validated and who knows what will happen next.
2	1523453680	1	That trend line is currently at ~8900, so if we break through the current descending channel, we should retest that resistance at ~8500-8600 in a week or so. Big if. I don't see a lot of buying pressure at the moment. And now that Chad is apparently learning how to short, it could get even more difficult.
3	1523453967	3	For a bear market break out i consider the horizontal one much more important. Particularly after bouncing 5 times from it (2 bounces up, 3 bounces down) .And still the amounts of "normies" on crypto it's pretty low anyway, although bigger in some countries like the netherlands or the USA:Oh, almost forgot. that trendline changes a lot depending on how you draw it, so for me it will be something to confirm after the breakup or the bounce down.

Break down and the bottom is anyone's guess again, I think the low 5k's will be good for a bounce (previous ATHs, pole length).

0	1523432830	4	Entered a low leverage long here. This squeeze opportunity is too good to pass up, even if its slightly unlikely.
1	1523433155	6	I don't think it's that unlikely and IF it happens it's going to be quite violent. The longer we spend down here the more shorts have piled in. IF they can't force it below this level and the market rallies above the downtrend then the shorts will be scrambling to cover. With so many shorts the rally could be very powerful in the opposite direction to the norm for a descending triangle.edit: I've opened a 5x long at $6,800 which I will sit on until around the 17th April when I expect we will find out which way this is going to break.
2	1523434241	1	> IF they can't force it below this level and the market rallies above the downtrend then the shorts will be scrambling to cover. or they get brave when it does break down, double-down on the guaranteed free money, *then* get rekt.

0	1523453626	8	I'm starting to think that an illiquid market such as this one means that people are so fed up with bitcoin going down that they are either in fiat waiting to enter when they have a clear signal that the bottom is in, or they are just holding. So whales can only steal from other whales. No honor among theives I guess haha. I personally think so little trading means the bottom is in. Good luck trading mates.Edit: the bottom was in and it was 6k. I'm probably wrong tho. This is all conjecture :)
1	1523454480	5	Your 1st comments were GREAT!  Then you went off into fantasy land, calling bottom based on nothing... so only reddit silver for you.
2	1523454620	1	Haha yeah I don't usually like to call bottoms but hey, imagining is free
3	1523454849	2	Hah all good, fun to guess at it.  But for real, your comments on whales is 100% spot on - the plumbers and lawyers of bitcoin are long gone and it's really just the long term HODL'ers and whales left.  Whales playing liquidation games daily, it seems.  So I agree with you all day on that.
4	1523455302	1	Thanks man! HODL'ers, whales and the /r/bitcoinmarkets crew of course xD
1	1523456301	2	illiquid? that just depends from where you look.
2	1523456897	1	Well, sideways movement, no significant volume until some whale decides "fuck it market buy 500-1000 BTC" is my loose definition of illiquid. Then it stagnates for 4 hours hovering around a certain price. Maybe illiquid is the wrong word in this case. But the only significant volume comes from these whales for now. IMO

0	1523464843	6	[Bitcoin dominance graph](https://imgur.com/a/rfaIY) looks like it is poised for another tumble.  Maybe this is just how crypto slowly moves on from Bitcoin.  People want to buy alts, not Bitcoin and that's why the BTC price is stagnant.  Every BTC rise gets diluted out into the alts people want to buy.  The strongest surging category is the "Others" light blue line which would indicate a healthy diverse crypto ecosystem is taking hold.
1	1523465005	8	100% disagree. Alts will continue to fall against BTC for the short term. Xrp being near .50 is evidence enough of that. 
1	1523466939	2	Yes.... EVERYBODY is buying alts.... NOBODY is buying bitcoin... because why have a piece of the most prevalent, adopted, mature, relevant and most limited crypto asset there is? Look dipshit, if you're gonna make a case for "go alts fuck bitcoin" at least try to make it better than a half-assed low-IQ post like this. What makes you think even alt coin speculators don't have bitcoin in their portfolio? What makes you think there's no one interested in bitcoin? The bitcoin supply is incredibly low, even if majority interest goes towards alts bitcoin itself has a lot going for it with a VERY limited supply, the price can easily go back to prior highs. Or are you saying it won't, that *this* is the time where bitcoin stagnates for good and the rest of the world completely forgets about it? Good luck with that dickheadThe mods are offline today and I'm tired of being excellent to alt coin inbreds like you. It's as if the BTC market cap can't grow *with* the alts. It's like if BTC doesn't have 90% we might as well pack our bags and give up guys.... it's over...
2	1523467252	3	I mean I get you, but you could have worded that a bit different.
0	1523460739	5	I expect we will make another down turn to around 6.75k just to increase the confussion and to play out the pennant. In around 5 days I expect the real action starts with the tightening of the 1d Bbands. I expect a fakeout and than a quick move in the other direction to have max pain.
1	1523462794	2	how far down do you think?
1	1523461190	2	Agreed. Although, there is one bullish indicator that I've noticed. We've been in a rising wedge since the current descending channel met with the long-term ascending trend line which has acted as support for about 10 days now. https://www.tradingview.com/x/msY59pCX/

2	1523436898	4	Could you do me a solid, and quantify this R/R I'm hearing about? Seems very anecdotal - overall trend is still very much in charge
3	1523437394	9	There is very little evidence we can break 6.5k as it has proven solid and all the shorts need to cover, many do so after a few % gains. So that's a 6% move at best.A move up has little resistance between 7.2 and 8.4, and arguably the number of shorts covering could easily propel us above 7.2Aaand just as I wanted to count and point how thin the bfx sell order book is vs buy order book, it went offline. But it's like 1 for 3.
4	1523437643	1	Thanks, appreciate your thoughts. Think 7k will need some effort to breach however, descending support from 11.7k.... But we'll see soon.
0	1523450683	4	Four hour cloud looks like it's about to get popped on the third attempt. Nice and thin, despite the momentum lines being bearish (a cross after a kumo escape would be expected and quite bullish). The chikou has a bit more work to do, but a slowly-does-it scenario would give a very easy breakout target. 4h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/sNurEf5V/My other chart today is the weekly, which I feel I've hardly reviewed for two weeks now (ie since it closed under 8k for the first time in '18). I'm closely watching the chikou here as it's about to come into contact with price and then momentum lines. I've very few bullish expectations, with momentum lines inverted, thin near-vertical cloud and a recovery target of 10k+, but I think the behaviour of the chikou will be very indicative of what's to come.1w: https://www.tradingview.com/x/7y7xThQ1/

0	1523448354	5	Remember when longs outnumbered shorts heavily in early December and we had a huge long squeeze and the price didn't triple. 
1	1523449655	6	Except, we did have a long squeeze in December. Sure it was after we hit 20k but were you not there when the price dropped 4k in, like, two minutes on Mex? Crazy liquidation cascade. We were at 15k I think and then suddenly it just dropped to 10-something which was one of the first bottoms people started looking for. We actually had several long squeezes in December.Edit: Just found the chart for it. It was at 14k and then dropped to 10.9 on December 22nd.
1	1523448901	5	you still short from two days back?am outta position here, have a cheeky lil 25x long from 6.5k in the futs still in play, just for kicks really. and i just aint shorting in this range.still hoping for the 7.5k lol.everybody seems to be creaming their pants over a short squeeze and i would mind one to be honest

2	1523442905	1	Did you finish yours?
3	1523443157	3	I’ve had a market maker bot for a while.I have a very basic arb botI had a “buy the fucking dip” bot, but that actually started losing money after Jan/Feb.None of these are really profitable, so I shut them off. I was making good money back in Nov Dec, especially with the arb bot since GDAX was 1k EUR above Kraken.Now I have no bots.If you want a bot trading the market using multiple signals, you’re going to need to read a couple books.Elements of Statistical Learning Theory is a good one
4	1523443326	1	A bot for trading this chop gotta be profitable no?   Thanks for the suggestion :)
5	1523443489	2	I guess. I mean, the hard part is quantifying “low” and “high”. You can tell the bot to buy and then put limit sells higher, but that’s about it... You can use RSI and a bunch kf other signals, but you still need to act upon them. The “acting” is not that easy tbh.

0	1523433050	4	I saw earlier that someone said that the alts are on the rise. Can confirm. More of a 'bubbling' than a decent rise. Whether that's out of boredom, confidence or fomo for short term gains it remains to be seen.I'm tentatively flipping from neutral / neutral to neutral / bullish and I'm going on the basis sub 6k bitcoin is off. If it goes to 6k again I'll have to face up to a 10% hit but it's a decent enough risk to take. Especially if shorting really is the new black.Still expecting bitcoin to drop a bit but swings of 3-500 vs multiday 1k plummets. But what do I know, I'm just another stranger on the internet.
0	1523461028	0	I just don't see anyone buying in.  Dumb money got smart.
1	1523461470	9	You are right. Dumb money tends to buy in only when the price is near the top. 
2	1523462251	6	... And sells the bottom. All the volume we've seen over the last 8 weeks is the exit of dumb money and smart shorts, IMO. The fact that volume is drying up right now is very bullish.
3	1523462654	2	Why is it bullish that there is no volume?  I'm not being argumentative just genuinely interested.
4	1523462901	11	It's an indication that momentum on the trend is being exhausted. Bulls aren't going to pile in before there's clear confirmation of a trend reversal, and bears are going to keep betting on the trend until there's no supply left to sell. When there's a supply shortage the market can't recognize that for a while. The issue isn't that the bears have oversold the asset. The issue is that a fair market value has been found and accumulation starts to happen. When accumulation starts, people are trying to buy at the lowest possible price, so they let the price drop and then gradually buy it back up. You end up with a market that rises on low volume because the buys that you see are distributed acquisitions that will make up a much larger position.
4	1523462868	3	Lack of momentum. Think of a rubber ball hitting the floor. Thats what the chart looks like. Once it stops bouncing like that we can go on climbing again.
1	1523461586	5	Volume on GDAX is about as low as we've seen in ages.
2	1523462288	3	I went to sleep and woke up to the same exact price on GDAX. Have never seen that happen before.
1	1523461823	5	dumb money went straight to alts which for now seems like the smart option. As a self proclaimed alt trader kicking myself a bit for ignoring this new alt trend, whether it be short lived or not, since I've only been paying attention to this sad BTC movement. 
2	1523462801	1	you could had bought verge! Besides alts to get bought usually need to buy bitcoin first so they are buying bitcoin. 
3	1523463089	1	Not necessarily. A lot of altcoin holders have hands of titanium so they may have swapped or been in tether. However I do understand what you're saying.
4	1523463421	2	indeed we do. I bough a bit more than 1500 bitshares when they were worth a bit less than 0.06$ . Longed them to 3000+ . Didn't sold when it hit 1$. Now they are worth 0.15$ . Still really good profits but i can't say im exactly happy about it. 
5	1523463585	1	You rode the full stack from a dollar to 15 cents without reducing your position somewhere in there?  Incredible the bags people hold in this market.  Maybe it pans out later.  Good luck.
6	1523463743	2	Easy to say im an idiot there, but you know, it wasn't that muchmoney, wasnt afraid of losing it and im still sitting in 6x profits at that stack. When you have made almost 33x profits you think you are better than you are. 
7	1523464595	1	Yeah I’ve made bad trades and held bags too.  If nothing else it is a great learning experience.  Good to get learning before putting significant cash into this machine.

0	1523452300	3	Its interesting watching how the bull memes adapt to changes in price action. Parabolic increase: to the moon! Rapid free fall: capitulation incoming! Sustained sideways: Wyckoff accumulation zone!It’s almost as if any movement at all is predictive of an incoming bull run...Don’t get me wrong, some of these could be correct at some point, but it’s important to check your bias if your hypothesis is unfalsifiable in your mind.
1	1523452518	5	Yeah, people assume it will just go up because. I feel like right now the path of least resistance *should* be up, and since it's not going up, the market is just psyching itself up to go down.
2	1523452707	6	The fact that we’re struggling so much to get back above the 6.8-7k range seems quite bearish to me. Didn’t we just get rejected by 7.6 and 7.2? I wouldn’t even think about being slightly bullish until we broke through those zones.
3	1523454499	4	At some point is like delaying the inevitable. Just like i think the december bull run should have ended at 11.8K and was only propelled by fomo, i think this bear run should have ended by now but is also propelled by fomo with the shorts and the sells and waiting for a lower point of entry. This has two readings, people miss their entries and leave and shorts get squeezed to low 8ks at most.Or people fomo in because their buys didn't got filled, shorts get squeezed, nobody sells and we are in a bull run again. The second seems more likely given the nature of bitcoin, but betting on that as guaranteed is a recipe for disaster.

0	1523453714	3	There seems to be a fractal forming just like the pattern of the battle of 10K, we all know what happened next. Also the RSI, MACD, and Bollingerbands have had some time to cool off getting ready for another dive into goblin town. I think that if one were to bet on the fractal by shorting then the current range of 6900-7150 would be a great entry with stops just over 7300. Target for this dive could be in the 3-4K range. There may be a capitulation wick below. Betting long then stops just below 6500 and buy above. (though I personally wouldnt go long atm).[Some lines on a daily chart](https://prnt.sc/j3tf8e)

2	1523460356	1	I'm a fan of EOS, hate all you want but I bought low, sold my initial and am hoping its forming a giant up and handle on the btc pair
3	1523460592	1	Who the fuck says i hate EOS? I think it is very overvalued in its BTC ratio, but hey, as a bitshares fan (which has proven much more than EOS and that doesnt have to compete with ETH in the near future, nevermind the crash [thanks god i bought more or less at the current price]) this is just beneficial since they share same technology, base team, community up to some point and when EOS is released the idea is to go and make the blockchains be able to interact with each other.
4	1523460681	1	Sorry not saying that you hate it, but it gets a ton of hate in the crypto world 
5	1523460872	1	Because it is not a released project yet and because Tron. Also the Eth dumpI don't honestly believe they are going to live up to expectations, thats why i didn't buy eos besides for some quick trades.
1	1523459001	4	I don't do bitmex and short so all I want is a bullmarket but this is becoming less convincing of a start of one however maybe THIS IS the 2018 version of a bullrun. Slowly establishing higher lows and slowly chopping up, ignoring prior trendlines. All the top TA guys on Tradingview are constantly moving their lines and triangles to fit their narrative and leaving margins for error by saying "trends sometimes change guys" in fact I would respect them more if they say "sorry I'm just as confused so I don't know anymore"We were supposed to be below $6K at this point since we didn't make it past $7.1K right? TA seems to be working for support and resistance but the extreme low volume is not convincing me this has legs to for the bullrun towards ATH many are hoping for. 
2	1523459592	4	Saying we should be below 6k just because we didn’t hit 7.1 is nonsense. The RSI was heavily oversold and needed to take a breather on all timeframes. They’re all pretty much reset now to a point that would allow another major dumping, and with each pump less convincing and not reaching previous highs, it’s not looking promising that we’re in a reversal here. If we can push over 7.2-7.8 convincingly, with volume and hold the position, that would be a decent indicator. These crappy 100-150 dollar pumps are just not it. Bear in mind a few weeks ago we pumped from around 8k to 8.6 in a matter of an hour or two. Everyone was excited by that pump, and within a couple of days we had another major dump on our hands.It’s still too close to call.
3	1523460879	2	I agree with you. The below 6K was not my call but that's what people bears have been saying for a while now. I'm bearish myself but more based on sentiment since I don't really follow TA. The fact is though BTC has been making lower highs with even less volume. The upside is that 6.5 has been defended so many times that I'm not really believing the double bottom theory. I respect TA but its not anywhere near accurate and if anything just a guideline that bots and whales trade off.
1	1523458212	2	bullish, this time is different
0	1523455713	2	is that a 2k BTC sell wall at 6.955 USD on Bitfinex?
1	1523455919	4	$6.955? I'll take it

0	1523443552	2	I mine as well as trade and what I mine (zcash) is dropping in difficulty and Bitcoins hash rate appears to of dropped off sharply (edit, mioticping highlighted it was an error - thanks!). As in a big player just took their toys and put them away for a bit.There will be a couple of days to go before the difficulty adjusts to make it profitable again.Nothing to do with trading but just an FYI.
1	1523443975	2	> Bitcoins hash rate appears to of dropped off sharplyWhere do you see that? I don't see any sharp drop (+10% diff on next retarget): https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty
2	1523444132	5	blocks per 10 mins are more than 1 too, so it doesn't look hash-rate dropped:24 hours 	163 (6.79/hr) 2 weeks 	2157 (6.42/hr) from: https://fork.lol/
0	1523454950	2	Closed my long from 6630 at 6995 (it hit my ask order) at the same time opening a small short. So far playing out exactly as I thought it would. Here is the chart I posted 2 days ago : Https://www.tradingview.com/x/PW8z4hrD
1	1523456764	1	Whats your target?
2	1523457463	1	6750 +/- with a stop at 7150.
3	1523457726	1	Have a short from 8850 that wanted to close yesterday around 8750 but never went there (kraken). Will let it ride a while more to try at least breaking even. Thanks 
4	1523457909	2	Seeing this wedge playout you will get your chance to close in profit. Also it would not supprise me if this green wedge would breakdown to 5k. Contrary, we could see a big leg up at the end because of that big falling wedge on the 1D chart. After I close this short I will wait to see what happends at the apex.
1	1523456812	1	> Https://www.tradingview.com/x/PW8z4hrDThis is what I'm seeing, ~$6950-7000 meets the downtrend resistance set by the last peak at $7170 and a prior at $7500. If bulls can't push to create a higher high then I think we'll see another sharp drop like we saw on the 9th.

0	1523461736	-1	This has to be the bottom, buying pressure is unreal. Im blown away.
1	1523462471	12	We've been waiting on a new low for 8 weeks. If bears have the juice to push it down then we should see that, shouldn't we? Instead, short leverage is piling up and we're floating up on low volume.
2	1523463698	6	Thank god for the kraken whale that saved us from going under 6500.
3	1523464094	5	>kraken whaleI would love to see one of those
4	1523464546	2	It happened, price was on the verge of plummeting until a kraken whale put up a 1500 BTC buy wall
2	1523463931	3	> If bears have the juice to push it down then we should see that, shouldn't we? We do see that and have been seeing that for several weeks.
2	1523463330	1	I think it's just really impossible to tell until we've started testing some of these large descending triangles. luckily that will be soon and we'll get some more indicators.https://www.tradingview.com/x/A7H0QGTD/
2	1523463586	1	> short leverage is piling up and we're floating up on low volume.What kind of indication is this from your perspective?
3	1523463647	2	It indicates that shorts aren't closing. They're probably not closing because it's not profitable to close. New shorts are probably opening at an unchanged rate.
4	1523464104	1	> They're probably not closing because it's not profitable to close.I think that is obvious, what I mean is that what is your prediction based on your own TA, which direction do you see the price moving to?My opinion, if shorts are not closing and new shorts are being opened at unchanged rate, if we get a good pump, we could see some good rise in the price. Then again, there is way to much resistance ahead, I think we need more buys than a pump. 
1	1523463588	13	You sarcasm is typical of not-so-smart people shorting the bottom and staying longer in denial than they are solvent. If you're a bit curious about off-the-book indicators you can see than all the shorts opening have sold into something, because the price didn't move down at all. And that those smart people buying them corns were not in a rush to incite fomo, why buy higher if people are willing to sell so low?
1	1523462732	8	In a bear market you look at sell pressure... 
1	1523461875	3	where? not much on gdax
2	1523461893	3	/s
3	1523461956	1	ah ok x) , it's pretty weird, there's no volume for either side, only sudden big buys or sell offs but no one follows either
4	1523462102	3	Yeah.. I’m on the sideline.. this could go any direction, and I don’t feel like gambling
4	1523462196	2	I am pretty sure aside from the big buy and sells, this is how the current organic bitcoin market looks like. Hence the reason why I am bearish. Binance has bots on full speed right now causing all sorts of FOMO for no reason.

1	1523424596	1	Did you lose all your indicators or just the volume?
2	1523424813	1	Ok, after your question I got that I need to find it to add it as a separate indicator, and there it was.  Thank you!
0	1523425712	1	Anyone long ETHBTC ratio - longed it at 0.059, after 0.058 held. Trying to gauge TP point as momentum indicator for the entire market. ETHBTC ratio or any ALTBTC ratio only goes up, if the market overall is going up / stable (there are exceptions, but in general it is true). https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHBTC/70K0x1Ek-ETHBTC/
1	1523426068	2	In general as of late the ETHBTC ratio tends to mirror BTCUSD, so you get a multiplying effect on ETHUSD.  I've been trading ETHUSD off BTCUSD charts.
1	1523425761	1	The trick is to long with USD as the underlying.
2	1523425925	1	Can you elaborate - what's the trick? In a bear market, I understand the goal is to gain more fiat, but in the long run, we all want more BTC, ain't it?
3	1523426078	1	High correlation pair, increased rollover fees per unit volatility.Long term, both are going up, a lot.Good luck on the ratio without insider info.
0	1523426558	1	Mini Bart on the 15 min chart. Too risky for a trade here I'm gonna park my Fiat and get some nachos. Maybe go to bed alittle early.
1	1523432107	5	You shouldn't be driving and trading anyway.
