Hell we only just managed to transition to ASICs when it occurred. The media was giving us coverage, but only people adopting were techies. No where near the coverage BTC was getting in Nov/Dec 2017. MtGox was the only exchange (if you could call it that in comparison to today's exchanges) and a large portion of coins evaporated (literally) over night. We were all shaken. These communities didn't exist and as soon as it happened most of us just figured we fell for a scam and stopped posting. Without any exchange how ever could we think Bitcoin would succeed. We couldn't even cash out what we had, just watched it fall. It took almost a year before you started seeing people coming back and talking about it.I lost 6 coins (which wasn't considered a lot to most people) to MtGox and when the lawsuit hit they told me all six were deemed to be worth $3.62 even though when I sent them to MtGox they were each worth $1,300. I won't even go into the rage I have when someone talks about the seized coins being sold for the profit they received and I believe the Japanese Government is as much a part of my rage as MtGox is.The point being, the community learned from their mistakes and built back up. It took a while, but we know how to do this now and there are more of us. It won't take as long this time around.

0	1523460152	2	"LOL YOU LOST XX% OF YOUR MONEY!!"  same person a few years later when the price is now 20x what it was when they were making fun of you:  "Hey, how do I buy bitcorn?"  
0	1523462949	1	Would not bet in ATH before the end of the year, but yes, it's pretty possible the cool-off and recharge time will be shorter now.
0	1523432658	1	Only problem I have with this an all other posts is the guarantee part. 
0	1523432436	0	There are no guarantees of this. There are many events that could trigger a collapse - for example if tether is insolvent. It is completely possible that tether was created and used in an identical way to the willy bot to artificially pump the price of bitcoin.
1	1523457840	1	I really don't see tether causing a market crash. Tether is really no different than nano or any other alt coin that turns out to be a scam or gets hacked. Those who invested in a coin that lost value will lose their investment but anyone holding BTC or any other coin will be just fine.
0	1523437679	-1	It isn't until everyone doesn't 'expect an ath by the end of the year ' anymore  that this will be over. Coming from someone who stupidly held instead of sold the entire 2014-2015 bear market. 
0	1523453289	-1	Right now the problem is different. A metric crap ton of dumb money went into alt coins chasing get rich quick promises creating by proxy a huge bubble in BTC.Until 95% of coins die (and I mean actually go to 0) there is no room for BTC to grow. Like weeds stopping a healthy ecosystem to grow.Now, don't interpret this as me saying all Altcoins are bad, I am not trying to be a BTC maximalist here, to be honest I have no idea if BTC even will be here in the future. But, we need to recognize there is little to no utility in having 500 coins with non-negligible market caps muddying the crypto waters. Most of then are just forks with a couple of parameter changes trying to capitalize on a flashy logo.If anyone can just fork a coin and create value out of thin air then the whole model of knowable inflation breaks down for crypto. If a coin spits and the combined value increases then there is something broken in the market and it will need to correct before continuing its organic growth.This was the great liquidity flood of 2017 that lifted all the boats of crypto, and most of them were not even boats. Even wood logs with a flag attached were deemed sea worthy and ready to take their passengers into the promised land. Now Darwin must start the brutal selection process of culling the misfits mercilessly. Even some coins that don't deserve the beating will be punished.

1	1523446603	3	> What is Avg. IQ of a MGTOW’er> I would estimate probably 105-112.   It takes a some degree of above average intelligence to reject the scietal programming and propaganda... and take that red pill to see things the way they are.  Of course it's not a pill that changes your thinking, but a long process of thought and reflection and analysis.Your most recent post is great. > My god you guys are desperate and delusional.Stop projecting. Go take a few more of them red pills and chill. 
2	1523448706	-3	Non sequitur and ad hominem... good job.P.S. Keep praying and maybe the price will be $20K again.  But pray really hard.
3	1523450196	3	Do me a favor and look at your original comment. What type of response did you expect to get? You’re a moron. 
4	1523452084	-3	I expected the delusional hodlers to cry and pout...just like they did.
5	1523452254	2	lol. You’re delusional. 
1	1523468679	1	So, you having a good time poppin them red pills? MGTOW and using red pill in a sentence... Having some woman troubles there buddy?
