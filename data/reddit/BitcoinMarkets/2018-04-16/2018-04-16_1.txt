Then got absolutely destroyed by that 1m candle.  Thought I could hold overnight before getting liquidated (price down around 7920) but woke up to that depressing e-mail.  Learn from me -- margin trading is gambling and, when you're feeling cocky, stop trading.-2btc on that trade.  Holy fuck, feels bad.
1	1523889724	6	25x leverage is not your friend, man, especially with $15K positions. Sorry for your loss. There's a reason many of us keep it at 5x most of the time. Also, if you have a position that far in the green, break-even stops is basically a given. Zooming out helps. Crypto time feels distorted, but having a liquidation point just under $8K when we were at $6800 4 days ago was unwise. Take a step back, reevaluate, and *definitely* don't revenge trade. Good luck man.
1	1523893103	6	Oh, look, it's another undercapitalized trader getting rekt using hilariously excessive leverage25x leverage is gambling and it's not even the informed, card-counting kind of gambling, you're just laying down a massive position on black
1	1523888170	6	Been there, done that. you’ll make it back.well, at least if you don’t fucking trade with a liqui at 7920 when the price is 8400... What the fuck man? Don’t do that again. You liqui needs to be well below the 24 hour low.You’ll make two BTC back. No biggie. I trade with 5 and I’ve been down more than 2 BTC and made it back in 30 days
2	1523889198	9	> Been there, done that. you’ll make it back.lol. that's not how it works.
3	1523892618	8	it's how a gambler's mind works though
2	1523889179	3	Understood.  I've honestly never opened as aggressive of a position and I chose to do it when the risk / reward was ridiculously shitty.  I think I was in the mood to get abused.
3	1523892691	3	Live. Learn. Move on.
4	1523896056	1	To re-fund my gambling (bitmex) account, or not.That is the question.
5	1523901057	1	is it completely enpty? If not, I’d try to make due with what I have left
6	1523901478	1	Basically completely empty.  A couple thousand sats left - not enough to scalp effectively.Going to have to deposit if I want to keep playing the game. 
2	1523900780	1	Yall need to step your yolo game up. My liq is usually 2-300 away. Buy at support/sell at resistance. Exit immediately if it breaks.
3	1523901086	1	If you’re out if a position while sleeping or away from chrts, seems fine to me
0	1523855311	19	You guys have inspired me to take a trip down memory lane with all this talk of "manipulation," "high-volume pumps/dumps and low volume the rest of the time," and "it was never like this!"I open my archive, and every dozen or so screenshots, I'm seeing stuff that would make you guys blush.[Exhibit A](https://imgur.com/a/EWXMr), and I just started looking. January of 2017. Three gut-wrenching candles within one day. Each 3-5%, the equivalent of a $300 or $400+ move now. Can you imagine how many longs and shorts got rekt? Bonus: I spy ETH (that I thought was *wildly* overpriced) at ~$10.
1	1523856368	6	I see your memory lane and raise you: https://i.imgur.com/LsuMgMH.png
2	1523856610	4	I fold, you got me there. Wasn't around for those good old days!
2	1523868203	3	Actually, on second glance...was that 2013 or 2014? If the latter, then I remember it. For some reason I thought it was the 2013 bubble to $260 when I first saw it.
1	1523856954	6	Thank you.Getting sick and tired of all this BS manipulation shit. It's not any more manipulated than it always is/has been, these jumps are just byproducts of a relatively illiquid market. Yelling manipulation is a complete copout and stifles actually helpful and concrete analysis. How do you quantify it? What evidence is there that the quantification is valid and not something else? It's essentially unprovable and undisprovable at the same time, so completely useless.
1	1523855663	1	Those are futures (less liquidity) and the recent BGD was 20% in 30 minutes. But I would genuinely be interested if you can find other historical examples.
2	1523856452	4	If I recall correctly (I welcome those with better memory to correct me), OKCasino futures was the market with highest liquidity and volume at the time...and is still significant even to this day (though of course the China bans put a damper on things).Also that price action was mirrored across futures and spot, as it usually is. Though upon closer inspection it appears you are right to a certain extent, the moves were less pronounced on spot...looking at the tickers in the tabs I had open, as best I can tell, spot was $920 high / $902 low (give or take) vs. $936 high / $870 low on futures.> 20% in 30 minutesI am *sure* we had plenty of those over the years.> I would genuinely be interested if you can find other historical examples.Yeah, I'm having a lot of fun digging in the archive. Will report back with more.
3	1523857194	2	Interesting, thanks for looking into it.> I am sure we had plenty of those over the years.Oh ya, definitely. That's why we all play this game, right? What I mean is that the recent BGD happened with no movement suggesting a trend in that direction (or a clear reversal sign) immediately prior. Actually, there was a small downtrend (which brought on the shorts), and then a huge response. Almost more like a bounce, but with the bounce being much larger than the precipitating fall. I just don't think this kind of thing (and barts) were as common in the past because either (a) there weren't so many clueless people making high leverage bets and there were fewer whales with the means to exploit it or (b) there was enough liquidity to absorb it. It's not until now that we have the confluence of low volume, high-leverage margin trading, and whale games that allows for this kind of activity to dominate the price.
4	1523858441	2	Yeah, I actually partially agree with you there...margin trading has made things crazier in some respects. I think the BGD made perfect sense because the shorts were just begging to be squeezed and the $6.5k support tests were making shorts wary and bulls more confident (and I put my money where my mouth is by riding it up, even though it cost me in the weeks prior by getting chopped out 3x beforehand). What I can't explain (and where I agree with you) is why it happened *there* and not before or after. That's one of those mysteries of life, I guess.
5	1523879264	2	100% agree with this take. Thanks for hunting down the great historical examples 
1	1523856012	1	Are you referring to barting action among things you're saying have been around the whole time too? I agree w/ the rest
2	1523857319	3	I'm really not sure what people are referring to with this barting thing, but [this chart shows the hourly of Mt Gox in late Nov-early Dec 2013](https://www.tradingview.com/x/c5CERfQT/). 11.29-12.1 especially look rather Bart like to me.Or [this one.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xh0BVJtt/)
2	1523857146	1	I don't know if I can find Barts that "clean" (well-formed) in the past...but yes, referring to the general market action of high-volume pumps and dumps amidst uncertainty that create weird formations on the charts (as you can see in the shot above).
1	1523863178	1	wait, how is the fact that it has always been manipulated an argument against it being manipulated just now?
2	1523903166	1	Well, a lot of people around here were acting like some of the phenomena was new; I wanted to demonstrate that it wasn't. Also, some people can look at the older examples I posted ("Chinese hedge funds suppressing BTC!", 2014) and say, well clearly that theory was nonsense and we were just in a bear market...then turn around and look at the same nonsense today ("Soros shorting BTC to $0!") and take it seriously.The overarching point is that the market is the market is the market. If there's manipulation, then you might as well just get used to it and work around it. And it's human nature to construct creative narratives for things that have more reasonable explanations. These theories are easy to create but very difficult to prove/disprove. It's best to just ignore them unless presented alongside very compelling evidence (and "look at all these coincidences!" isn't very compelling, either).
0	1523856114	49	Closed my $1.2mm short from $8388 posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ccvku/daily_discussion_sunday_april_15_2018/dxeb02i), at $8022 for a total profit of 4%. About to head onto a long flight with no wifi, prefer to stay out. 
1	1523858547	2	Well played yet again. Better safe n sorry. Always good to take small profits which is what I have learned the hard way!!
1	1523856279	3	Mind if i asked what sort of work is it that you do?   
2	1523856435	34	>Mind if i asked what sort of work is it that you do?   Previously founded and sold numerous companies including a crypto exchange, finance and take companies public onto the Toronto stock exchange, currently most of my time is spent running a small hedge fund. 
3	1523857398	8	Any reason you started posting your trades lately?
4	1523873322	6	It helps to move the market if you are consistently right. There are bots that scrape Mike and Chewy comments
5	1523878462	1	Man I love programming!
5	1523897815	1	Agreed, just wondering if that's his rationale or what 
3	1523857072	10	Most impressive sir!  We appreciate your input here :) 
4	1523857873	3	I totally agree with that comment. Awesome that you do that, Mike. Although you should never blindly follow anyones calls and do your own TA (as far as possible), it's nice to get an insight into people playing with higher stakes. 
3	1523859531	3	Any thoughts on shorting the living crap out of Euro bonds expecting interest rates to go up? risky?
3	1523857631	1	wow, didn't know you're from toronto
4	1523858413	3	The6 checking in.
0	1523852743	17	Alright. My balance in Bitmex is now officially back to where it was Nov 1st 2017. That's a few days after I opened up a tiny^tiny short at about $5600, that I added to and held throughout the runup to $20K. I survived and learned and now I think I've become better at risk management and order spread. It was an exercise of patience and control. Now, I'm at breakeven (in BTC balance, in the green in USD value) from when I chose to open a short at $5600
1	1523854535	7	Good lord. Talk about being around the block and back - like 27 times. No better teacher than experience!
2	1523855412	5	Hehehe, yeah! You know, I have three years of experience in bitcoin. But it feels like I've learned more in those three years in the market than I have learned in the last 11 years of my academic education.
0	1523885881	60	After pushing up and up in a remarkably overextended rally from $6,800 to $8,400, the market finally decided to cool off a bit and give up some of those gains in the form of the correction we are seeing currently. How deep it goes should provide some very helpful insight into whether or not this is just another dead cat bounce or the beginning of a full-blown trend reversal. In order of bullishness, they are:1. Bounce off $7,800 followed by a new high above $8,400. This would put the [long-term resistance line](https://imgur.com/a/8e62A) as an immediate target. It's currently sitting at around $8,750. 2. Bounce off of $7,500 followed by a period of consolidation between $7,500 and $8,400.3. Bounce off of $7,300 followed by a period of consolidation between $7,300 and $8,400.4. No bounce and a full-blown Bart Simpson back down to $6,800. There is an argument for additional horizontal support zones at $7,100 and $7,000 flat, but I'd find it unlikely that they'd hold for long if $7,300 breaks down. At least for now, there's nothing to be particularly concerned about if you were bullish yesterday. This correction was long overdue, and is not especially surprising. As long as this doesn't retrace 100% of the way back to $6,800, then we'll have the beginnings of a nice, solid bullish trendline that could bring the market up and over the long-term resistance line in the coming weeks. The first point of contact being the start of the Giant Green Candle (or whatever we're calling it these days). The second point of contact being wherever the bottom of this particular decline is.Ideally we'd see a 3rd point of contact prior to a breakout of the resistance line, but we'll have to wait and see.This is the bullish case, and it's all predicated on one of the above support zones holding strong in the $7,000s. The bearish scenario is pretty straight forward. If the market breaks down below $6,800, then I'd expect buyers to finally throw in the towel and concede $6,000 shortly thereafter. If you are out of position, then continuing to sit this out would be my recommendation. The risk/reward on a short is abysmal between $7,950 and $7,800, and it doesn't get all that much better below $7,800 (aside from scalping 2% - 3% down to $7,500). Conversely, opening a long here has a slightly better r/r profile, but you'd have to be prepared to hold throughout the $7,000s.I'm short currently from around $8,330, and will likely hold onto it until breakeven at this point. 
1	1523886135	6	good job Chewy
1	1523886354	5	> I'm short currently from around $8,330,Bet me by about 15 US. I agree with all of the above. Though I'm expecting a rally afterwards mostly because of the 3D metrics. I highly doubt that we will go below 7500. I'm hoping to exit around 7600.
1	1523886453	4	Thank you, great recomodation again! Do you ever do minor trades to improve the entry of your position, or you never do this? 
2	1523886773	5	Usually not, no. I generally stick with an entry and either hold it or give up on it if things go south. For example, I had a short from $8,030 that I closed at $8,080 prior to the move up to $8,400. I described the movement as "stupid" at the time and had very little faith in the prospect of continued upward movement. So I could certainly have just added to it on the way up, but opted instead to get out of the way and reevaluate. 
3	1523887203	1	I did the other, basically. I had a stop limit, but didn't set it deep enough. Instead, I added at 8350. 
4	1523887636	1	You were layering sells right? What is your CA right now?
5	1523888590	2	Yes. My CA is about 8150. I didn't have the nerves to double my position up at 8350, so I only added about 25%. Feels obvious in hindsight, but the number and size of those green candles one after another was freaking me out.
1	1523887269	2	"I'm short currently from around $8,330, and will likely hold onto it until breakeven at this point.""If you are out of position, then continuing to sit this out would be my recommendation."How do you reconcile these statements? Unless closing will push the market against you how is holding a short distinguishable from opening one at the same price?
2	1523888456	9	When I make trade recommendations, at least a small number of people follow them. The difference between opening a short at $7,950 vs holding an existing short from $8,330 is how much you have in your trading account to support that trade. let's say you shorted 1 btc at $8,330. On paper, you currently have about 1.1 btc. If the market goes back to $8,330, you have 1 btc. If you short 1 btc here at $7,950 and close at $8,330 you have ~.9 btc. What I'm essentially saying here is the following:1. If you've got some profit from your current short to support the position, then let it ride and take the risk/reward of seeing $7,500 before we see $8,400 again. 2. If you don't currently have profit from your previous trade to support the position, then stay out. People hold me accountable for the recommendations I make. I have zero issue with folks missing out on profits because they held a position too long based on my recommendation. However, I try to avoid forcing fresh losses on my followers because I advised them to enter a position at the wrong time.
3	1523888843	2	I see where you are coming from. Short from 19k, price is 6500, can keep the position open as a runup to 8k is a relatively small movement.Short from 6500, a move up to 8k will smash you.
2	1523888480	2	One of his main reasons is hedging his cold stack. I enter most of his trades but leave early / take profits because i have no hold stack so when i enter a trade is to make money. This is something people following other traders positions must understand, if the reasoning behind the trade is the same between traders.I entered a bit bellow his entry and left @8100. Was it early, yes, but if it bounced from the bottom of the channel to 8300 again it would almost count as a loss for me, specially since i had a losing streak last week and my last 3 trades were break even, so i really needed a win.
2	1523888355	1	R/R to open a position is not worth it anymore here. However being short from 8330 he has quite some room to let it breathe and see what happens without immediate danger of being in the red.
2	1523889404	1	"Cut losses quickly, let winners ride"That should pretty much explain it.  If you're a few hundred points in the green, you can afford to wait it out in case it continues to break down.  If you open a short here, you could very quickly be in the red.
1	1523889894	2	Your input is always very much appreciated. Thanks. 
1	1523886061	1	good short Chewy..yesterday some dude was upset he followed your short and it went up to 8400 LOL wonder if he closed at a loss..I hope he did for being a dick
2	1523886262	10	Actually, he closed for a loss and also opened a long near the top. I can certainly understand someone's frustration when they follow one of my positions and it doesn't work out as they'd hoped, but if you can't stomach a 1.5% move against a position then you're going to have a bad time. He exited too early and ignored my recommendation to set stops above $8,500.
3	1523886335	3	maximum pain geeez
3	1523886592	2	am i wrong for opening a short at 8330, and then closing it at breakeven because i really didn't think i would have the time to monitor it well and didn't want to fuck the trade up again?
4	1523886973	7	Of course not. The only thing that would be "wrong" would be trying to catch every single 3% to 5% move. If you can't pay attention to the market, and you don't want to rely on trailing stops to take profit and stop losses to protect your trading balance, then you probably shouldn't be taking positions at that time. 
5	1523887578	3	the downsides of being a busy 16 year old
4	1523886817	3	You're never wrong if you have good reasoning
4	1523886901	2	nothing wrong with that imo - patience is a virtue but not being able to monitor trades, even with sensible stops, can lead to regret later on if it doesn't pan out i would think
0	1523895421	30	Briefly on the subject of hidden bearish divergences, because they've been very helpful in pointing out Dead Cat bounces in the past. Right now we are seeing the potential for hidden bearish divergence on the 1h - 1d when compared to the bounce from $7,300 to $9,200.1d: https://imgur.com/a/ZYl7o4h: https://imgur.com/a/DUSpfThe only thing I would point out about this particular hidden divergence when compared to previous ones is that the Big Green Candle is more or less entirely responsible for the elevated RSI on lower timeframes. Had the market taken a more leisurely pace to get to where it is, RSI might not be making higher highs when compared to the push from $7,300 to $9,200. Anyhow, the market needs to push above $9,200 to invalidate the hidden divergence. Until then, it's something to keep an eye on.
1	1523896040	12	I've been extremely skeptical of your posts as I've been lurking here since 2016 and remember your exit after the crash from 1160 to 735. However, since you came back your posts have been informative and useful, and I have realized not to judge you by one bad trade. Just wanted to say props for the continued quality content, keep it up.
2	1523896322	23	I appreciate both your skepticism and your ability to judge my commentary at face value rather than with an established bias based on my past trading performance. In my defense, when I rage quit at $760 I even acknowledged at the time that I was very likely selling the local bottom. I was emotionally drained to a point I hadn't even realized was possible when I initially started trading in the $200 to $300 range. The six month break I took between $760 and $5,000 helped me step away from my emotions and focus more on technical analysis. My performance has improved considerably since.
1	1523898393	2	If $9200 invalidates the hidden bearish divergence, it will be invalidated within a week. Personally, I'm hoping for a third higher low at $7500 but the latest dumper doesn't seem to have as much ammo as the last one which makes sense since supply is tight.
0	1523880881	13	Opened both a short and long at 8080. Stops around 8200 and 7950. Expecting a big move once a direction is established and if I get chopped for both positions I lose around 3%, a risk I'm willing to take.Let's be honest, we're all just gambling at this point.
1	1523881505	8	Speak for yourself. We've had an ascending wedge forming for three days. Last night offered an excellent option to short 8350+, and many of us did. I was already short 8120, but added there.
2	1523883188	2	Shorted hard when 8400 was failing on that last few dribbling attempts. Overbought on many timelines, running into old log support turned resistance, daily stoch RSI about to cross, and tight stops were not hard to place in case the bull was real and the resistance broke
2	1523882392	1	Short from 8349 here, added at 8094 with another planned add at 8149 if we get back up there. Stop set at 8169. Gonna start taking profit at 8009 and then in installments on the way down if it breaks 8000. Edit: 8009 filled a second after saving this message. Here we go...
1	1523882913	2	both ur stops are gonna hit now, i think, this range is terrible really to set stops, either ride it both ways or just pick a direction and stick to it. 
1	1523881259	1	Noob here. How do you profit by going both long and short? Care to explain? Thanks 
2	1523881535	6	He places stop loses and expects to get stopped out of one position while riding the other one. So he will have about 1.5% loss on one position but will recoup that on the other one if the move is substantial and if he doesn't get stopped out of both because of wild swings.
2	1523881500	3	You don't if you have both positions open, they effectively cancel each other out. I'm currently unsure of the direction BTC will go, but I do expect huge momentum in the direction it picks. So if I open both positions with relatively tight stops, one will get stopped out from the move and hopefully the momentum will keep going. I will hold the remaining position.
3	1523881620	1	Ahhhhh I see, pretty smart idea (never thought of it that way). Thanks man appreciate it.
4	1523882121	4	This falls under the category of trading ideas that sound clever on paper but usually end up just losing money.Especially with BTC, setting 1.5% stops on a long/short from the same entry is asking to get chopped up. The better play for opening a long/short is when there's a wedge forming (of any kind). Open your long at the bottom of the oscillation and the short at the top. If you've got $100+ between your entries, it makes a lot more sense if you're trying to catch a candle. 
5	1523887101	1	You're right, this was a hasty trade because I became impatient during the 8030-8100 zone. Got stopped out of my long at 7950, also closing this short basically at break even so I've actually lost a tiny amount on fees. There was a move but not a huge one. Someone has been flashing a 350 BTC bid for a while and actually did soak up the whole amount at 7950, wonder why.
4	1523882126	3	Not so smart because we had lots of considerable fake outs before the bigger movements. It would stop his wining bet and leave the losing one to be also stopped.That move requires manual stops to be safer and a movement far greater than his stop limits because he will only start wining after 1.5% + fees, so if the movement is just 2-3% might not be worth it.
4	1523885516	1	seems silly when you can just use 2 stop entries and therefore save on fees
5	1523885525	2	Hey, TriangleSushi, just a quick heads-up:  **therefor** is actually spelled **therefore**. You can remember it by **ends with -fore**.  Have a nice day!^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
2	1523881520	1	he hopes for a big move obviously so his long/short gets stopped out quickly while his other position makes big gains
0	1523867459	22	Ok, last one for now. [Exhibit E](https://i.imgur.com/CMSy9FV.jpg) (original upload), June 2014. The elusive "Bart" formation, albeit short-term, but with an actual plausible-sounding manipulation narrative and presented in a humorous format.My goal in digging through the archives was to ~~sit in my rocking chair and reminisce about the good old days~~ demonstrate that all the common talking points and market action of today were just as prevalent a year ago, in 2014/2015, and almost certainly earlier. I'm talking about manipulation, wash trading, pump and dumps, "Bart" formations, shady exchanges, price suppression / accumulation narratives, etc. etc. etc. It all happened then, it's happening now, and it'll likely continue for the foreseeable future. Your goal as a trader is to adapt to all these things, and even use them to your advantage when possible. Complaining and speculating wildly won't get you too far. And if you can't adapt, then your best bet is to switch to a long-term investing strategy and save yourself the heartburn and sleepless nights that you'll get trading.I hope that enough commenters will see this that we'll get at least a *slight* reduction in the types of comments we're seeing non-stop lately (optimistic, I know).I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane; lots of good and bad memories. Plus, I dug up enough ancient material for a month's worth of Throwback Thursdays! If you guys enjoyed them, I'll post some more soon.
1	1523869407	3	Post some more, I'm really jnterested and I like your approach.
1	1523868443	2	What about futures whats your opinion on them? 2014/2015 had no futures.
2	1523869026	5	2014/2015 had futures, but they were OKCoin futures. They were a major force in the market, and there was always some funny business going on due to their unregulated nature, high volume, leverage, etc. (we call them OKCasino for a reason).I'm guessing you mean regulated, big boy futures like CME/Cboe? Yeah, it should be interesting to watch. Right now volume on those futures is so low that I think their market impact is negligible. However, if volume increases, we should see them have more of an impact. While I don't put much stock in some of the wilder futures manipulation theories (gold/silver/uranium/etc.), I do think the "tail might start wagging the dog" in terms of futures affecting/controlling the spot markets due to arbitrage effects, etc. That would actually be really bad news for your average Crypto Chad retail trader, because I suspect that the institutions / HNWI that play those markets play much more serious and subtle games than we see on Bitcoin markets today.
0	1523857610	9	[Exhibit B](https://imgur.com/a/BKHVu), November 2014. This is a funny one...all the elements of a modern-day /r/BitcoinMarkets drama, including:* Terrifying 1,000 BTC ask wall!* High-volume dump!* Followed by a (literally) dead market!
1	1523857740	4	Yeah, totally dead markets with not a single trade were a thing before. They're not now. I can't remember the last time I saw more than a minute or two between trades. That alone means this market can move and react faster than it used to be able to do.
2	1523861711	5	You weren't kidding; [look what I just found](http://i.imgur.com/jgdA3th.png). October 2015. Weirdly high-volume period creating some ugly chart patterns, followed by many minutes with *literally 0 volume*. Talk about low volume and low liquidity!
2	1523858696	3	You're right, but I have to admit my post was a bit tongue-in-cheek (I think Bitstamp, or its feed, literally died after that move...no way did people not trade at all after a dump like that).But yeah, there were paint-drying days where you could see 3-5 minutes go by with no trades. Especially during the bottom of the bear market.The one thing I really miss about those days is you could set an alarm for 1-3% and not have it hit for *days*. For the past couple of years, alarms go off constantly. I miss my beauty sleep.
0	1523882931	15	Shorted at 8,015. Thank me when we pump to 10,000.
0	1523854118	16	Tried to post this yesterday but it had a youtube link (*b/c I wanted to credit the guy @CarpeNoctom*) so the post sorta disappeared, and made me think I was shadow banned. Btw whose idea was it to auto-remove youtube links? That's just disappointing. How are we gonna post the DBZ 9000 videos? Anyways https://i.imgur.com/XAkI57S.png- bullish divergence^TM- price is at least touching the cloud with high probability (~8800-9000)- if it gets rejected at cloud, bearish af, lower lows incoming - if it breaks into cloud, it's going between yearly pivot and end of cloud (11-12.5K) with high probability- if it breaks though the cloud, 16K in sight- if it breaks that (*ETF approval, central banks adding BTC reserve, etc*), then we've reset the [2017 bull run](https://i.imgur.com/ZiM19RB.png), and I'll be rich again- also a possible adam & eve bottom, similar to one [one we've seen](https://i.imgur.com/Z17KcHA.png), which helps the case of a trend reversal - for the non-traders (*everyone here and myself*), adam & eves have a sharp V bottom w/ high volume (adam) and then a second rounded bottom w/ low volume (eve)- this will take days to play out w/ surprises in between, obviously, stop bitching about a day's volatility - also, 8400 is not significant, if we get bitchslapped back to bear it'll happen around 9K, so i'll double down on point two And don't you fucking forget: https://i.imgur.com/sP8b91A.png**TLDR**: It's either going up, or it's doing down
1	1523856036	3	That rule was implemented a long time ago. It actually works quite well. We allow through the posts with on topic vids when we see them, but sometimes we miss one. If you  get stuck in the spam filter again just shoot us a message! We'll take care of it.

1	1523858560	1	8500 IS significant', it's the weekly breakdown level.. too many people hoping for higher rn not seeing the reality 
0	1523900653	7	Exited my short (8100 CA) for small profit at 8030. Bear flag appears to have broken up. If the downtrend line breaks (8070), I'll be sitting on the sides. Otherwise, I'm happy to re-enter around my exit if we stay within our channel here.edit: back in 50% at my exit roughly (8040). Downtrend channel held so far. Will add the rest if we retest 8100, stops above 8150. This is roughly what I'm watching: https://www.tradingview.com/x/m6ZCxDsV/  
1	1523900807	3	So far it looks like its just confirming the breakdown of the post-BGD rise. If it makes it above 8100 it might be something more
2	1523900885	4	Agreed, but since 8100 is my entry, I was wary to hold until there. Borderline weak hands move here, but I held this short through the trip to 8400 and didn't want to do it again. I do expect 8100 to hold though, given this stall. 
3	1523901179	1	Oh ya, I get you 100%. Market has been too unpredictable recently so it's probably a wise decision.
3	1523901076	0	The sell book of BTC and ETH also concerns me, a whale could literally buy it all and send us to the startosphere, don't want to play with fire. Wise decision to protect capital.
4	1523901839	2	That is what we saw with the last BGD (8100-8400).
4	1523901575	1	Why would that concern you? Don't you have a hodl stack? 
5	1523901977	2	No, not anymore. I consider Bitcoin a niche and wouldn't buy it for more than 1-3k. This whole "we will one day pay our coffee with bitcoin" narrative sounds extremely stupid to me, it's very impratical for that usage. Remains evading taxes / money laundering (but anon coins do it better) and gambling I suppose. Niche. 
1	1523901635	1	It seems to be on a [downward channel](https://imgur.com/a/JatGn) no?Or better yet, a smaller downward channel inside a larger one .
2	1523901743	2	Yep, I just had updated my post with my chart. I've got a bit of PTSD from the BGC, so I have been managing stops/positions more closely. Downtrend channel seems to be holding, so I did re-enter 50% of my position at 8040. 
0	1523860484	16	[Exhibit D](http://i.imgur.com/XJKYk29.gif), original upload (author unknown), circa October 2015. Blatant, egregious wash trading on a Chinese exchange (those are CNY prices) back in the day when men were men, traders were honest, and markets were organic, free-range, and GMO-free.I'm as shocked and surprised as you are, really.

0	1523898767	17	Bullish elliot wave TA update.A bear case is starting to emerge as we approach descending log resistance from the ATH. I should draw up, but for now I'm just commenting on the bull case.https://www.tradingview.com/x/4SVmnFoT/You can see the last post where I projected we'd find resistance around 8.5k here:https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bwesq/daily_discussion_friday_april_13_2018/dxb0ojx/I got lucky on that projection, but it does seem to somewhat validate that we ended the third wave and currently retracing. We could go as low as 7,500. This is a bad place to take a long, but it's an okay place to distribute buys that increase in value as we descend down.Using a DCA to enter a long position in this area puts us into an excellent position if we are going to attempt to break descending log resistance from the ATH. Breaking the log line with our fifth wave sets us up nicely for a slow (for Bitcoin) rise back to 11k next month and 15k in June or July.
0	1523853538	5	Question please; would this be considered a Adam and Eve double bottom? https://www.tradingview.com/x/GY479shw/
1	1523853684	6	Yes, but only if it confirms at 12k, so we still have a long way to go.
2	1523853805	2	Thank you.
3	1523854323	5	In fact, double bottoms generally fail to confirm and end up going lower around 64% of the time (not a BTC specific stat).
4	1523854434	2	Thank you. No volume so we know this isn't happening soon.
0	1523863086	4	I posted this yesterday but didn’t get much feedback. Rookie question. Suppose you had enough of a specific crypto to move the exchange price somewhat significantly and also had cash on hand. The currency is low volume without much movement either way. Volatility is low.  Would it be most profitable to place a series of large volume buys and sells of an equal value apart then let the orders be filled back and forth all day -or-make less frequent whale moves to force the price up for a day or two and then back down for a day or two? Thanks for any feedback guys!
1	1523863253	5	If you're the most powerful player in the game, anything you want to do will work, as you literally have a crystal ball and just need to worry about liquidity. But you're not - so any strategy is associated with risk, and believe it or not, whales also hunt each other.Both strategies you described have their risks and profit potential, which someone with enough capital should know to evaluate properly.
2	1523864340	1	Thanks, I was wondering if the increased trading volume with small buys and sells help drive more interest on the exchange without a panic dump. 
1	1523863964	4	> Suppose you had enough of a specific crypto to move the exchange price somewhat significantly and also had cash on hand. The currency is low volume without much movement either way. Volatility is low.Beached whale bagholding for everyone. You'd do whatever you could to get the hell out again, in the process volatility would no longer be low.It's kinda an oxymoron that it would be low volume, volatility yet you can move the price significantly. Then it's simply illiquid, as in no water, as in beached.
2	1523864183	1	Excellent point, thanks. 
3	1523864411	3	Another way of putting that is, if you can move the price, yet the price doesn't move on it's "own" otherwise. Then perhaps no one cares about the market.Then your observation about "wash trading" creating fake volume to bring attention to the market is probably a fair one. However, will anyone care about the market all the same?
4	1523864710	1	You’re exactly right! It’s hard to get out without hodlers panic selling with low volume though. 
5	1523865749	3	Read up on Wyckoff Method, that should help a lot.Grab a copy of *Volume Price Analysis by Anna Coulling* (there is a PDF somewhere), it's a good quick easy read with a nice way of explaining a lot of the tricks of the whale trade.
6	1523865892	1	Outstanding, thanks for your help!
0	1523868769	4	Still waiting for a proper retrace to jump back in. Seems like it won't happen, or probably will when we retest the ATH downtrend at ~9K.What are the chances we will see sub 8k today or in the following days ?
1	1523869855	-4	99% (but maybe only to 7800, who knows)

1	1523901725	3	I am sticking to my long @ 8000. 
0	1523893348	22	Haven’t posted here in a while since I have been trying to spend less time looking at charts, but this is what I am currently thinking about. On one hand I still feel pretty bearish since volume did not really pick up after the big spike last Thursday, and now we are falling again, but there is one thing that is a little different to me about this pump which is that it seems to have been driven by smart money vs. a big short squeeze like we have been seeing a lot lately.https://www.tradingview.com/x/C1aUnU6g/You can see that shorts declined a bit on the $1,000 rise, but they didn’t REALLY start covering until after the price had already hit $8,000. There was also media coordination to go along with the pump. Do you think it is a coincidence that news broke that [the Rockefellers and George Soros had entered crypto](https://www.rt.com/business/423559-rockefellers-soros-rothschilds-cryptocurrency-investment/)? That was clearly planned. There is no way this information would be released unless the people involved would somehow benefit from it. My guess is that Soros, Rockefellers, etc. had been shorting Bitcoin and had been accumulating for some time now. Also there was a segment about Bitcoin that aired on PBS NewsHour on the same day. That program is partially funded by The Rockefeller Foundation. Also, all of the insane price predictions for 2018 came out around the same time.So now we have to try to figure out the motive. It is either that they want to kick off a new long-term rally or that they want a better short entry. I believe it is the latter since I do not see a ton of sustained buying volume, and Google trends are still on the decline despite the positive sentiment.One thing I have started doing is looking at an inverse Bitcoin chart to get another perspective:https://www.tradingview.com/x/nkguCGJ3/Everything is flipped here so the price falling would be bullish. Based on this I would say there is still a bit more downside (upside on real Bitcoin) before we continue the uptrend (downtrend on real Bitcoin), but nothing would surprise me.---Also, for fun I charted Parabolic Trav’s tweet count vs. the price of Bitcoin. Check it out on twitter:https://twitter.com/cryptocraig123/status/985631198717337605
1	1523894971	9	The inverse chart is fascinating. Shows your own internal bias at how you view each trend. And LOL @ ParabolicTrav
1	1523897060	1	We should short Bitcoin to the ground just to fuck them and make them rage quit. Then go long so hard making a new all time high.They're playing us all. Those fuckers.We regular traders don't have our own media companies to manipulate the markets and take money from the little man.
0	1523867810	8	We barted yesterday. And there was a tell-tale bulltrap forming right before 8450 got rejected!I think this is a healthy pull-back and I don’t anticipate too much downside. 7800 should hold, but time will tell.Looking to re-enter a hedge at 8200+. Since I closed my short from 8250 at 8022, I can stomach a move to 8500+ without me.If 7800 doesn’t hold, I think I’ll just short to stay sane
1	1523868293	4	I'll be surprised to see sub 8k. I say that with my inner bear looking over my shoulder and my bull side in a fetal position.
1	1523869806	2	Let's wait what happens @12 and @16 cest although i think it will go up slowly for the next 24/48 hrs until we hit the log resistance.

All his recent posts have really clickbaity titles and they're all just drawing comparisons to 2014.Not to mention he also runs a paid VIP group.Hows this guy any different to Suppoman?
1	1523879520	7	you don't know the great D4rkEnergY ?? He has come to show us the way of the COMET NAMED BITCOIN oh praised be his words and wisdom!! D4  loves you
1	1523879085	4	Possibly a sock puppet account used for PSYOPS (e.g. FUD / FOMO) Think about it, there is no way to see the actual list of followers on TV, meaning they can be just bot accounts to upvote this guy's posts.   Same goes for MagicPoopCannon. If there was an option to block posts on TV, I would have blocked these two accounts immediately. 
1	1523878636	2	Ah, so I wasn't the only one who thought his titles were a bit ridiculous lol. "*Scary BITCOIN-Comparison - 2014 and 2018! You Won't Believe it!!*" I guess it attracts clicks on Facebook from people with "*Professional crypto investor & trader since 2017*" in their job description.edit: to be fair, I still kinda liked that comparison, just that title lol.
1	1523881611	1	On quick look it's basically [2 expats](https://coinrunners.vip/meet-the-team/) who started a Korean crypto community with some Koreans on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQfb-EyVE0jpYzf2zyYEl5g/featured). It seems like they started in October 2017 so still pretty new (and only on Tradingview and Twitter since February 2018.) They are selling "VIP memberships" on their site CoinRunners with "*Ranked #1 Top Author*" as selling point.Overall, it does seem reasonable that they have a real following in Korea. But it seems strong marketing (clickbait titles, descriptions, etc.) to me too. Since I have only seen a few charts from them, I cannot really comment on the quality of that.
1	1523883733	1	I don't read his posts, but I've noticed more and more recently that every time I go to tradingview, it looks like those "Around The Web"/"Suggested For You" boxes that are on most websites all over the front page.

0	1523884427	9	Updated daily stoch RSI crossing chart:https://www.tradingview.com/x/Jd9segbz/We did have one fake out (bright green line) when it bounced a day later and then recovered before recrossing and going down more significantly, but that was after the week long run up from 6k.The chart says what I don't need to say, which is I would be cautious about setting up a long and expecting a continuation of the bull rebound up past 8400.edit (from another response):The overbought/oversold metrics on sRSI work very well *with* trend, so overbought indicators are not strong during bull markets, but conversely, an oversold crossover of daily SRSI was very good at predicting the bottom of a dip/start of a new rally during the bull run to 20k, though not 100%:https://www.tradingview.com/x/Sh8T2GFB/

The medium green dildo yesterday was like someone saying 'I can do this too boys' rather than Thursdays BGD which was like someone setting a new trading level to adhere to.I was up until 2am last night waiting for a dip and it hit at 3am local. Hit some orders on the way down and went a bit further but I'm not worried.The only thing that is popping up in my head right now is that I hope it's not a repeat of the DCB to 17k and 11.8k. Because it feels like it a little, if it is then 6k isn't off the cards. But it's a gamble I'm fine with taking (for now).

3	1523895173	1	Yes, yes: the “deal with it” rally! I distinctly remember /u/moral_agent’s charts with those pixelated sunglasses slapped onto the rally to $680 from underneath the descending log resistance line from ATH.

3	1523889659	2	You said it better than I would've, so hats off to you.  ^ This is exactly right.
2	1523887385	2	Before distribution every dip was bought up, so while it DID indicate local tops, they were quickly bought and new highs were formed within a week or two after.  So it would have been a good play to sell at/near tops and then rebuy if you play that game (I don't). 
1	1523886508	2	The higher low indicates "yes" to me.
2	1523892752	1	Well until now we´ve only made a lower high, no?Higher low remains to be seen.
3	1523892972	1	Agreed, higher low is not confirmed until 11 something.
1	1523886975	7	Hammer 🔨 time
1	1523886702	7	Specifically saying "this time is different" without any substance is silly. But...The drops are getting less and less significant and unless you're suggesting RSI *always* works as an indicator, the pattern will eventually break down, as all patterns do. So it could happen this time, not that this validates the people saying such.
2	1523887265	6	I mean, I figured the chart spoke for itself, but I guess I can translate to words if you need.* Post distribution (the large selloff after the ATH), the daily sRSI has been extremely accurate in predicting "tops" of each rally/bounce.  The current situation is setup with the sRSI well into the "overbought" range, indicating a reversal is coming in the not-too-distant future.  Note: sRIS does NOT predict price targets, only momentum on a daily scale. 
3	1523892605	1	The weekly RSI just crossed to the upside, what now? 
4	1523893091	1	the weekly is too long of a timeframe to be useful IMO and also it's stayed oversold and crossed over and back since Jan 8th
3	1523894304	1	I understood that all from the chart.Yes it has been an extremely accurate way of predicting tops of each rally/bounce since the ATH.Are you implying that this will now and forever more be correct each and every time?My point was that every pattern breaks down eventually. Dismissing those that say "this time is different" \(as I believe you were originally implying\) is equally as silly \(albeit with the odds in your favour\) as claiming that an indicator/pattern will always be correct in predicting a pump/correction/reversal.
4	1523895389	1	I'm implying the trend is true... until it isn't.  But really, if you're betting against something that has happened 5 or 6 times in a row, then you're essentially gambling.  Another way to put it - at this point in BTC's market cycle, that trend is extremely accurate.  I am watching for signs of prolonged accumulation, which would essentially be months of sideways.  At that point, the indicator will likely fail considerably.  But for the time being, this volatility cannot be sustained, which is essentially what the indicator is saying.
1	1523889164	4	This is a healthy retracement™
1	1523889154	1	But let's accurately give weight to the probability of tail events.
1	1523889586	1	Yep. This time the bottom has the Kardashian formation.
0	1523858680	12	Seems very Bearish in here again. Am I the only one seeing a nice bull flag forming on the 4 hour that has managed to stay in the channel so far?Edit. Also, wouldn't this constitute a good risk/reward trade. Tight stops just below the channel which coincides with 8k. Then see if it manages to stay within the channel as it could move to the top of the channel or resistance at 8.5k.
1	1523858860	2	I mean if it drops much more we'll seem to have broken the flag boundary. And it's an odd bull flag since it's slanting up.
2	1523860983	3	Slanting up makes it a bear flag, though it's within a very slight upward trend which makes it ... nothing, basically. This is noise within a dying, very large bull pennant that extends back to December. It could drop here, back to the triangle support, or it could pop through.

However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.

Even in October 2015, conspiracy theorists were working overtime to concoct rich stories of manipulation to explain away perfectly natural market movements.I don't have context for these two shots, but my favorite part is that they seem to be by the same author (judging by the annotation style) and that that same author has two wildly different and equally implausible manipulation narratives for the same price action.The focus of this exhibit is the manipulation angle, of course...but you have some familiar chart elements as well (bart-like pattern and dump-followed-by-surprise-pump on the 22nd).Side note: "just a trap before selling picks up" turned out to be an amazingly good time to buy.

0	1523852387	3	"Bart" is only a term that got coined in the past month because while spikes are nothing new to BTC, the spike -> flat -> spike back down have only started happening en masse recently, March 26th being the first day when several happened in a row. Now they are growing in scale.Why is this happening? Is this a result of the mainstream being mostly exited? Because while big powerful candles could happen before, there was much more of a flow to them that I am guessing was a function of the non-trader/non-crypto obsessed market making buys and sells that when along with FUD or FOMO. Any other theories? Whales holding a larger percentage of coins and so their pumps and dumps are even more pronounced?

0	1523878421	8	Given the severe drop from $8.4k to $8.1k, the fact that we haven't dropped below $8.0k with conviction strikes me as surprising. Super low volume, yet the market hasn't been scared into action by such an aggressive drop.I'm in a 'expect more pain' mindset \(not trading\) and just holding. I say as much, because I absolutely expected a significant retrace if we lost any momentum, and that sharp of a drop feels like it should've triggered it. Just a tad confused really. Just #bitcointhings I suppose.
1	1523879846	13	I'm not surprised at all. The alts will tell you where this market is going. They started recovering first and haven't been scared on these latest drops. You can see it in the price action. The dumps don't have follow through. Just like all the bears said on the way down DCB "The bounces don't have any follow through", this is now true of the dumps. Dead Cat Dump? 
2	1523880379	7	Well that would be one reasonable answer to why the market didn't dump, that the overall market sentiment has shifted. My issue with this is the continuous exceptionally low daily volumes. *Dead Cat Dump* is a great name, but does conjure up a pretty grim image in the mind.
1	1523879356	11	Bears were hoping on sub-6k to accumulate, but because of the high volume breakout and the strong bottom we made they are forced to accumulate here. So we will probably consolidate in this price range for a few more days until we have enough strength to break through the 1d cloud. This is the time to scalp or sit on your hands.
2	1523879422	2	I agree sir
2	1523879636	2	If I was a bear in this market, I'd have shorted from $8300\+ and expected a dump to mid 7s. I do see people closing their shorts now, rather \(IMO\) preemptively as I would and continue to expect a retrace to mid/upper 7s.Why has the market essentially ignored a nigh on instantaneous $350 dump? Bears should see this as great news. Bulls should've been shook. But nothing. It's like we were never at $8.4k. 
3	1523880222	3	Because it was instantaneous, if it took 1 day to drop that it might have more credibility, this case was a huge market sell and could be a bear trap. Traders are becoming numb to this type of market manipulation with no follow through.
3	1523882878	3	Both smart "bears" and "bulls" both shorted at $8300+.
3	1523881381	2	Don't think you're wrong with your targets. Just a bit impatient. Lots of accumulation is going on in this range so the drops are not going to be fast
4	1523882367	1	True, finally happening now though.
3	1523881632	1	This isn't like January. A lot of people took advantage of the discounted prices and are still up 20 percent or more even after this small obviously manufactured dump. Price would have to go sub-6K for people to even begin to worry, and it's not going there.
4	1523882483	2	One could argue the same for the "obviously manufactured" pump that got us here..... Price would have to go above 9k for bears to begin to worry. 
2	1523881499	0	You mean bulls are now forced to accumulate at 8k, which they are reluctant to. Nice entry for bears at 8.3-8.4.
1	1523879248	6	> Just a tad confused really.Every honest Bitcoin trader.
2	1523879733	2	Hah! I very much like to admit when I have no idea what is happening. I think human behavior/market sentiment drives BTC mostly, and I'm dead confused that a \~$350 drop didn't cause the market to dump harder *as it has literally been doing for months now*. So I'm just a tad confused ;\)
0	1523900323	4	Breaking upwards...interesting.
1	1523900515	2	For now anyway. It'll be interesting if sentiment has changed in such a way that a fairly continuous rise is self fulfilling. If everyone thinks the bear market is over dip buyers could sustain a rise up. Volume be damned.
1	1523900474	1	Doesn't seem too strong to me (edit: may have spoken too soon) but have to let it play out obviously. Considering adding to my short position (8.3) in case this is the last time we're over 8k for the next few days but that might just be asking for a kick in the teeth. 
0	1523865392	6	Personally think further down is the direction in the short term. Then we'll need to see whether a higher low plays out before creeping back up.We've had an EMA cross and a MACD cross to the downside on the hourly, looks like a MACD cross to the downside is playing out on the 4 hourly, and RSI is still close to 60 with more room to go down. On the daily, yesterday's gains are almost wiped out by this morning's drop.Also concerned by a potential double top at 8400/8800 similar to the 11.8/11.5 double top earlier last month that would make me pause to open a long here unless scalping.Disclaimer: I have no open position having closed a short from 8250 and using Bitmex charts. Will try to sit out now until this pushes past 8400 or drops below 7800 with conviction.
0	1523901646	6	This time if we get to 8400, I think we will pass it fairly easily. To me, it certainly looks like race to 10K.I have seen the last BGD live (from 8100 to 8400), within 4-5 minutes the whale (single institution) bought around 3k-4k coins. I am sure whoever that institution is, has already done it's research. Otherwise, who would buy that much of coins to be sold at loss later. The price is not going down, this is what my analytics suggest me.I think most people are shorting here, they might get trapped. Trade safe!
1	1523901988	2	um. As far as i can see, leverage is frozen right now. No one dares to move. Wise choice.
2	1523902407	0	I see two group of traders here.1. Those who are waiting for the price to rise so that they can open shorts; and;2. The new comers who are attracted to the market again due to the recent rise in price (or even those who are just sitting on the sidelines waiting for clear indications). This group of people have greater buying power. I can see this group over powering the first one.
3	1523903816	1	I am number 2. Relative to the buying power in the last 3 months, 1k of fiat i would say it's greater buying power.
0	1523858657	5	Anybody thinks this is a good safe point to go long? We have already touched 8k twice now so may start going back up?
1	1523858747	3	Personally i believe its going to breakdown even more
1	1523861680	3	I would think so, just buy in half so if it does run up you will not regret it. If it drop lower then dca
1	1523859314	2	nobody frikkin knows, its a coin toss really.if i were you i would open an equally sized short and long here.the trend is still downwards, but could see a random ass green candle taking us upto 9k even.so this way, your long doubles in size if on medium levg. and you can use this to add to your short when we lose steam.on the flip side, if it were to dump here you can always close your long if we go below 7.6k,
2	1523861629	1	Thanks. Interesting answer. Although I understand the benefits of opening both long and short, I am not sure I can be disciplined enough to use it properly. Knowing myself, chances are I’ll start to panic and close one when it starts moving opposite direction only to find it quickly changing course and screwing up the other position as well..!!
0	1523886624	7	I been noticing alts are not bleeding as much this time when BTC drops..Is the sentiment changing?
1	1523889033	9	I keep a close eye on alts, since it's the only trading method I use to accumulate more bitcoins. The alts I have paid attention to bottomed out in SAT value after the second drop in the $6600 range. Once BTC started chopping in the $6600-$7100 range, it started regaining most of the SATs that it lost in March/April and those lows have become strong supports even when BTC is mooning or dumping (which previously used to be dumping grounds for alts) Also many of the alts, at least on binance, have more 24hr BTC volume than GDAX. My thinking is, just how I was in 2014~ holding BTC, many alt holders, especially those who got in Dec/Jan near ATH are not selling since they are down so much. If you visit the alt sub or /cryptocurrency you will see a lot of "would rather watch it go to zero than sell now" comments. Now that alts have proven in the last couple weeks to outpace BTC in regaining some value, I think many alt holders are gaining confidence and simply are not willing to sell.I don't see the strong alts hitting lower lows unless BTC dips below $7200 which many, including myself, would invalidate this last BGD pump. 
1	1523886805	5	they bleed more or less the same in average. the BTC dominance was 24 hours ago 42,23 and is now 42,21 according to coinmarketcap
1	1523886658	2	I'm actually gaining sats from the BTC drop.  Certainly indicates people aren't dropping their alts immediately now.
2	1523887387	3	yea I've noticed that as well...I think they will bleed again if BTC breaks the log resistance around 8.8 
2	1523887226	3	After a while people just say 'fuck it, I'll ride this to 0".
1	1523888266	3	Market sentiment towards Bitcoin has changed. People want moonshots, bitcoin price (and history) psychologically is against moonshot (near term 10X gains). Therefore they go for alts. Also as I've said here before, Alts are more appealing (and welcoming) to new investors. Also Alts have faces, those who can be held responsible (and nagged to). BTC has none, and most normies find that scary. Idealism aside, I find it scary what happens to the market when the coins in the satoshi wallets moves. 
0	1523854363	9	Short from 8340 - what's a good place for a stop? 8.25? 8.3? 8.4? I'm not thinking of resistance/support lines. Rather, my main concern, as someone pointed out in the last daily, is that this move could play out like the Bart right before the huge green $1k candle. In which case I'd want to catch it on the way back up. 
1	1523856031	2	i opened a short at 8.25 currently got stops at 8.2, tbh might close it nowish if it struggles to get under 8k ill just take this small scalp
2	1523856402	5	8K is gonna break. You really think we’ll never see sub 8K BTC again?
3	1523856633	1	hell no, problem is im impatient and when i finally get to the green in my trades i look to close quickly especially with all the "barts" happening lately, tbh my position is just a bit too big for me to be comfortable unless it gets to sub 8k, ima give it like another 1-2 hours XDEdit: its fucked me recently because i closed a long a bit too early right before the huge 10% spike happened so im aware of the possible profit im missing out on by constantly closing quickly, its just nerve-wrecking because their is no constant trend it feels like
4	1523859342	2	noob here but isn't it better to be making many small profits where you're more certain, rather than holding out for larger profits in an area you're less certain?
1	1523855683	3	Not sure why you're getting downvoted...the post is on-topic, and while the fear may be unfounded, "good place for a stop" is a reasonable question.
1	1523860642	1	If you are too greedy with the stops in that scenario you will have a lot of slippage. I would put it in 8100 . Not because Im bullish, but because you may be forced to settle much higher in that case. Look at how big the wick is in the big green one.
1	1523871553	1	8.6
1	1523855983	1	No need to worry about a stop, this shit is gonna dump hard. 
2	1523856149	2	What gives you that impression? Are you going off the macro trend? Looks like a double top around 8.4/8.8 on the daily similar to the 11.5/11.8 double top earlier. We've just had an EMA cross to the downside too.
3	1523856539	2	100% macro. This "runnup" is 100% noise. Yep, we'll slowly step down after this double top. 
4	1523856812	1	Thanks, much appreciated. I just closed my short from 8250. Would rather take profits as we go down. If we drop back below 7800 with conviction, I'll re-open.
0	1523898418	6	I dunno guys, this rise is looking like a duplication of the 7300 to 9000 rise. Both have now had 25%ish rises predicated partially on mass short liquidations, then roughly 7-8% drops. Both times we also had a large short FOMO as we approached a symbolic level (7k vs 6k). If we double top here just like last time, I am convinced that this whole pattern is merely just the whales liquidating shorts before commencing downward.
1	1523899186	1	On the bull case, you could liken it to the first 11.8k top - there we fell off at the linear ATH resistance level. This time we fell off at a log support-turned-resistance. If we can fall down to 7.2-7.5k and then climb back over the next week, that resistance will cross with the ATH resistance and could set up an attempt at the log ATH resistance at 8.4k similar to the second 11.8k attempt where we failed originally. Maybe the situation would be different enough on that attempt to where we break through then.Or this was all just a throwback to confirm the log support we broke initially at around 7.7k as new resistance and we continue lower.
1	1523901237	1	* How does a double top point to liquidating shorts? IMO, it is liquidating longs & commencing shorts.
2	1523902932	1	The initial rise from $6,800 to $8,400 is where shorts were liquidated. If the market does make another failed attempt at $8,400 and confirms a double top by falling below $7,800 then that will convince him that this whole move was orchestrated by whales to shake out shorts.

0	1523876554	2	Guys, what is the difference between no-position, and 1x long leverage on BitMex?
1	1523877509	12	This is the nomenclature I assume for this subno position = HODLing BTC, i.e. no position open on Mex. The value of your portfolio in BTC is flat.flat/hedge = in Fiat (sold), equivalent to 1x short on BitMex with the whole value of your trading stack. The value of your portfolio in USD is flat.short = you have an open short position. This could less than the notional value of your trading stack, in which case you are 1x long the difference between portfolio and position size. In any case, you stand to lose BTC if the price were to go uplong = Basically, more than 1x long. If the price were to go down, you would lose BTC
1	1523877108	4	1x is, in reality, 2x. Your underlying btc + equal amount of borrowed btc.
2	1523877442	1	you don't borrow btc on futures, but the rest of your argument is right
1	1523877371	0	If you go 1x long then you are in effect borrowing fiat to buy coin. So if the price of a coin goes up or down your margin will adjust accordingly. Leverage only affects the amount of margin required and the liquidation price.

0	1523901213	2	If 6k is was indeed the true bottom, would that have been the first double bottom in bitcoins history? 
1	1523901382	8	This is not the first time I've read someone insinuating that Bitcoin always makes V bottoms.While I can't remember a significant double bottom in recent memory, the bounce off of ~$200 was a triple bottom.
2	1523903162	2	we sort of double bottomed at 3k during China FUD. It went 3k to 4.2k back to 3.5k and then bounced off 3.5k convincingly 
2	1523903006	1	That's an OG reference
3	1523903560	1	It wasn't even that long ago! The market was trading in the $200 to $300 range about 2.5 years ago. I have spices in my cabinet older than that. 
4	1523904048	1	You cook, too? oo la la, the whole package! :Pedit: my brother was acquiring at that time. Mentioned it a couple times, but I never dove in. Oh well.
2	1523903556	1	$160 was a double bottom in 2015 ... but only on Bitfinex as far as I know. First one happened in January when I bought my first Bitcoin. And the second one happened in July. It went over $300 twice in between but hung around $230 for most of that time. By August, it was back to $500. 
3	1523903676	1	I generally view that entire movement as a triple bottom at ~$200. The drops to $160 were outliers and the market only traded below $200 on any one occasion for a few hours. Maybe only a few minutes (it's been awhile and my memory is hazy).
4	1523903825	1	Below $200 about a day the first time. I guess I got lucky buying my first bitcoin on that day... about January 2nd or 3rd. You're right it did not stay below $200 long the second time. https://i.imgur.com/err0v4I.jpg
0	1523851800	4	Good Morning Traders!After closing my long yesterday (quite early during the day with good gains), I sat on the sidelines as the price swinged around 8300.I was tempted a lot to go either short, or long, long at that time however didn't made any sense due to huge resistance around 8400 -8500 region (order book is a great tool at times if you know how to analyze it).So what did I do? I placed a buy order at 8000 and went to sleep peacefully knowing that if the price gets low, some big player will hit 8000, fill my order and the price will move back up. That is exactly what happened.I am now riding a long from 8000, not sure until when I will ride it. :) 
1	1523852253	1	You lucky bugger.
0	1523885758	4	Funny thing is, if this goes below 7.7k, there's no covering shorts to give it some bounce since all shorters were liquidated during our pump
0	1523889966	8	Monster hidden bullish divs all over the place. Bears need to smackdown now or see you at 9k.
1	1523891159	11	There's an undeniable hidden bullish div on the 1w, but other than that I don't see any hidden bullish divergence on lower timeframes. 1w RSI fell to around 40 during the drop to $6,400 but only got down to around 44 during the drop to $6,000 back in February.EDIT: There is definitely standard bullish divergence on lower timeframes though. The dump from $8,400 to $8,000 dropped RSI lower on the 15m and 30m than the drop from $8,000 to $7,900 did. Lower lows on price but higher lows on RSI.
2	1523892058	3	Worth mentioning the 15 min bull div in your edit may already be playing out/have played out, though. 
3	1523892230	5	Ya, divergence on the 15m or 30m isn't likely to result in a massive reversal. 
4	1523893652	1	Seems like we're knocking on 8k's door but no one's answering right now, might be people/bots trading this bull div?
5	1523893975	6	I wouldn't read too much into it either way.Buyers are cautious of buying above $8,000 because of the rejection from $8,500.Sellers are cautious of selling below $8,000 because of the previous bounce off of $7,800 that catapulted the market to $8,500. One side will concede at some point today and we'll either see a strong push to $8,200 before there's another "decision point" on the part of buyers/sellers or the market will drop below $7,800 and we'll have a similar standoff at $7,500. 
6	1523894377	1	I originally opened my short position at 8120. I added last night at 8350, but not heavily. It pulled by CA up to 8160. My position still wasn't the size I wanted, and we're in agreement that it should move decisively one way or another. I'm obviously expecting down, as we haven't tested support on anything between 6900 and 7600 since the big green candle. I went ahead and added to the position size I wanted (50% increase) at 7995 just now. CA now 8100, and setting breakeven stops this time. 
7	1523899386	1	I'm deciding about each side of 8k like this. Is it a bear market or a bull one. Once I decided that (currently bull) I trade accordingly.
2	1523892004	2	https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZIJSs1va/Maybe he's talking about this? Not confirmed yet though
2	1523895115	1	Might be talking about this? Significant divergence on the 1 Hour MACD.https://www.tradingview.com/x/77cGt9eM/
1	1523890239	8	Care to show a chart?
2	1523890768	2	I think he's talking about the decreasing RSI during the ascending wedge we just broke down out of. You can see it relatively clearly on the hourly. I think the break down indicates that it has already played out, though.
3	1523891777	7	What you are describing would be considered bearish divergence though. Price making higher highs but RSI making lower highs. When looking for divergence, you're looking for the strength of the current trend to diverge from the movement of the current trend. Hidden divergence is generally seen when the market is temporarily moving against an overarching trend. We've seen hidden bearish divergence, for example, during pretty much all of the previous dead cat bounces. You'd want to be looking for hidden bullish divergence during the decline we're currently seeing. Not during the upward movement that preceded the decline.  
4	1523892575	3	Thanks, that makes a lot of sense. I actually couldn't imagine what OP was talking about so just trying to take a stab, even if wrong. This is quite a helpful summary -- appreciate it.
1	1523890239	3	My bear is gentle and takes its time.
1	1523890540	1	Where do you see this?

1	1523884223	3	With this being the 3 day chart, wouldn't this just be leading on from the recent massive green dildo and subsequent pump?Surely the 1, 4 and 6 hour time frames are more appropriate to pay attention to at the moment, which have all crossed to the downside?
2	1523884891	1	If you look at 3 day chart you can see MACD would flip either way but few days later. Smaller TF looks as they do... They can change fast also. I think this might test 7800$ then hard bounce based on that 3 day (and daily - MA cross) setup.

1	1523889879	14	The first part of your statement completely contradicts the second one, I'm lost.
2	1523891107	0	I'm saying it's a good idea to be buying incrementally while we drop lower because this is just a minor retracement, BTC ran up several days. The daily chart has it's higher high, but it also needs a higher low for the trend to shift (to an uptrend). That's very likely to happen. The real test is in a couple of days. If there is no momentum and it fails to produce a new higher high, chances are it's going to 6.5k again. 
0	1523892149	4	Just wondering since tomorrow the 17th is the final date to file your taxes if we should be expecting a bump in the price. It seems that is the sentiment going around. Just having an open discussion to gather thoughts on this. Edit: I do think the end of tax season will have a significant effect on prices. My 2 cents
1	1523892404	29	It will be as significant as the Chinese New Year and the Wall Street Bonuses 
1	1523894796	7	The average tax refund for Americans is between $2,500 and $3,000, [depending on where in the US they reside](http://www.businessinsider.com/tax-refund-average-by-state-2018-1).According to bitcoin.com, [around 5% of Americans have invested in Bitcoin](https://news.bitcoin.com/survey-60-of-americans-have-heard-of-bitcoin-5-own/).So, assuming the 5% of Americans already invested were to roll 100% of their tax return into bitcoin (very doubtful), that's about $40,500,000,000 that could hit the bitcoin market. That amount of fiat could purchase 5,062,500 btc instantly. A few problems with this math:1. Many (perhaps most) Americans have already filed their taxes and received their refund. So potential buying pressure could be at the tail-end rather than the beginning stages.2. People have lots of things to use their refund on, and traditionally allocate very little of it for investing. While the number of folks investing/saving is higher than you'd expect, [it's still less than 50%](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/20/heres-what-americans-do-with-their-tax-refunds.html).3. Bitcoin has been in the news lately, but not in the "best investment ever, buy all the btc!" sense. It's mostly been negative press focused on the volatility and rapid decline from $20,000. Anecdotally, I get a lot more, "damn, dude, bitcoin is really tanking huh. Do you regret investing in it?" than I do, "holy shit, I can buy btc for $8,000? What a bargain, time to invest!"
2	1523894935	5	Also, those that already invest/trade heavily in BTC may not be getting a refund at all if they made any moves during the Nov/Dec run. In fact, many are finding out they need to sell some of their holdings to pay their taxes.I expect this to be nearly a wash in market impact. 
2	1523896452	2	I seriously doubt that most Americans have received their tax refunds yet. Most people are probably like me (lazy as fuck and like to procrastinate) and are probably waiting till the last minute to file. I filed a couple days ago, and I definitely know where some of that money is going in the next couple weeks. 
3	1523897925	2	https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everyone-files-their-taxes-at-the-last-minute/about 1/7th of Americans wait until the last week
2	1523896081	2	> According to bitcoin.comlol.  There is your problem right there.  
2	1523896155	1	Not all Americans get tax returns...
3	1523896452	5	good point. I'm not going to revisit the math though. The point of my post was basically that, while a substantial amount of money could potentially hit the btc market due to tax returns, it's either already been invested, or it never will be invested.In either case, it shouldn't have a significant impact on current price.
4	1523899475	2	It just made me feel excluded. I get so jelous of the tax return people. :( Then again I am working for myself, so that's a plus. I wonder how many people pay vs don't pay.
5	1523903507	1	Don't feel excluded. Tax returns just mean you paid too much in the first place. There is an opportunity cost to not having that money in hand until it is returned.
3	1523897327	3	I wish I was getting a refund.  But, if you can project your income you shouldn't get a refund.  Every year it seems I have to pay because of a single, un-forecasted event.  This year I write the check happily.  Life is still pretty good.
1	1523892808	14	Most people have paid taxes by now
2	1523897393	1	I think most people have filed.  The people that pay, will pay tomorrow.  At least they should.  I started moving everything last week so it will show up in time for me to file.
1	1523893018	3	https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-rally-tax-day-dont-bet-farm/As always, take whatever those shitbags write with a pinch of salt though.
2	1523893059	5	As always 😊
1	1523894725	2	I don't think it will have much of an effect based of previous years. Did a quick check on the significance of US Tax day on the overall market cap since 2014 and there wasn't much. Even though this isnt the best indicator to draw conclusions from its still worth looking over.https://imgur.com/a/nxYqj

0	1523877575	1	Hey all. I know the below theory have been posted by a few people in the last few weeks. But I’m gonna post my own take on this, just for added insights.I’ve studied the 2014 bubble a bit, and read up on two seemingly important concepts:1. Institutional/whale order flow2. Wyckoff market cycleDisclaimer; After reading up on the above topics, I do admit that there might be a degree of both “wanting to fit the pattern on the chart” and “hoping the bottom is in”. That said, I do believe there’s some merit to the below ideas.Not gonna cover the topics above in detail, but I finally understand what “stop hunting” _really_ is, and how to potentially trade them knowing how institutions/whales would tackle this market with low liquidity. But here are two decent resources to start with:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffxSdX48VI- https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/070715/making-money-wyckoff-way.aspWyckoff’s first rule is; the market never behave in the same way twice but rather unfold through similar pattern of different sizes, extensions etc. Keeping that in mind when comparing the 2014 below will be important, because time scales and extensions in my comparison are indeed not the same, but rather _similar_.When getting into the actual Wyckoff market cycle, you’ll notice it fits well with the institutional order flow pattern. Stop hunting and liquidity zones is the name of the game! I would highly recommend reading up on it.Part over-simplified version of the Wyckoff cycle is; accumulation (with failed sell-offs) -> breakout -> throwback (into accumulation channel) -> re-accumulation -> correction. The cycle isn’t necessarily a reversal or continuation pattern, it’s just a cycle that keep on happening on larger time frames from time to time.2014 - looking at the 2 day chart, I’ve mapped out important points in the decline, as well as the Wyckoff cycle that marked the reversal of the trend: https://www.tradingview.com/x/XsgB6sEs/2018 - similar pattern can be seen for this decline, but on the 6 hour chart instead. And here I want to point out the similarity to the Wyckoff market cycle that _potentially_ can mark a reversal of the trend: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Y9tqmDwe/And one last note; a Wyckoff cycle can emerge in a trend continuation as well, as it did during Oct-Dec 2017: https://www.tradingview.com/x/GVo5l3Go/---As for the current market, considering all of the above, I would expect a throwback into the accumulation channel soon. Perhaps testing $7250-7400 before reversing into new local high through re-accumulation and then a final leg up where the cycle ends with a correction.
0	1523884874	-1	Has anyone done real research into whether or not weather patterns have any effect on BTC price movement?Because it's snowing over here, and the BTC price is moving down. Would really like to get involved with this research if it's honestly being conducted.
1	1523885506	12	This might be news to you but the weather is not the same everywhere.
2	1523885572	4	Well, TIL. Thanks, man :)
2	1523886034	2	How does global warming effect the price then?
3	1523886401	2	Global warming went 25x short at 8450.
1	1523885022	5	I highly doubt it.  Maybe the winter weather and the lack of other stuff to do pushed some of the new retail investment last November/December, but even that likely has minimal impact on the market.

1	1523883517	3	Bitfinex bearwhale is leading. 20 mins ago 1 min candle with 1k BTC volume to $7905. Just like the first few dumps from 8.3k. Decent market sells while triggering stops.
2	1523887549	2	No it was the stop market orders activating. Mine (and others I guess) stop short was set at 7990. As soon as the price reached that it instantly dropped because of the market sells. My order got filled at 7960.
3	1523887832	2	But that's what I said? :p > Decent market sells while triggering stops.Whale is still selling like 100-500 BTC that triggers stops (let's say 500-1k BTC) making it go even lower all in same few seconds. Potentially whale even fills the stops with his buy orders.
2	1523883835	1	Legit, checked by the minute and they both fell at 14:38 CEST but finex probably lead it. Just some lag from kraken maybe? Never noticed before /s...

1	1523883449	-1	What is a Whale? A whale is not as small as us. Most whales are bigger than a bus! A whale is not like a fish in the sea. A whale breathes air like you and me. A whale can't walk upon the ground. A whale must swim to get around. A whale is a mammal just like me. But its home is in the deep blue sea.We just love to talk about whales affecting everything. All the while knowing there's nothing we can do but follow along. Yet we still feel compelled to complain about it as if it will make a difference.
1	1523884004	1	Why would a whale deaccumulate *after* crashing the price with market sells? 
2	1523884155	1	he can do both, open limit sells and wait till gets filled. when no further growth, dump coins, wait till limit sells get filled... and so on.
0	1523884645	0	I'm ecstatic about being back in the 7k range after bungling most of my trades in the past week. After learning how Bitmex worked I realized that if I had known about margin trading a few weeks ago I could've opened a very low leverage long in the 6k range with a low enough liquidation point that I wouldn't have had to worry about it too much (although maybe that's just hindsight, I guess I couldn't have been sure the bottom was in).But now that I've lost a chunk of my stack I wonder if a low leverage long in the 7k range with what I've got left will be foolproof enough - maybe I'm just spooked from trading but it makes me realize nothing is impossible with regards to the 5-6k range. I'll be looking for strong support at 7.2 as many here have suggested. Though as far as bullishness goes it would probably look better if we didn't go below 7.5.I'm hoping this recent pump has made people realize that just because the market crashed investors didn't abandon hope, they've just been accumulating, which means anything over 6.5k should be fiercely protected at this point.
1	1523884806	10	> After learning how Bitmex worked I realized that if I had known about margin trading a few weeks ago I could've this is the line of thought combined with 20/20 hindsight that has crushed many stacks even harder...be careful
2	1523885249	2	some people must learn by playing with fire
2	1523885735	2	Bitmex works? could have fooled me! The most overloaded platform in bitcoin right now. So much I have to really wonder if it's overloaded or on purpose.
2	1523885469	1	:)You're right. At the very least I'm playing it much safer now
1	1523885256	1	How did you lose a chunk of yiur stack? Did you short?
2	1523885519	1	Was short at 6.9 and in disbelief after the BGD, figured no one would take the bait, and shorted again. 
0	1523889073	-11	I'm still of the opinion that we are on the verge of the big breakout and it is confirmed. I won't tell my sources (its odors stinks) but that it is what it is for me.I'm putting my money where my fu'ing mouth is. I increased my crypto portfolio by 60% (crypto value). The USD value continued to plummet as I kept buying.I'll be keeping a vigilant eye these few days but I think we are not very far from the breakout. I already exhausted my financing options so i can't buy more even though i think the price is a steal.tldr: we are going higher. just wait it out. it is going to be a bit painful but it is happening.
1	1523889443	11	Why painful? What's informing your sources, i.e. TA, foreknowledge of institutional investment etc.?
1	1523889425	1	Any idea how soon then?
0	1523877463	0	To me the past few hours just look like bulls and bears are protecting their longs/shorts
1	1523879729	3	What do you mean by that? like what would that scenario look like on a graph?
2	1523883970	1	Yeah I should have been clearer. The graph looks very "spiky"..Any direction, up or down is rejected almost immediately. As soon as it seems to be going down, lots of buys. As soon as it seems to be going up, massive sells. But only until it's back in the the 8k region.Of course as I'm writing the sell pressure has increased and it's dropping^^

0	1523884800	-14	What has changed from 6.8 to 8.4? Did more merchants begin adopting Bitcoin? Did Bitcoin find some use outside of gambling and hodling to get rich? The answer is no. Bitcoin is as useful today as it was last night before the dump as it was at 6.4 2 weeks ago as it was at 150 during the dog days of 2014. Not very useful at all. As long as the fundamentals for Bitcoin are piss-poor all traders should adopt a bearish bias in their trading, most especially after a clear bubble burst. 
1	1523885399	8	>  Bitcoin is as useful today as ..  it was at 150 during the dog days of 2014.> As long as the fundamentals for Bitcoin are piss-poor all traders should adopt a bearish bias in their tradingWith this logic you should have been bearish for whole of 2017. I doubt that would have worked out well.
1	1523885679	6	So, per your comment history. You bought 19K and then panic sold it at $6.4K, Your attempts to drive this lower are futile. Just rebuy $19K
1	1523885468	6	> What has changed from 6.8 to 8.4?More people are buying and trading alts. Most alts are traded against Bitcoin. More volume in alts = more liquidity needed from Bitcoin. More liquidity needed = price goes up. It's not complicated. > As long as the fundamentals for Bitcoin are piss-poor all traders should adopt a bearish bias in their tradingYou must have had a very profitable 2017 with this line of thinking.

They had to wait until the counter opened before they could send, were then charged an extortionate fee to send it, and then they will have to wait days for it to reach the other person. This was for 3 different people in the space of 5 minutes that I was in there.Crypto has the potential to eradicate this and many other backwards situations that exist in the world. Yes, it's not there yet but it soon will be.

3	1523887619	1	Even as it stands it would be better than using WU, and it will only get better. 
1	1523885153	3	> What has changed from 6.8 to 8.4? Did more merchants begin adopting Bitcoin? Did Bitcoin find some use outside of gambling and hodling to get rich?That didn't change from $500 to $20,000 to $8000 either....or actually less merchants are accepting Bitcoin now.But actually Bitcoin and crypto is used for more than or trading...not much more, but more.However, 100% agree with your basic premise.
1	1523885456	3	you know that there are other books than "The intelligent investor" about markets those days right ?
1	1523887406	3	Looks like someone bought the top
2	1523888533	1	don't think that was a serious post.
1	1523885180	9	How is Bitcoin not very useful?Where I come from, I can walk up to any ATM and deposit BTC there for cash. I can trade it for any shitcoinI can cross a border with vast amount of fundsI can send my mom 10k to fix up the roof in 60minutes. She can sell on Kraken and withdraw to her bank account if she wants.Not to mention when I gotta pay my homies for something we did. IBAN? SEPA payments... lolMore like GDAX or Mycellium
2	1523885305	1	So much this, the use/value of bitcoin is lost on many privileged first world people. 
1	1523884945	3	that being said, its fundamentals are actually stronger than when it was 20k, give or take ( : 
2	1523885169	-2	The lightning network beta? 
3	1523885626	3	segwit is FAR more adopted, including big exchanges, transaction times are much shorter and cheaper at the same time, LN is growing, yes and it generally points in the direction that even when (if?) BTC becomes much more adopted, it won't have the scaling issues we saw (which were combined with spam attacks at the time) ( : 
1	1523885241	2	sure if you view of fundamentals is shallow and one dimensional.
2	1523885593	2	He's selling his short as that comment is too over the top. Plus things are changing weekly if he bothered visiting r/bitcoin.
0	1523901713	-4	We are still bouncing around in a giant bull pennant on the 4h and 1 day( looks a little crappy on the 1 day ). This morning, we got rejected off the bottom of the pennant around 7885. If it were to play out where we reach the top of the pennant we would be looking at a target around the price of - 8360-. If rejected, we could be bouncing in the 8000-8300 range until the 20th of April where we would look for a breakout or breakdown of the pennant. 
1	1523902420	9	Not really. It broke down quite definitively this morning:https://imgur.com/a/eLKpAEDIT: If you want to be extremely generous, then this morning's dump is producing an [ascending triangle](https://imgur.com/a/It5IZ). But that requires one to pretty much ignore 90% of the market movement since April 12th. 
2	1523903275	4	>Not really. It broke down quite definitively this morning:\#Murdered by charts
2	1523903561	1	New to charting, I’m seeing something different. Thanks for the clarification 
3	1523903828	1	That's not to say that the market won't take that breakdown and turn it into a more clearly defined, longer term pattern. Something [like this](https://imgur.com/a/dFqGF) is quite possible over the course of the next few days to weeks.
0	1523903117	-4	Someone from Malaysia contacted me through LinkedIn asking whether I could sell 20,000 BTC or any other amount to a Chinese directly. Any ideas on that?
1	1523903505	1	Probably trying to unload stolen BTC. Obviously stay the hell away.
2	1523904031	2	Lmao why’s he getting downvoted? Stay away!
1	1523904109	1	probably a scam? do you have 20,000 btc?
0	1523864441	-11	idk if i am right or wrong but looks like we might hit around $7,600 then head up again?
1	1523866621	17	Idk too man it seems like the price is either going up or going down
0	1523852355	-5	[removed]
1	1523852878	4	Strong TA right here. Going all in
2	1523853577	1	[Please](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/005/574/takemymoney.jpg) :D
1	1523853492	3	8500 looks really difficult, unless lots of new buyers hop in.
0	1523869123	-7	I find incredible how the number of shorts and longs is flatlining low since the big short squeeze, if even traders are deserting the place after millenials left, that's really depressing.
1	1523869450	11	Millenial checking in
1	1523870213	8	Are you at the gates counting who had left and who is still in, and their ages?
