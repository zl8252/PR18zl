0	1523896320	18	I work in mainstream finance, and was often astounded at the sheer stupidity of some of the individuals working in the industry.    But man, if the crypto field isn't way worse. 
1	1523897263	6	Crypto is kinda better because everyone in this industry know's they're an idiot.
2	1523898208	1	Yeah, not so sure that is true though . . . 
3	1523899440	2	Well I know I am.Can't speak for others. 
0	1523890940	10	There are also lots of bearish preditctions and they are all downvoted. Nobody knows what the price will be. Currently its not looking good with such low volumes, seems like nobody is interested in bitcoin.
1	1523893156	2	There's a sucker born every minute, but we need a few year's worth of suckers to pull off a moonshot.
2	1523897276	2	Better to be an early sucker than the last sucker to the party.
1	1523902139	0	Because Bitcoin's fees skyrocket with any real use - why would people be interested in a useless currency? Bitcoin's uselessness stains the whole market.
2	1523902333	1	Because unlike every other cryptocurrency it has a solid track record of security, sensorship resistance and immutability which is the whole point of cryptocurrencies if you missed that. Who am I kidding, you are a retarded sockpuppet of course you missed that. 
3	1523902611	1	What's the point of a currency that can't be used as a currency?There fucking isn't one, and thus the points you mention amount to fucking nothing. Numerous others can do all the things BTC can, while also being **useful.**
4	1523902733	1	No they mean everything, transaction speed and fees are details compared to security and immutability. They will improve with technology, not unsustainable bandaid fixes. Go back to r/btc circlejerk fucking moron.
5	1523902872	1	Is that why adoption of BTC has halted almost completely, you fool?Get a clue.
1	1523894160	-4	some know where the price will be..., the whales
0	1523897009	4	In the late 90s, tech stocks were booming.  Companies like pets.com, red hat, web van, etc, had millions and millions of dollars going toward buying their stocks until investors had an 'oh shit' moment, realized the companies could go bankrupt, and the stock prices crashed.In 2008, the same happened with cdos.  Pension funds, banks, and other players were buying these investments blindly until there was an 'oh shit' moment in realizing the cdos were full of defaulted loans.Fiat is printed at a rate of hundreds of billions of dollars per year.  Anyone doing anything more than living paycheck to paycheck should be having an 'oh shit' moment in the form of 'it's impossible to save value in fiat at the rate fiat is printed', and then hedge by buying bitcoin.  Unfortunately, people are not always rational, and it's impossible to time the market.  But, as can be seen by the price, more people are catching on every day.
1	1523897826	4	I agree with this pov generally — use BTC to hedge against inflation — except there’s 100s of other financial instruments that do the same thing. BTC’s fate lies in the network effect. If we all see it as a simple hedge, it will become just that.IMO the very nature of BTC as an unbridled trading medium means we will be forever in a cycle of boom and bust. You can buy a gold etf and have less volatility, for now anyways.Sidenote - US debt is alarming and I’m trying to figure out what my exit strategy is in the event that we get caught in some kind of hyper-stagflation event.
0	1523896400	2	>Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of digital assets investment fund BKCM LLC,Someone who has a company centered around digital assets thinks crypto is good? Wow. This is huge news.
0	1523898033	1	So the guy that showed normies how to buy ripple at the top on live TV should be taken seriously?
1	1523899938	2	I don't need to be shown how to buy Ripple, bought that shit years ago. Today I just buy bottom shelf whiskey. 
0	1523902723	1	If you believe this, you should go long september futures on BitMEX. They are trading at a discount currently so -1% annualized interest rate for longs.
0	1523897821	1	BTC is a dead man walking. LN isn't going to  save it. 
1	1523902221	1	Yep
0	1523892045	-1	Looking into the forseeable future i dont know where information like this can be justified .25k sounds like a fairytale
1	1523892063	15	Hey, cryptomarketinghub, just a quick heads-up:  **forseeable** is actually spelled **foreseeable**. You can remember it by **begins with fore-**.  Have a nice day!^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
2	1523893989	9	Good bot.
2	1523892668	-6	lol :)thanks , i am actually fast writing so mistakes happen 
0	1523896150	-2	Not before touching 4k mark. I being realistic here. If we look btc chart in logarithmic graph we still haven't breached the resistance. I really want this to be the low and we shoot up from now. But my fingers are crossed, let's see how price play
1	1523897474	0	I honestly believe that with US tax season ending there will be a lot more upward pressure for the rest of the year.  I would not be surprised if we already hit the low.  That said, I buy the same amount (in USD) each week no matter what the price.
0	1523898525	-1	25k is nothing... CNBC has no idea what they’re saying. A serious prediction would be 50,000$ by year end. Or there is always 0. But let’s be optimistic here
