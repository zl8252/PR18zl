I do have a couple questions.How do you make money if this is free?How are API keys stored?Any plans on open sourcing?Any plans for an api I can push updates to?Would you consider adding some more features to the backtesting? Specifically thinking I would like to be able change the date range and percentagesWho are you? Looking at your site and some medium posts all I see is the name "Shrimpy App".
1	1525648582	5	I'm skeptical that hourly rebalancing works.  I did backtesting over several years using MPT, and the best returns always came from rebalancing once a month.
2	1525655857	2	We will continue to monitor the data and update the backtest tool so we are always as accurate as possible. However, you are more than welcome to use any rebalance period you feel comfortable with. We understand everyone has their own preference.
1	1525655787	4	Hi, great questions!There are a significant number of reasons we are better than hodlbot.1. Free to use2. More assets3. More exchanges4. Custom portfolios \(Allow asset selection\)5. Custom rebalance periods6. Higher potential for returns7. And so on...We don't currently make money as we are focusing on user growth and development. We have plans for future versions of the application which will allow us to make money.API keys are always stored encrypted. We take security seriously, so we use high industry standards when handling any of your keys or information.We don't have any plans on open sourcing. Open sourcing all of our code would compromise our system. This is why most exchanges, custodians, and money transmitters don't open source their code.We are considering options for APIs. I can't provide a specific timeline at this point.Our previous version of the backtest tool was very complex with a lot of features. We would consider adding some of the functionality back into the tool, but we want it to be as easy as possible to use so we aren't alienating some of our user base.We are a group of professional engineers from the San Francisco Bay Area. We previously worked for companies like Facebook, Amazon, NASA, Samsung, and Texas Instruments. We will release our team, but not at this time.

We have plans for future versions of the application which will allow us to make money.In this business this usually translates to: We want to acquire users now so we can sell your data later. If this is the case, it would be nice if you could inform users beforehand. 
3	1525680763	5	Absolutely not. This is not our business model. We plan on making money from transaction fees on our platform. Similar to an exchange in a way.
0	1525649200	9	This did not include taxes (which would be long term cap gains) for less than 1 year.
1	1525655201	4	Hi, we have a section in the article that discusses taxes. Is this what you are referring to?
1	1525670318	4	Actually for less than one year (due to rebalancing) it becomes short term rates which are very punitive. I'd be paying almost 40% between federal and state on gains with each rebalance.  It may still outperform holding and paying long term gains but that may be a fluke due to the huge runups
2	1525673924	3	This is a big reason why when I see posts like this, nice as they are, I assume they're either not in the U.S or are trying to evade taxes.
3	1525680921	2	We are both in the US and are not evading taxes. We even included a section on taxes in the article that addresses some of these concerns.
4	1525683866	1	I didn't mean to accuse you specifically (although it definitely reads like it), the "they" I referred to is intended to be more general. 
0	1525657153	8	so by re-balancing do you mean simply adjusting the portfolio every time interval such that each asset makes up a set percentage of the total eg. selling off positions that have outperformed and adding onto positions that have underperformed?
1	1525667425	3	Yes, this is correct. You can read more about rebalancing here: [https://hackernoon.com/portfolio\-rebalancing\-for\-cryptocurrency\-7a129a968ff4](https://hackernoon.com/portfolio-rebalancing-for-cryptocurrency-7a129a968ff4)
0	1525673123	3	Wow, thanks for sharing.  I love crypto portfolio analysis.  I have never seen an analysis that used such a short one hour rebalance.  I imagine the gains would be even greater using Binance and holding Binance coin and getting .05% fees instead of the .25% fees used in your analysis.
1	1525680983	1	You are correct! We used the .25&#37; fee as a default for our backtests because that was the most common fee we have seen on exchanges. I'm glad you enjoyed the analysis!
2	1525701554	1	Do you have a rough idea what the gain increase would be if using .05% fees instead and used hourly rebalance?
0	1525686258	2	Hi, I have a question: why do you use a period at all instead of just rebalancing as needed?
1	1525687043	1	That is most certainly an option. Shrimpy allows you to do this easily. If you don't set a rebalance period, you can always click the "rebalance now" button to rebalance on demand. This gives you complete control of when you rebalance without requiring you to make every trade manually.
2	1525688033	2	Oh I mean rebalancing when one of the coins is out of proportion by a certain threshold. Then the rebalancing is only performed on coins that need it which helps keep fees down.
3	1525696449	1	There is a link to a different article by the same author that discusses different rebalancing approaches, including the strategy described by you. The minimum threshold should be set to at least offset trading fees.

0	1525664629	2	The crypto20 holds the top 20 coins with weekly rebalancing. I'm buying more everytime I can.
0	1525710300	1	I like the concept, and am trialling a very low volume - $250 USD - split across 5 assets on a 1 hour basis, and am seeing no rebalancing happening (outside of manual rebalances). I would hazard that such a volume's likely too low to trigger rebalancing within whatever percentage variation parameters the algo's use?I would like to see a feature added which lists whether a rebalance was triggered or, if not, why not ("Rebalance not executed - balance is within bounds" or similar, in the prior paragraph's case). Is that something which could be added?
0	1525715451	1	Will you add support for GDAX?
