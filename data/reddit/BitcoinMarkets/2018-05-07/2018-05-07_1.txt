0	1525689265	32	Long $1mm @ $9277. Expecting a short term bounce early this week as the regulatory rumors are resolved. Stops at 4%. 
1	1525690522	1	Can you elaborate on your decision? Why do you expect a positive/not harmful output from the regulators? I’m long but I feel like I’m gambling now because I don’t know what’s going to happen. 
2	1525693290	4	The most probable thing from these hearings is that nothing happens. Therefore we'll have a relief rally.
2	1525692798	2	This is a guy who is prepared to be underwater for a while. He thinks that the regulatory news have been mostly priced in and that there should be a bounce soon based on other factors. The other factors must have a higher weighting in his books than the possible negative outcome of the meeting, hence going short here would be gambling, going long is logical. *probably*
3	1525693083	2	Is that actually TRUE that Sec is going to discus that matter today/this week? I don’t see many news outlets talking about, so I think we shouldn’t rule out the possibility that it’s all fud and nothing is actually happening at all.I might be totally wrong and I’d be happy to be corrected.
4	1525711754	1	> nothing is actually happening at all.spot on
1	1525690866	1	How did the rumors get resolved? Can't find any particular post-news.
2	1525697679	1	as = when

We're still in this thing.https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8h38jj/moon_math_update_noob_dca_strategy_second_edition/
1	1525711144	7	Love the noob DCA write up... great contribution to the community
1	1525711535	1	Why did you say buy a trezor and cross out ledger nano s? 
2	1525711680	1	See the top comment. They're both legit, IMO. Just being accommodating.
0	1525666760	21	Can anybody link me to a reliable source that says this SEC hearing is even happening tomorrow? I can't find any reputable outlets talking about it, and it's not on the SEC website.
1	1525667366	8	Best I could find. Not very solid though. Makes me think it's just a working meeting and will be a great big nothingburger.[\*link\*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/worlds-second-most-valuable-cryptocurrency-under-regulatory-scrutiny-1525167000)From a little over halfway through:>	A working group of regulators including senior SEC and CFTC officials are scheduled to discuss the matter on May 7, one of the people said.
2	1525673515	2	Sell the news event?
3	1525705991	2	No. Sell the rumor event. 
1	1525669569	2	SEC was supposed to discuss potential Bitcoin ETF listing on ARCA behind closed doors.  I wonder if this meeting is about that matter or are they actually speaking front of Congress or something?  The ARCA news wouldn't surprise me, since SEC hinted it do not consider BTC as a security.  I am expecting a positive outcome this time.  Even though 9/10 times any SEC news fucked bitcoin pretty hard up the bum.
2	1525670103	0	With the crash just a few months ago and tons of liquidity issues, I doubt it'll happen.
3	1525670400	2	Volume increased good amount on CME. Goldman coming in with their trading desks.  I expect liquidity to improve over the summer.  Would love the opportunity to trade BTC ETF on ARCA....My god, the execution speed.
4	1525670777	1	Except all of the problems that were mentioned in the ETF decision *last year* are still present today. There's literally no reason for the SEC to change it's mind.Just because more people are pouring money in doesn't mean there should be an ETF out there.
5	1525671095	2	The problems that were mentioned are mostly KYC and how exchanges that currently operate needs to improve that before they will even consider it.  SEC dont have to worry about KYC or people cheating IRS for traders that trade on ARCA.  They are verified to a different level.
6	1525672003	1	Forgive my ignorance, but what do you have to do to trade on ARCA?  Would the requirements mean the ETF isn't available to normies with Schwab accounts or what?
0	1525709193	19	There is something basic in investing that is well known yet missed, risk to reward ratio. Is Buffett telling us that the majority of billionaire Investors became so by investing in safe stocks and commodities? You can make money from "value investing" in promising startups such as Apple and IBM back in the days, but guess what, they were as risky (if not more). Also, you've to be a millionaire (known as Qualified Investor) to even put in your money. It's a bit sad that people like Buffet and Gates are being close minded to something new. Is Bitcoin a risky investment? Damn straight. But it gives us poor bystanders a chance to have a better life. I think it's ok to take that chance. 
1	1525709869	9	> you've to be a millionaire (known as Qualified Investor) to even put in your moneyThis is one of the bigger evil policies keeping the rich richer and the poor poorer. The poor can't access high yield investments even if they wanted to, but they are allowed to gamble it away in negative Expected Value games. 
2	1525711728	5	In the late 90s, I traded stocks and you could margin daytrade with $2000 in your acct.  Because there were too many individual daytraders, they changed that to $25,000 and price most of them out of being able to particpate in the market.That is the USA for you.
3	1525715402	2	They changed that rule after the Dot Com bubble crashed the market and all those new daytraders ended up going bankrupt (literally).It's the government protecting the masses from their own stupidity.
4	1525715666	1	The same idiots who lost money day trading used the rest of their salary buying Floridian Condo's in 2007.
2	1525710493	2	The policy is overrated. As far as I know it is US policy. Many, if not most, countries do not restrict citizens that much and they are still not being millionaires from investing.What I saw in my country of origin, were people who were just randomly picking some hot picks for US stocks and they never made it anywhere. Well right now they are buying alts on credit.
3	1525710660	2	For sure, it's not going to lift any class out of poverty. But it is certainly one way in which America limits it's citizens' economic freedom.
4	1525710821	1	Yes, it makes no sense, at least now as KoKansei wrote. The people who want to do non-qualified financial decisions will do it even if they are restricted from certain markets.
4	1525713265	1	blanket rules that dictate how you can use your money based on your current level of money are always in your best interest.  Your intelligence and drive/ambition should have nothing to do with it.
3	1525710887	1	get a pay-day loan at 35% APR then move it onto bitmex and go 100x on an altcoin future.. now that's how to invest.
3	1525715517	1	Actually almost all western countries have similar restrictions for investing in private companies. Not sure about Asian countries but I'd assume they're similar or moving in that direction.Canada's laws are extremely similar to the US's.
2	1525715931	1	Those rules aren't in place to keep the rich richer and poor poorer. They're in place because in the realm of private ventures, you have to pay for and advocate for your own justice.The government will advocate for people in criminal matters but it won't do it in civil matters. So if a company is refusing to uphold their contract with a shareholder, then the government says it's said shareholder's own job to represent himself/herself through the entire proceeding.That's *incredibly* expensive. The cost just to file a lawsuit starts at $20,000. That's just to officially state (in court records) you're suing the other party. That's not even for discovery, trial prep, trial, witnesses, etc.The cost for even a small matter is high five figures to low six figures.Your average citizen doesn't have the kind of money to just file a lawsuit much less take it to court. And in the civil world, *nobody* works on contingency. Lawyers expect to be paid up front.So those rules are actually very smart. They were actually created in the 70's when $1M was worth significantly more than it is today. There has actually been discussion in the past decade about raising those requirements.
1	1525710367	9	This makes me wonder if there were billionaires 40 years ago that warned everybody against investing in tech stocks like IBM, Microsoft, Apple and Google."It's all fake, it's just electricity through wires, it doesn't have any production value"
2	1525711095	14	"There is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable. It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will." - Albert Einstein, 1932"This 'telephone' has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us." - Western Union internal memo, 1876"If excessive smoking actually plays a role in the production of lung cancer, it seems to be a minor one." - -W.C. Heuper, National Cancer Institute, 1954"How, sir, would you make a ship sail against the wind and currents by lighting a bonfire under her deck? I pray you, excuse me, I have not the time to listen to such nonsense.” — Napoleon Bonaparte, when told of Robert Fulton’s steamboat, 1800sLots of extremely smart and successful people have made incredibly bad predictions throughout time. I would not listen to an 80 year old about Bitcoin. I think Warren is the best at what he does but he does not invest in tech companies so what would you expect him to say?
3	1525715072	1	Nice collection. Always interesting to read these, and there are many, many more.
3	1525715268	1	> "This 'telephone' has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us." - Western Union internal memo, 1876The presiding tech of the time was the telegraph which had a lot of limitations which the telephone overcame. For example, the telephone allowed you to convey over 100x more information per unit time.The only thing better crypto does compared to our traditional banking is that it's faster. The problem is nobody actually cares about "faster" these days because credit systems are already in place which allow for a similar operation in the same time frame.> "How, sir, would you make a ship sail against the wind and currents by lighting a bonfire under her deck? I pray you, excuse me, I have not the time to listen to such nonsense.” — Napoleon Bonaparte, when told of Robert Fulton’s steamboat, 1800sNapoleon didn't understand how you could change thermal energy into mechanical energy. He also didn't understand just how much more energy a block of wood (or coal) had compared to a light breeze. In other words, Napoleon didn't understand the modern physics of the time.
1	1525709682	8	Buffet and Gates belong to a dying era where people of means believed that those of a lower economic status than themselves must be shepherded like cattle in order for them to be productive members of society. Hence, all the restrictions on what those "not qualified" are and aren't allowed to do with their own capital.You could argue that these restrictions might have made sense before the advent of the Internet, but the market for information is now far more developed and the old system is starting to hurt much more than it helps most people.
2	1525710118	5	> You could argue that these restrictions might have made sense before the advent of the Internet, but the market for information is now far more developed and the old system is starting to hurt much more than it helps most people.This is such a positive perspective on a topic/opinion so often discussed bitterly. Thank you for this.
3	1525712480	2	Cheerful Ancap, at your service!
1	1525710789	1	typically an investment pitch that starts with 'now the little guy can finally make big money' don't end well
2	1525713622	1	that's what media moguls/dinosaurs formatted your brain to think.
3	1525713738	1	well, except the commercials at 2am
1	1525709466	1	> Also, you've to be a millionaireGrammar nazi post (sorry) but you can't use a contraction in that instance, you've to spell out "you have"
2	1525710050	4	"you've got"Take that!
0	1525691938	11	To follow up on my comments yesterday I need to start with an apology. The "Consensus" event in NY is next week (May 14-17). Normal time and crypto time have apparently messed with my brain. As to the SEC meeting today, it is an internal meeting where the SEC along with the CFTC will discuss how to proceed with the issue of regulating the crypto space. Again, it's an internal meeting and since non-public in nature then means we shouldn't expect any comments made after the fact. I am, however, expecting leakage to the press much like the meeting itself was leaked. Before I get down voted, there is no source to my comment above rather my personal knowledge to how these things work with the various financial regulators. Expect pieces to be put into place internally before any public commentary on how they intended to proceed are made public. Nothing necessarily malicious with such an approach. Just how government agencies operate. Finally, been seeing ongoing commentary of how low volumes are do BTC on the various indices. While itself an important factor the focus should be on OTC volumes as well. For me that is where buying and selling among large institutions is taking place. Now, go out and enjoy the day/evening. 
1	1525692030	5	Yeah I have this impression people think this SEC meeting will be like a Trump Executive order or something, with a big press crown and their director saying "And today we decided X"That's not really how government agencies work
1	1525692383	2	Can you link to any official source saying this meeting is actually happening? I didn't find shit.
2	1525693708	2	For me, there were two sources. One was in the a high profile story WSJ focused on ETH on May 1st - written by Paul Vigna nonetheless - that referenced "one person familiar with the inquiry" and second was more critical at least to me; former head of the CFTC Gary Gensler speaking last week at an event where he said there was a strong case that ETH and XRP are non compliant securities. That was even sources in the Vigna story. Realize that it looks very weak as support, but I am personally watching these small pieces of what appear to be inconsequential data points very closely. 
0	1525697130	10	Found an article on bloomberg on sec and securities, was published just a little over a week ago.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-23/ether-ripple-may-be-securities-former-cftc-head-gensler-saysIt states there that either ether and ripple will be considered as a security will be decided in “ nine months to a year, or 2 to 5 years at the longest”Is that really all just just nonsense fud that’s been all over reddit these days? 
1	1525697251	4	I'm not sure where this whole notion started. I suppose it was Twitter?
2	1525699541	1	It's people trying to justify the dip. But it's such a stretch, I'd rather just leave it to we're not out of the bear's woods yet that's all
1	1525700936	1	http://fortune.com/2018/05/01/sec-and-cryptocurrency-regulations/This article states that "the prospects of the SEC taking action are remote", and that "Gensler’s background is at the CFTC, which does not have a role in determining what constitutes a security".
0	1525705549	18	Guys the "SEC/CFTC live steam" that you are watching happened months ago. Goes to show who *actually* watched it last time ;)
1	1525705642	7	lol if it's the one which was quite positive then that's bullish with some lag
1	1525709616	2	I put a spycam in the closed door session im streaming it right now..good news guys.. vary good news.
0	1525714691	9	175b worth of net worth gathered around in a room to make dispelling arguments against Bitcoin. Whether they made logical claims or not, that's pretty damn interesting.
1	1525715776	3	They are more of the status quo more than anyone else.  It's no surprise they are bashing cryptocurrency.  It is good for them and their friends.
1	1525716233	1	 A bunch of pretentious old men playing at running the world. But the world left them behind long ago. We are the future. 
0	1525711447	8	Potentially this was a retest of the bull pennant https://www.tradingview.com/x/UnKvdQzT/Edit: Its also a retest of the log trendline from daily close https://www.tradingview.com/x/z4BnbOGj/
1	1525712631	4	Was thinking the same thing [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/JUckaCsz/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/JUckaCsz/)
1	1525713685	1	That's my take on it as well
0	1525690991	6	I'm setting up laddered buy orders in the **9.2-9.0k** range. Currently we're on our trendline from **7.8-8.8k**, and for now it seems to be holding. However, I think the slope of this line is rather steep and though we might bounce a bit from here (would've expected it to already have happened to be honest) I think it's unrealistic to expect we can sustain that growth. I have more faith in the support line from the bullish pennant we recently broke out of which is currently at about **9.0 - 9.05k** which is also pretty close to our 0.236 retrace. I'm expecting a bigger bounce here.(Messy) Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/PDfHUDd7/ (Green and purple line)
1	1525691446	1	holding for 5 hours :D    
2	1525691825	2	Yeah it's holding pretty well, but I'm thinking it might be another little bearflag. Think there's still some downwards room on the 4hr RSI and the div's on the 1h are not crystal clear. I'm keeping a close eye though because it might just be reaccumulation here. 
0	1525703865	8	Closed my long from 9330 when it dropped below 9200... Of course it bounces right after and it seems it was a fake out and now will go up just to mess with me some more...Better stick to the bot. Trading is not for me.
1	1525704818	1	What does the bot do?
2	1525705290	1	Its the position tracker one
3	1525705353	2	We should give it a name! Like Gandalf!
0	1525703967	7	Warren at it again...https://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-cnbc/buffett-bashes-bitcoin-as-nonproductive-thriving-on-mystique-idUSKBN1I813Fif you don't like it, move on to something you do like...
1	1525704356	21	If he genuinely believes it's rat poison (which certainly seems to be the case), then he honestly feels he's doing a public service by shouting that fact from the rafters.You may not agree with him, but that should explain why he's not just moving onto something else. He's either a good person who has a different view of bitcoin than most here do...or he's a greedy, selfish asshole who wants to see the cyrpto space burn so that his non-crypto investments don't suffer. I like to believe it's option A instead of option B.
2	1525705143	3	I think it is ego.  If you follow his advice, you basically only buy SPY and are supposed to be happy with 5-10% gains per year, except during a recession.  If that is the kind of return you're getting, it is easy to be jealous of people making significantly more in crypto, and those people might be less inclined to follow his advice.
3	1525705620	7	For every 1 person who bought BTC sub $1,000 and is still holding it, there are probably at least a dozen who bought sub $1,000 and still sold for a 25%+ loss.BTC often looks like it only goes up, but that's obviously not the reality of the situation. Volatility is terrifying when the money you're investing needs to work for you to pay for college, retirement, a house, etc. Bitcoin IS NOT a safe investment. And it's arguably reckless to advice anybody otherwise. 
4	1525706019	2	I was telling everyone here (and everywhere else) that unless you use crypto on a daily basis in business or life (a true convert), then you don't belong within 10 miles of it.It's not something you can just passively invest in. It's nearly a full time job just keeping up with the news. It's also somewhat complicated so it requires you to really know tech and have a solid grasp on finance and economics. At the end of the day, it's soo stupidly risky that it makes for an absolutely shitty investment.
5	1525706544	6	I agree with you wholeheartedly. In about 4 years of following bitcoin, I've only once ever advised anybody buy it. And that was a close friend who was already interesting in investing, but was just wondering whether I thought $3,500 was a smart entry.People asked me at $300, $700, $10,000 and $20,000 and every price point in between and my answer was always the same:"You will almost certainly wind up selling the bottom of the first 50% correction you have the pleasure of witnessing. Take your money elsewhere, or buy $1,000 worth and do everything in your power to forget you have it — without losing access to it."
5	1525707706	1	I agree with everything you said except for the passive statement.  Im almost entirely a passive investors and have advised and helped several people in crypto.  They were all also passive.  We've all made north of 20x at this point.  You can, if you have the right attitude/fortitude, be a passive investor in crypto.  In fact most alts are closer to seed stage investments where you should expect a return timeline of 10 years...  actively trading in these spaces is pretty silly if you take a step back.  But its fun to see it play out anyways.
6	1525709078	1	You're literally describing an active investor.A passive investor is someone who buys something and never looks at it again until he's ready to take his money out of the account 5 years or more later.Guarantee you're looking at your portfolio often.Your statement shows the clear lack of financial literacy in this space. You don't even understand the basic terms.
7	1525709194	1	You have an odd definition then. 10 year hold is not typically considered active investor. 
8	1525709317	1	Active investor vs passive investor has nothing to do with how long you hold an asset. That's long vs medium term investor.Angel investors usually buy for 5-10 years but they're most certainly considered active investors.Active vs passive describes whether you follow your investment and/or participate as an investor (to the extent an investor is allowed to participate). So if you're checking your portfolio often, then you're most certainly an active investor.
9	1525713469	1	Wow - you're financially illiterate AND an asshole.https://www.investopedia.com/news/active-vs-passive-investing/First fucking line:  "If you’re a passive investor, you invest for the long haul. Passive investors limit the amount of buying and selling within their portfolios, making this a very cost-effective way to invest.">Angel investors usually buy for 5-10 years but they're most certainly considered active investors.Totally fucking wrong.  They are only considered 'active' if they participate in running the company - such as board seats - which a vast majority of Angels do not get.>So if you're checking your portfolio often, then you're most certainly an active investor.Thats just a stupid statement.  But even more ironically - it supports my statement that a long term buy and holder is NOT by YOUR definition an active investor.Jesus you beat yourself in this argument...
4	1525713173	1	> Volatility is terrifying when the money you're investing needs to work for you to pay for college, retirement, a house, etc.This is very true. Which is why investments in the crypto space should be no more than what someone is willing to lose. Many people break this rule, and the resulting sour grapes is entirely their own fault.
3	1525705869	1	I'm arguably one of the best traders on this subreddit and I tell people to stick their money in SPY.If I had free cash I'd be putting it in SPY. Low cost passive ETF investing is the smartest thing to do for *most* people.
4	1525707683	1	The point is that if bitcoin takes over the world, that will objectively not be the case for all serious investors.
5	1525708765	1	Even if crypto took over, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix are still going to be listed on the NASDAQ. They're literally not going anywhere.In fact, many crypto companies (such as Ripple, the company) would likely have IPO's such as Ripple.
6	1525709153	1	Yeah, I agree without the benefit of hindsight a more conservative approach then the "YOLO all in crypto" portfolio is best for most people. But again if bitcoin takes over... hindsight will be a real bitch for certain bruised investor egos.
7	1525709592	1	It's been a decade and everyone is literally still using the term "if it takes over" not "when it takes over".How many decades do you need before you'll concede it's not taking over?
8	1525709802	1	Uhhhh, bitcoin has produced on average ludicrous annual returns since its inception. How much faster do you want it to grow?  
9	1525710595	1	So has Tesla doesn't mean the future is battery powered cars.The rest of the automotive industry, in fact, believes the future is hydrogen fuel cell power vehicles.
2	1525704612	2	I do too.  Dishonest types would try to get in on the action.  He has little to gain making that call so emphatically.  I actually take his warning seriously.  I also went on a long rant on another poster characterizing him as an 'old man' who doesnt 'get tech'.   Buffett is not your stereotypical old man.
3	1525705788	1	He is absolutely a stereotypical old man who played his cards right and absolutely can be a dick. He excels in certain areas and he sticks to those. I could be wrong but didn't he say anyone who gives any value to an internet company is stupid? 
4	1525706078	1	if he said it during the dotcom bubble of 2k he wasn't
2	1525709250	1	I think it's option C: He has zero clue how Bitcoin works or what it's value proposition is. 
1	1525704227	6	Not that his opinion matters much for bitcoin, but I think it's noteworthy how harsh he is about bitcoin
2	1525704738	8	Like I implied above, I think he truly believes it's too dangerous for 99% of investors, and nobody should touch it with a 10-foot pole. And to be honest, he is absolutely correct. There aren't a whole lot of financial advisors out there who would instruct their clients to invest in crypto. If they did, they'd get calls every 4 hours thanking them for their miraculous financial advice...followed by calls 4 hours later telling them to go fuck themselves. 
3	1525705798	1	From a pure investors point of view he is not wrong, it is still a speculative asset.I do know financial advicors who are in cryptos. Of course only with the high risk tolerable customers and only with a very small position.
1	1525704573	5	aka: it doesn't fit any of my legacy fiat models or world views.> sorry Warren, we don't care.
1	1525705636	5	A couple of things to note:1) Buffet never invests in new technologies. He's a corporate raider with a "nice grandpa" PR imagine.2) Buffet isn't that great of an investor but he does have extremely sage advice on *money* and basic financial literacy.3) [The technical literacy rate of people is a joke](https://lifehacker.com/this-chart-shows-how-computer-literate-most-people-are-1789761598). The only literacy rate lower in people is financial literacy. Most people can barely turn their computer on much less understand what or how even basic parts of it function. Cryptocurrecny is an even more complex hybrid of technology and digital financial asset.Therefore while you shouldn't listen to him on technology, you should listen to him on money (not investing). Here, he's absolutely correct that the vast majority of people don't understand what they're getting into and simply gambling because they wanna get "easy" money, quick. That's not how it ever works out and people just lose.
2	1525705793	4	he invested in railroads I doubt he knows how a train engine works.  People on here would rather take stock tips from a train engineer than buffett.Techies are biased.. towards tech.
3	1525707157	1	By the time Buffet was *born*, railroads had been around for almost a century.Cryptocurrency has been around a decade and still hasn't shown large scale adoption or threat to traditional fiat.I should also note Bill Gates invests in the railroads. On the whole, they have a better risk adjusted return than Tesla or SpaceX.
2	1525707396	1	>Here, he's absolutely correct that the vast majority of people don't understand what they're getting into and simply gambling because they wanna get "easy" money, quick. That's not how it ever works out and people just lose.Big citation needed. I don't buy Buffet or any other technocrat's assertion that most people are incapable of managing their own money when given a fair chance. Many people have been mislead into poor financial habits but they will soon learn.While I think you're right that very few people understand bitcoin on a deep level, understanding it at a basic level is not rocket science, depending on how many simplifications you are willing to accept.
1	1525707120	2	Sounds like buffet is about 6 years too late to the buttcoin party.
0	1525700491	28	It's too early in the morning for this shit. There's a handful of short-term formations to potentially draw here, and none of them are bullish:First there's an [obvious bear flag on the 15m](https://imgur.com/a/n7xhh9L) which would drop price to around $8,900 if it completes with a push below around $9,250. This may complete before I finish typing by the looks of it. Next there's a very [janky descending channel](https://imgur.com/a/B0GZCmy) (not a wedge in my opinion), with support in the $9,050 area. Anyhow, pretty much no matter how you slice it, we're unlikey to see much upside today — barring a sudden big green candle reversal above resistance. The sustained downward pressure itself isn't so concerning, but the lack of buying pressure certainly is. You can generally gauge the strength of a trend by the fervor by which counter moves are reversed. When buyers gulp up dips, the underlying upward trend is strong. When they sit it out and let sellers dump to their heart's content, it doesn't exactly project confidence.
1	1525701321	8	> The sustained downward pressure itself isn't so concerning, but the lack of buying pressure certainly is. It's not been mentioned today but as well as SEC uncertainty in the USA here in Europe it's a 3 day weekend and it's really lovely weather outside, hottest May bank holiday here in the UK for 40 years.Just an FYI.Typing from a sun lounger. Waiting for the ice cream van.
2	1525701771	8	no idea what uk is doing but may bank holiday was last week in europe ;-)
3	1525702067	3	It is VE day tomorrow. That's a huge deal in France at least where it's a public holiday. Maybe a tad less in Germany.I'm in France at the moment and will be cursing The Hun at the war memorial tomorrow.  
4	1525702791	1	ah right. I'm always confused since the Netherlands celebrate the 5th, France the 8th.... anyway here in germany it's different 😀
4	1525703477	1	I'm French living in Germany and can confirm you that I'm working today :) they obviously don't celebrate anything today
2	1525703433	1	Don't go in the van if a 70 y/o guy dressed like a hobo screams "free candy"
1	1525700752	6	Suddenly the sub turns bearish.
2	1525702582	2	Perfectly reasonable to be bearish right now. The market has now retraced 100% of the push up to $10,000.Buyers disappeared. They may re-emerge suddenly and without warning, but for now they're nowhere to be found.
2	1525700974	1	And that concerns me \(with my short\). I felt as the only one being bearish when we have been still above 9.5k and I felt good with that ;\)
3	1525701351	1	I was as well my friend and i am sure the both of us had some company. :)BTW, i do not contest _chewtoy_, my comments is referred to all the people still holding their longs that will turn moderately bearish following his TA.
1	1525700856	4	I guess you still hold your 8.8k long \- if so, why?
2	1525702481	5	A couple of reasons. First and foremost, $8,800 has served as ironclad support for a few weeks now, and it's pretty much the strongest possible long entry one could be holding at the moment. Second, the market has already dropped about 8% in the past 48 hours, and RSI is getting pretty close to oversold on medium timeframes. There were far better opportunities to close my long this weekend, and I missed all of them.At this point, it's not really worth it to close it vs. hoping for a bounce and another attempt at $10,000. Better just to hold it until breakeven or close it after the next strong bounce.
1	1525703944	1	Not sure if this adds to any thought processes but public holiday in loads of countries in today... May day or labour day.
2	1525704141	1	I don't really factor bank holidays into my analysis. Even if you subscribe to the "mysterious they" outlook regarding market manipulation, you'd have to assume that "they" would be more than prepared for a bank holiday and would have made sure any bank transfers cleared last week.
3	1525708264	1	Was thinking more a volume thing if relevant. And as far as uk concerned, stunning weather with record breaking temps... rare here :) definately stop loss/buy order weather. Rock climbing at present myself :)
1	1525700819	0	I don't think TA is very relevant at the moment , but what do I know 
2	1525701180	6	Clearly nothing
1	1525700787	1	Sounds like you had a rough night.
2	1525703375	3	I've had better — but I've also had far worse. I honestly don't care if the market spends a few weeks trading sideways in the $9,200 to $10,000 range. I'd just be a lot more comfortable if it were at least toward the middle of that range instead of mercilessly dropping toward the bottom ofthat range.
1	1525701181	1	its not only not a wedge its starting to get a bit disorderly.Another poster mentioned this but that bull trap candle last night was clearly some whale taking a giant dump.  No increase in shorts.  We failed 10k and he saw his exit.
1	1525701248	1	I did have your channel as a wedge, and I'm expecting the 9250 high volume node / historical support to hold. I believe the market reacts to it FUD/news irrationally, and I try to trade against sentiment when it seems like a big bag of nothing (SEC hearing nonsense). I went with swaps this time, to not get bled on the futures premium dissolving. Stops below the not-wedge breakdown. 
0	1525705201	5	So I was able to exit yesterday's long at $9610 about an hour before the sell off...  this drop has me wondering if we're witnessing a trend reversal, but I think it's too early to make that callIf you remain bullish, this price level is a good buying opportunity as we're [near the nadir of the trend line volatility](https://www.tradingview.com/x/rBcrDbzQ/).  We may bounce here off 40 on the 4hr as we did on 5/1 and continue bullish trajectory to $10kThe very recent bounce of $9180 was bought with some gusto... a move bellow however would begin to a paint a more bearish picture with promise of an $8800 retestPersonally I'm out of trade and waiting for things to become a bit more clear
1	1525705404	4	> move bellowthat would blow
0	1525705946	6	[https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/05/07/munger\-bitcoin\-is\-worthless\-artificial\-gold.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/05/07/munger-bitcoin-is-worthless-artificial-gold.html)Bill gates: "I'd short it if there was an easy way to do it"What do you guys think?
1	1525706935	9	I see several old men grasping to understand a future that doesn't include them. Even Gates feels the need to point out the utility of block chain. 
2	1525709236	1	yeah bill gates is a real tech dunce almost as dumb as stephen hawking.
1	1525706110	6	Buffet has a well known reputation of not investing in things he doesn't understand.  Munger is his longtime protege.  Makes total sense they'd shy away from crypto.  Not sure about Bill Gates though.
1	1525706356	4	why is there always fud like this when we hit an important level and right after we have a dump? seems coordinated /tinfoilhat
2	1525706743	2	Lol it's not conspiratorial to think some of the richest people in the world whose wealth is held in traditional vehicles would be like fuck cryptos... It makes perfect sense.
3	1525714098	1	It would be stupid to NOT think some of the richest people in the world despise Bitcoin and are actively conspiring against it. Seriously. Stupid.
1	1525706493	2	Well he is one of the richest guys in the world but he is fiat rich. If crypto really does wget adopted he will no longer be one of the richest. I'd say the same if I was him.
1	1525706684	5	who the hell cares? As they said, if you really believe then it does not matter.Also he is right, a lot of people just get in for the money and not for the tech, thats why stuff like XVG happens. At the end of the day btc is here since almost 10 years and it shows some use cases other cryptos not so much.Don't forget that people don't know the difference between bitcoin or any other coin.
1	1525706147	3	He also said it was a technological tour de force.https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1dx6rq/bill_gates_bitcoin_is_a_techno_tour_de_force/
2	1525706337	4	It can be an epic technology and still worth shorting.The internet was a tour de force but only a moron bought tech in late 2000.More importantly, the technology can be good but it's open source so there's no protectable IP to invest in.
2	1525709203	1	Bill also said that Bitcoin is bad because drug users use it to buy drugs. > The main feature of crypto currencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The Governments ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. Right now crypto currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs and crypto currencies is super risky for those who go long.https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/80ow6w/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/dux49ll/
3	1525710473	2	bitcoin is also the single least anonymous currency in the history of currencies, so this sentiment is laughable.
3	1525711065	1	So ironic because IMO one of the great features of crypto is to make money flows transparent - no more big business tax fraud, banks laundering drug money, price cartels, corporate lobbying, governments funding terrorist organizations.
1	1525707962	3	I think these two people will be dead before btc has reached it's full potential so it's hard for them to take it seriously.
1	1525706632	1	I'm not surprised. The simplest answer is that humans are greedy, and these three want your money to flow into traditional investment vehicles. It doesn't help them if you buy BTC.
1	1525712364	1	A man with money and connections like him can set up a trading account in Chicago Futures Exchange in a few minutes I assume, what is the problem?Oh he's just another intellectual yet idiot that thinks he understands markets. Ah nothing to see here
1	1525706161	0	bill gates is an old man who doesnt get technology.
2	1525714215	1	Really, he doesn't, and Buffett is not an investor. What they both are is salesmen. Buffett sold shares of a glorified mutual fund, and Gates sold the worst OS in the world to big business. History won't be kind to either of them.
3	1525715449	1	tough to be a good salesman without knowing the product, i believe they both started in the trenches too.. gates with DOS and buffett with highly analytical corporate raiding.
1	1525707296	1	I like Munger .. he's an exceptionally smart dude ... but no one on the panel really made a cogent argument against BTC as a viable technological replacement for sound money.They're right to think the space is still highly speculative; cypto has not come close to replacing things like gold or fiat... but they'd be remiss not to recognize the now 10 year track record of BTC's anti-fragility and the real fact that billions in VC capital is pouring into the space which should engender some confidence that crypto will continue to mature.
2	1525708450	1	VC capital pouring in doesn't mean a whole lot.  It just means that people with money think they have a decent chance of making more money.  It doesn't mean they "believe in bitcoin".
3	1525708767	2	Ponzi's are profitable for the early adopters.  If you legalized ponzi's, they'd invest.  Legalize crack, they'd invest.
4	1525713978	1	Are you saying Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme? If so, I think you're in the wrong sub. 
3	1525710409	1	You're talking as if one is exclusive to the other
2	1525708689	1	I like all 3, and want to hear what they have to say.  Agree or not.I know buffett hates gold, so of course he hates bitcoin.
0	1525705969	6	Can you put a stop loss and target sell limit at the same time into GDAX?
1	1525706082	2	sadly no.
2	1525706329	1	Which platforms have this functionality?
3	1525707119	1	BFX has OCO order to do this.
3	1525707813	1	Bitmex can. If your stop order triggers your position-reducing limits are also automatically canceled for you.
1	1525706254	1	I wish, but sadly no
1	1525706349	1	No, sadly, but I wish
0	1525711333	18	"I would short bitcoin if there was an easy way to do it." - Bill GatesGuys, no one tell Bill Gates about Bitmex, ok?edit: also, don't tell him about the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Kraken or Poloniex
1	1525712250	8	he can short on CME, he can short on Kraken, he can short on Polo(in the end owned by Goldman Sachs, an american big company)This is just some public stunt
2	1525712812	1	Oh I know, it's just funny (and says a lot) that no one called him out, like hey bill, there are multiple easy ways to do exactly what you're saying.
1	1525711897	10	Bill Gates and Warren Buffet are part of an old guard, that instead of embracing new ideas, stick to their long held faith in the stock market and Fiat.  His ignorance of the fact that Bitcoin is easily shorted in several venues by many rich people and market makers just shows their cursory and novice knowledge, typical of someone who fears change and of the unknown and only learns about that which they fear enough to conversationally bash it. Should Bitcoin go back to 20000 anytime soon? Is its volatility good or bad for it? Is the amount of the market that is made up of speculation healthy? These are good questions, but do not rate an intrinsic failure of the technology.
2	1525712289	6	Quite funny how Bill Gates was the one shifting IT focus from hardware to software, and now when payments and information and messaging and so on are shifting from centralized to decentralized open software, he is the IBM of 2010
1	1525713119	4	More like he would if he knew how / he would if he had the time. Don’t see the point in Bill Gates day trading when he practically has an infinite supply of money. 
2	1525713421	1	True, but I'll bet there are a lot of things that he would do if he had the time, yet, he doesn't go on national TV and say he would bet against those things if there was an easy way to do it... 
3	1525713737	1	The guy just loves to hate on crypto. I could never see him acting on these claims. At the end of the day, Bill Gates isn’t a trader.. he didn’t become a household name from his ability to trade and analysis markets.. the idea of him having deep pockets with the “intent” of shorting doesn’t worry me. 
4	1525713824	2	oh I know, man. I'm not worried about that at all.
1	1525711507	3	I thought the same thing when I heard him.
1	1525711718	4	He'd have to buy BTC first to short there. 
2	1525712049	1	And everyone thought the *$750 1m candle on BFX* was silly. 
2	1525712169	1	or he could have used the BTC that someone gifted him (which he says he sold)
3	1525713305	1	The point is that bitmex means you take on a lot of counter party risk and a lot of people don't particularly like the CME contracts
4	1525713653	1	oh I know, I would never use Bitmex for that very reason. doesn't change the fact that there are, indeed, easy ways to short bitcoin. 
1	1525711795	4	Liquidated short on XBTUSD: Buy 7,000,000,000,000,000 @ 9400 🔥🔥🔥🔥 ~ GWP-like!
2	1525713246	1	7 Quadrillion?There's not even 100 trillion of paper wealth on the planet...
3	1525713446	1	I meant 7,000,000,000,000. 100x.
1	1525712354	2	Couldn't he just sell bitcoin futures on legitimate US futures market? Is there a reason why this wouldn't be essentially the same as shorting? 
2	1525713183	4	Based on what he has said, I highly doubt he has even looked into what it would take (one call to his financial advisor) to short Bitcoin.
1	1525713821	2	I only hope Buffett stays alive long enough to see $100k Bitcoin.
2	1525714554	10	Why? the price means nothing- your idea that the price is what will prove people wrong is everything  wrong with bitcoin. It's proving his point. You should be hoping to see it *be used*. Not for the price to go higher 
3	1525715863	1	BTC is being *used* right now as a speculative investment and hedge against other more traditional investments.  edit: I get what you mean about people obsessing over the price. interestingly enough, price (as it relates to a store of value) may eventually prove to be one of BTC's most useful features.
1	1525713187	-1	those 3 act like bitcoin is beneath them and they barely care about it but you know secretly those 3 are talking about 'shitcoin' all the time and call it buttcoin and are plotting to destroy it.
0	1525709942	9	Just a sad little note that one of the two biggest crypto exchanges in India, Koinex, has a volume of 7 BTC in the last 24 hours. The other exchange, Zebpay has a volume 224 BTC. 7 is just plain sad though. Really hoping positive crypto sentiment can come and hit India again.
1	1525710434	5	That's because we use those just for buying. We trade in the US exchanges like Bitfinex. 
1	1525711176	1	There's some appeals against the crypto ban that are now being heard, so we'll have to see what the outcome of that'll be.
0	1525668430	30	Hey guys! Update...So yesterday, [I posted in the daily asking for feedback regarding my hackathon project that relates to crypto trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8hcsus/daily_discussion_sunday_may_06_2018/dyiyun7/) (my idea was one of the finalists selected for Seattle Startup Weekend Blockchain Edition). I was promptly downvoted into oblivion (like -12 at one point) and perhaps rightfully-so; most of y'all don't wanna see that stuff, especially when the market is volatile.*Welp as it turns out*...... **WE WON!!!** First place!!So thank you to the haters that downvoted; that fueled us to work harder. And thank you for those that gave feedback either publicly or in-private; it was super valuable! We're stoked on the win and what the future may hold.The whole pitch/presentation/demo was recorded so once that gets uploaded, I'll share the video. I was the team lead and guy who presented so bring on the trolls. :)
1	1525668885	12	Congratulations
2	1525669984	2	Thanks mate! 
1	1525670311	3	Fucking good for You, bro!
1	1525679710	1	Well done. What did you win?
0	1525702414	3	If we can't hold 9200 with strong support.  We will break under 9k.  We got sold very hard around 9200 that led to the dump to 6k earlier this year.
1	1525702657	2	Bounced off hard at 9200 on finex...I like it 
2	1525702792	4	it bounced by 30$...
3	1525703061	4	Now buyers building up on order book around 9200 on finex.  On the market depth chart it looks like a staircase....Which usually means it's one big whale, orders are broken down in blocks creating that staircase....Just my observation.
3	1525702880	3	I know, but it held and did that after massive market sell order 200btc+...The fact that it held off all those market sell orders, it is support, I agree the $30 bounce is pretty weak. 
3	1525703456	3	someone bought over 700 BTC at $9,200 - pretty solid bounce. we'll see what happens from here
3	1525704275	2	Did you mean $130...?
4	1525704639	2	No, the initial bounce was about 30$, check the time of the comment.He was right in the end but not when posted.
0	1525702596	3	Buy wall on BFX at $9,200 just swallowed about 700 BTC
1	1525702733	3	i really should change exchange. GDAX is getting really obsolete, the action always seems to be elsewhere..
2	1525702764	3	here you go:https://www.bfxdata.com/orderbooks/btcusd
3	1525703008	1	does finex offer € pairing?
4	1525703293	1	yes
0	1525703097	3	Well I’m now underwater on my long from $9,536 where I had many opportunities to close it for a great profit, but I Was married to the position and let greed get to me. First position in a month where I allowed myself to get greedy and not take profits.I was busy over the weekend drinking Don Julio and working, and now looking at a fat loss.Do I hold my long open? Or close for a loss... We have Erased nearly all of our gains and i cant see how this is going to drop any more 
1	1525703324	2	Use stops man.There's no reason to not have at least a breakeven stop when the price was > $400 above your entry.
1	1525703815	1	Hold open for long
1	1525703456	1	300$ up and down are not fat gains/loses.Just hold the position for a little longer.
0	1525709628	8	The meeting is not happening and it was all just BS 
1	1525711161	6	Ok, let's go back to wildly speculating about Goldman Sachs and NASDAQ.
1	1525710263	3	Welcome to Reddit 
2	1525711194	1	It's not just about Reddit tho , it was talked about everywhere in crypto space
1	1525709777	2	There is something on the SEC website about an event on the 11th.  Perhaps the date was misreported.  But the event on the SEC website looks like just a casual discussion rather than a decision making meeting.
1	1525709725	1	Yep \- I searched teh [senate.gov](https://senate.gov) site thoroughly and didn't find anything scheduled.
1	1525711141	1	Told you guys. 90&#37; crypto traders are living memes.
0	1525706892	15	BitcoinMarkets Position tracker updates:* It's now possible to order results in the page* Values with commas are allowed now* Created new commands to take profits / reduce positions either by stack % or by leverage* The add command can be used just with leverage, in cases where the stack % remains the same but the leverage changes* Mouse over the opening value shows a tooltip with open and close dates* Row color changes depending on the position is long or short* It's possible to list the history of all users at once instead of being user by user* Low effort posts are now replied by PM to reduce SPAM on the thread. Additional measures are being analyzed to further reduce the spam * By default, if no leverage and no stack % is used when opening a position, stack % will be 100% and leverage 1X* Added the delete command to enable positions to be deleted in case of mistake* XSS problem resolvedToDo:* Calculate PnL on open positions using the pair used (now all PnL are calculated by the BTCUSD price)* Show the position full sequence (showing adds, profit takings and close)* Enable position commands to be sent by PM to the bot instead to reduce spam* Add filter options to enable filtering results by pair, type or both* Add karma to the bot account to avoid using my main account* Add BTC address to page to allow donations (this will be the last thing to be done after all is implemented and bug free)As always, bug reports or suggestions are welcome
1	1525707643	6	I'm concerned about the number of comments that only share their position. Can you implement a word count that's > 100 words and send a DM when users fail to do that (also, don't record the position)?
2	1525707913	6	You're dealing with two competing priorities:1. A desire to log the position as soon as it's taken2. A desire to provide meaningful commentary to back up the position. I struggle with this myself even without the tool. When the market is moving rapidly, I hop in to update the community on my position and then I'll usually edit the position immediately after to rationalize it.BTC can — and has — moved 5%+ in a matter of minutes. So sometimes it really is important to log your position asap and rationalize it later.
3	1525708534	1	You can create a post just stating your position like normally you do and not use the syntax. When you complete your post, you can then comment on your post with the syntax for the bot. The system will use your main post as link to the position on the site like you if you had put the syntax in the first place.
3	1525709658	1	I realize people are paranoid, and rightly so, but would it be better to have an open source browser extension (no auto updates) that logs your trades automatically? Then you don't have to do anything.
2	1525707769	3	an option could be that we can add our trades directly on the website and dont have to type them here.
3	1525707847	2	Yeah, this is a lot like the flair game that everyone stopped using.
3	1525708260	1	That would be the option to PM the command to the bot on the ToDo list
4	1525710633	1	This is probably the solution that's going to be the least controversial.People like myself who post their positions in the daily thread can continue to do so as we've been doing, and update via PM if we so choose. And anybody who wants to track their position without providing entry/exit rationale can also do so via PM.
2	1525708881	2	Please create a seperate position sticky thread. The post here are just annoying.
3	1525709049	3	There are already 2 sticky threads. We'd have to kill the alt discussion thread... which was implemented by popular demand.
4	1525713070	1	What about a link on the right to the position tracker page and to a post where this commands could be inserted?I could then remove the link from the comments the bot posts and direct users to that "sticky" post
2	1525708086	1	For now those low effort posts are being replied by PM (has to have a least 50 chars to be replied by comment).I can implement stricter rules like the one you suggested without a problem. If users can PM the bot with their position (future update) there is no reason to create this kind of posts, so they would be PM'ed stating that they needed to send the command to the bot.
2	1525709015	1	I really like this idea. No commentary, no entry. Coupled with an automod delete this keeps the thread clean.This plus the devs's proposed PM the bot any commands, allows inclusion of the super high frequency traders who want to keep sending small trades without commentary. TBH I don't see that group of users being very high. Majority of people posting positions here will be people who are willing to also provide commentary, it's just a matter of putting in a control to require it.
1	1525707284	1	what pairs are accepted?Can we post trades on BTC/ETH or LTC? Ist only usd as currency supported? Do i need to convert the eur prices to usd?thanks for your work!
2	1525707733	1	All pairs are allowed, the only issue is the PnL on open positions will be wrong. When you close the position the final PnL should be correct.To use Alt pairs just to the the Altcoin thread and use the commands there.You can have multiple open positions as long as the type/pair are different.
0	1525685004	6	For those that have been asking, here is the schedule for this week from the SEC.gov web site. https://www.sec.gov/news/upcoming-events#upcoming_events_sec_meetingsFrom what I've been reading on the crypto subs, everyone has been expecting some news today?  Doesn't seem to jive with the official schedule of events. 
1	1525686201	3	I'm pretty sure last time the SEC spoke the news was out 12-24 hours before.
0	1525686523	6	Bears are sure clawing down hard today, but ~9270 may just be as far as they can push it. *knocksonwood*
1	1525687292	5	Yeah not that many market sells, but the sell orders keep piling up. My guess is some big players are taking profit while trying to avoid a drop.
1	1525686701	5	No one is worried about BTC right now. Ether is dragging the market right now purely on fundamentals / rumor basis
2	1525687036	5	Not saying I'm worried, but being down about 7% since touching 10k I gotta say I'd like to take another charge at 5 digits again. Also - I believe /r/bitcoinmarkets *does* care about how BTC fares ;)
0	1525691151	3	Difference between Kraken and Bitfinex price is finally negligible, does that mean that BTC found support around 9250 and is consolidating now. It was really hard to trade on Kraken being 100$ cheaper last two days
0	1525693381	3	Quick question. What are the reasons for bitmex settling in BTC and not dollars?Edit. Thanks for the repsonses
1	1525693585	4	They deal with BTC only. No bank accounts that could be frozen ;)
2	1525694460	2	Perfect use case for BTC in itself that
1	1525693643	2	One aspect is surely regulatory. The moment you start operating in USD there is a new level of policing that comes into place
1	1525693923	1	why do they call USD and not USDT in there charts? how can you can lock\-in Fiat funds on Bitmex without USD involved?
2	1525694058	3	You can't lock in fiat funds on Bitmex, unless you are in a short position.They call it USD and not USDT because, well, why not -- there aren't any dollars nor tethers involved, either way. All the balances are in Bitcoin, USD is only there for display purposes. 
3	1525694264	1	thanks, I was reading all the references currently, but it is a bit messed ;\)So it is not possible to provide Fiat funding and stay with your stack in Fiat? You can only provide BTC funding, but if BTC goes down you might loose money, because the BTC value loss is higher than your funding gains? Is this correct? Thank you in advance for a clear answer.On Bitfinex you receive currently 0.13&#37; for providing Fiat funding per day. Wanted to try out Bitmex now, but if I do not have the option to stay in Fiat it is a no\-option to me.
4	1525694885	2	Correct, if you put any BTC onto Bitmex, it will always remain as BTC. The only thing you can do is a 1x leverage short which is close to the same as being in fiat (as your dollar value remains the same if the BTC price goes up while your BTC stack size diminishes). If you're looking to collect funding payslips, Bitfinex is much easier / safer. Unless of course it goes down and tether goes down and everything goes down as some fudsters think it will, but then you're probably fucked either way, be it on Bitfinex or Bitmex.
5	1525695528	1	Thanks for the explanation. So in general everybody who is trading of Bitmex is in a Bitcoin long position, if he has not a open short position.>only thing you can do is a 1x leverage shortIf I do tihs I cannot provide funding at the same time, or?New to this Bitmex concept, still not so clear for me how it can work, if there is nothing involved that functions as a Fiat equity that can be transfered back and forth...
6	1525695756	1	Someone else should correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I remember Bitmex doesn't have a funding feature specifically. Funding is 'socialized' in such a way that if there is an imbalance of longs / shorts, the more crowded side pays the less populated side for funding, and if it was a perfect 50/50 balance there would be no funding fees at all (I think that's how it works anyway, I may be wrong). 
0	1525675908	13	Disclaimer: new to crypto, take everything I say with a salt mine. I mention altcoins a couple of times but this is primarily a bitcoin post. I don’t care about most coins, theyre just there to make me more btc. Surely that counts as btc trading? also, this post is mostly unstructured rambling but my grammar and spelling does suck. like a lot.Nothing like waking up at 4am on a bank holiday, but got shit to do so figured might as well get up and get on with it.Started with restructuring my portfolio again. I seem to do it quite often but I always find new little ways to make it better. Today, I did something I shoulda done a long time ago: differentiate between trades and investments. It’s certainly clean up my portfolio and made it a lot easier to differentiate between coins I actually care about and just stupid shitcoins that make me more bitcoin.I think this coming week, and the month of May, will be pretty awesome for crypto. Ive only been here since September/November so this stuff will just be based on charts. In 2015, may was relatively quiet but june was a bit better. In 2016, may and june were both pretty great and in 2017…. Well 2017 was just crazy in general. There was a fantastic table that someone made, circulated on twitter a lot right at the end of Q1, it showed btc movements split into quarters and Q2 is usually one of the better ones. Shoutout if anyone can find it. Ref: https://www.tradingview.com/x/BUgTJTjp/Okay, so historically, next two months should be pretty fab. I understand that history is no indication of future but this a hype driven, speculative market. For an explosion in a market like this, you need insane buy pressure and then something to pop that pressure. Fuel and ignition (not sure if that metaphor even works). The demand is there imo, we’re all greedy fucks, and I mean that as people in general, not just traders. I theorised before that breaking 10k would create a media onslaught and more FOMO than in Dec/Jan. I think theres a lot of money on sidelines that never left, money that pussied out (or exited smartly) AND two types of money that never entered. Two types imo are those that registered on coinbase/gdax but didn’t buy and those not registered yet but I don’t think it really matters since both of those need a trigger to buy.We have the demand (or fuel) and we just need a spark or trigger to ignite it. I think there’s two pretty good contenders. First of all, the SEC and ETH situation. I think the decision was made a long time behind some closed doors and now it will just get announced that it is not a security. Think of coinbase and circle. Circle had SEC approval before buying poloniex so if ETH was to be a security, I reckon theyd know. Same for coinbase. I don’t know, could be bollocks but still, considering that ETH is lead bull, good ETH news could trigger the whole market.That’s one trigger, second one is Consensus. I think a lot of coins/developers/teams/whatever are waiting for consensus to make announcements. It makes sense as well, why make release news during a bear market when you can just wait and release the news a little bit later at the biggest (?) crypto conference when the market recovers a little bit. Also, id like to find what the correlation is between consensus and may/june being historically good months but im too thick to do that.Now this is the last point im gonna make. Im not into chemistry so this could be bollock and therefore correct me if im wrong but doesn’t pressured fuel burn more than unpressured? I think that right now, crypto is a gas cannister filled with demand and the pressure has been building for ages, just waiting to explode. Reuters talking shit (https://nypost.com/2018/04/27/bitcoin-has-become-boring/) but it shows the lack of volatility. Beautiful twitter thread on this topic: https://twitter.com/carterthomas/status/991129801745317888Closed my short from 9650 at 9340. Made a couple of % and doubled it with funding so not complaining. Was targeting 8600-8400 but I don’t think we’ll go there. Decided im gonna go heavy long on the market as a general but im ready to pull the plug on everything in case of shitty SEC news.TLDR: May/June usually good months, plenty of demand (imo), triggers incoming, built up pressure, going long.
1	1525682889	2	Interesting.  I was thinking even if ETH was classified a security they may get some form of unregistered exemption.  As for the ERC-20 tokens most could have trouble ahead.  I am seriously wondering if XRP will be considered a security.  Surely if it does this could be very good for BTC.  Interested to hear other thoughts on this matter.
2	1525687920	1	I think if ERC20 tokens and XRP are classified as securities it won't be good for crypto across the board, BTC included. A not insignificant amount of buys come from people wanting to get into these tokens, and BTC/ETH is generally the entry point.I think the ICOs were a core driver behind the 2017 bubble actually. I don't think BTC or ETH would have gotten as high as they did last year without them.
1	1525676373	0	Well written.I hope you are right about the SEC situation, I basically have the same thoughts, so I keep my long positions open.I’m still a little worried though, just because IF there’s an announcement that’s not in favor of crypto then I cant even imagine how fast and how low we might go. 
2	1525676863	1	Thanks, little write ups like that help to get all my thoughts together in one place.I do believe that the whole SEC thing is a done deal either way and at this point it will just be an announcement of their decission.I also think that the decission will be positive from the fundamental of ETH not being a security (utility- intended use is gas for ETH machine or some shit- need to look it up) but just the general positviy that SEC and CFTC have shown towards crypto.To play devils advocate, we have just had like 5-6 weeks of green...
0	1525692805	12	The entire idea of crypto is to get away from 'a group of men' making decisions for you. When will this sink in? Don't tread on me.
1	1525693107	5	but instead we all wait for the decisions of the whales that make the real moves
2	1525697142	1	Not if your developing for the network. I speculate too for fun but the tech is even more rewarding IMHO.
1	1525696320	2	Any new idea or ‘revolution’ like this isn’t about taking power away from a group of people for the sake of everyone like in a happy hippie dream. It’s about taking conditions that do not favour you and turning them in your favour. There is a very big difference. 
1	1525693412	2	Getting away from men making decisions about when and with whom I may transact. Price is still subject to market reactions
1	1525693164	1	Such simple but beautiful idea didn’t even appear to be before you said it.That’s so true.
1	1525693637	-1	> The entire idea of crypto is to get away from 'a group of men' making decisions for you.So you entered into a system controlled by 10 Chinese miners and a handful of bucket shop exchanges registered in various non-extraditing countries.  Makes sense, that'll really stick it to "the man".
2	1525696893	2	The segwit battle prooved that the miners are not in control of the system.I have used DEX exchanges so that model is only temporary for onloading.Oh really "stick to the man" paaaleease .
0	1525703389	4	Are people really selling because of a mysterious meeting that we dont even know if is actually happening?
1	1525703546	11	There's a very significant amount of selling pressure right now.There's potentially an SEC meeting taking place right now.Just because the two are occurring at the same time does not mean they are in any way related to one another.
2	1525703735	1	what do you think of the bounce we just had now?
3	1525703840	3	Sellers will see it as an opportunity to load up on shorts while buyers continue to decide they are "le tired" and give up momentarily.EDIT: If buyers push above $9,400, then perhaps $9,175 was the local bottom. If not, strap in for continued downard pressure.
1	1525703566	4	Yes 
0	1525706552	5	Jun and Septembers futures premiums are still too high. They are higher than they were last time we were at these price levels before the run to $10k. To me, that screams that a lot of margin longs opened between $9500 and $10k and they are currently underwater but aren't capitulating yet. I expect we go down until the margin longs capitulate. The market is not gonna give any free rides to $100k\+. 
1	1525706738	11	To me it screams that traders are finally agreeing upon the possibility that the medium-term-bear-trend has reversed. It's certainly higher than it's been in months, but it's not outrageously high if the market truly is consolidating prior to a move up to challenge — and ultimately overcome — $11,700. If anything it's still lower than it should be (particularly on the September contracts).
2	1525706924	4	The premium is certainly not extreme or unsustainable. If we moonshot from here, the premium will only continue to go up. I don't think there is a bear trend of bull trend currently. The bull trend was broken Dec/Jan, the Bear trend was broken in Mid april. I think it's sideways and consolidation time, and I think that during that time, margin traders will be the fish. Right now those fish are majority long. 
3	1525707555	4	Can't disagree with you there. The market could drop well into the $7,000s and still maintain above the log-resistnace-line of the January to April bear trend: https://imgur.com/a/O3Dq7YYIf we were having this conversation on Friday, I'd say you were worrying about nothing and the market was mere hours away from establishing above $10,000 to build a base to attack $11,700. Instead, I think it's probably more likely that the market is gearing up for one last gasp of the bear trend down into the $7,000s.Either way though, I'm fine holding onto my long until breakeven and waiting for a buying opportunity far lower once the log resistance line is confirmed as support.
4	1525707851	3	Right I mean my point is that the premium is double where it was last time we were at these levels. And because what? Because we ran up to $10k and bounced off? Feels like bull trap central.\> Either way though, I'm fine holding onto my long until breakeven and waiting for a buying opportunity far lower once the log resistance line is confirmed as support. I notice you include a lot of this sunk cost fallacy in your decision making lately. I'm not trying to criticize your trading, and I love what you bring to this community, but this is just one of my pet peeves. Entries are irrelevant. What matters is the current market and the current trade you make now. You are choosing to be long right now, and where you break even is irrelevant. Longing right now and closing at your 8.8k entry price is no different of a trade than you staying in your long and closing at 8.8k. You are essentially treating your profits on your current trade as not real money and acting accordingly. 
5	1525708800	3	I'm glad you brought this up, and it's an important criticism. For me the primary reason I'm continuing to hold this trade rather than taking profit and rebuying lower is because I simply can't monitor it 24 hours a day. I'd been saying for awhile that there would come a time when spot would move up 10% and June futures would move up 15%. And we more or less saw that exact scenario play out over the weekend. The spot market moved from $9,000 to $9,950 while June futures moved from $9,000 to $10,400. I didn't know whether that would happen at 3:00 am my time or 5:00 pm my time. But I knew I wanted to be holding a long before it did happen. And futures could still continue to diverge from spot if the market breaks up here and continues towards $10,000 again. The last thing I went to do is close my existing position and enter a new one higher. So I'm willing to take risk on an open position, because the reward is likely to be magnified.
4	1525707835	1	Chew is there a technical reason you would close at break-even ($8,800) or is it more because it is your break-even point?
5	1525708327	2	From a technical standpoint, the "better" location for a stop loss would be around $8,550 or so:https://imgur.com/a/hZgnC3kSo for this trade, $8,800 is mostly just significant because it's roughly the location of my entry.However, provided the premium on June futures maintains at ~$200 above spot if/when the market gets down below $9,000, my stop actually won't trigger until $8,550 or so.
6	1525708466	1	Good stuff, thanks for explaining.

0	1525713346	5	I have one comment to the whole Bill Gates/Buffet/old grandpas with privileged background dramas.Look at who entered the bitcoin market, who made over 1 billion competing with the Bank of England foolishly trying to defend the pound on the free market,  never gets married to any position/investment and can change his mind 10 times per day and is one of the best hedge fund managers and speculators of our age.Also think of who media hates vs loves, vs who makes money in those markets and not. Then the answer who to listen to and not is quite easy.
1	1525713513	4	What if Bitcoin is rat poison squared simply because the rotten, corrupt banking establishment is full of, and ran by rats... :O
2	1525714282	-1	He knows BTC is the future. He’s just salty because he knows he’ll be dead soon and will never see it. Fuck Warren Buffet and the whole rotten to the core banking system. 
3	1525714628	2	Downvoted for blasphemy.
1	1525713612	6	It's a good thing that Bitcoin doesn't function within the markets they dominate.It's a bit like using Stephen Hawking as your primary source on AI.
2	1525713937	-3	AI's another overhyped tech
3	1525713982	8	Classic non sequitur. Much troll. Very upvote.
3	1525716044	1	look into bayesian inference. Do your research
1	1525714504	5	Gates and Buffet are self made men and can absolutely say whatever they want, they have earned their opinions a thousand fold. That said, it's just opinions that the media likes to overdramatize. I don't think either of them cares much about crypto, and I don't think anyone can really say at this point if they are right or wrong. It's just media getting your clicks and attention. 
2	1525714959	-2	Gates is not a self\-made man. He got his money by having the government enforce absurd IP laws to destroy his potential competitors. All he did was making and maintaining a mediocre OS. Which was impressive at the time, but not billions\-of\-dollars\-impressive. The government did 90&#37; of the work.
3	1525715333	4	He was also born into an already multi-millionaire family and thus never had to worry about actually sustaining himself when he started Microsoft.Not to undermine his achievements, but he is not rags to riches.
0	1525697151	10	Not enough panic over what we saw last night. I'd be wary about this being a bull trap.Go to the 2014 chart and overlay it onto 2017 to current. Shorters must be licking their  chops.
1	1525699812	9	> Go to the 2014 chart and overlay it onto 2017 to currentNo. 
1	1525699613	1	the longs that we all saw pour into the market 2 weeks ago want to pretend like they're all hardcore 10 year hodlr's.You see some article about a big buy and it's some chinese multimillionaire daytrader gambling with a larger stack calling himself an 'investor'.
2	1525702214	1	Bingo. Except at 10000 coins, you can't really dump that many on the market without significant slippage so they would dump over time or OTC it. We are all just remoras hanging on to the whales.
3	1525702678	1	the OTC markets aren't as liquid as exchanges and can dry up in a snap, if that happens they'll panic dump on an exchange.  Fear of getting caught by their govt may actually force them to hodl and ride it out, lol.
4	1525703814	1	I personally know a couple OTC desk guys, it's not drying up at all. They are raising minimums though, which is interesting
5	1525704339	1	it's not now.  But when it does OTC gets very illiquid.  That's the problem with 'dark markets'.  There's a reason exchanges were invented in the first place.  are the buyers chinese, or middlemen likely buying for chinese?  If so that $$ is likely going to an exchange as collateral for margin to speculate not for storage.
0	1525703196	7	I'm starting to think this is just another buying opportunity before the eventual breakout over 10k. Reminds me of how annoying it was when trying to break 3k and 5k.  kept on thinking it would break up but always failed.  but then that one time it did break and it was awesome and i regretted not buying more
1	1525703621	2	the person who just bought 700 BTC on BFX at $9,200 seems to agree with you

0	1525690203	4	If there is one thing that is sure today, is it that SEC insiders already placed their bets and will make a lot of money very soon 
1	1525690768	4	Im assuming GS doesnt announce a BTC desk w/o being well aware of the regulatory landscape and/or helping to create it.Based on that Im fairly confident the regulation will not target btc directly.  I assume, based on previous rumblings from the SEC, that this will likely crush alts with a particular focus on scam coins.  That may hurt ETH just because so many have been built on it.  The real question is does ETH fall into the ruling or not - LTC? XRP?  the line they draw will either have to be very subjective and grey or they will hurt some of their own (remember big banks and companies are part of both ETH and XRP investments).
2	1525690945	2	Gotta stop thinking Bitcoin is somehow separate from the rest of the crypto market. A big reason for Bitcoin's price increases recently (in my opinion it's the main reason, but even if you disagree with that, you can't ignore this point entirely) is the overall increase of trading volume / attention on crypto markets. If the crypto market overall suffers, so will Bitcoin, there's no way around that. Any kind of negative regulations *will* impact Bitcoin negatively, even if they don't target Bitcoin specifically. 
3	1525691403	3	Eh, bitcoin while tied to the others, is in a separate class.  No others have professional retail trading desks being setup - bitcoin has several.  No others have US regulated futures - bitcoin has 2.  No others have significant real world economic integration - bitcoin has over 144,000 at last count.  So while there is correlation in speculation of the alt market, bitcoin has both a buffer, from real world integration, and a huge defensive position, from multiple professional/retail regulated exchange opportunities.  Additionally, there is little indication the SEC will impose truly (ban all coins) negative regulation on cryptos.  They will put standard protections in place in an attempt to stop scams.  Im hoping there is a lot more in the way of clarity which will cause a boom in the market (yes with some winners and losers as a result but long term positive).  If you look back 2-3 year, basically every time the SEC or Finra came out with clarifying guidance the market shot up.  Because low and behold, money likes certainty, stability, and regulations that encourage it.
4	1525691848	1	I'm not saying Bitcoin is the same thing as XRP or some shit like ExperiencePoints or something, but its price is highly correlated to trading volumes in all that garbage. Significant real world integration of Bitcoin? Please, 'real world' use of Bitcoin is completely dwarfed by the trading volumes on exchanges and OTC. I am not saying regulations are bad for the market long term, or that wiping out some of the bullshit ICOs is a bad thing -- but if market confidence suffers, Bitcoin *will* suffer as well, even though the percentage losses in Bitcoin value would be lower than those in Ethereum or whatever coins affected by whatever rulings. Any kind of scenario where SEC comes out with any kind of restrictive measures that make fiat onramps more difficult or limit trading in whatever other way resulting in a net gain for Bitcoin in the short term, until the market adapts to the new regulatory framework and trading volumes recover, is completely implausible. 
5	1525692292	1	Again...look back. Every time the sec has made clarifying statements you have been proven wrong. The market reacts positively. This means your stated opinion is based on an objective ignorance about the impact of regulations in this merky market.  I only state what I state because I've watch this at least a dozen times now. Stop trying to push your biased gut opinion and start looking at data. Edit: and we'll see. Maybe they go really harsh and this truly hurts crypto, but nothing I've seen to date indicates that. 
6	1525692906	1	So when did we have any 'clarifying statements' from SEC that were anti-crypto / anti-altcoin and led to altcoin dumps while seeing Bitcoin climb at the same time?
7	1525705903	1	They havent had any clarifying anti-crypto statements except the times they said they are securities etc.  Not that I think thats anti-crypto but some have thought that.  Thats a huge part of my point... evidence doesnt support your FUD approach to this.
8	1525711935	1	What FUD approach? Are you sure you are replying to the same things that I'm typing?All I'm saying is that IF the SEC statement is negative to any significant portion of the market, then Bitcoin would also be affected. I never said I think it will be negative, or things would dump hard in reaction to whatever SEC might say, or anything of the sort. I'm just saying that Bitcoin isn't in some sort of an impenetrable bubble, and it DOES react to any significant fundamental market news whether things are 'aimed directly at Bitcoin' or not. 
2	1525691003	1	I think it's still too early for regulatory bodies to swing baseball bats around. But it's coming.
0	1525700170	4	As I posted elsewhere, I had my all-in 8x long from 9280ish close overnight at 9790 on a profit-stop. My Sept futures long from 6410 finally also closed on a profit stop at 9890 (knew I should have taken 10400). Between the two, I doubled the stack from where it was last week. This drop has been precipitous, and it's starting to feel like do or die. I'm opening with the profits here near the bottom of a falling wedge, above pretty solid historical support of 9250-9300.

That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.

0	1525697600	8	https://www.tradingview.com/x/v205IZdZ/Looks like a second bear flag being printed here with rejections from the EMA12 on the hourly.I think we're seeing the beginning of the weekly trend reversal to begin setting that higher low.  However, the market will want to see the daily lower high first.  I'm guessing a pretty classic H&S will be forming here to confirm the reversal.  I could see the second bear flag breaking to the 8900-9000 range with a rally over the next 24-48 hours up to 9400-9600 and a failure to close above that price which will signal the end of the weekly impulse and the beginning of the weekly correction.My target still remains ~7500 for the weekly higher low.

1	1525703594	2	No, Bitmex has also had a premium. It's because USD funding has been really expensive lately.

0	1525669949	4	Looks like we are heading for another attempt of 9.2... anybody thinks it’s a good place to open a new long entry or will be going further down?
1	1525671562	1	r/r on a long here is decent. We moved down quite sharply, and most shorter timeframes look like there should be at least some temporary relief. That said, longs still heavily outnumber shorts and it's not like short term oversold HAS to bounce up; keep an eye on where things go or set tight stops if you do go long here, and be ready to reduce leverage / take profits early if we do bounce a bit. 
2	1525674320	1	Where do you go to determine longs vs shorts? And if, in this example, there are way more longs than shorts, is there more pressure for the price to go down because those longs will get liquidated so market makers have more incentive to push the price down? Is there such a thing as a "long squeeze" that fuels a move downward like a short squeeze pushes the price upward?
3	1525675994	2	datamish.com or https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS / https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDLONGS to see margin positions. And yes, long squeeze 'can' be a thing if pushed enough, although longs tend to be a bit more resilient since there's always a limit to how much a long can lose and it is easier to protect; a short can have infinite potential downside so people are more likely to get out of losing shorts faster. 
4	1525707122	1	Thanks for the info. When looking at the charts, 30489 for longs and 20257 for shorts. Is this the amount of shorts vs longs opened currently on bitfinex? Does it take into account the amount the people are shorting, is that reflected in the size of the candles? 
5	1525712011	1	It's the amount of coins currently held in long / short positions. 30489 longs means there is a total of 30489 coins bought on margin, for all we know that could be one single big margin position, or 300k positions sized 0.1 BTC each, or anything in between; likewise for shorts. 
1	1525670860	2	If 9.2 breaks, 9k isn't too far away. If 9 breaks, then it's likely there will be more selling to 8.8(ish). 8.6 isn't far from that and if that breaks, then most will probably dump and go short.
2	1525671128	14	6.8 is not too far from 8.6.

1	1525686412	7	Ok. so you trade on BEAR Posts?
0	1525675202	3	In the aftermath of the Mt. Gox incident, the prevailing theology was "Don't leave your coins on an exchange." It has been a while since a major exchange incident. Do not forget the possibility that your exchange of choice could at any point no longer offer access to "your funds." When the assets leave your hands, they are no longer yours. While today's pending SEC statement on Ethereum may or may not have a major impact on Bitcoin markets, it is vital to remember the possibility of SEC enforcement action and any possible ramifications. Until legislative action clarifies the status of other currencies, and as long as major exchanges are handling assets that may be classified as unregistered securities, the entire crypto space remains in jeopardy. This is not FUD, but merely an attempted wake up call to the masses oblivious to such potential market influence. Again, today's expected statement may not be detrimental in any way to markets, however, realize the potential. If an exchange is participating in the sale of unregistered securities, the SEC can come in at any \(business day\) moment and freeze the assets of that exchange. I'm just asking you to consider the blowback of such an event, and realize it as a possibility. The SEC would love for new legislation to clarify if a coin that had an ICO in 2014 is a security. Until then they are forced to enforce the law as it stands. Contact your politicians; State the need for comprehensive securities reform to reflect new and changing asset classes. and: Don't leave your coins/fiat with an exchange. 
1	1525677987	5	So I'm not disagreeing with you (not entirely, anyway), but let's not forget that majority of exchanges aren't based in the US, and majority of their customers aren't American. There are certainly risks with keeping your coins on an exchange, but there's no way in hell SEC can 'freeze' the assets of, say, Binance or something. 
2	1525680329	2	hm, for me that actually makes me even more wary of leaving stuff on their exchanges. I trust gdax over pretty much any other exchange 
2	1525678857	1	Sure the US gov't can do something like that.  They went in and raided BTC-E and forced Bitfinex and BitMEX not to accept US customers, etc.  They can do whatever they want.
1	1525684840	2	>It has been a while since a major exchange incidentTheres been bitgrail (170M) and coincheck (530M) recently, both of which are in the same order of mt gox (470M).Ofcourse the proportional value to marketcap was much higher back then, but these are quite major exchange fiascos
1	1525683199	1	> State the need for comprehensive securities reform to reflect new and changing asset classes.Which is what exactly? These ICOs should be as regulated as any other security. Why should they be treated differently?
1	1525697249	1	Before Mt. Gox, prevailing wisdom was to keep your coins off exchange. Everyone who lost coins there had heard that they needed to store their own coins on their own wallet.

1	1525694210	1	I'm not much into TA, but if I read this correctly, it's a rising wedge and if it breaks down we can expect the price to drop by at least $1,200 from the breakout price (height of wedge measured at base). In which case, we're looking at $8,100 or below.

1	1525684829	3	We are in the middle of a bear flag,  9320 in this very moment. Failed four times to break the top of this flag, broke the major ascending wedge (although i think this is quite week) and are overing the more important low bnoundary of the major wedge that formed following mid-april short squeeze. We are in the 5th green week in a row from mid april with 20 SMA curving over us. MACD is turning red, upward momentum is gone.

0	1525695054	4	Every single person who has bought and held for six months or more is in profit.

2	1525696320	5	Well at least you had fun....right?
2	1525696425	3	What a difference one month makes. That December was on steroids. Now it’s so obvious such growth wasn’t sustainable. 
3	1525700493	2	It was obviously unsustainable back then as well. The only open question at the time was how far up it would go.
1	1525695487	7	That’s true but losing ~~80%~~70% of profits at one point isn’t exactly something to be proud about even if it turned out ok. If you are a smart buyer you need to be a smart seller too. There’s really little excuse not to have sold at 17k after we failed to make a higher high after the first correction. (I myself haven’t but I won’t make that mistake again, even though I’m still sitting on a very nice profit from my initial buys it was stupid not to take some profits there). 
2	1525695695	5	>here’s really little excuse not to have sold at 17k at 17k it was not sure that we failed to make a higher high. that only became clear with the next hard break down. 
3	1525695837	1	Yes, I used just that as a point of reference. 
2	1525696186	3	I agree that in hindsight, $17K would have been a good place to sell.

2	1525705439	1	dude, I have done so much backtesting of seemingly every strategy imaginable, and I have yet to find one where I benefited from a straight-up stop loss.  The best compromise that I've found so far is that when the price hits my stop, it requires some sort of short term reversal (like the 5 min RSI hitting 70) before selling.
3	1525709470	1	I played around with backtests using chandelier exits sized with multiples of ATR that did alright.

If that happens, will we set another higher low?

2	1525697458	1	Wouldn't you think that a new investor would not jump into alt's right away? Always considered GDAX and coinbase an "entry drug" to crypto markets.
3	1525699025	2	idk, but I think Binance is higher ranked in the app store in most countries than coinbase, which has been the case since the alt bubble in Dec as far as I'm aware. 
4	1525699124	2	Good point did not think of that!
0	1525715934	-1	Guys, let’s be honest.If you had the money to gamble a massive short and still be rich if you were wrong, you would short the shit out of this bubble tooI love Bitcoin, but I would short the shit out of it if it didnt kill me inside
1	1525716200	1	to successfully short you need to dispel the thoughts of 100k per btc and ground yourself more in reality. Not saying it WON'T happen, but if you don't, you'll forever be underwater in your margins
0	1525682423	1	Warning: bullish hopium tinfoil hat conspiracy bullshit ahead.If you were trying to accumulate a large amount of coins (say, tens of thousands or more), wouldn't it make sense to keep USD as collateral and buy long on margin instead, to paint a picture of overbought margin longs and plant seeds of doubt in any competing buyer's mind as price keeps going up with your big fat buys? Then if / when someone tries to run a stop hunt for your longs, you happily continue to scoop up the coins and eventually convert your margin longs into actual coins with your collateral USD to cause the next fomo surge as thousands of longs close without dropping the price at all.
1	1525682473	4	Sure, unless much bigger whales are doing the opposite against you.
2	1525683223	1	If you're determined to buy X amount of coins regardless, doesn't really matter what other whales are doing, does it? 
2	1525685484	1	shouldn't that play to your advantage though?
1	1525685530	2	or you can massive short futures that you break them and break the price then buy all these longs that get margin called below market price. happened on okex but the trades were reversed.
2	1525685628	1	Massive shorts are risky, though. If enough capital calls you out on your bullshit, you stand to lose a lot. 
1	1525682654	3	Maybe there could be such games a year or longer ago. Now it's filled with pro algos that don't give a shit and just grind out money from noobs(amateurs, like us). No need to overthink it
1	1525689877	1	you'd just buy OTC...Also...why now? 
0	1525670710	1	Can someone explain why my 5&#37; profits on my long were less than my 1&#37; loss on a short play? I put the same amount at risk at the same leverage. 
1	1525675036	2	>Can someone explain why my 5% profits on my long were less than my 1% loss on a short play? I put the same amount at risk at the same leverage. >For the 5% profits long:>Entry price: 9279.5>Closed at 9332.0>For the 1% short loss>Entry price: 9278.5>Closed at 9293.5Looks like 10x margin orders? I would check your order history for swap funding rates, that's likely the culprit. Side note: Which timeframes are you trading on? Closing a position after a 0.1% movement seems a bit odd for those not churning maker rebates. 
1	1525670997	1	Maybe.  can you look at your transaction history and tell me what the open and close were for each of these trades.  
2	1525672067	1	For the 5&#37; profits long:Entry price: 9279.5Closed at 9332.0For the 1&#37; short lossEntry price: 9278.5Closed at 9293.5
3	1525672360	1	That's not a 5% and 1% movement...and your position size directly affects your profits...
1	1525671235	1	What exchange, what instrument (XBTUSD/swaps on bitmex?) and how long was the position open for? Need position size and entry and exit for both positions
1	1525671573	1	you probably paid a lot in funding. Also shorts profit more due to the inverse contract.
2	1525672089	1	ahh i see. 
0	1525675883	1	Anyone having problems with Kraken deposits?Just sent some XRP to Kraken, Txid confirmed but Kraken doesn't add the funds. Already contacted support. 
1	1525682790	1	> elp toBe patient. Kraken sometimes need a little time to add it to your account. 
1	1525694067	1	Solved, took +-5 hours.
0	1525701788	1	What time is the SEC expected to announce something?
1	1525701941	9	it is not expected to announce anything today. at least there is no source for that. more down you find a source which actually says, that it can take month or even a year for a decision.
2	1525701968	4	Oh wow ok, bit of an anti climax then
1	1525702444	8	THis is a meme with no fact based support at all. There is no source to this rumor. There is nothing at all to suggest a critical ruling will happen this morning. This meme was completely fabricated over the weekend.
0	1525702219	0	!short XBTUSD close 9200
1	1525702368	0	!short XBTUSD 9350 1x 33&#37;
0	1525703106	1	my guess once this meeting is done with and it turns out to be a nothinburger(for BTC at least, ETH might get fucked)....we'll head back upbut if not, for me if this drops below $8800 I'll close my long on the bounce
1	1525703380	4	While it shouldn't necessarily be the case, if ETH gets rekt, BTC is going to also, at least in the short term. 
0	1525707162	-6	BTC is one of the greatest trading vehicles ever.  A turd that will not flush.  Buy as it in the vortex headed to the drain.  Sell as it rises like a submarine from the depths.  
1	1525707903	9	I understand the technology may be hard for you to understand, but it is certainly not a turd. 
1	1525709609	1	Make all preparations for surfacing!
0	1525691660	0	Anyone got a link to the SEC hearing today? It was streamed live last time
1	1525692043	7	It’s closed doors.
2	1525692290	3	Someone should go and periscope it :D
2	1525692133	1	Cool, thanks for clarifying 
1	1525691992	2	i dont think there will be a meeting , just an announcement tho i cant find anything about it at all on their site.
2	1525692123	1	Ah ok, I heard 3pm GMT but not sure if that is the announcement or start time. Will have to just wait and see I guess 
0	1525703722	0	[removed]
1	1525703770	2	This is old.
0	1525710502	-3	This smells like a major bull trap. Am I alone on this?
1	1525710721	14	Well, right now it's just a 2.5% bounce off the local low. So it's pretty much a nothing event so far, regardless of which way the market continues in the short term.
1	1525713130	9	> Am I alone on this?Yes.
