0	1525630499	4	> does the liquidation price shown (on Bitfinex) take this potential drop in the value of my collateral/equity into account or should I calculate my actual liquidation price manually?it doesn't -- if you're long while using that coin as a collateral, your liquidation price will increase as the coin drops, since I believe it's calculated relative to current USDT price. so yes you should solve for it by hand.
1	1525630612	1	Ok cool. Good to know. Thank you.
2	1525639872	1	The safer option is to use fiat and go long x long
0	1525646619	3	I actually calculated it already a few days ago. The formula is quite complex.Let's say you Margin Trade BTC/USD and you have both USD and BTC in you Margin Wallet. I'll call :* USD : Number of USD in your Margin Wallet* BTC : Number of BTC in your Margin Wallet* PV : Size of the position (in BTC).* EP : Entry Price (in USD)**Long** : 0.5*(SQRT(-1472000*PV^2 *USD *ABS(PV *EP)+846400*PV^2 *ABS(PV *EP)^2 +640000*PV^2 *USD^2 )-BTC*(920*ABS(PV *EP)-800*USD)) / (400*PV^2 -400*BTC^2 )**Short** : 0.5*(SQRT(1088000*PV^2 *USD*ABS(PV*EP)+462400*PV^2 *ABS(PV*EP)^2 +640000*PV^2 *USD^2 )-BTC*(-680*ABS(PV*EP)-800*USD))/(400*PV^2 -400*BTC^2 )Sqrt is Square Root and Abs is Absolute Value.Don't ask me how I got these results. Too lazy to explain.EDIT : Formatting
1	1525679825	1	Never thought of this before, this is actually a great formula !
1	1525691173	1	This is very useful. Thanks!
1	1525701226	0	What the fuck, you just have to maintain 30% of entry position. How does it translate to this cluster fuck of constants

3	1525715639	1	Please do - I'm interested.
0	1525636887	4	As other have said, it's not included. Further, be aware of stop hunting, and notice that occasionally long wicks will appear which may indicate successful stop hunted liquidations. A good defense against stop hunting is a diversified portfolio where it's unlikely that every asset can be stop hunted at the same time. 
1	1525692026	1	Good point. The leverage is just to hedge my portfolio and I'm using fiat as collateral too, so I have a long way to go to liquidation.I'm just looking to fully understand how these things are calculated to ensure that, in the case of a dump, I've mitigated any risk of liquidation, even with stop hunting/long wicks.The replies that I've received so far have clarified things for me.

1	1525629246	10	Thanks, but not particularly helpful.
1	1525633828	1	Yes leave all the money on the table for guys like me. 
1	1525643624	-1	This is partially correct.  Margin trading is dangerous.   If you are new at margin trading, never trade more than 10% of your fiat balance.  Even after you are a "pro" never trade more than half your balance.This is to help you reduce your risk and learn the how the market moves.  It's just like gambling.  You wouldn't throw down $100 on black in roulette unless you were willing to lose it all, because you still have $1k in your pocket.  (Or because it's 6am and you're wasted... /ts ðŸ¤£)
