1	1525708551	4	IOTA seems to have had some high profile issues early on which put them in the "reckless" column with their development practices.In general, I think the dag-coin concept could be a very good one for low-value settlement, but as far as I know, you need to download the entire tangle to validate... so it's going to get hard to run a validating node... not sure if they care about this. edit: also, I think the whole "IOT" marketing angle is stupid.
1	1525710653	3	What's the deal with the Coordinator these days? The impression I got was it was a very hand wavy way to essentially have a single central resolver for transaction conflicts, with many promises to eventually have it be dictated by oracles or something once the network grew?
2	1525712006	3	I don't think IOTA has figured out how to make the network secure without the Coordinator.If they had, they could give specific criteria for when it will be removed.
1	1525693971	1	I'm not a real bitcoiner, but I think IOTA might suffer from their adversarial relationship with researchers:https://hoskinsoncharles.blogspot.jp/2018/03/an-ode-to-critics-iota-and-dci.html
2	1525696214	2	Did you read the comments below the article? Do it.Researchers in a conflict of interest are not real researchers anymore.
3	1525702710	5	> Researchers in a conflict of interest are not real researchers anymore.That's crazy. The pursuit of truth stands on its own. It doesn't matter who is contributing to this effort, or what their biases.

Wait for an official statement: [https://www.sec.gov/news/pressreleases](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressreleases) The SEC has already made clear the jurisdictional obligations. If you are exchanging coins that may be considered securities OR doing business with companies that do, please consider the potential legal implications and any potential results of an enforcement action. 
1	1525687342	5	All I’ve heard is there will be a closed door meeting and haven’t heard anything about there being an announcement. Where is the source for said announcement? 
2	1525713025	1	Copy/paste of a comment I made elsewhere, responding to the same question:Best I could find. Not very solid though. Makes me think it's just a working meeting and will be a great big nothingburger.[\*link\*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/worlds-second-most-valuable-cryptocurrency-under-regulatory-scrutiny-1525167000)From a little over halfway through:>	A working group of regulators including senior SEC and CFTC officials are scheduled to discuss the matter on May 7, one of the people said.
1	1525668849	5	Are you sure about that? Source? 
1	1525668968	3	What is the argument for classifying it as a commodity? It's fully established that it was an ICO and it's mutable (at the will and whim of Ethereum Foundation). How is that a commodity? It's an unregulated security, undoubtedly.
2	1525714035	1	hmm.. then the www is an unregulated security. obviously . so is windows os .. people use it to add their own software on top of it . /s
3	1525714254	1	> then the www is an unregulated security.What are you talking about?>so is windows os .. people use it to add their own software on top of it.Double what? Windows is a product, not a security.Seriously though, what on Earth are you talking about? Do you know what a security is?
4	1525714838	1	eth is a utility . the state of wyoming passed a law:"The Utility Token bill was designed to exempt specific cryptocurrencies from state money transmission laws and is the first of its kind to legally define the way in which specific types of crypto tokens are treated by regulatory bodies. The bill excludes “developers or sellers” of tokens from securities laws under the caveat that they meet certain conditions. In order to meet these requirements, the token must not be offered as an investment and must be a vehicle for exchange as a utility token."https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwolfson/2018/03/13/u-s-state-of-wyoming-defines-cryptocurrency-utility-tokens-as-new-asset-class/#26cde0e74816eth is a utility called gas used by other tokens that ride on top of it . and it is Web 3.0 ..
5	1525715398	1	> eth is a utility . the state of wyoming passed a law:Lol, you think the SEC is bound by Wyoming legislation? Lmao.>In order to meet these requirements, the token must not be offered as an investment and must be a vehicle for exchange as a utility token."Lol. Even the article you linked said that the SEC defines ICOs are securities and they're still working out the details. Did you even read the article.ETH is undoubtedly a security. There's no other way to spin its sale and purpose. The Ethereum foundation auctioned off coins (just like a security) and the coins represent "shareholder" value within Ethereum Foundation. They are completely in control of ETH and have made several super-obvious changes to design and issuance. It's a centralized security, end of story. There's no way you can spin this to make the SEC see it differently. I remember many a months ago warning people in ETHTrader that regulation and crackdown was incoming and proponents made the same tired arguments of "no, it can't be so. Bitcoin is a commodity so Ether must be too." Only time will tell but it's readily apparent that these are two entirely different types of "crypto" assets. I would be astonished if the SEC *didn't* regulate ETH (and other ICOs/ERC20 tokens) as a security. 
1	1525709434	1	Thank you for the link.
1	1525711956	1	I highly doubt anything as big as classification happens today. I think all they are doing today is figuring out who does what.  With bitcoin already falling under the CFTC, my guess is that rest of crypto will as well.  SEC will do their job of goimg after the sale of unregistered securities, protecting retail investors and going after illicit activities.  That would include clarifying the ICO prosses and regulating exchanges.  I just hope they realize that a recent innovation might not fit a securities act that has been around since 1933.  Based on what I have heard from those closer to the process, there is very little chance that ETH is declared a security for a multitude of reasons despite the obvious characteristics it has of one.  
0	1525682683	2	If ico's die is it a good or bad thing for bitcoin short term?Having your shithead meth cooking neighbor explode, is kinda a nuanced topic, and I'm wondering what people think which way it would go.
1	1525683701	2	if ico's die there will be Airdropped tokens just like EOS is doing, thats why it's up today.It should be a good thing cause if more airdrops happen more people will want their found in their own wallet, what will lead to more dex.

Compare that to the 798,894 shorts, which has held relatively constant since April 1, and it gets a bit scary.XRPUSD still maintains a huge long:short ratio, but because less are underwater, there has not been a singificant long closure there yet.XRPBTC long:short ratio is 27:1 and the XRPUSD long:short ratio is still 9.4:1.On April 25th, there was a candle that touched $0.49USD when 15M XRPUSD longs closed. At the same time, the XRPBTC price fell 15%. Those XRPUSD longs reopened, but the price has not recovered, in part due to the BTCUSD rise in the intervening period.If the ratios start to rebalance, or if more people get pushed under water on their longs, look for a cascade that will plummet the price. Barring hidden buy walls, closing 20% of the XRPUSD longs would clear the order Bitfinex order book down to $0.20.Similarly, if a further 25% of the existing XRPBTC longs closed, it would clear the Bitfinex order book down to 0.We may be looking at a flash crash within the next month. If you are confident that XRP will rebound after that kind of potential crash, you may want to put in some *ridiculously* low limit buys.
0	1525714935	1	https://twitter.com/abercrombiezie/status/993524947061370880EOS just sent 209k ETH ($155 million to Bitfinex).  Dan Larimer is about to play some hardball.  Things are going to get interesting for ETH and EOS.These are the transactions referenced in the tweet, I scrolled through a lot of pages to find these:https://etherscan.io/address/0x2c2fb0313bd5120aa5d5bea20ea07e22e565c6b4
1	1525715671	2	what does this indicate? 
0	1525666581	-6	Found an interesting [recursion glitch in BCH](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8hevlq/rbitcoin_user_suggesting_that_someone_one_day/dykjofd/?context=10000). And these people complain about /r/Bitcoin.

1	1525699739	2	Two rooms full of children arguing. If you want to having meaningful discussion, the Reddit comments section probably has a low success rate.
2	1525706627	1	Actually, I began replying with that *because* discussion with the guy turned meaningless, or rather was intentionally meaningless by him from the start.Should I have just let it go? Yeah. But there's no effort in replying 'keep up the charade' whenever I get a message from the guy, and besides, I stopped reading what he wrote.
3	1525707552	0	Lol, what? I asked you a handful of pointed questions that you couldn't/wouldn't answer so you just started repeating that phrase. Even others in the sub were ridiculing and chastising you for it. There's no way to spin this that doesn't make you look incredibly childish. 
4	1525707859	1	Keep up the charade..Edit: None of what the guy just said is true, btw. In case anyone reading wants to bother looking into it.
5	1525707943	0	*cringe*
3	1525714145	1	Reddit has a ignore feature 
3	1525714481	1	> I stopped reading what he wrote.Classy. No wonder you seemingly didn't understand anything. Because you didn't even bother to read it. Illiteracy is a great excuse though!
