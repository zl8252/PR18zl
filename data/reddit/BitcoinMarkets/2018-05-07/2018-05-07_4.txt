Its a little maddening.edit: New York is the primary one here, but also this:"Shortly after the regulations were signed into law, exchanges such as Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Kraken, and Poloniex pulled out of the state, and informed Washington customers they needed to take their business elsewhere."https://www.geekwire.com/2017/new-bitcoin-regulations-shake-washington-states-cryptocurrency-industry/It's a little crazy as Bittrex is based in Seattle WA and Seattle is a major tech hub...
