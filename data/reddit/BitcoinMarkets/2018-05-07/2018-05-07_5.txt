1	1525715149	1	Thanks for the constructive criticism!  
1	1525715283	1	oh... wait... now it makes sense...  you're a BCasher!

0	1525715199	1	http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/287/You seem like the newcomer based on the misinformation you are posting.Secondly, you have somehow managed to completely interpret everything that represents BTC in an inverse manner.Let's start at the first obvious error. BTC is not designed to be a store of value. Nowhere in the whitepaper (you know the small thing that summarizes the goals and purpose of BTC) does it state it is meant to be a store of value. The property of BTC to become a store of value is a secondary effect of it being a deflationary, P2P electronic cash. So make no mistake, that is the hypothetical you should be focusing on, and I'm sorry to say, no one cares which one you would prefer to lock your money up for 20 years. That has little bearing on the core feature of BTC, and that is also simply ignoring the fact that it would probably be a bad idea anyways no matter what investment.And why do people need to "do something" with their Bitcoin? Because if there aren't people "doing" things with their Bitcoin, what utility does BTC provide? Without natural demand for things for people to "do" with Bitcoin, how the fuck do you expect it to achieve it's primary goal of being P2P digital currency, let alone hold value?Next, onward to SPV and full-nodes. Regardless of if you run a full-node or not, you still ask for permission unless you mine the block yourself (so millions of dollars). You don't add the transaction to the block, you literally ask for permission (broadcast) and pay a fee as an incentive and if every miner collectively blacklisted your address, you could do nothing about it. You insist there is a "trusted 3rd party" that is relied upon in the use of SPV, please tell me who I am relying on if I wait for more confirmations? This is even fielding the argument that someone going to host hundreds of a rogue nodes in an attempt to beguile you out of your chump change. For simply sending payments, your ridiculous scenario of "asking permission" relies on the inability to locate a single honest node?Maybe you should again, read section 8 of the goddamn whitepaper. I'll give you a hint, it is titled>8. Simplified Payment Verification And the first line is>It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.Edit: It's dupe, not doupIt's Gresham's not Grisham'sI don't trust Ver, Wright and certainly not Adam "I would gladly pay $100 transactions fees if it came to it" Back
