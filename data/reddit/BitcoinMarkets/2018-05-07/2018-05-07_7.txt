1	1525675247	1	Thanks,  I'm not savvy enough to write my own bot but I appreciate the answer.
0	1525652337	1	Can do it with binance
1	1525675172	1	Thank you.  Could you elaborate on how or do you have a link?
0	1525673133	1	Sure. Prepare to lose money. 
1	1525675210	1	Could you elaborate on this?  First by explaining how and second on why you would expect me to lose money for limiting my losses?
2	1525709153	1	Well, you might, if you're really good at it. Otherwise better traders, with more capital, know the stop-limit game and how to profit it off of it. You see all those really long wicks on charts?
