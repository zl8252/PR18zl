2	1525675221	1	Of course, last time bitfinex was hacked 36% of your lending balance was gone within seconds. So you were lending $100k feeling like a genius and them boom you lose $36000 instantly. So yeah...They managed to repay with time most of it but many people sold their debt at a loss before that.If some deal looks too good to be true its because it is. Take the risk into account when judging the rates.
