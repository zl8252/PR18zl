0	1525791778	47	To add to my earlier comment from this morning:There are two ascending channels that I'm now watching. This first is more long term, and it's already broken down:https://imgur.com/a/tfpaOJkWhile the resistance line for the formation is obviously a bit suspect (the market broke out to the upside and then fell back within the formation), the support line is more straightforward. I agree with others that starting a support line prior to the Big Green Candle is likely going to throw TA for a loop. The point of chosen for the beginning of the support line is the second dip to $7,750 that kicked off the continued rise up to $9,950. I think it's a perfectly valid point to start measuring the short-term trend. As I mentioned, it broke to the downside, so one would expect continued decline to follow in the next few days. With the possibility of a confirmation of support-turned-resistance at around $9,300 to $9,500 (depending on how long it takes for the market to make its way back up there to make that confirmation test). We also have a shorter term channel which others have posted:https://imgur.com/a/7KjQ5D8This one is very compelling, because:1. It's cleaner. There's no false breakouts.2. It hasn't been violated yet, so it's still a bullish formation. I don't see the market busting through the bottom of the second formation right away (although that's always possible). Instead, I'd say it's quite likely that the market will bounce off of the support line from the smaller formation up to $9,300 or $9,500 to confirm support-turned-resistance of the larger formation. RSI is fairly overextended on shorter timeframes (30m and 1h) and is closing in on oversold territory on medium timeframes (2h - 6h). As far as RSI is concerned, there's still plenty of room to fall on the 12h, and 1d.Interestingly enough, there's also still plenty of room to go both up or down on the 3d and 1w. Both are neutral around 50.So my general sentiment is this:Expect a 3% to 4% bounce before $9,000 falls, but don't long or short it. If the market gets back to $9,400 and loses steam, consider shorting it. If the market blasts through $9,500 and makes its way back above the support line of the larger formation, then opening a long might not be crazy. Personally I'm a bit uneasy in my short now that I'm seeing the smaller channel support holding. But we'll see what happens.EDIT: Another thing to watch is the [falling wedge](https://imgur.com/a/DkO9c9B) that others have pointed out.To me, it's starting to look like sellers could have painted themselves into a bit of a corner here. There's strong support immediately below price, and sellers failed to pierce the descending support of that wedge. Buyers might just have a launch point here to break through the wedge resistance and retest $10,000.This would invalidate the larger channel breakdown, but that would actually provide a bit of symmetry to the formation. As there was a false breakout to the upside already that was rejected.
1	1525792133	6	So short if $9000 is convincingly broken, long if $9500 is retaken and don't do anything in between as it is too unpredictable. May I ask how likely you think it is that $9000 will hold chew? And finally, if we do drop below and start falling, do you think we see a huge green candle like before that shoots us back up? Thanks for all the analysis.
2	1525792428	8	This is the formation to watch for a downside breakdown:https://imgur.com/a/DkO9c9BDon't focus so much on whether $9,000 breaks down, but instead on where that price action fits into the life cycle of this wedge. If $9,000 broke right this second, then the market would likely have broken below the falling wedge support (which would be incredibly bearish) and shorting that break would likely be profitable.If $9,000 breaks tomorrow instead, then the wedge support is down closer to $8,800 and you are more likely to get insta-rekt by a bounce off that support line than see any substantial gains.
3	1525796092	2	im wondering why everyone on here draws charts, i mean if you've been doing TA for a while its pretty obvious where the formations are.. is this just to educate the masses?  Or do you actually sit around drawing lines to figure out your own positions?I only ask chewy because he uses the same ranges i do
4	1525796301	3	I post charts to get feedback from the community here. It's always helpful to see what other people are drawing, and what other people think about formations I'm watching.The second ascending channel I drew is a perfect example of this. I hadn't even started watching that channel until I saw other people posting it this morning.I definitely have a strong desire to help others within this community, but I'm not a saint. If I wasn't getting anything out of this community myself, I'd most certainly be operating in a vacuum and not sharing any of this with anybody.
4	1525796358	3	I just noticed that you're actually asking if I draw formations at all without sharing them. And I absolutely do.I'm constantly drawing lines on charts to decide what to do next and when.
3	1525792767	1	I feel a bit uncomfortable opening a short right now, I will wait on the sidelines and see. Hopefully the next 12 hours give a bit more clarity on where we are going; kind of feels like a coinflip right now. 
4	1525795158	2	Yup, we're right in the middle.On the other hand formation isn't big so it's possible to set tight stops.
1	1525794128	6	I very much appreciate the depth of your comments.
1	1525793160	5	Great summary, this reinforces what I was already thinking.In addition to the things you mentioned, the resistance of the previous symmetrical triangle could be acting as support: https://www.tradingview.com/x/1kismAH4/Not to mention the 0.5fib of the retrace from 11.8 to 6.4k.
2	1525793869	2	Bullish momentum was stronger during the previous symmetrical triangle and 10K was still on sight. This time 10K was clearly rejected, buyers pressure is very low, shorts are not increasing considerably Also we did not see a single BGD since 9650 was breached on the way up the 3rd of may and i think we all agree most of the momentum was built by BGDs in this run. Looks like a different scenario to me but let's see.
1	1525792697	3	thanks for the input , dont you think the rejection from 10k was a bit too strong?
2	1525793686	5	Too strong in which sense?1. The market is overreacting and it's going to bounce back soon.2. Damn, that rejection was undeniable and clearly demonstrates the market is going to continue to decline. Personally, I'm in camp #2. Although I can see the argument for camp # 1.
3	1525797055	1	What's so special about 10k expect being a psychological number?
4	1525797343	6	Nothing. I'm actually very surprised buyers overcame resistance at $9,800 but still managed to drop the ball on the 1-yard-line at $10,000.
5	1525797936	2	Yea it was weird and that SEC FUD came at right time too 
6	1525799172	1	that fud is why i shorted, thinking it would cause profit-taking after a long run up.  I didnt know it was FUD.  VanteyX is our head researcher now.He is russian and doesnt believe imperialist propaganda.
1	1525794795	3	I agree with everything you've said. My concern is this fall seems to be happening in slow mo. Past falls from key resistance/round numbers have happened in a similar fashion except 2x as fast. This slow motion has me thinking there is a larger play in play, possibly to 10k again. I'm concerned cuz I'm 50% stack in a shirt from $9350 but not planning to close until 10300
2	1525800204	1	its called unloading bags bro aka distribution.
2	1525800280	1	> I'm concerned cuz I'm 50% stack in a shirtPut the other 50% in a pair of shorts, and you'll have yourself a complete outfit!
1	1525799999	2	> To me, it's starting to look like sellers could have painted themselves into a bit of a corner here. There's strong support immediately below price, and sellers failed to pierce the descending support of that wedge. Buyers might just have a launch point here to break through the wedge resistance and retest $10,000.I'm betting on this being the case
1	1525793002	1	Thanks for your efforts and contribution, always very useful! So far buying pressure has been lower than after previous recent dips. Why do you think we will have steam enough to test old support turned resistance? It didn't even bounce so hard from 9000.
2	1525793153	3	The market often confirms support as resistance, but it doesn't *always* do so. The market could very well stay rangebound between $9,200 and $9,000 for the rest of the day before choosing a short-term direction. Clearly the market is not in a rush to break out. 
3	1525794889	3	9.2 was clearly support and resistance both ways in this run, didn't fall fast on the way down, don't think it can fall fast on way up.Nice point to watch.
0	1525770769	19	I must have fat fingered something on my phone yesterday, I woke up this morning to find my 5x short from 9,410 was at 100x leverage.I'm amazed that I managed to go to sleep with a 100x position open without getting liquidated. It would only have been a small portion of my stack as Mex reduces the assigned margin if you increase leverage once a position is open (rather than increasing the size of your position), but I still feel super lucky.I really need to stop making trades on my phone from bed while half asleep.
1	1525785018	2	Lambos on you
1	1525802733	1	Good news is, you have like 1000% ROE. Bad news is, E is only a tuna sub. 
0	1525787813	31	The great thing I love about comparisons to 2014 is the ultimate confession that, back then, a massive bull market followed.If you believe Bitcoin is going to $5k "because 2014", then it's only consistent to believe there will be at least a 19x rise to take us to $95k.Enjoy the sales while they last!   
1	1525788744	10	I don't think any bears are denying that. I'm bearish as hell medium term, but buuuuuuullish as fuuuuuuck long term.
2	1525788920	4	Why bullish as fuck though? Previous performance should not be used to determine future gains. Honestly, I think we're still in a pretty massive bubble. Bitcoin is essentially digital gold that'll lose its value as soon as major players start cashing out, and has little to no real use as a currency.Sure, it has no borders, which is great, but services like PayPal already fit that niche for 99% of people and whilst I personally dislike PayPal and many other similar currencies, I think it's ludicrous to suggest that your average person is going to start using Bitcoin for this sort of thing.I would say, amongst my friends, Bitcoin usage definitely is up now compared to a few years ago but I reckon, if anything, they'll gradually start flaking out / moving to alts and I reckon current adoption is, realistically, about as high as it's going to get for now. I would absolutely love to be proven wrong - I still hold a pretty decent amount of Bitcoin and I'd love to see some mad gains on that but I really don't think it's realistic.
3	1525789290	11	Do you honestly think that PayPal is fitting that niche for 99% of the global population? 80% of the world is estimated to be unbanked or underbanked. 
4	1525790208	3	On top of PayPal is horrendous for international transfers and for people living abroad. All the proof of residence and having a phone number in your home country is just awful on expats.
5	1525804350	1	Don't get me wrong - I'm not a fan of it at all. I don't have a PayPal account and I love that I can freely send money with Bitcoin, but I think it's a rather niche problem that most people would prefer to deal with in a way where the value doesn't fluctuate wildly. Not to mention that I genuinely do not think Lightning Network is the solution for Bitcoin's capacity problems, though I'm really not quite sure what exactly is.
4	1525804363	1	Right, but what makes you think those unbanked people are going to start using Bitcoin?
5	1525804589	1	because it's the best option they have and people tend make decisions based on self-interest. bitcoin doesn't need to be perfect, it just has to be the best solution to a massive worldwide problem. edit: wording
3	1525789789	3	[This FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Help:FAQ) has answers to some of your questions. Hope it can be of use to you.
4	1525804286	1	I have used and do use Bitcoin, but I just don't think the mass appeal is there. I really don't think the majority of people are ever going to use it. I hope I'm wrong.
1	1525788210	5	Self fulfilling prophecy will fulfill when enough people will believe in it's fulfilling.If enough people will believe in 5k then there will be nobody to buy until then.
2	1525788521	3	can't say his enough, this is why we have been bouncing between 5\-10k. 
1	1525790333	2	except maybe this time it is different?
1	1525796134	1	Nah. Rat poison bro!
1	1525804706	1	19x?? Pfft. $220 > $19600 = 89x 89 x 5k = $445,000

1	1525769195	2	thanks for posting this
1	1525770617	1	LOL, that was priceless!
1	1525790135	1	What the fuuuuuuuuuuck!?Seriously though, isn't PPC already taken (peercoin)?
0	1525799509	12	Ignore the rest the mess at the top, but the [BBands are the tightest](https://snag.gy/iunPQf.jpg) on the daily it's been since Oct 31st last year, get ready for something big I'm guessing. 
1	1525801556	2	I’m fearing for down as we’re nearer the upper edge
2	1525802811	1	Take a look at the Oct 24-30 BBands and you'll see candles mid to upper side also. Price rose then dipped for a week before the rocket fuse started to smolder.
0	1525773280	9	The failure to really break 9460 tells me that most buyers are waiting fro the price to drop. Selling pressure is constant, but the lack of buying is worrisome to me.I opened a short @9310Might stop @9500
1	1525773608	3	What does the failure (once again) to break 9260-70 tell you?
2	1525773754	3	You are calling it a failure pretty early. It's testing it right now.
3	1525779506	2	broken
2	1525774216	2	Yeah support seems good at that level. But all it needs to break is a whale to unload and at the moment that seems more likely than a whale pushing us through 9460, to me.
0	1525779162	8	Interesting read https://medium.com/@derekpankaew/how-the-sec-is-deciding-on-ethereum-fake-news-spread-a4f58aa9c4f0 
1	1525780617	8	Absolutely nuts. I'm 100&#37; aware crypto is a heavily unregulated space, but if rumors like this propagated in conventional investment space and *nothing was done to rectify the ill formed rumor* there would be serious legal ramifications.Meanwhile it's just another instance of FUD \(whether accidental or otherwise\) on a very long list for crypto. This \+ buffet \+ a dozen other negative stories this last week and you've got to wonder whether there's an interest in keeping BTC under the 10k/11.6k for a little longer. *takes off tinfoil hat*
0	1525798346	9	Bitcoin failed to break through $10 000 and we find the market correcting itself after the gains from early April.Bitcoin has fallen through the first few bullish trend lines and is now on critical support, in my opinion, if there were to be a bounce this would be a good place to buy. However I am not convinced with the price action and a retest of $9000 – $8800 is most likely on the cards.Should the above support zone hold we could expect the bulls to pull back into the market, but as it stands right now, momentum is turning bearish and I think we could see some more selling action before the weekend.There are some bearish candlestick patterns on the 4 hour candles, hinting to more downside in the market.Both indicators are confirming my bearish suspicions and I will wait for some bullish signals before going long on the market. For those higher risk traders there could be a short on the table should our near term support fail.The prices will need to consolidate above $9400 – $9600 for the bullish momentum to continue. (just my opinion)[You can find the charts here](https://cryptosignals.trade/forums/topic/bitcoin-btc-technical-analysis-may-2018/#post-17623), safe trades.
1	1525799520	4	selling action before the weekend?  It's tuesday.  pretty safe prediction.
0	1525800416	21	You pros gonna think this is boring, but I’m sharing it anyway : after 5 months of meh I finally got the amount of coin I was after. From here I’m switching to boring hodl mode and switch off my engine for a summer break. Best of luck to all !
1	1525800596	6	nicely done. how did you come up with your amount? % of your wealth? a nice round number? also, do you have a minimum amount of time you'll hodl for?
1	1525803324	6	You, Sir, ***are*** a pro. A pro isn't someone who makes craptons of money, he's someone that knows how to walk away with his winnings in his pockets.Feel good about yourself and be happy with your accomplishment! Don't need to make billions of dollars to know you have it good.
1	1525802442	4	That's awesome. No reason to continue trading this headache of a market if you've already reached your goal. Sleep and a life are more valuable anyway.What was your trading strategy and how'd you arrive at the number you chose for your goal?
1	1525803992	2	Good luck, but just keep in mind that "hodl" mode can lead to you losing 50% of your money in the next few weeks/months if things don't go the way you prefer.
1	1525802866	2	I'm right there with you man, my new strategy is to buy at the end of a bear market and sell at the end of the of the bull cycle and to just ignore all the noise in between. Sure I could make extra money/add to my stack but I'm bought btc at 6900 and ETH at 415 and don't plan on selling till this thing definitely is heading back down.I'm always somewhat off from the absolute top and absolute bottom, but I'm really just focusing on the mid to longterm so I really just miss out a little with extra profit 
1	1525800547	1	another farewell letter.. reminds me of late december.
2	1525802868	3	doesn't sound like a farewell letter to me. 
2	1525800724	2	I also realized the way futures went retarded right before a local top at a round psychological number is really similar. Remember when futures on bitmex got to like $23k lol. We got to like $10.4k on futures...-_- bitmex noobs really are dumb as hell 
3	1525803181	3	That's a good indicator to remember for the next time. Only next time, it's all somehow different again, as always :) 
3	1525800815	2	I saw March futures hit 24k+ but with 0 liquidity. I think the spread was almost 200 bucks
4	1525802921	1	Damn...I miss the days when volatility was insane. I remember seeing a spread of $200 on GDAX a few times during those violent dump days. wish I could just watch a video of it 
0	1525786275	8	went long here like I planned to in my previous post, but already feels like a mistake. this buy volume is hideous..   edit: closed it. will reopen if we get above 9200 with any volume or at 8.8-8.9k, holding my short for now. 
1	1525786348	5	Yea hate to say it but I think you might get stopped out here
1	1525786311	5	selling pressure so strong.
0	1525794025	7	NYT reporting Trump will withdraw from the Iran deal. Since I posted about it earlier, figured I would post a follow up when news came:https://twitter.com/nytimes?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5EauthorEDIT: CNN reporting is slightly different, reporting that as a potential first step Trump will allow sanctions to go through.https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/08/politics/donald-trump-iran-deal-announcement-decision/index.htmlEDIT: Bull case, increased destabilization in middle-east will increase demand for BTC as a flight to safety asset and as a hedge against continued inflation in Iran.         Bear case, the market is big enough to absorb this without a noticeable impact.
0	1525790768	13	i'm not sure how i should interpret bill gates + buffets opinions on bitcoin. I mean both have been terrible predictors of technological trends~. it just happened that they handle multi-billion companies and fortunes.~ microsoft missed big time both on the internet (search/social) and mobile (apple)if history is any indicator, this is a signal to go all in deep throat in bitcoin/crypto. both of these guys have been risk averse in complete change. wall street says that it is never different. Well, they missed big time on apple and google. i mean come on: it was different. The tech sector is different. Things go crazy in this kinda world. the laws of physics don't apply here.still here still long. still waiting for a resolution to the upside. turning my career all in to crypto, trading and blockchain in the mean time.
1	1525791786	3	Until buffet can explain how a currency system should be designed to protect currency holders, and then explain how bitcoin doesn't fit that design, i could care less about his opinion.
2	1525798366	1	The system cureently works for him haz little interst to change it
1	1525791095	4	he told you. As he explained that people who invest in btc often get angry when you criticize it. so aks yourself, do you get angry of your "investment" goes to 0?If you truly believe it won't change a thing, and with that price should not mater. That reminds me a bit of Vitalik when he said to not focus on the price.
2	1525793750	4	Buffet's actually 100% correct there. Since the price itself is irrelevant to it's use as a currency, then you shouldn't care if you just care abut the technology and progression towards a realistic currency.If you care soo much about the price, then you don't care about moving away from fiat but rather are gambling, hoping the price will keep going up so you can make more fiat.
1	1525791150	3	A) buffets hates all commodities because they have no cash flowsB) it's government propaganda cloaked as financial advice.C) Bill Gates is being forced to toe the line.D) Level of hatred and verbiage tells me they fear it, and its not 'just some ponzi' which they claim.E) I'm seeing synchronization in verbiage and stances, meaning there was a meeting about it, between at least those 3, probably involving many more.  And a policy/stance was set.And, I dont think its bad.. for social reasons - I like all 3 of them, a lot, and respect their leadership.   But for investment reasons - ignore it.

2	1525791897	1	microsoft came in the tech sector boom. it was responsible for a shitty operating system that was significant man hours. apple/linux oses were more advanced and better polished (osx). it took two decades for the market to re-adjust.

1	1525781422	4	oversold on the 1hr RSI as well
0	1525767337	7	We got higher lows higher highs on 1 hr, BUT we also got a bear div on 1d and we hit a huge major mega resistance so I expect a half assed bounce soon before we continue down. Would not go long here, would not go short here

1	1525753987	5	>  $25K that's about 1 ~~year~~ month worth of posts/comments/views on this sub. We collectively paid for it.
1	1525754249	3	his wife was sponsored so he probably got some good deals too ;)
2	1525754337	4	its not like he is brokehis own networth is about 4 mil and Serena's networth is 170 million. they can afford to pay retail
3	1525757539	4	I'm sure his net worth is far north of 4M.
3	1525757975	1	yea not saying he cant afford it, I mean if you can get it for free or discounted, why not? every dollar saved is a dollar in crypto ;)
3	1525764388	1	>its not like he is broke>>his own networth is about 4 mil and Serena's networth is 170 million. Everything I'm reading puts his NW at $9mm+, based on docs revealed when he got married. Not sure why you think he lost more than half during the following 18 months. 
4	1525766289	3	Mike he bought btc at the top thats why he is trying to pump it to offload his bags :D
4	1525780665	1	I just went by his Wikiepdia that shows 4 mil
1	1525764411	3	>did it while wearing a $25K Audemars Piguet watchObviously the most important part. 
1	1525758058	4	deets? Royal Oak? 25k isn’t exactly impressive from Audemars, now is it? ;)If he was wearing the brand new GMT, I’d be jealous
2	1525759147	5	I was gonna say that. 25k is pretty much entry level for an AP.

0	1525782773	15	I won't have the time to post a longer analysis until later this afternoon, which is unfortunate because this move is fairly significant.The [ascending channel](https://imgur.com/a/vxYYEuH) that brought the market from $7,800 to $9,950 broke down on this move.I'm not suggesting that we're seeing a bull trap in this entire move starting with the big green candle, but if $8,600 breaks to the downside, then I'd expect to see the market confirm the log resistance line as support, which is actually very important and better to happen sooner rather than later.That line is all the way down at around $7,500 or so right now. In the short-term, there's likely to be plenty of chop in the lower $9,000s and upper $8,000s. If the market gets back above $9,400, I might start to reconsider my short. Otherwise I'm holding it for the foreseeable future. Edit: looking at the ascending channel on mobile, it did break down with a brief wick, but it's actually holding at the moment. So there's still hope. Edit: ignore the above edit, I was mistaken: https://imgur.com/a/vxYYEuH
1	1525783323	5	I'm not seeing a breakdown, even on the wicks.https://ibb.co/daNgDn
2	1525783721	2	You've started at 8.5, he was talking about 7.5
3	1525783886	1	I'm in the camp that the BGC shouldn't really be considered in TA since
4	1525783969	2	I agree, but the green candle went up, then it dropped to about 7.5 before steady climb up from there, so 7.5 is the lowest point you can start from.
1	1525783286	2	Drew the support line I think you're referring to with a verticle/horizontal line showing the current log downtrend value of 7519 as I have it drawn.https://www.tradingview.com/x/PuYb9Fev/
1	1525783524	2	Yep, I make the linear support zone 7350ish as well. It’s probably going to bounce off that line at some point. 
1	1525784350	2	Resistance turned support? https://www.tradingview.com/x/cJmPMJw1/
2	1525784453	3	The issue with that scenario is that the market already broke through the support line of that formation.It would be a bit odd for the support line of a formation to break while the former resistance line of that formation confirms as support.
3	1525785101	2	Sorry, I meant the green downtrend line / top of the pennant before our break up to 10K. Purple is a 10-month log line I've left on my chart for no particularly good reason. Sorry.

0	1525781048	6	The past 3 weeks have hurt badly but it's slowly turning around.Interest wasn't the best but I got enough back to cover what I paid out during the bottom. Won't hold through this time around, however.I'll be letting my stuff go and cutting my short to go long. It's been my longest position to date and it'll feel awesome once I finally dump it.
1	1525781375	2	8200 entry, right? Did you add at 10k?
2	1525781667	2	I never closed from my December open.
3	1525781836	2	Ahhhh ok. So you're just accumulating interest in the hopes that the funding moves your way in the net? I agree, it may be time to close it. I don't think we will go below 7k for a while, but I'm sure the bears will come out of hibernation soon and call for sub 5k soon enough.
4	1525781948	1	The dip cost me a ton of interest. I added on this run up and it just barely paid me out even on the interest.I don't wanna sit in a shitty short paying out interest again cause if it dips, again, the interest at the bottom will probably cost me 15-20% of my position.
5	1525782970	2	Any reason you did not just close at the bottom? Usually insane interest is a good top/bottom indicator? I understand your positions are quite big and you can't just market close them, but you could move portions over to futures instead of swaps, no?
6	1525783280	1	Decided to close one night, and woke up the next morning to see that BGD had skyrocketed the price. :/
7	1525783369	1	Similar, only I decided to go long. But I didnt have the balls tbh

3	1525783964	1	okay thanks.  somehow i read that you were now long which surprised me with your comments over the past few weeks.

2	1525803526	6	can't stop thinking this is accumulation... idk though, probably my long position bias
3	1525804051	1	i think it's selling that is now somewhat absorbed by other players. Also concerns ETH (and we know EOS has been moving some stacks again), with a volume on par with BTC volume recently. Hundreds have been sold steadily each minute today in blocks of 10 and that climax candle was probably caused by a 3k sell on gdax (bots).edit : seeing this pump, maybe a stop hunt from a buyer indeed
2	1525803401	3	My hopium is real but misguided I think, haha. 
3	1525803734	2	Things seemed so bullish just 48 hrs ago. 
0	1525804307	5	Oh well I got caught in that bear trap and added to my short...bad timing.  Not really any way to guard against that, except cover quickly when it gets pumped higher.
1	1525804528	1	Don't worry about it - we all make mistakes. The key thing is to know when to close your position and minimise losses. On the other hand, it could well drop again soon too. Don't close a position prematurely. I know this advice isn't particularly helpful, but you get the idea. Don't beat yourself up, but equally don't let the fast paced nature of bitcoin allow you to act irrationally.

0	1525787305	12	Doesn't it feel a lot like may the 1st?Price action is similar, this sub is turning bearish, chewy is closing his long, even the volume is similar (although it was higher on the way down last week).Meanwhile we have a nice support line with 4 points of contact, previous resistance of the symmetrical triangle is also acting as support, hidden bullish divergence on the 4h is continuing. We also just wicked below the 0.786 fib of this retrace before climbing back up half way to 0.618, just like may first.Maybe I should turn bearish as well but i'm conflicted.https://www.tradingview.com/x/Lo4jkmg6/
1	1525787745	7	On May first, we broke up out of our bearflag with a 300-400$ candle. This is the first bearflag consolidation we broke down from since the 26th. It was looking promising because history repeated itself but at a higher price point, but it broke down for the first time instead of breaking up. Buyers aren’t there at the high price points, and sellers are just *pwning* any time the price jumps up the slightest bit.I was super bullish  last few days, held me underwater 9.5k long for some time but as we failed to break up from the bearflag and rejected off $9,456 it worries me so I closed my long, and opened a short 
2	1525788209	2	> On May first, we broke up out of our bearflag with a 300-400$ candle.I'm sorry i'm not sure what you're referencing? We also broke down from the bear flag on may first and wicked 8820: https://www.tradingview.com/x/RiuR8YKM/

4	1525789228	1	I see, but that's not really a proper bear flag isn't it? As it's not sloping up. What I see here is a small bear flag that broke down but the lower support was stronger. I guess it's a matter of perspective. I do agree that the bearflag we just broke down of was pretty long!
5	1525789318	1	Well me and you a while back referenced this “ bear flag thing “ formation we are looking at here. A giant red pole followed by consolidation in a 100-300$ range. It’s not necessarily a bear flag, but it has been a pattern, same thing happened on the 26th. 26th Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/jjEUikVX/

1	1525787640	3	Chewy draw line for ascending channel which begins at 7.8. That one broke down, but it doesn't mean it'll drop harder.If we look at 9.2 it was good support and good resistance in the past, breaking it down isn't good for bulls. For now 9k held.As for me I'm gonna pay bigger attention to the market when it goes back above 9.2. 9k bounce wasn't as big as it should to consider it as a good support.
0	1525787999	8	(-)DMI heading up but ADX is heading down on the daily; price currently has kumo and EMA100 support, and close behind is kijun, EMA50, and EMA200 support, and a daily golden cross is imminent.https://www.tradingview.com/x/1rVgpsqY/
1	1525788069	14	in layman’s terms? 
2	1525788259	14	Sure, I still think we're in bullish territory given the above.  ADX/DMI is a measure of strength trend, so although the (-)DMI is heading up, ADX is heading down indicating that the negative trend is not very strong. Keep in mind this entire move was not strong to begin with, though, so you have to consider that.Right now, price is showing support at EMA100 and the Ichimoku cloud. Right below it, if this level breaks, is support where the kijun (Ichimoku MA), EMA50, and EMA200 align in addition to the EMA50 crossing up through EMA200 -- a golden cross, which is a bullish indicator. In short, I am going to continue to buy this.
2	1525788285	1	Moon!
1	1525790391	1	I'm a bit wary of this golden cross. Last time a daily golden cross happened was 10/29/2015 and it signaled the end of the bear market. Before that was on 06/03/2014 but it was just a bull trap and the bear market resumed. It was in between 2 death crosses. Comparisons:2014-2015: https://www.tradingview.com/x/pmgJUdm5/Now:https://www.tradingview.com/x/Zs7dZovD/What's your take on this?
2	1525790993	3	I'm not one to account for historical data because I'm in the camp that thinks the market players have changed so much that it's not wise to rely on it.I will say that at this angle (the daily chart), MA crosses tend to be confirmatory, but since we've been in a serious downtrend, the "cross" could instead actually be a bounce (EMA50 bouncing off of EMA200 instead of crossing through).Still, all of my indicators are below price except the tenkan (another Ichi MA; the conversion line. Bears are going to have a hard time blowing through all those support lines, so in this situation, I have to lean bullish.I'll reassess at 8800 if we get there.

0	1525796975	12	This is looking **Extremely** similar to the price action we are seeing from the April 30th-May second price action **April 30th-May1st** At that time, we were also sitting in a falling wedge, and a bear flag that broke down https://www.tradingview.com/x/nZ9YAUto/This nearly mimics the exact price action of today’s falling wedge / bear flag breakdown. On April 30th, we broke down from roughly $9200 after and found consolidation in the $9000 range ( what we are seeing now ), followed by the bear flag breakdown after $9000 fell to the low $8900 range. This created a mini “ Bear flag channel “ that we eventually broke up from here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/3HWOhMQP/**May 7th-May 8th**We are essential looking at the same exact thing, but one important factor has changed. Falling wedge with an extremely similar bear flag breakdown to a bear flag consolidation type thing that was *expected * to break up: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Fr05biAS/Now to point out the difference: On my second chart posted, we had the “ bear flag “ type consolidation channel between $9200-9400, which if history repeated itself ( April 26th/ May 1st ) we would have expected a break up from the bear flag type thing, but in this case it broke down. https://www.tradingview.com/x/cL8E0Obz/What’s interesting here is it looks like we are forming another one of these bear flag channels: https://www.tradingview.com/x/pUOdI2hh/Sorry for the long post, just pointing out some patterns we have been seeing in the $9,000’s range.

0	1525771062	4	Seems like we waited for the 2h Bbands to tighten. Adding two more candles in this range will make them very tight, so a next bigger move might happen in around 3\+ hours.\(Might happen faster than thought, made a new lower high on the 1h\)Another interesting thing is that a lot more volume was needed to push us up the first time to 9.7k but now not much volume was needed to push us from 10k to 9.3k.

0	1525763413	7	I've moved up my laddered buy orders from yesterday's 9.2-9.0k to 9.3k - 9.0k.Reasoning: We seem to be holding on to the trend line from the 7.8/8.8k low, though only just. anything below this line is bought up relatively quickly, and the 4hr RSI is nicely reset. I simply don't see us breaking 9k, because our bear flag would've successfully have broken down already yesterday. If we do go down, I expect a target of 9.05k or so to the lower boundary trend line from our pennant last week. Alts are making higher lows and are trending up it seems, so despite the lack of legitimate buying pressure and the high ratio of longs opened, I think the R/R here isn't too bad. Edit: s/l around 8.9k for now but will monitor.

0	1525784463	3	I'm waiting for breakdown of the ascending channel for confirmation, but this looks like textbook [Wyckoff Distribution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fed56be4b0b8a1d3d33918/t/5a663076e2c4834307e3dd53/1516646527060/Elliott%26WyckoffSchematic.png?format=1000w), following the accumulation phase from early April. It's definitely still early in the process to get overly bearish, but something to keep in mind if it breaks down further from here.
1	1525784584	2	I thought that as well, but we haven't seen a sign of weakness. I interpret this as reaccumulation.http://d.stockcharts.com/img/articles/2015/07/1438369533740479636177.png
2	1525784950	2	Both are very possible, which is why I'm staying out for the time being. I see breakdown of horizontal support around $8900 as confirmation of distribution, but for now it just looks like a slow bleed until smart buyers come back in to accumulate further.
0	1525791679	3	I'm watching the same falling wedge that others have already noted shape up nicely on the 4 hr.  Looks like we bounced at a convergence of the 100 and 150d EMA, and another rising support line that we've touched a few times.  My question is does anyone else find it concerning that while we've violated the log trendline from the Sept low through 6k several times, we've only wicked below on the daily, but haven't closed below it.  Today is looking like that's a real possibility.  Or has everyone pretty much dismissed that as support altogether?https://imgur.com/a/50G5DHQ
1	1525791879	2	I have that line on my chart as well, but the number of times we've crossed it leads me to think it's not that applicable at this stage. 
2	1525792054	1	Yeah, I'm starting to think I should scrap it and pay more attention to the shorter-term support that looks to be emerging.  
0	1525803202	3	anybody using ichimoku cloud? looks like the price is gonna be sideways for a bit...
1	1525803571	2	I use it and it still looks bullish on the larger time frames. We are in the midst of an e2e move that should take us to 11.6 in the next 2 weeks.
0	1525803795	4	Too many over confident shorts, time to go long.
1	1525804598	1	Good move 
0	1525780297	5	Buy pressure disappearing? Those walls are propping up the price but I'm not seeing many market buys. It looks like it's just a matter of time before the walls are pulled or eaten.Edit: the big buys start coming in within seconds of me posting this.Edit2: soon overpowered by even bigger sells.
1	1525780464	3	I've given up trying to work out which way it's going. I still reckon another attempt at 10k this week (and one that will fail again).A big market buy can come at any time, that it's hit a local double bottom again (at the time of typing so don't fry me) but not fallen through smells of accumulation.Edit - well that sucks.
0	1525781678	5	My buy in target got reached spot on... most buys got triggered, was hoping for a wick through but stopped perfectly on the trendline. ( i flip flopped back to my targets of yesterday of buy in at 9.15-9.05 after mentioning this morning I'd move them up.)4HR RSI at the lowest point since our BGD from 6.5k I'm expecting a bounce here. I could be wrong, but if the trend is still bullish, this is the point of reversal. Edit: Also a potential hidden bullish div on the 4hr with the 8.8k low.
1	1525782138	1	You are a brave men! My short is still open and i'm waiting for confirmation 1st.
1	1525782665	1	4h still has a lot of room, not even below 30. shorter time RSIs indicate we stop here, but somtimes bitcoins gives a shit on short term RSIs... ;\)
2	1525783169	3	Yeah Absolutely true, and we might see more downside. I'm well aware BTC doesn't give a damn about what I think.But I'm for once trying to stick to my plan:Fractals put my target at ~9100 USDSupport trend line at ~9050 USDand the 0.236 fib retrace is at 9100 USD (cut off the wicks a bit to make it more conservative. ETH seems to be making a higher low, and LTC & BCH seems to be making a double bottom. Con-side:No real sign of a reversal in BTC and it seems heavy like when we descended from 11.7k.
1	1525782889	1	I'm not so convinced. I track the alts that are very sensitive to the price of BTC and they aren't really buying it either. I've said it before, but it bears repeating: alts can be good indicators of predicting immediate / short-term movements in BTC. Those who trade alts during high periods of volatility can have a lot more to lose than if trading BTC/USD.
0	1525796066	6	Bitmex futures premiums went down a good bit. Still higher than they were when we were at these price levels a little over a week ago. Does it make sense that the September premium is now $150 higher than it was back then just because of running to $10k and bouncing off of it? No, it doesn't. What does make sense is that leveraged traders got bull trapped as fuck, and the June futures longs are finally starting to capitulate, the September futures longs haven't yet. Expect more downwards movement until September futures longs capitulate. 
1	1525797258	11	One thing I will say:If this continues to decline, this will solidify for me that Bitmex futures traders are — as a group — some of the dumbest people on the planet. The market popped from $6,400 to $9,750 and the premium remained at neutral or less than 1% (and sometimes even traded negative).Suddenly, and without warning, they went full bulltard and started trading at a $400 premium while spot was making a relatively weak and slow upward push to $10,000. And even if the market DOES push higher here, they're currently doing the exact opposite of what one would expect to see in that scenario: reducing the premium as price makes a small drop instead of increasing it. There should be more buying pressure on the dip, resulting in an inflating premium. Not the reverse.
2	1525800350	2	Bitmex offers 100x leverage, full of dump people.And you don’t trade futures then same way you trade perps due to low liquidity.I’m at work can’t post the chart, but compare june vs finex lol.June went over spot at 11.7k and now. And it went below spot at 6k.I think bitmex futures premium or discount are a great counter indicator. Funding fees also, Sunday it was screaming for a long squeeze.Made a shit ton shorting it lol and got a good long entry at 9.1k this morning.
2	1525798316	1	But don't forget Bitmex funding in the equation. Towards the end of the run up from 9k, funding was so high that it was better to long futures (when they were ~ neutral). You could even have a neutral delta (longing futures and shorting spot,) and collect the fees. Maybe there has been over-reaction in both directions though, an influencer probably raised awareness on futures.
1	1525796205	1	Trying to predict movement based on mex premium is pointless.
2	1525796314	6	It's been highly profitable for me for years now. 9 times out of 10, highly leveraged traders paying a premium to be highly leveraged are wrong.
1	1525799665	1	futures forward curve
0	1525781519	9	Remember when on Saturday everyone was calling for 11.7k?Remember when we were at 6.5k and everyone was calling for 5k?Wouldnt it be great if we could all just calm down and think rationally about what the most likely outcome is going to be? I know a bunch of people in here have great advice, but there’s the bull and bear parade thay just always comes in when the FOMO comes out.My thought is this dump gets stopped cold in its tracks at 8800 and we are back above 9200 by Sunday.If 8800 falls, Im out
1	1525781773	6	Remember when we were at 15k and you were calling for 50k?
2	1525781939	3	Times change, people learn.
1	1525781835	1	I was never calling for that shit. I've been calling for low for the past 6 months. xD
2	1525782420	3	6k seems low enough. I don’t see us going any lower to be honest.I just don’t see it happening, it seems unlikelyI think we bottom out at 7.5k for the rest of 2018
0	1525773780	9	That Bitfinex buy-wall is absorbing a lot of selling. The buy wall just denied further price drop expected from the sort-of H&S on hourly. I'm starting to think this is accumulation; coupled with an increase in Bitmex shorts over the next days, could be the proverbial viagra for the next green dildo.Edit/update: the H&S reaction eventually came through
1	1525774779	3	This is all.. 2 hours - 4 hours - 8 hours talk.  Patience and we will see 10K.
1	1525778769	1	I agree, the buying pressure yesterday at $9,200 was voracious and I expect more accumulation in the $9,050-9,250 range. 
0	1525773640	9	Feels very bottom-ey.Buying pressure sub $9,300 is absolutely relentless. 
1	1525774685	8	But there's absolutely none once we approach 9.4k. I'm finding this very difficult to read.It seems this sub is 50/50 too.
2	1525777695	5	This means we found the true price of BTC - $9350. Time to pack up, guys and gals.
2	1525774830	5	this is how it was all the way down the first time 
3	1525774928	2	So you think we are going down to pound town? 
4	1525775178	2	Not necessarily, just think we tried $10k too fast. The market should've pulled back lower after $9.6k originally. overextension leaves buyers exhausted and dejected when they fail to break an important resistance level. A strong bounce from low $8s/high $7s would have been more bullish.. But now it's possible we don't bounce back. Either way, I would be wary holding a long from above $9.3k here. A break below $8.6k and there's a good case for a continuation of the bear market 
5	1525775346	2	Definitely the reason why when we hit the $9400 level buyers become essentially ghosts, I myself would not open a fresh long from anywhere over $9,300. But on the other hand, we have made a new local high and these bear flag formations have been breaking to the upside. Honestly pretty clueless on where the market is headed next 
6	1525777708	1	If it is an accumulation range, the streets have been emptied for the decided buyers to proceed.
1	1525774581	4	The 1-4h EMA bands are telling me a different story 
2	1525777665	1	what story are they telling you?
3	1525778189	1	The one you're seeing now :)
4	1525779758	1	What was the thought process behind your analysis? I don't really know how to use EMA. Do you use the 9 days average?
0	1525765250	15	I see a lot of talk about how Gates and Buffet are being ridiculous with their ludicrous claims.But people... please. Crypto is a speculative asset with no real use case outside of illicit activities and gambling at this point in time.How can someone who built their entire empire on value creation and looking for long term value investments by buying shares in undervalued companies feasibly look at something with no real use case and a market cap greater than the GDP of a 2nd world country?EDIT: Crypto Market Cap of 443 bn puts it right under Thailand and Belgium, right above Iran. That’s just completely ridiculous I love Bitcoin, and I think it has a bright future. But let’s not be unrealistic about how and why someone would invest into Bitcoin. If you’re a notoriously shrewd investor and you make a killing by buying undervalued assets, you know damn wel you aren’t buying Bitcoin, which is sure as shit NOT undervalued at 10k.We’ll make it to the moon, but we need the real world adoption. If it doesn’t come, then speculation is all we are left with and it’s a pretty big nothing burger if you ask meThat said, I think BTC at 9200+ is too high. I expect a retrace to the 7500-8800 range over the next month or so, and we should even out at about 7.5k for mid 2018 and start a slow and sustainable climb à la 2014. I don’t anticipate a new ATH in 2018, and I’m seeing a potential double top at 9750.But this shit pumps on no news all the time, so who knows
1	1525769348	11	My 2s:1 Bitcoin = $10k is too much, fair enough, I see the argument, however, my thought is how many people buying bitcoin are buying one whole Bitcoin?My broad point is that for millennial and younger generations, bitcoin represents a way for them to easily invest their pocket money in something and potentially watch it grow. You don't see many 14 year olds with Vanguard accounts or even savings accounts, but I bet you a fair few of them have coinbase on their phone. To my mind, this is adoption, almost more so than acceptance as a currency by retailers. 'The unbanked' don't just exist in the third world.Bitcoin (and by extension crypto) has sparked a wave of financial literacy among younger generations, I can confidently say myself that I wouldn't even be thinking about ETFs and index funds if I hadn't started with bitcoin.EDIT: disclaimer - i'm 29 and bitcoin was my first investment four years ago (but i didn't even consider it an investment at the time)
2	1525769704	2	great points
1	1525766186	12	> Crypto is a speculative asset with no real use case outside of illicit activities and gambling at this point in time.Beg to differ m8.I've:bought tokenized equity (in a company & real estate) w/ 24/7 liquidity. used decentralized livestreaming & decentralized social media like peepeth.serve files to/from decentralized storage.spoken to young, travelling Venezuelans financially 'saved' by crypto as a permissionless wealth store [to some degree]. List goes on.None feasible without crypto.It's just not widely distributed. And it's not common in the Bitcoin community (more on the Ethereum side).
1	1525766351	4	Honestly though the difference between the current price and your perceived fair value is so negligible in the grand scheme of a speculative asset that it doesnt make much sense to make a prediction like that 
1	1525772498	4	The whole country of Argentina seems to have a pretty good use case for it, as did Greece 8 or so years ago.
1	1525768853	3	In my opinion you’re pricing bitcoin incorrectly. The future possibilities must be priced in. You must price in the possibility of a future where bitcoin is in widespread use and the fact there is a very limited supply of them. The lack of adoption right now is irrelevant. If you think large scale real world adoption is likely in the next 10 years then 10k is an absurdly low price. If you don’t think this will happen, then even 7k is absurdly high.Personally I’m banking on future adoption. But to price it the way you have makes no sense to me. You’re not asking what it’s worth now but what it will be worth in the future, it’s a speculative asset.
1	1525770437	3	While Bitcoin does not have “intrinsic” value, it does have valuable resources backing it in the form of the network infrastructure. Bitcoin has become to be viewed less as currency and more as an asset. If you want to leverage the features of Bitcoin for any reason whatsoever, you must use the asset. This is also how use of the protocol is kept from being abused, by limiting the supply. This is one reason why bitcoins have value — the limited resources of the network are represented by a limited number of bitcoins. It just so happens that the value of bitcoins is being used by most people as a currency or as a means of saving. This has caused some in the community to decry the 'HODL' philosophy but if you believe in the future widespread utility of the Bitcoin infrastructure then it is hard to imagine anything other then an increase in value over time and this leads to the temptation to hoard it away for future.The real and present value of Bitcoin is that it is a store of value, means of exchange and an infrastructure that can support and secure ANY type of transaction.A transaction that is verified by the mining infrastructure with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of hardware scattered throughout the world. A transaction that is broadcast once again \(as part of the verified block\) another 10,000 times. A transaction that will be permanently stored in that block, on the blockchain, on the hard drives of tens of thousands of computers. A transaction that uses community\-sourced bandwidth, community\-sourced disk storage, and a nanosecond of computer power from a global mega\-cluster of computers.I would suggest the true value of all of that is more then $10k per bitcoin.
1	1525772246	3	The entire world of Valuation is completely based on what someone else is willing to pay for it. Diamonds aren't exactly rare, but are expensive because people are willing to pay that much. So is the stock price of a Fortune 500. Combined with that is the intangible possibility of growth. Are you telling me IF Coca Cola were up for sale, its valuation would be equal to its MC? No way. Its Brand Value (which itself is massive) would 5X that. What gave WhatsApp value? Why should anyone pay 1 Billion dollar for a piece of tech with no revenue stream and an idea that can be replicated easily? Also the very idea that Bitcoin is a decentralised store of value, that itself is immensely "valuable". Honestly neither of us can "fair" price it. Just like people think Gold is worth X, hence Bitcoin will be worth Y. 
1	1525765935	3	gates said it right, the technology is good and there are some good aspects to it, but the speculative mind of bitcoin is not good. And to me he is 100% right.
2	1525766083	4	I agreeThe tech is revolutionary. A Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus Mechanism that handles more than 1/3 byzantine faults. It should have gotten a Turing Award.But other than that, I dont see much “revolution” anymore
3	1525766608	2	also, why should companies use a public ledge and not just switch to a private system? Like XRP or IOTA, the tech can be used leaving the public out of it, no one needs regular people.  We'll see where this goes.
4	1525767950	1	I have no idea why any company would use one of the existing blockchains when thye can just spin up their own network, allowing people to swap in and out
5	1525768636	1	I read somewhere a good point about this.  Why use the public internet when you just can use your private one?I know with blockchain its a bit different, but is the basic concept not the same? So many unknown factors.. 
1	1525772994	4	> Crypto is a speculative asset with no real use case outside of illicit activities and gambling at this point in time.Money. Money is the use case. Fiat is dog shit money that doesn't preserve value or empower the capital stored in it. How do you know bitcoin isn't undervalued at $10k? What is the appropriate long term value as measured in dollars, a currency that exponentially inflates?
1	1525765555	5	> hat said, I think BTC at 9200+ is too high. I expect a retrace to the 7500-8800 range over the next month or so, and we should even out at about 7.5k for 2018.Such a precise view of the next several months.  I wish I had your magical powers to see the future with such accuracy.Personally I have no idea what the price will be in six months.  There is too much regulatory uncertainty to be able to do that.  But I don't have magical powers.
2	1525765667	2	This is a trading sub, I simply gave what I consider a sensible price of Bitcoin. I think 10k is too high.I don’t have magical powers, I have an opinion

1	1525766511	2	So you think it’s too high at 9300 and that it’s ridiculous that the crypto market cap is higher than the GDP of Iran. And that it is a speculative investment with no real use cases. But then at 7500-8800, it’s totally fine?If it’s overvalued based on your points, the overvaluation is definitely more than ~20%
1	1525776653	2	Why are you comparing the market cap of combined cryptocurrency to country GDPs? Two very different measures, and also two very different value holding entities. Obviously the market cap of entire countries is vastly greater than the crypto market cap, that's what should be compared. Also the crypto space does not require the type of maintenance in order to exist like countries do, it essentially exists on a different plane not having to run a military or really deal with the physical world as we know it, and so GDP is very important for a country. Crypto probably has a GDP of some sort but we don't calculate it yet. What's the market cap and GDP of the internet itself? That's a very ethereal question, but it's probably larger than many many countries combined, if not all of them in some way, if we consider the internet to be its own entity.
1	1525766747	2	I absolutely agree with everything you're saying, and the lack of adoption is frustrating. However, I do think its increasing slowly with smaller retailers increasingly accepting cryptocurrencies. Moreover, with BTC being a more "Store of Value" type thing, the adoption and utility argument becomes very blurred. Is there real utility in gold, why do we pay premiums are items with identical utility but have higher scarcity? As for price, you might absolutely be right. To be fair, paying 10k for a speculative asset is kind of ridiculous in the first place. However, there is of course real potential in betting on a paradigm shift in the world's view of value and trustless systems for transacting. I think we also need to start considering the ecosystem that has begun to develop around crypto's and take into account that price movements are largely done by trading algo's that take no underlying asset value into account, but only trade based on price movements. If the algo's say 9k is fine, then 9k it is.As for market cap, we're not even half of what Apple's worth, which is one company. Admittedly it has a working product and generates revenue, but the entire crypto sphere being smaller than one company, and BTC being around 20%, I don't know if the valuation is *that* ridiculous.
1	1525767992	0	So you are saying BTC at 10k is way too expensive for any rational investor to buy in, but 7.5k sideways for a year is fine and will totally happen? Jeez man. I have you tagged and every single post of yours qualifies as BS in my brain. And you are doing a PhD or something. It's sad. Oh, and BTC used to have adoption, before our new overloads kicked in. Now you are not supposed to use the currency, you know. Damn this is double sad, you are supporting that viewpoint and complaining about adoption. You are basically the definition of what's wrong with BTC.Now do your best to shit on me as you did in the past. 
2	1525768580	4	No need to shit on you.You can tag me as you wish, I do not care. I’ve been around since 2011 and I just had expectations about the adoption of today, and we are below it.I personally don’t understand your comment. You can call me sad, not really sure what that is supposed to achieve. You say I’m doing a PhD and somehow that fact coupled with my opinion is sad. Sure... Well said.You don’t even know what my research areas are.Not really sure why arguing 7.5k is a fair price, and subsequently reasoning 10k is overvalued is hard for you to understand.I’m kinda used to people being daft in this sub. You are no exception. And in the meantime, I’ll trust my reasoning, which I find to be sensible and well-rounded. I’m both bull and bear. Bullish as fuck below 7.5k and somewhat bearish (or at least careful) above it. It’s really that simple. So far, this has served me well, but I agree that time will tell whether or not this is the right approach.In any case, have a nice day bro. I don’t need you to like me or agree with me. But don’t callme sad, because nothing I said is “sad” inmy eyes.
3	1525771049	1	> and we are below it.And 1MB4EVER has nothing to do with it, correct?> You don’t even know what my research areas are.You talked about them being crypto related, or to at least know where the real research is made in the crypto scene. That should qualify you as competent in this topic. And yet, here we are.> Not really sure why arguing 7.5k is a fair price, and subsequently reasoning 10k is overvalued is hard for you to understand.I don't want to answer to this, I just want to quote it to make sure it's read again.

0	1525769271	3	I'm gonna update my position here.Honestly I thought 9.4 is gonna hold, it didn't. Took a stupid move to add at 9.5 and then closed at be at 9.2 on local bottom instead of waiting for 9150 to break down.The inability to push through 9.45 and small buying pressure makes me think this should at least revisit low 9k.Shorting here, probably gonna bail on higher high or 9.5 break

0	1525797906	2	Is there video footage of Bill Gates bad mouthing bitcoin? Or was this one sentence taken out of context from a full interview?As there is a video on YouTube from a while back in which he seems to be praising it like it will be the future. It seems like fake news to me, just like this SEC Eth hearing.Remember when Jamie Dimon caused the drop by saying its a fraud? That was a pretty substantial drop from just a few words and he was the first one.Now it seems like every time we seem to be recovering another one will come out and say some negative stuff, but the comments that are being made now aren't having as much of an effect like they first did.How many times can you cry wolf before people become immune to it.
1	1525798162	9	What's with that obsession with what Gates and Buffett said about BTC? That is just two old men talking about a technology they don't understand and a market strikingly different than traditional ones. Come on guys, those people having a negative opinion about BTC is neither bullish nor bearish. Stop trying to see patterns in every random thing.

2	1525798299	2	I'm so tired of hearing about these quotes already.  
2	1525798589	1	Their comments are blatantly there to scare the PUBLIC from investing, and this is the funding we need to keep upwards momentum.I'm sure everyone in this forum or people that actually believe in crypto will ignore it.But it is a psychological thing to the man on the street.These "two old men" have had their wealth pushed in to the public eye for many years, so the public will believe what they say as they have been very successful in the past.Its not about what we choose to believe but it's what everyone else believes and these are the people that watch mainstream news.
3	1525799845	1	Follow BTC and (I'm sure) any asset long enough and you'll notice that news tends to follow price the majority of the time(because it's priced in). It's no conspiracy to keep the price of BTC down just people who know how to take advantage of events that the general public will view as havng an effect on bitcoin. There are exceptions with news but 99% of the time it's following the price for one reason or another.

0	1525799983	1	I'm playing around with the testnet on BitMex to learn about leverage trading and have a few newbie questions.1) I don't actually set an entry point, it just kicks off from where the price currently is?2) The mark price doesn't ever seem to move, how long does it typically take to adjust?3) There is no need to set a close, correct? If I want to open a long, I can just let it sit?4) Are there hourly or daily fees for leaving a position open?5) The cost vs order value. The cost is what it is to open the position, but where can I find the maximum I would lose if the position were to be liquidated?Does anyone have any good resources they'd like to share? Thanks!
1	1525802608	4	Just use regular Bitmex with 1 or 2 contracts. The most you can lose in this scenario is a few bucks over the course of a month or two (unless you're really stupid and use high leverage and overtrade -- still, hard to imagine any significant losses racking up) and the prices and trading will reflect real market conditions.
1	1525801256	1	Sounds like the BitMex docs would be a good place to start.

1	1525778258	2	Looking how futures premium evaporates I think it may be a problem to see 9.4 again before bigger drop.
2	1525779888	1	Indeed. At this point I'd take 9400 on June futures. Probably won't even get that
3	1525780169	1	That's hard to say. Didn't expect another bounce above 9.2 after this drop, and it seems to be holding still. Went short at 9385 but now I'd say it's more of a coin toss if I had to choose further direction.
4	1525780969	1	There goes that. 
5	1525781096	1	Yeah, strange drop with a bit of rest on 9.2.Now we could say that if that h&s on 1h was valid then we're somewhere around it's target now.

1	1525784861	1	I should have been paying attention today or set stops last night.  June future is now underwater, evaporation of premium was brutal.  Haven't made a move yet.    Might just double down.
2	1525785846	1	Yeah, premium has dropped like a rock. I still have my sell entries (to open short) in on June for 9420, but I don't think those are likely to hit any time soon. We'll see.

0	1525783312	2	I closed my short from 9920 at 9600 ish and closed my long from 9180 at 9300 last night. This morning I realized we sitll havent quite tested the channel bottom yet and added some more buy orders at 9160, 9130, and a big one at 9030. Went out for a smoke and I'm filled at an average of 9100. I closed half at 9120 because I realized it was a big of an irresponsibly large long. BUT,some of you are saying a chhannel broke down? This is what I'm seeing... No breakdown here, not even on the wick.https://ibb.co/daNgDn
1	1525783871	3	With the 1d Bbands that tight we will not follow this almost horizontal channel \(if you zoom out it is quite horizontal\) IMO. Not saying we go down from here, but I doubt this channel you are referring to has importance.
1	1525783753	2	https://www.tradingview.com/x/4H4IS70s/That's how I have it. The wick goes to the bottom of the green box. 
0	1525796219	3	Pullin my hair out tryna read the charts. Any guesses on How reliable the bbands and RSI on the 1 hour chart? Would it be better to just make trades from a shorter time frame or increase long than 1 hour? Looking at the one week charts we may have more room to fall... this seems likely? **Calling all crystal ball readers*
1	1525796799	9	BBands will only tell you that a move is imminent. They won't necessarily give you much in the way of direction. RSI is a pretty reliable indicator when the market is rangebound, but not as reliable when the market is trending.
1	1525796765	2	I only use BBands as an quasi-reliable indicator of maximum pain you can get from your current price level for the current candle, depending on your time frame.
0	1525774517	2	Looking at the rainbow chart on https://www.moonmath.win/, all previous bubbles went over the rainbow. Maybe the true bubble didn't even start yet?
1	1525777420	1	I think this is most reliable:https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/pmV1uLC7-Bitcoin-Longterm-update/Check back his history, so far his long term TA has been very accurate and reliable.
2	1525778810	2	https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ETsf4M8H-Midterm-picture-looks-bearish/
2	1525778067	1	that is not his most-recent chart....
3	1525778319	1	Yes but is the most similar to the Rainbow chart above.
1	1525778154	1	When things go bad, better dream of rainbow support!
1	1525791649	1	That would be awesome and could very well happen although the declining volume makes it look less likely.  I think this bubble was smaller for two reasons:1. the alt coin explosion that happened during this bubble caused a lot of people to sell btc for alts, making it smaller.  (but you could also argue that alt spending fueled the bubble more)2. as time goes by and price goes up you would expect the later bubbles to get smaller in proportion because it takes so much more to make the price go up.
1	1525774712	0	Thats a Bingo i believe. we never truly saw a popping, in the grand scheme of things this is probably a bear trap
0	1525785487	3	Hmmm... woke up in the netherworld. Was going to short at 9100 or long at 9200 and it was right at 9150. Small long at 9150. I don't think this bearwhale has what it takes.
0	1525772342	4	My bet is diamond bottom/reversal re-accumulation pattern. Sticking to muh longs. Have we stacked up enough shorts to have a little squeeze yet? Funding seems to be quite reasonable again all of the sudden. https://www.tradingview.com/x/OJ3VrL7e/
1	1525772509	0	just lol, because random pattern fitted into random square. 
2	1525772674	2	http://thepatternsite.com/diamondb.html
3	1525773045	1	Yes, but the picture you provided violates candles. You just went through all candles on the left side. 
4	1525773358	2	Diamond pattern is like coin flip. Rejection rate is too high to include it until it's almost complete and then it's not worth it.
5	1525773666	1	You are correct....the main takeaway here is that we have not closed a candle under my buy zone, even after this dumpy evening.If it does play out as a diamond, we should be nearing completion. https://www.tradingview.com/x/gmytVVmE/
6	1525774000	2	Well, I still think this is a bear flag that we're in ~9.2-~9.4
7	1525774544	1	IMO this is looking just like the fall after our first go at 9.7k.... first drop was flag second was accumulation. Just one reason I think we could move up from here :)https://www.tradingview.com/x/47ikruCK/
8	1525776250	1	I still think it's a bear flag with fake-outs both ways.
4	1525773394	1	Mostly wicks... any candle chopped is simply because I drew it up in 2 seconds.... 
0	1525771487	4	I think the most important level for today is 9200. This is the daily middle bband, if we close below it, then this is starting to look bearish enough for a proper pullback. Next level is 9011, the daily Tenkan(going long here).  https://www.tradingview.com/x/fnPUVVbM/   edit: wrong chart
1	1525773968	3	As unpopular as it would be, a proper pullback to the mid-low 8000s by the end of the week would set a lower high on the weekly time frame, which is needed as the weekly is getting over extended. In order to reestablish our equilibrium on the weekly, a new lower high is needed for a proper bull run later this summer. I'm targeting a small limit buy at 9180 this morning. I'm anticipating a dead cat bounce up to ~9700 before we retest 9000 and possibly lower later in the week. 
1	1525771648	1	Horizontal support seems decent at 9300. (Until it isn't).
2	1525771707	5	Looks like its failing, not enough buying to support it

0	1525757495	4	"buffet, gates, munger: the scary thought for billionaires is to wake up one day and discover that their lifelong obsession of accumulating & being evaluated in fiat terms is slowly fading in relevance."Edit: Since when does posting a quote = endorsement? i.e. u/654278841
1	1525760838	12	I can assure you no billionaire is terrified nor should they be.  They own vast assets including land, buildings, corporations, etc.  You're completely delusional lol.  Crypto is not going to hurt them and they will be in on it if they want to. 
1	1525758300	9	Don't be foolish - they have an excellent portfolio of assets that make them much better positioned for a currency collapse than most. That is not to say it would not concern them.
2	1525762428	1	Who's being foolish?It's simply a scary thought for such individuals to consider.
3	1525764735	2	What percentage of their assets do you think are kept in cash?  They primarily own things.  They're not just collecting cash from one country and locking it away.  They diversify into the obvious ones like real estate, stock, and property, but also less obvious ones like fine art or rare automobiles.  They will use cash for its liquidity only really, primarily they do not want to keep their wealth tied up in cash just sitting in a bank doing nothing. 
4	1525764980	1	> They will use cash for its liquidity only really, primarily they do not want to keep their wealth tied up in cash just sitting in a bank doing nothing.This is obvious & not the point.Let's avoid strawmanning.They're simply worse off contextually in a global, permissionless currency world - in many ways. And it's an eerie thought to consider one day having your wealth evaluated in unfamiliar, [likely relatively lesser] terms.
3	1525762548	1	I'm saying it is not a scary thought, because they have not been accumulating fiat but wealth.
4	1525762753	1	Their identities, their recognition etc. is tied to their Fiat dollar wealth.They'd be worse-positioned in a transition to crypto context. Hence the 'scary thought'.(Not to mention, Berkshire has >$90B in fiat cash reserves.)I'd like to hear your rebuttal.
5	1525763228	1	I'd say the recognition is tied to wealth expressed in fiat value equivalent. Sure, they have to keep some of the wealth in fiat, because of liquidity factors.Berkshire has these large reserves to allow them to be "actionable" - which is again tied to other assets liquidity, but while significant in size, proportionally it's not as impactful to their wealth as you suggest.
1	1525758530	2	Not in their lifetimes.  Long time before fiat becomes meaningless or if it will ever.  If one day you see everything being priced in BTC (or any other crypto) rather than USD then you can know things are changing.  Fiat is still king.
1	1525762862	2	For any alternative to work there has to be either a crisis or incentive, requiring the masses to want, need or love it. Reactionary government aside, does this describe Bitcoin/crypto? Fiat is safe for a long time... even hardcore traders only use bitcoin to accumulate fiat it seems. 10 % swings are tough in dollar terms, easy to imagine perhaps seeing your monthly salery disappear instantly if you live in countries outside of the west. Time is on the side of those mentioned & their ilk... including time to alter views as well as percieved control of any transition... well, maybe not so much in the case of some of the older ones

2	1525762031	2	Just to be clear, I've had that exact argument since I first heard about bitcoin *5 years* ago.The only reason the price can keep going up in the long term is because coins are lost. However, in the process, liquidity falls.

3	1525763282	1	You got it!!
0	1525799588	0	Does anyone think we could bart right back up? volume is low, and we havent seen a real bart pattern in a while.inverse bart pattern would be insanely bullish. 
1	1525800288	6	Aaand bitcoin successfully expanding the field of technical analysis with the introduction of the "Bart pattern". Also giving us the concept of a "big green dildo" in charting. lmfaoEdit: Sure would like an inverse Bart right now. 
2	1525802246	1	haha. why wouldn't it? it's a 24/7 GLOBAL market that's never been seen before. 
1	1525799979	5	I honestly have no clue what to think anymore. I want to open a long here, but I’m currently short from $9,400.May just open a long to hedge against it and bail on long if we break $9,050. Wouldn’t be the worst idea 
2	1525800431	2	I haven’t known what to do since we broke 8800 when the log resistance broke
3	1525800554	4	The only “ Obvious “ move was a short from $9950 on our second failed attempt at 10kOtherwise, it’s been like drinking a bottle of Jameson to the face will throwing darts trying to hit a bullseye 
4	1525800747	2	sadly I was asleep when that happened. Went to bed at like 9800 thinking we could strike at 10k, but got pretty wasted and fell asleep
4	1525800703	3	that was free money. only time 25x+ justified.
5	1525801285	2	Did you short it at that time?
2	1525800401	2	Did you go from long to short last night after our conversation haha
3	1525800634	2	Closed my underwater long for a small loss and opened a short at $9400 ish, which wound up being a good move. Now.... do I close for a profit to make up for the losses + some profits on my long? Do i close my short and open a long? I really have no clue what to do here. 
4	1525801064	1	probs best to close short and HODL or just let the short ride with stops at BE
5	1525801792	2	If this an inverse bart, and the Bbands are this tight on the daily. An explosion upward and a missed long entry from this price point would be very upsetting. 
1	1525800160	3	> Does anyone think we could bart right back up?It wouldn't surprise me. Things are acting really weird right now. You get a feel for the graph and something is really odd today. Like it's about to spring up. Can't quite put my finger on it.
1	1525802297	3	This movement seems really weird.https://www.tradingview.com/x/5JjZpyQa/
2	1525802408	1	It’s this bear flag channel things we have been seeing Idk what they are, but they for sure are strange. 
1	1525800147	2	possibly but actually everything since $8k has seemed pretty legit, nothing has been as barty 
2	1525801005	2	agreed. Our last Bart was at 8200 and it was only a couple hundred bucks
1	1525800755	2	is volume low? on BFX we've already done 21k BTC today, yesterday's total was 25k BTCedit: also, yes I think that it is totally possible we bart right back up
2	1525800902	1	BTC volume is about as low as it was when we were barting around in the 6-8k range.Edit: Looks like volume is lower now than it was then
3	1525801867	3	right but don't we need to take into consideration that BTC is worth ~40% more than it was at $6,XXX?edit: number
1	1525803412	1	It's interesting how the price now moves in smoother curves. I remember about two months back when it was nothing but tight straight channel > green or red dildo > channel > dildo etc. 
1	1525804273	1	In my opinion 6,5 -> 10k was organic like smurf ice cream, most of the sub is stil looking at it as a bull run because most of the sub cannot trade a bear market and the hodl mentality. Let's be serious, do you think we could have reached 10k in 5 weeks, without a major retrace, after so massive dropping, without that short squeeze and subsequent huge market buy orders? So why it is not going up? If that was organic growth people should be pretty happy to buy at 8% discount before before we salute 4 figures forever...Back to reality, why we had someone buying big lots of BTCs till 10k at market price and now everything is silent? If someone was accumulating, did he/she already finished? Suddenly at 10K? Is he holding? Cmon...There is nothing sustaining the price at this level in this moment other than hope and hopium. Maybe at 8.7/8.8 something will change and will see some bounce but I am not even sure at this point and, in any case, i doubt we can revisit 10k unless some other organic movement made of BGDs creates momentum. Maybe we shall paint smurf dildos.Anyway, just my opinion, let' see how this plays.
0	1525779470	2	Stopped out of my 9300 long with no loss.  Trying again !long 9230 
1	1525781117	1	Why would u long on a bear flag. 
2	1525781188	1	Lets hope he could close with little loss.
0	1525804470	1	Can't imagine the next few months play out any different than 2014, except it looks weaker with less hopium so far. Just like 2014, the market broke the steep log trend line and then establish a newer, less steep line. Meanwhile the market will chase the top of the original line down to God knows where. [LN Topology](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/) looks bullish af, imo, but networks take time and organic growth to develop. Still, the LN FUD over hub and spoke, institutional control, money transmitter registration, etc. has basically all been proven to be just that, FUD. LN is by far the most bullish fundamental factor, much more so than anything to do with Goldman Sachs, CFTC, NASDAQ or any other market based news. LN will demonstrate that most alts don't have a place to stand in the future. Sound money is made stronger with adoption, consolidation and distribution (Metcalfe's law). Once scaling is demonstrated on LN (not to mention privacy features, instant speeds and negligible fees), the final piece of the "money" use case is solved for and all alts that rely on FUDdy narratives will fall by the wayside and the market will consolidate around Bitcoin for hard/sound money. Interestingly enough, true LN adoption at scale may coincide with increased hype over 2020 halvening (and better exchanges/liquidity) so I expect the next bull run to out-do 2017 but I highly doubt we're not going to see lower lows this year. The stars are simply not aligned to facilitate this move right now and the ongoing PnD behavior of alts just goes to show that the market is still flirting with bubble mechanics. Historically, downward price discovery phases of Bitcoin re-test areas near previous breakout/bull-run/ATH. Obviously, this is about $1.2K for the current situation. I'm still somewhat skeptical that it will get *that* low but it's certainly not out of the question. Overall, it's a good thing. Bitcoin is not ready for large scale adoption and the more time spent in price discovery mode will benefit liquidity and speculators willing to take on the 'risk'. It's better that the tech more closely aligns with adoption than what we saw in December, which was beyond what the Bitcoin network could handle (particularly because wallets and exchanges screwed the pooch with Segwit and batching implementation). With better supporting infrastructure in place, Bitcoin will be positioned to *actually* reach the moon (i.e. approach some sort of equilibrium). Anyone who thinks that 20K was the toppity top is fooling themselves. 
1	1525804701	1	> Overall, it's a good thing. If you aren't a holder.   > Anyone who thinks that 20K was the toppity top is fooling themselves.What an incredible arrogant statement.  There is an significant probability that $20K is the ATH...., as is ALL TIME, and that wouldn't change.   I would say the probability of that is around 50%...not 95%, but also not 1%, as you claim.
0	1525757997	1	Anyone else have any thoughts on this being an entry point given the stochastic rsi on the 4hr charts? https://postimg.cc/image/h5hihleij/
1	1525758948	2	Looking at a single indicator of an indicator is a sure way to get burned.
0	1525780526	1	Well for the short term it's all about 9200. Break through that and I can definitely see 9k going and we the downward trend keeps going for another week or so.Was hoping we'd bounce off this 2nd 9.2k hit but not seeing it as of yet.Seems to be a matter of time before we break down 
1	1525780660	4	Stop hoping.  Play the game.  Hope doesn’t do anything.  Have a plan for whatever bitcoin does.  People never learn this lesson and it is the most important thing.
2	1525781106	1	What the fuck are you on about? It's a turn of phrase. I'm currently in a short so I want to it fall for my trade.Overall I want it to rise obviously 
0	1525771640	1	Think thats over... looked like stop hunt right into their 9275 hidden wall to me.
