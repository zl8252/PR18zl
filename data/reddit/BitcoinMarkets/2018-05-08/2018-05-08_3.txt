0	1525791296	4	One of my tabs of stats is this pie chart of [USD loan allocation on BFX](https://fiddle.jshell.net/jge32jv1/2/show/).At moment, USD loans for EOSUSD margin longs are nearing BTCUSD levels...which is somewhere between surprising and horrifying. Quick glance browsing through EOS website, subreddit, I can't find anything that really raises an eyebrow even, to back up this hype. To clarify: obviously there have been plenty of (if not most) shitcoins out there that have pumped for no reason except to pump. Plenty of shit-flavors of the week/month. But I don't think I've seen any as proportionally leveraged as this. It's actually raised USD borrow rates that affect BTCUSD for example. What's the deal with this thing?
1	1525793801	3	https://EOScountdown.comIt is launching in 25 days (most pumps start on average 23 days before news according to my spreadsheet) and EOS has [transferred 220k ETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2c2fb0313bd5120aa5d5bea20ea07e22e565c6b4) to Bitfinex to sell and pump the price of EOS.  Seems like a really safe long to me.
0	1525786608	3	Well, I parted ways with some of my NEO the other day. Originally got in at around $2 and finally decided to convert a chunk to BTC at $80 per NEO (BTC $9500 at the time). It was tough, but I think I made the right decision. When I think about which coin is more likely to be around and go up in the future, BTC has a much higher chance than NEO. For example, a $95k BTC is imo far more likely than a $800 NEO (assuming they both 10x). What do you guys think? 
0	1525760775	3	5/8/18 UPDATE. Posting something quickly here. I've been watching ETH recently and noticed it's much easier to gauge direction on shorter time frames than BTC. That might also be because I'm doing very short-term trading. Barring any SEC nonsense over the next few days, I think we're in for a solid recovery and will see over $815 within the next 48 hours. Additionally, in the spirit of fractals, I noticed a similar sequence played out back in early June 2017. Here's the [5/8/18 chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PPlOzivG/).     Here's the [June 2017 chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/71ruxaCG/).     I'm curious how people think this will play out over the next few days. Further, as shown, I use several MACD indicators which I've found to be better short term predictive indicators than Stoch RSI. What indicators are you all finding are best for ETH and/or other alt coins?
1	1525785699	1	I'm horrible at short term swings. I've been long since 422 with some trades along the way. I'm seeing the same activity the entire way up from the bottom. Dips are bought up, gets too hot and sells off. Bears still think it's Jan and push it down only to get wreck on huge bounces. I haven't charted much over the past few days, as I have zero worries about any real drops taking hold. Mostly just chop between 680 & 800 for this week is what i see.

1	1525767410	3	And Ambrosus mainnet in July
0	1525762186	2	I mostly trade alts in USD. Is there any significant value in trading against BTC? Could someone elaborate on this please? 
1	1525774809	8	Many times alts will rise is USD but lose against Bitcoin. When this occurs you would have been better off staying in Bitcoin. Last year when Bitcoin went on its tear I had 3 bitcoins all tied up in alts, the total value was about 13k. By the time bit coin hit 20k I was down to 1.7 bitcoins but a total value of 34k. Had I just stayed in Bitcoin I would have had 60k. Back then I only paid attention to the USD value of alts so I didn't realize I was slowly bleeding away Bitcoin, all I saw was I went from 13k to 34k. Now I only pay attention to the Satoshi price. If I'm not gaining Bitcoin from the alt market, I'm losing.
2	1525795041	2	But the inverse is also true. You don't see your losses if BTC and alts both go down.
2	1525776267	1	Aha.. Understood... So do you suggest converting fiat to BTC first and then using that to invest/trade? 
3	1525786309	2	What exchange are you using? Some exchanges will list both satoshi values and fiat value. Could always cross reference with satoshi values listed on the btc pairings on that exchange. If you’re looking to day trade, I suggest trading with BTC. Make it your goal to accumulate Satoshis. If your buying with intent to hold long term, then just buy with fiat and hold. Just my 2 bits. 
4	1525787923	1	Mid - long term. Finex. 
5	1525788678	2	Gotchya. I don’t use finex, though I use cryptowat.ch for observing finex charts. Have never seen Satoshis listed anywhere on there for fiat parings. I’d honestly just avoid the extra trade, and buy with fiat. I tend to believe observing satoshi values should really only matter for short term traders / day traders.  Though, like I said earlier, you could always cross reference your trade with btc pairings to determine satoshi value if you’re interested in keep tracking of that long term. Edit: grammar to avoid confusion! 
0	1525770633	4	BCN on Binance just made a lot of people absolutely fucking loaded. Pre listing it was .006 cents, now it’s 16 cents. Jesus Christ 
1	1525788660	2	Deposits were messed up so it is like the Bitcoin Diamond situation when it pumped on Kucoin.  Whoever buys now is going to be the ultimate bagholder when it goes back down.https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8hvv58/current_bcn_pump_is_a_sophisticated_pump_and_dump/
2	1525794848	1	I was up last night and saw it when it got added and the degenerate gambler in me had to slide in for a couple pumps. Made 6% both times in less than a minute. Super risky. I watched the BCD pump live and that was insane. 
2	1525797909	1	of course that thread seems to imply that it is anyone's fault except the people who bought at inflated prices.  These idiots are going to bring on regulation and ruin it for everyone.
1	1525780619	1	Jesus. Where the fuck did that coin come from?
1	1525785507	1	What the actual fuck. This was a coin listed today? Possible exploit in play here, or just a crazy thin order book..? 
1	1525772462	1	Its insane.   If we use the binance price then BCN is currently 4th in marketcap ahead of bcash.Whats even more insane is that I cannot transfer my BCN from poloniex to binance......   so insane i wanna cry.
2	1525772683	-2	It won’t stop.. Almost bought in at 1500 sats, and it just went to 2500 sats. I’ll be waiting for a dip to buy in as this will probably continue all day. 
3	1525773162	2	If we use the binance price then BCN is currently 3rd in mcap at over 40 billion!This is complete insanity!
3	1525772967	-1	Unreal.Will it soon beat ripple for 3rd place?I can only pray that the other exchanges follow binance and the price gravitates up....  then i can sell my bcn on polo...Good luck trading this one!
1	1525771150	-4	It was 0.006$ and now is 0.016. So a raise x3.
2	1525771366	3	.006 = 6/10ths of a cent .16 = 16 cents That is not a 3x raise lol. Simple decimals man, come on 
3	1525773506	-1	Except it's not 16 cents right now but 1,6 cents. Simple reading man, come on.
4	1525780385	3	It's $0.18 right Now, dude.
0	1525764474	1	Anyone got an opinion or thoughts on Aragon Project business governance blockchain? Both in terms of usage potential and/or trading/investment.Seems like a great solution to run my decentralised, profit share co-operative.
1	1525765431	0	Huh.... I was going to say shitcoin, no easy link to a white paper and the code on its page is written in solidarity.But apparently its built on top of eth, not a clone.Read up on the dao, I consider anything from eth to be risky unless you invest an absurd amount into security. I'd wait for simplicity if you must blockchain your databases for reasons that are increasingly beyond me.
2	1525770821	2	Thanks, i understand and accept your points. My usage is kinda hybrid ie non financial (only dao running costs) but using only the decentralised admin/ownership features and procedures.Blockchain's decentralised/ immutability/trustless features are very appealing and solve loads of problems for a profit shareing, collective/co-operative whose members are perhaps countrywide.The entire crypto thing is simply a tool or extension to business operations... An example of attempted business adoption right here. I would therefore require a cheap usage cost with little associated currency value volatility... and of course, faith in team and blockchain longevity. Willing to trade in currency if i must to preserve value otherwise this is a distraction to day to day business activities
0	1525797152	1	anyone care to share how xrp seems to move with price of btc? seems to be on it's own yet connected with btc just a bit of a lag????
1	1525800458	1	Pretty much all alts are tethered to BTC and follow it. You also have arb traders / bots that trade the different ratios.
0	1525763788	1	Finally time to reap in some REAL dApp profits that doesn't come from some lame marketing or "add to exchange" speculation hype https://www.reddit.com/r/etheroll/comments/8hm655/etherolls_4th_rewards_period_wealth_week_iv_is/This is the real power of anonymous dApps and as usual gambling is leading the internet development.  No hype or "partnerships", just pure working dApp
