Each contract 5 bitcoin, so oi equivalent of 10k btchttp://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_volume_voi.html#tradeDate=20180504** edit ** sorry you wanted cboe.  Iâ€™n not sure where to find

Because you can see the 24h volume for the particular day, but for all dates together. For example: 25th April volume was 11202 contracts for MAY, JUN, JUL, SEP. I want to know the volume only for MAY.

0	1525787489	1	I'm confused about what you're asking.Are you asking about:1. when you say "total volume of CBOE futures" ...meaning the combined volume of all four current XBT contracts (MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG), on a specific day?If so...which day?  today (at the close)?2.  the volume of the May contract on settlement day (May 16th)?3.  something else?  btw...in case this is part of the confusion:  the 'volume' figures that are in the links that you've provided... those are not 24h volume in the way that the different btc exchanges display 'volume over the past 24h'.   It's volume since the last settlement.  So it reset at market close every day.  I'm not sure where you saw '24h' on the CBOE site.       
1	1525788264	1	You mixed 2 things CBOE and CME. My original post was about CBOE, it means:> 2. the volume of the May contracts on settlement day (May 16th)?And in comments we discussed CME, it means:> 1.when you say "total volume of CBOE futures" ...meaning the combined volume of all four current XBT contracts (MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG), on a specific day? If so...which day? today (at the close)?&nbsp;> in case this is part of the confusion: the 'volume' figures that are in the links that you've providedIt's not **cumulative volume** (all number of contracts) for **the whole period till 16th May**.
2	1525791843	1	>You mixed 2 things CBOE and CME.No...I was referring to CBOE the whole time (hence, I gave the CBOE expiry months, not CME).  I was just trying to clarify what you had meant by 'total volume' for CBOE.>It's not cumulative volume (all number of contracts) for the whole period till 16th May.>Okay...so you mean 'cumulative volume'.   so...from when it began trading in February until today?  Naturally, we can't tell you what the volume will be between today and May 16th.  Btw...it's likely that it's available by simply adding the daily volume from then until now (I'll check if I have access to that in a minute), but it's very possible that there isn't anywhere that they specifically track 'cumulative volume' from the time of a contract's inception until settlement date.  The reason it's not widely followed, is because the volume skews massively towards the front months - i.e. so far today, volume for the May contract is 4475 while volume for June is 216 and July is 137.   Come the end of June, the July contract will then start seeing the majority of the volume.
