0	1525870973	45	Hey guys, First time posting on here. Been more of an eth guy frequenting ethinsider and ethtrader. Just wanted to say a big thanks to all the regular posters who post really good TA. The level of discussion on here is amazing. I have been hodler since 2015 and started trading more actively this year. Specially want to call out chewtoy, the detailed scenario and analysis after yesterday’s drop was just amazing. It gave me the courage to hold through the panic breaks below 9,050. Entered a risky 10x long at 9095 this morning with stops below 8900. Looks like it could be an amazing entry. The old me would’ve panic closed at 9k break for sure. So yeah thanks again and shall try to contribute as and when I can :) Edit: Tagging u/_chewtoy_
1	1525873339	11	It's always nice to hear that people find my commentary helpful. Welcome to the community!
1	1525872022	10	Absolutely agree with you. Also been more into Ether than BTC lately (since 0.6 ratio), but this sub is just so much more interesting than the ETH subreddits. Ethtrader especially is just so bad, I absolutely hate it,it's only memes and upvoted bullish statements without any analysis. 
2	1525872977	1	Yup! I get downvoted there if I try to discuss price retracement or consolidation lol 
3	1525873913	1	I just gave up on posting there. Last time I tried, I got insulted for using trade terms and they asked me why I didn't just HODL or bought more. I fell into that trap when I just started out with crypto (being too sentimental in general as well) and it's because of subs like that, who just spout their ignorance at anyone trying to discuss analysis or heck anyone who is bearish. I'm certainly no expert (not in the slightest), but how can I learn and improve my skills, when every post is 'GENTLEMAN' or 'Moon WHEN?' (with 20 upvotes). 
1	1525871776	11	Chewy is our hero 
2	1525872475	14	The most significant difference between chewy and many experienced traders here (myself included) is his ability to divorce himself from his positions and trade rationally based on what trends the market presents. I'd wager there are a number of traders here that can analyze the market out of position nearly as effectively and determine a good entry point, but once in position, the blinders often go on. Rationality and a separation from emotional reactionary moves is the only way to win in this market. 
3	1525873995	4	>Rationality and a separation from emotional reactionary moves is the only way to win in this market.So, so true. 
3	1525872881	2	Totally agree! Another differentiator for me is the time he spends explaining and even answering the trolls. I would get pissed at the doubters for sure lol
3	1525876940	1	so true it hurts

1	1525847528	2	I think this may go a bit down before going up again but agree on that premium, it's insane, futs traders don't want to give up.!short XBTM18 close 9055Closing just because I won't be able to babysit this and want to keep the profits.Edit: Plus I see a triangle on 15m, small formation but won't be surprised by another test of 9.3 soon.

3	1525872768	2	It's due to 2 main reasons i believe:* Laziness in entering that in the command / lack of knowledge of that feature* Fear of being used against them in stop hunting

2	1525871049	1	Nice
1	1525873985	1	Absolutely killed it again.  Nice trade.  I didn’t get quite as good an exit, but still closed my short in profit.   I went to bed right after the market fell below 9000, thinking it was gonna continue down.  I had stops set at my break even, maybe I should have moved them down before going to sleep...woke up to 9200s and was kicking myself.  Still made 20% profit on my stack, but would have been nicer to close where you did and clear 50%.
0	1525886178	31	Still not trading. Just hodling and enjoying life.Feeling optimistic about the chart right now. We're consolidating above support, in the middle of the range, in what feels like a "re\-accumulation" phase. Volume is declining which is what you'd expect. I wouldn't be surprised if we return to our regularly scheduled programming in the next few weeks \(break 11.7k, then 100\-200&#37; runs followed by 30\-40&#37; dips\).We are comfortably sitting above the 12h cloud for the first time since 2017. We're inside the daily cloud. An E2E would take us to 11.7k at the least.[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/i9EwpL0.png)# #95kbydecember
0	1525865237	13	Due to popular demand (i.e. people messing up the open commands) the bot now supports opening positions with:!long xbtusd **open** xxxx 10x 100%Leverage and stack % are mandatory if you want to use a stop loss in the open command like:!long xbtusd **open** xxxx 10x 100% -sl 8750Since i rebooted the bot some of you might receive again the last error PMs
1	1525866692	1	I occasionally chech on this sub to see how everyone is doing and stuff, but this is new to me? Some kind of accountability bot or something?
2	1525866926	1	Yes, it tracks the users positions on a web page [http://bitcoinmarkets.atwebpages.com/](http://bitcoinmarkets.atwebpages.com/). Still very new and with some bugs but it will get there.
3	1525867546	1	Very interessting, I think it is good for this sub to have this. Good job.
1	1525868334	1	One summary webpage display change I suggest is putting a + or - sign in for the PnL percentages. Roughly 10% of blokes looking at your colourscheme won't be able to see the difference between the the red and green shades you've chosen. Otherwise, it's great! 
2	1525869024	1	Added in the ToDo list.
0	1525840180	26	I stepped away for like 3 days and didn't put stop losses. Lost $50k. That's why I'm drinking Coors Light instead of Coors Regular
1	1525842186	10	Sucks man.  It's so tricky, you set stops and you get wicked before a bull run.  You don't and you get screwed on a bear run.  You see the dip, you think it will turn around, but it keeps going, then at some point you tell yourself you're now a holder and you'll just wait until it comes back....but it doesn't.  You can lose every which way.Probably setting layered stops is the way to go.
1	1525841663	3	I bet you could make $80k if you could get 400 cases of that Coors east of the Mississippi in under 28 hours.
2	1525845019	2	Buckle them seat belt boys
2	1525846359	2	Give me a diablo sandwich, a Dr. Pepper, and make it quick, I'm in a god-damn hurry. 
1	1525842932	2	I realy want to tasye that coors beer since the sensei jhonny lawrence drink it
2	1525845085	1	Lay your head back and open that mouth, I'll feed you baby bird.
1	1525845057	1	[deleted]
1	1525840673	1	It ain't lost until you sell it.
2	1525841916	3	You're right, let me just Stein's Gate to my past self real quick
2	1525849976	3	So if I had bought Bitconnect at the all time high and my portfolio value went down to almost $0, it would be okay as long as I don’t sell it. Makes perfect sense. 
0	1525880717	25	There are some who are conflating a so-called lack of buying pressure in the 9K range due to lack of interest in Bitcoin period.  Do not forget about those buyers who will not under any circumstance manifest themselves as buyers until the point where an uptrend is absolutely confirmed.  These buyers far outnumber the active traders that are moving BTC back and forth right now -- this does not even take into consideration that BTC's, crypto/blockchain developments in general are better than they have ever been and grow less speculative by the day.  All of these movements day to day are just noise, its not worth it for the average joe to get caught up in this.  Remember most people are 'set it and forget it' investors and for good reason -- the average person is an awful trader and will lose their shirt at some point if they try.  They will hold when they have a good reason to hold - and are generally more profitable that way eg. IRAs, 401Ks etc.  Everyday that the underlying technology is adopted/accepted is a step further to that occurring. The average person will only know and prefer to long a security and these are the types of investors that will really catalyze the price.  Right now it's a zero-sum shell game between traders, what kind of everyday investor would want to get caught up in that? Patience.  We are in the early days of the internet.
1	1525882667	15	I think most people are like me and just do not believe we are near the bottom.  Tons of bitcoin is created daily and demand seems to be dropping off.  9k bitcoin is just not an appealing buy to me.  People buy crypto for the chance for exponential short term gains or they are hodlers.  Not many people want to buy and hold 9k bitcoin.  I’m not sure where it goes from here but my gut feeling is down hard before up hard.  So I’m on the sidelines.  If I play it will probably be low stake shitcoins looking for a fairly quick turnaround.  
1	1525885851	6	Spot on! BBands are tightening for a reason; Traders are being pushed out by investors who are making their shorts less profitable. As volatility drops more and more traders will stop placing leveraged bets and it will read like a major decline in interest. If you buy through a period like that then you're a winner long-term.
1	1525883113	2	Ultimately it comes down to fundamentals.  BTC is the least speculative of all cryptos and it has achieved it's purpose better and for longer than anything else out there.  An open-source immutable digital ledger -- something considered impossible in the digital world was for all intents and purposes impossible until BTC arrived (by virtue of how difficult and costly it would be to compromise BTC with a 51% attack; digital permanence (the ledger is completely trust-able and has complete integrity or it cannot exist) and scarcity is BTCs value proposition.  
0	1525856135	19	Am I seeing this right? According to "bollinger band width" on TradingView's Bitfinex BTCUSD chart, 1D bands haven't been narrower since 2017-02-21. For 1W, it's 2017-05-08. Seems pretty remarkable.
1	1525856325	4	That's correct. 
1	1525856448	1	lol, I just tipped the same comment \(see above\) before I read yours.
0	1525848534	9	Posted selling all alts into btc a few days back, seemed like a nice entry. I gained a bit of purchasing power for whenever I want to reenter. Dominance was 36.0% then, it is up to 36.8% currently. I think the r/r here for me is keeping everything in btc (not fiat), and laddering descending buys into the alts I sold off. Personally I believe we could see dominance easily reach above 40% again, but holding BTC seems the most short-mid bullish call in my eyes. Don't think there will be a drop below 8400-8500, and don't want to miss the rebound. The value in this time period for me is getting more of the alts I believe in. Overall, market sentiment as well as media sentiment are swaying positive. EDIT: A few days ago, I posted this as part of my comment:"Scenario 1: We breakout soon and I see nice $ gains holding BTC. "Oh no, no big alt rally for me!" Whatever, pigs get slaughtered.Scenario 2: We breakout upward and alts lose BTC value meaning I increased my purchasing power to rebuy. (I do support a few specific alt coins in the long-run.)Scenario 3: We breakout down, and alts typically drop harder and faster."I personally believe we are watching scenario 3 play out, and believe scenario 2 will occur on the rebound. Best of luck in life everyone, overtrading kills portfolios! 
0	1525882781	9	Interesting article on Bitcoin as a store of value/disaster currency — https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin
1	1525883578	10	can we all agree that bitcoin does, indeed, have a use case *right now*? 
2	1525883703	3	Well with Trump doing his thing, I guess it's the perfect scenario to trial a disaster currency
0	1525863822	8	Wouldn't it be better to wait for a clean break of 9260? It's only $60 and going long here seems risky to me. 
1	1525863950	4	Up to you. Matter of patience and it will be 10K.With Crypto.. you can not tell.

0	1525859360	7	[https://www.tradingview.com/x/cj3k1bZZ/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/cj3k1bZZ/)We're close to the resistance line and this will present the fifth touch on it. Likely we get a breakout and RSI will recover on medium timeframes. I'm longing if 9150 breaks.
0	1525882276	7	What are your thoughts on Bitcoin being mentioned on the New York times front page? If something like that happens and attracts new interest/cash inflow, would it be expected to impact immediately?I'm not sure how it is now but back in 2013 when I got into crypto it took me about 5 days to jump through all of the verification hoops in order to actually buy Bitcoin.
1	1525882668	2	Someone just watched crypto daily haha what did the article even say? Bullish bearish or neutral tone?
2	1525883495	5	Nah this is all I saw(Direct link to the front page scan from NYT website)https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/08/nytfrontpage/scan.pdfThe article itself is on the left hand column just left of the picture of Rhiana dressed as the Pope(?). Seems like positive exposure. Just curious on what peoples thoughts are on how it might impact the price (if even at all...)
1	1525894330	2	It takes a couple of days now to buy bitcoin from scratch. (Including learning the process, registering on exchanges, finding real buyers, organizing storage etc.) Things like this will likely have a positive effect but you shouldn’t forget that 9k is still a very high price level for BTC. Not so long ago 10k was considered moon. Not long before that 2k. It will take significant new buyer pressure (if we only consider that) to move it to new ATH.
0	1525853146	12	Quick question here about those fucking TA celebrity experts on Trading View, you know the ones... the constant predictions every single day. I've been reading them for fun and my God, they are almost always always wrong!I know it's a nightmare to predict this shit but seriously, they are miles off. Most of them can't even predict the next 6 to 12 hours action without getting it wrong. Why do they have such large followings??? 
1	1525854058	5	I have absolutely no clue. It really speaks to the level of intelligence of the general cryptosphere and traders in general. 
1	1525855989	3	> they are almost always always wronggood. that's how you make money.
1	1525859295	3	* They are sock puppet accounts for manipulating market psychology. Their only mission is to manipulate clueless retail investors/speculators into taking the wrong side of the trade, and make them lose money.* They have a high number of followers, but we cannot actually see the list of their followers, meaning someone can create 15000 accounts on TV and just start following these accounts to make them seem "popular".
1	1525854677	1	Maybe they predict wrong and take the opposite trades? Some of the top accounts look like they're the same person. 
1	1525854800	1	Only one of the top three is worth listening to IMO, other two are arrogant and irritating, not to mention wrong.
1	1525855233	1	Could anyone recommend who to follow? Is there any them who sound reasonable?
2	1525857842	3	If they were good traders, they would not need you. You need to take responsibility and do it alone. Start small if needed. If you are lucky to find a mentor, preferably a friend, you can learn fast.
2	1525858464	2	I like reading Botje since he is active and updates a lot. He also had a few good entries in the last couple of weeks, including ETH, BTC (I know for sure he is short from 9970) and he does kind of TA that people like on this sub (short time frame movements, triangles, possible breakouts and all in all updates in real time).Trader I learned a lot from is Pro Indicators, he posts daily 10 minutes videos explaining his view on the market and often gives some tips and great information about overall market movements and how to improve as a trader.I like people who are modest on TV, even when they get something right they stay modest and stick to the ground, while MagicPoopCannon had one good call of H&S couple of months ago and he has been acting like a GOD now. I petty the people who trade on his advice. 
3	1525858932	1	Awesome mate. Thank you for such a descriptive answer! Very helpful :) 
2	1525861419	2	I really like TheChartGuys. Sober and seasoned daily updates on BTC, ETH, LTC
3	1525870103	1	+1 for TheChartGuys.  Dan does a daily video on YouTube as well.  I find his analysis really helpful.
1	1525857666	1	And it makes you wonder, if these guys are trading their own 'ideas', should they not be broke by now?  Anyway maybe they have no balls for trading. One thing is to analyse, another is to pull the trigger.
1	1525864417	1	> Why do they have such large followings???People like being told what to do.
0	1525872722	12	Closing my short from a few days ago.!short xbt/usd close 9278.5Going long here, bullish divergence everywhere. From daily down to atleast the 4 hr. (Didnt check any lower timeframes)Changed my flair too. I've always been a long-term holder, but I'm full bull right now and not in hedge mode. Lets see 
1	1525872891	1	You used xbt/usd to open the position so you must used it again to close it.On the next one you can use xbtusd to keep it simple.
2	1525872981	1	Thanks, just edited my post

4	1525873179	1	!short xbt/usd close 9278.5Really trying not to clutter the thread with my meaningless position moves. Hopefully this saves :)
5	1525873451	3	My strategy now is I'll keep replying to the thread that I opened the position on.  And if I have anything particular updates to say later I'll make a fresh post and link back to the thread that opened the position.

0	1525854854	5	I'm still long from yesterday and decided to let it ride without stops. Evidently, 9050 wasn't the bottom, though it seems selling has decreased a little bit, as I was expecting a more aggressive dump after 9k fell. I'm not sure if we're currently making another bear flag, though it's starting to feel more and more *"bottomy"* the lower we get. the 9K push might've been stop hunting and we go up from here. For what it's worth we've been making bullish div's yesterday and the 4h MacD looks like it'll want to go up a bit again here.I might add a little if we succesfully retest 9k. 
1	1525855371	3	i am scared that if we break trough 9k we might just break lower.There is not much room on the upside, the resistance is to strong at 10k. Best scenario is we hoover in this area for quite some time and then move slowly into higher highs
2	1525855529	5	It it hits 8800 I'm cashing out and flipping bear. 9k is a stretch as is imho.
3	1525855907	1	Yeah 8.8 is my limit too, and I'll dust of the bear suit. 
2	1525855877	1	Yeah, that's why I'd like to see a successful retest of 9k (or really low 9k's) after testing the top of the channel. Support seems to be getting somewhat stronger, though we could absolutely just fall through.

2	1525863893	1	Got 2 messages with errors, then 2 messages with position opened.Don't get it, it didn't catch the opening without stack or what?
3	1525864366	1	Got your commands in duplicate, don't know why really. It seems to have happened only to you. Could have been a reddit issue though.
4	1525864438	1	Which syntax opened the position? Both should be good.
5	1525865705	1	The one without the stack caused an error and was discarded.Will have to redo my syntax parser to allow some parameters to be missing.That will allow to handle commands with just leverage (and assume 100% stack), just stack (and assume 1X as leverage) and so on
6	1525866114	1	I thought so. It should work as you said here.Best way is to take like this, parse the line with ! with: *x is lev, <num> or $<num> is entry, *% is stack, <alpha>[aplha-num] is trading pair + additional search for 'close', 'open' and 'add' (if not found then assume open). You can drop order in the syntax with this.
7	1525866566	1	There are some trickier ones like [-sl, sl, stop] xxxx.That should make the add command for leverage also be changed from add -lev xxx% to just add xxx%Will need an update from Python 101 to Python 102 for this one and implement regex :)But nothing i can't handle with a bit of time. Then people can start using the bot to test all this variables so we can kick the bugs out.
4	1525865124	1	And it seems like it's replying to wrong post. Should be reply to the one with syntax and it looks like it gets to parent post of that with syntax.
5	1525865502	1	That is on purpose, the main post should be the one with the justification of the position. This allows to add the syntax in a comment if you forget.
6	1525865851	1	But this makes a lot of mess, cause look at chevy comment, someone responded with opening new position and you replied higher to somebody else.Bot should respond to post with command.
7	1525866180	1	No, that was actually my comment with the syntax that triggered chewy's position to be added. Only i can do that, the rest of he users only can do that if the main post is theirs.
8	1525866386	1	Ok, there's a mess in his post, cause somebody replied with close, then with open and you replied like randomly there.I will still think that you should always reply to the post that triggered the bot.
9	1525866802	1	Except when it's my user triggering the command, otherwise it will look like i was the one issuing the command. Already added this issue to the ToDo list
0	1525891294	10	Apologies for making two top-level posts in rapid succession, but I was curious if anybody else had tried zooming all the way out and drawing the mother of all ascending channels connecting the $1,160 ATH with the $20K ATH:https://imgur.com/a/HIVq9TmI'm using an approximation of the OG bull trend line as the support line for the channel. Let's pray that either the channel is entirely baseless, or at least that the market has no interest in testing the support line anytime soon.Pretty terrifying regardless of how you look at it. Although on the plus side we're looking at $100K btc by 2023 if the channel does prove to be valid in the long term and holds until then.
1	1525891995	8	Moonmath.win (or /u/jarederaj 's rainbow charts) are exactly this, just with the channels drawn slightly differently (the bubbles protruding out of the channel). I don't know if I consider that a good or bad way to look at it but it's at least a point of reference that I have referred back to many times.
1	1525891545	5	Yuphttps://www.tradingview.com/x/Qmrejin9/Ugly MoFo right now.Here's that upper section zoomed in.https://www.tradingview.com/x/B4xMHswb/
1	1525892614	4	Have you seen this?https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/pmV1uLC7-Bitcoin-Longterm-update/
1	1525892619	4	I use the bitstampp+gox  version. Less scary.
1	1525893706	4	the bottom line could be drawn in multiple ways. The top one has only two points. will need more points to confirm the channels.no i don't think it is relevant.
2	1525893944	2	I'd tend to agree with you. I was more just having some fun with the possibility.
3	1525894426	1	so what if was the channel real? It is very big that we could be practically anywhere from here and still validate it.
4	1525894609	1	It's not super helpful where the market is currently trading, but will certainly be worth considering if/when the market is trading in the $30K to $40K range or the $3K to $4K range (whichever comes first).

1	1525896811	3	I've been looking at this chart for a long time.  If it plays out the same way it will take us all the way down to the 200 sma line like it did in 2014 putting us at around 4k in December.   The biggest red flag for me isn't the chart but the continued decline in daily volume.  I don't expect the google trends graph to start moving back up until we hit ATH again but its hard to believe we're on a the next bull run when the average volume isn't growing.
1	1525891485	2	Interesting. I do have this one on my chart, though (assuming blow-off Dec top and oversold Feb bottom): https://www.tradingview.com/x/GcaCwXtT/
1	1525896422	1	If by "terrifying" you mean "delicious", then yes it's absolutely terrifying.
1	1525897445	1	I don't see the problem! As long as we are above support, it's bull! Even if Bitcoin drops to 2k we are bull!

0	1525867055	5	last 4h lower high was 9247.24 on GDAX and we've almost matched it at 9240 even on this candle.  I'm sensing a 4h trend reversal incoming which would confirm with a 4h higher low above 8960.About 1/3 of my buys filled between 9000 and 8800 last night, I've canceled the remaining and setting buys for half my remaining stack between 9160 and 9040 in anticipation of a 4h higher low (inverse head and shoulders pattern).If this reverses, trailing stops on each 4h higher low with a rough anticipation of setting a daily lower high in the 9500-9600 region before beginning consolidation on the weekly with a higher low target of 7500 or so.  If 4h higher lows hold past 9600, definite possibility of a run for 10k again.
0	1525875024	4	**Puts on tinfoil hatThe 1.5m walls that are always at the top of the order books on Bitmex are only there to force me to pay the taker fee whenever I want to enter a position.
1	1525875696	25	That's precisely what they're for, and you should be grateful they're there. Even if it can be frustrating that the only way to get into a position quickly is to market buy/sell.Market makers provide liquidity to the orderbook by placing large limit buy and sell orders close together. They don't particularly care which direction the market moves, because they are constantly resetting their orders up and down. Bitmex incentivizes this practice by paying the market maker .025% whenever somebody market buys/sells into one of their limit orders. So if somebody buys 1.5m contracts at $9265 and somebody else sells 1.5m contracts at $9264.5 a few minutes later, the market maker goes out and buys more than a few Tuna Subs with his profits. Since he's doing this constantly, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, he's pretty much guaranteed to make money regardless of which direction the market moves.So why should you be happy he's there?Because if he wasn't, the orderbook would be a ghost town. And you'd wind up paying a whole lot more to enter a sizable position (in the form of slippage) than the fees you pay by placing market orders.
2	1525876554	3	I never thought about it like that. I thought maybe I was being a bit tinfoil-hattish, but what you've said makes complete sense.
3	1525876738	2	That's why big players use big exchanges. You don't see 500 BTC market buy or 1k wall on kraken while on finex it's normal to see one of those once in a while. Going with 500 BTC market buy would push the price well above 10k on smaller exchanges with empty order books.
4	1525878977	1	There was a 300 BTC market sell on GDAX a couple weeks back. It went badly. 
1	1525875626	2	You realize those walls get pulled all the time. Put your limit order in and go for a walk. It’ll get filled. I hve learned it’s never the bottom or the top. Just gotta wait a little bit
2	1525879846	3	extremely underrated advice
2	1525875723	1	Yeah, that's why I put on my tinfoil hat. In reality, it's just hard to get a limit buy filled while the price is rising, or a sell while the price is falling.
2	1525876239	1	I agree, just be patient and wait for an hour - this is what I learned to do. Unless of course you want to fomo trade into a rising/falling candle and try to get into a position quickly. Then you have to market buy (if it is really worth the higher fees).
3	1525877717	1	If there’s a pump or dump, always market buy/sell. But I dont trade if it dumps or pumps and Im out of a position
0	1525876534	4	$50 bull flag... Don't think I saw one like that holding so long.
1	1525877072	4	I tend to choose always positions that will end up in the apex of the patterns. I FOMO'd @9250 after hesitating (and checking the bot logs for errors) at 9200. So this will go on a while before going down.If it does i might just close my eyes and remove my stop loss or move it bellow 8800. At least then if i get stopped i go out in flames...
2	1525877634	1	what made you want to FOMO at $9,250? what errors were you looking for in bot logs?
3	1525878554	1	I've had a losing streak 1 week ago, followed by 1 day of revenge trading that made it worse. I've been out of position for a week trying to get into a safe trade. The most i managed was breaking even.So for a bit i'll just follow chewy's advices and hope to recoup some of my losses to gain confidence again to enter trades on my own.When we broke up a lot of people started entering positions and some had errors on the syntax. I ended up editing the bot syntax to handle some variations of the syntax and lost some time there.On the next update to the bot parser things should be more resilient to errors in the syntax so i can get back to losing money on my trades. The bot was actually a good excuse to take my mind of trading for a while.
4	1525878983	1	ah got you, yeah I remember seeing you post about the streak, sorry to hear that my dude. I went on vacation for two weeks and stepping away for a while helps a ton, hope it goes well for you going forward. for what it's worth, your bot is a smash hit!
5	1525879475	2	It's just play money, but i hate to lose... And having to explain to the wife i stopped trading because i lost it all makes me hate losing even more :)The bot still has a long way to go, but i'm happy people are using it even with all the bugs. My first target is always put the code to work, then i can optimize it and make it better. Not the best way to do it, but it works for me.
6	1525880014	2	Don't worry, I've made some good gains, then had a 3 month losing streak that killed more than 50% of my entire stack, was one trade to actually call quit. It was good trade, bounce from bottom, almost at ATH now.
6	1525880141	2	> My first target is always put the code to work, then i can optimize it and make it better. Not the best way to do it, but it works for me.No that *is* the best way.  Otherwise you risk perfecting some detail that didn't matter, or it turns out you made a wrong turn somewhere completely.  The best way to kill a project is to protect it from its users.
0	1525884342	6	This seems to be taking a long time to break 9.3. Is this normal accumulation and getting ready to break it firmly for once or is it worrying and we may get a solid rejection soon?

1	1525863992	3	Back on June futures despite the $200 premium? Just woke up to find my short stopped out at a tiny loss just below (9340) and I should have flipped long then. Opening at 9385 is painful though. But the premium is bullish (or bulltardish--can't decide). 
2	1525864440	3	I'm on the June contracts despite the premium. If this reverses and breaks $10,000, the premium will likely be double or triple what it is now. 
2	1525864135	2	what's the advantage of future trading? I really don't know this area.
3	1525864186	3	No funding fees. You can hold until the instrument closes (6/30 or 9/30).Liquidity is lower though, so you're at risk of slippage for large orders, and it trades at a premium or discount depending on market/trader sentiment. 
4	1525864358	1	This mornings dip was interesting.  It wen't straight into premium divergence and didn't create a lower low like spot did.

1	1525864115	1	Do you agree thay given the small inverse bart yesterday at 9000-9200 and the current breakout, that sellers are exhausted. The fact that they couldnt push it below 9k, is good news. 9200 is currently providing some resistance, and unless we break it today, we will dip below 9k over the long weekend?EDIt: 9200 fell, good news for the bulls. If we can hold above, then I’ll be changing my tune. 10k can take it’s time, Im in no rush
2	1525865309	2	I think Tom Lee is crazy (in general, but also) to say that the upcoming crypto conference will give us 50%-100% boost, but it does seem like a prime opportunity to bust through 10K.
1	1525866739	1	You know what, I'm getting really annoyed by this.Buyers pushed from 9k, broke the resistance and disappeared like on yesterday's drop... Was expecting at least 9.3 on that move...
2	1525867830	2	Ok, nvm, here it is.
1	1525868037	1	It looks like you're putting a lot of value on the apparent pressure from buyers/sellers, and doing so successfully. It occurs to me that since we have the trade histories those could be aggregated to an indicator showing the relative degree of market buys/sells over time. The amount of sells vs buys is of course already aggregated in the actual price movements and volume. But this indicator might possibly indicate peaks and bottoms before they hit. Throw a 7-14-21 "moving average" on top and it might do very well. Time to do some backtesting!
0	1525852767	4	Not a big fractals believer but here's if this ends up breaking down and forming the third fractal of a pattern that came twice before the BGD.https://www.tradingview.com/x/KHbJK3Oj/
1	1525853687	2	Think 8800/8100 will hold at least for a first bounce. Down to 7500 is a big jump from here, we probably have a parachute at above support levels.
2	1525854374	2	Yeah I personally think we are about to bounce a bit soon back up to 9300-9400ish before back down

3	1525871919	1	Thinking of switching to bitmex because of this.

4	1525872353	1	Bitmex only irritating thing is that they still don't have mobile app. Logging onto website through mobile with 2FA takes too much time.Of course they still have problems with too much users, but I hope they'll fix this soon.
5	1525872691	1	there is no mobile app on android for kraken anyway so it's not a big problem for me. 
6	1525872994	2	But you can (or could if it works still, didn't use it for a while) use 'tabtrader',  it has support for kraken but not for bitmex.
6	1525873106	1	Hi, Kraken support here! Unfortunately we do not have an Android app and have no immediate plans to release one at this time. This may change, however, in the future and we'll be certain to announce it! -- Meanwhile, there are unofficial android apps that will take the API key, but we cannot attest to the trustworthiness of these. 
4	1525872456	1	I'm there because i have not BTC stack and only trading with a few hundred bucks. I hoped we got to 4 or 5k to buy BTC and then move to Bitmex. It never went there (truth be told, if it did i would probably wait for 3K and wouldn't pull the trigger anyway...)
3	1525871994	1	You'll get it eventually if you keep putting orders in. I went long on 3.5 btc this morning and it took 9 positions to get it all, some as little as .002They've been out of margin for the last week or so, it's been super aggravating.
1	1525872266	2	Kraken fixed their engine. And only the engine. All other irritating things are still on, that's why I'm not even thinking about getting back to them.

1	1525890151	2	The next wave on global interest hasn't yet begun.
1	1525889988	1	Okay, I'm far from an expert in the market, but here is my take. If you remember the daily dump in March, I think it may be money systematically leaving the market after the double top was confirmed.  It will probably take some time to win back trust and interest after we hit 6k a second time.  We did break out of the ATH down trend and defended some key levels since then, so I am gaining back some confidence in the market.  No one knows where it is going man, but I guess we'll see.
1	1525892102	1	Momentum, leverage, and a good dose of hopium.
0	1525865890	13	Hang on...yesterday a lot of TA guys were shorting and calling sub 8k and now you are all going long?Glad I held my underwater long from 9300.  I'm not dissing just confused how TA changes so quick and so extreme.
1	1525869285	16	If I never changed my mind, I'd still be short from $232. I was short because the market was in a steady decline and showed no signs of bottoming out. I closed this morning and opened a long when buyers materialized at $9,000. TA is nothing more than, since x is currently happening, y will probably follow. Unless of course z happens instead. In the current market, x was "breaking down below $9,250" and y was "breaking below support at $8,800, to head potentially as low as the mid $7,000s."Z was the market bouncing off of $9,000 and pulling back above $9,250. 
2	1525872250	1	Out of curiosity, what made you "pick" 9250 instead of eg. 9200 or 9300. What's the significance of 9250 exactly?What fib levels or channels are you looking at for that number?Just curious about your process here... :)
3	1525873077	4	First, there was the breakout to the upside of the descending channel that took place a few minutes after I made my entry:https://imgur.com/a/Rggoex9Normally I'd advise waiting for the breakout before entering a position, but since Bitmex's servers appear to be powered by 3 hamsters running on a treadmill, I've been forced to take riskier positions to ensure I get a decent entry. As for $9,250, you can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/sRgKJMh) that it served as strong support for most of the day Monday, and served as resistance for most of the day Tuesday. Reclaiming it as support is bullish and — combined with the break of the descending channel resistance — suggests this might be the beginning of a larger move. The market could very easily fall below $9,250 again, however, but as long as sellers don't push the market back into the descending channel, then the short-to-medium-term outlook is still bullish.
4	1525879002	2	Thanks a ton! Appreciate your transparency!
4	1525873552	1	Curious your take on the Consensus convention that runs next week. I know you're not one to trade based on news or FUD, and I personally think Tom Lee (of Fundstrat) is about as bulltard as they come and I don't believe we'll come close to seeing ATH prices during/immediately following this conference. However, it's a big conference which *will* garner positive media coverage and *should* cause an influx of public money. How much is unknown, but could that provide an X factor on top of the mid-term bullish outlook to push us back into 5-digit territory?
5	1525873877	5	I'm not a good person to ask about the possible impact of various news events on the market. I've seen the bitcoin market dump following "good" news and pump following "bad" news.I've seen the market stay completely sideways when something I'd consider to be "significant" comes out, and I've seen it lose it's mind when something I'd consider to be completely "benign" is revealed. It's easy to ascribe price movement to market events, but it's also a waste of time in my opinion. Did the market drop from $10,000 to $9,000 because Gates and Buffet have been spouting off about how bitcoin is "rat poison" and "they'd short it if they could"? Or did it drop because a popular Chinese food chain put "sell all your bitcoin" in their fortune cookies?When you divorce yourself from the **cause** of a move and focus on the **move itself**, then all that matters is what the market is doing. Not why it's doing it. 
6	1525874629	1	Fair enough. I think we're primarily in agreement on this front. Public interest historically has spiked during this conference, though, so you could almost put this into the category of taking a riskier entry due to the potential inability to get any entry during a violent move up. Not really enough to justify that, though, especially since there's 4 days between now and then and the market will likely be somewhere completely different by then.Plus we're both already long. 
1	1525866254	21	Most reddit "traders" pretend that they sold the top and bought the bottom of every move, even if they are actually getting slaughtered.
2	1525870561	3	That's why I feel it is so important to post your entry as you take it, not after the fact. Same goes for your exit as well. You have to own both your successes and your failures if you want anybody to take you seriously. 
3	1525873568	3	💯 % agree
1	1525866101	11	> a lot of TA guys I think they like to be refereed to as sorcerers.
1	1525865937	4	Maybe they were different people?
1	1525866959	2	TA changes so quick because there are support and resistance lines that create narratives. If any of these lines break, a different narrative becomes more probable.
1	1525867843	2	Still bearish, not calling sub 8k tho. But you know things change quickly depending on what TA you use. For me if we get above 9.4k and close that way things are looking a lot less bearish.
1	1525869701	1	Well it certainly could have been very nasty if it did fall below 8.8k and couldn't bounce back. In that case we could have dropped down to 7.5k where long term support is. But seeing as now it has held well on 9k and we're finally getting a nice bounce, it's safe to say we will probably try and break 10k again.
1	1525871538	1	I can confirm there is TA of every variety and pointing in all sorts of directions. Probably because it is not a scientific method and a lot depends on the person doing the TA, experience, insight or something. 
1	1525866494	0	TA is largely worthless in this market.  A few simple things matter like rounded bottoms and tops.  Fundamental analysis is the only thing that matters, and fundamentally, demand far exceeds supply over time.  We're making another run at $10K soon.

0	1525890745	14	While the market continues it's MO of flopping around aimlessly in the $9,000 to $10,000 range, I thought it might be helpful to take a look at where the market is in relation to the log resistance line from $20K to $6,000. https://imgur.com/a/hLYAEYiSince the line is descending, and the market is rising, we're getting farther and farther away from it every day. This is not necessarily a bad thing, however the market is painting itself into a corner the longer it goes without testing the line. In about 1 month, the line will be below $6,000. Which will be irrelevant if the market is above $11,700 by that time, but incredibly concerning if the market is still stuck below $11,700. Ideally I would have liked to have seen the line tested when it was still sitting in the upper $7,000s or lower $8,000s. Instead, the market opted to keep pressing onward. So we're coming pretty close to a point where the market can't really test the line without continuing to drop farther. We might actually already be at that point, since doing so at this point would drop price by about 25% — a pretty difficult drop to recover from.Anyhow, just something interesting to be mindful of.
1	1525891177	9	This is the kind of logic to why people think BTC will either Moon or GoblinTown this year.Why not just hover sideways without retesting that resistance, yet not resuming the old trend?
1	1525891086	6	What's the importance/significance in testing and confirming the line in your opinion? Why even the need to go and test it? The line slowly becomes obsolete anyways given how steep it is (and just the general nature of negative sloping diagonal lines), wouldn't we just want to stay away from it at this point?
2	1525891746	6	a bounce off of it would be bullish, which is why he'd want it. Chew always hopes for very clear signals regardless of where the market goes, it's not that he thinks it's necessary- it's just that it'd make it much easier to say "we are no longer following that line downwards" if we bounced off of it hard again. I agree though that the line is too aggressive to be followed and it's very possible we will not test it again even if we do continue downwards
3	1525896010	2	Yup, this exactly. 
1	1525891397	13	It's just a line people drew on internet and became a self-fullfilling prophecy. Pros are in control now, not retail "ta experts" and they use other indicators I believe, pivots etc. The further we get, the less relevant it is, wether you'd like it retested or not. Globally, diagonal lines have poor performance records, many are violated left and right up and down invalidating them, and at any point you can draw one from point a to point b, to fit your narrative, there's an infinity of diagonals. Sorry.
2	1525892136	6	I'm not going to convert someone who is so dismissive of technical analysis, but I would encourage you to reconsider the value of diagonal support and resistance as it pertains to bitcoin. Throughout 2016 and 2017, breaking log resistance lines with more than 2 points of contact was a strong indicator of short-term-trend reversal and significant upward movement:https://imgur.com/a/BdlD9WcGranted the timeframes are condensed for the resistance lines I've highlighted when compared to the resistance seen so far in 2018, but I would't be so quick to dismiss the significance of the breakout.
3	1525896154	2	I'm not dismissive of TA by any means, I use fib retracements, triangles, falling wedges, rsi, macd, volume, stoch rsi, parabolic sar etc. to enter a trade when the stars align. I used diagonals a lot previously and always wondered why the market did not react to one in particular, so let's find another one that fits (like the market cares about a point of the 2016 chart) until it fits, why did that one not get retested etc. Globally I think the indicators I use are much more representative of supply/demand that in fine, drives the price, than diagonals I kept adjusting to fit my cognitive bias. Maybe that helps, maybe not, I have a lot of respect for you and and how you're profitable sticking to your framework, which is something personal by definition.
2	1525891948	0	There's a reason lines with 2 points of contact are ignored. 4+ not so much. Believe what you will. Sorry.

2	1525869074	1	surprisingly well, yes
0	1525867539	6	Feeling ballsy. Long from 9250 until 10k retest. Stops under 8960.

4	1525871734	1	I was more referring to the engine routinely pooing the bed during moves >0.5%, but in a BGD scenario that's absolutely possible. Futures would almost certainly pass $10K if we had a 3% candle on spot. 
5	1525871850	1	Yup, lost like $50 on entry price trying to buy in on that break out. Got lucky to catch it while it was still going up.

0	1525863675	3	Little dumb me posted in the altcoin thread. Long @9150. As chewtoy said resistance gave up on this fifth touch as expected. I am actually proud of myself for finally making a plan and following it.
0	1525893196	3	I'm taking heat on my short, but not going to start to scale out of it unless we take out $9400 or so.  It's too early to call what kind of bounce this is, but will be become clearer over time.
0	1525842128	8	bulls defended 9k pretty well it seems
1	1525842455	4	More physiological support. From our previous dips, 9k has served as a weak support zone, generally bounced off 1-3 times then eaten away for a further plummet. 
1	1525846508	4	For now.  It was due for a bounce and they won that little skirmish but probably some more battles soon.
1	1525843039	3	i like how the bears were expecting a long squeeze but were tricked and none got liquidated(on finex) bears will dig more(8.8k) for treasure hunt?
2	1525843456	2	How did shorts get liquidated? Isn't 3.3x max leverage you can use on BFX?edit: I misread /u/ellahammadaoui's comment and gave him a hard time for no reason.

0	1525877275	5	This is pretty much exact same thing that happened on May 3rd... Consolidation in 9050-9175 rangeBump up to consolidate in the 9200-9300 rangeFollowed by hopefully a large candle to 9450 So for that reason ( and others ) I added to my long here from $9,040’s at @ $9,270. Expecting a breakup 
1	1525881161	2	Told you it looked like 1st of May! 
2	1525881679	2	And this time, we may break 10k 
1	1525877561	1	glad you were able to get those buys through in Kraken ;)
2	1525877646	1	Had to spam .05 market buys, anything over that i got a big fat  **not today sir**
3	1525878862	1	Why you go there? It's good for EUR non margin trading only.
4	1525879064	1	for people in the US who want to margin trade but don't trust bitmex, is there a better option than Kraken?
5	1525879212	1	Right, US have a problem. Finex and mex don't allow you to trade.Can't help here, I'm from Europe.
5	1525879709	1	Kraken is nice now that the engine actually works.  Some ui annoyances still, and some basic things that they could definitely stand to improve upon...But overall, I like Kraken.
4	1525879340	1	I’m from US. I’ve been told you can margin trade on mex in US but its against their rules.Just going to wait for binance to allow margin trading and stick with kraken for now 
5	1525879411	1	Somehow I didn't think you're from US. My bad.
6	1525879513	1	Haha what gave you the feeling I was from out of the states? My choice of language? 
7	1525879623	2	No, just messed some things up in my head. Too many people, too many countries, thought you're also from Europe.
7	1525880230	1	It's weird but, I'd been imagining you as a chinese dude.
8	1525880648	1	Asian???!?! Nope, I’m the definition of the typical white young adult ( country club, gym rat, ect) 
9	1525881150	1	I think because the shit you say is like a caricature out of a movie, like some of your shit-talking Americanisms (which by the way I love)  And you said it in a way that sounded like a chinese guy I knew who would imitate that.  So I guess my brain just reused an image for you.I'm American too btw, but I live in Europe (Asia before this).
9	1525881564	1	typical white young adult (51%+) is female btw, hello miss.
1	1525878827	1	Agreed... I'm still long from yesterday's slightly premature position.. have a take profit setup at $9440
2	1525879199	1	$9,150 seems to be a pretty decent area for a position. When you jumped the gun on the position i was actually surprised, you seem pretty patient when it comes to trading. I’ll most likely add more if we test the ascending channel line again 
3	1525879376	2	Yeah I got a little trigger happy.. could feel the thing ready to break and wanted to be in position because BitMex sucks during big price movements .. just had to hold through the dip
0	1525880264	5	So yesterday I said that I thought 9k would hold and fortunately I longed from 9050. Finding the correct exit is now the pickle. I think a retest of 10k is imminent in 3 or 4 days, whether it breaks or not is another matter. However I expect to encounter resistance between here and 9.6k so I will probably close around there and wait for reentry for a new long. tl;dr This may not be the run to 10k we have been waiting for but I think it probably is. I think we are trading above 10k next week onwards after overcoming resistance at around 9.5k-9.6k. 
1	1525881584	3	I have the same entry and don't plan to try and time the market within my sleep, that will most likely end-up in re-entering higher +fees. I'll set a stop profit before going to bed and adjust it as it goes up (or not)
1	1525882604	3	Thought your original text was concise enough. TL:DR seemed unnecessary. Just sayin. 
0	1525853526	8	30k longs, $200 premium on june futures... We might go up a few hundred, but we're not going to make a new local high anytime soon. Feeling pretty comfortable in my short, unfortunately.   edit: The past 8 hours we got 1.5k new longs and price has not moved. This is very bearish   In a downtrend like this you want longs to go down while price is not moving, until then any bounce is going to be a dcb
1	1525855937	5	I think the shorts and longs values on bfx are given waaay too much attention. It seems that every time longs starts to rise everyone thinks a big long squeeze will come and vice versa. In reality a real long/short squeeze is a rare event that takes the whole market by surprise.   The fact that you and, well anyone who has access to TradingView, can expect it, pretty much nullifies it. If this was so simple there’d be as many shorts opened as longs to make profit on the impending squeeze. Also bfx isn’t the only exchange. 
2	1525860796	3	For the time I have been daytrading bitcoin (about 15 months now), bfx longs/shorts and bitmex futures premium/discount has been the best temperature check on the market. I have been extremely profitable using this indicator. If the market is bearish and people are longing like retards, it is going to go down. The only time it did not work was in november and december last year. Having a 2-3% premium and a ton of underwater longs right under possibly the strongest resistance we will meet in a long while just shows how irrational this market is.      
2	1525856547	2	it's an indicator of trader sentiment- who are largely frequently wrong since January-february. Using as a contrarian indicator has proven relatively profitable so far for people who are patient and wait for things to truly get out of whack (which you're right- they aren't yet) And bfx really is the main exchange that other exchanges all follow 
1	1525854393	1	> $200 premium on june futuresHow does that support your hypothesis? It's still decreasing from where it was a few days ago, right?
2	1525855166	5	Just means most people assume its going to go up now, that this is the bottom. Shows that the market has a false sense of security, which marketmakers love to exploit, thats how they make their money. Basically we used most of our gunpowder down here, when we really should only use it when we're already going up
3	1525856864	1	Yeah it's fuel for market makers to push the price down but it's not an indicator in and of itself, I don't think. Eventually the price and premium will move up simultaneously. We we're looking at 15-20% premium at peak in December. Same thing can/will happen at some point. 
4	1525860487	1	December was an anomaly, the market conditions are far from that right now as the market is inherently bearish, and will continue to be so until we manage to close a few candles above the weekly bbands. The premium just screams market irrationality.
2	1525854812	2	well it went down to $100 and now it's back up to $200. and if you take the whole price goes sideways while longs/shorts increase as a contrarian indicator then you could think that premium going up while we go sideways is bearish.lots of people expect more upwards movement from here...which means most who want to buy the dip already have. so we'll see if their bullishness is warranted
0	1525840716	6	does anyone else think the [4 hour](https://i.imgur.com/wSJWzOW.png) looks kinda like [this](https://s3.tradingview.com/0/0Hn1Jm3s_mid.png)?
1	1525841445	5	> thisYou need a bigger picture man I can't see that small
0	1525856332	5	1D Bbands have not beent this tight since Februar 2017 on log scale and since October 2017 on linear scale. I would be really suprised if we break up from this little wedge just to make a new lower high.\(With the next daily canlde they will tighten a bit more once again if we stay in this range. Afterwards they will not tighten more for some time...\)
1	1525860684	2	Narrow BBands aside, today the price crossed decisively below the 20D MA; usually a clear indication of a trend reversal to the downside.
1	1525856386	1	of course if we broke down... the drop could be pretty damn big in that case
1	1525856600	1	It'll be interesting as for me it would confirm either a new bull trend or continuation of the bear trend. During last year bull run tight bands seemingly almost always broke up, Q1 this year during the bear run they always broke down.  
2	1525859393	1	They don't break up in a bull thread, but the fact that most broke up makes it a bull thread 
0	1525865667	12	Boy this just screams bulltrap. Fiat for now. Careful trading fellas
1	1525866001	6	only way to know is to wait and see if it's goes back into the wedge
1	1525868459	2	Or maybe the drop was a bear trap? There's as much reason for the rise as the drop. It's only a bull trap if the drop afterwards is sustained and long lived. If you think we need to drop further to say 8800 or 8500 before climbing higher it's not a trap.
1	1525868059	1	you can also ride a bulltrap a bit ;\)
1	1525870979	1	It can hardly be called a trap when there have been so many warning signs already.
0	1525864299	9	I still say this gets to at least $10K That number is just too important for the bulls to defend even if it goes down right after.
1	1525864402	9	12k is much more important as it will confirm an adam eve bottom which is a reversal signal 
2	1525864430	9	11.7k is the one to watch
3	1525864960	4	12k is easier to write, and everything is +- 500 anyway
4	1525865507	2	makes sense
2	1525864653	4	oh I know, but I don't think that'll happen just yetI mean even $10K there is a struggle with. But thats the point, if we struggle with $10K and take it thats one thing. If we struggle with $10K and can't even get above that, then the dump will be that much harder since people will start losing faith 
1	1525864418	3	This as in this breakout?
1	1525878516	1	We got to 9990, isn't that close enough?

0	1525894035	2	Sorry for a hypothetical bit of discussion, but let’s say some big players do indeed want to invest in BTC($10 million +), I have a couple of questions: - would it be logical to buy avoiding exchanges, like straight from the miners? - if the first one is true, what effect would this have in the exchange price? Would it raise the price due to less sell pressure from the miners (assuming miners normally sell their coins on exchanges to cover costs) - how do traders keep track of such activity if it doesn’t happen on exchanges? Would it be possible to make a massive buy/sell like this without affecting the market price whatsoever?I may be getting a bit tired but it seems to me that such activity won’t have a noticeable effect on the market price in the short term. Am I wrong ?
1	1525894811	5	Oh it's not hypothetical, there are plenty of people who are investing at those levels. Over the Counter (OTC) is where this stuff goes down. Circle does about $2 Billion a month in OTC:https://www.circletrade.com/en/
1	1525896311	3	1. If you buy OTC, you’re not buying on an exchange, so you’re not contributing to the buy pressure2. If you buy 10M on an exchange, price goes up3. The coins you buy OTC would be sold on an exchange if no one was going to buy them OTC, so you are taking sell pressure away4. Some OTC desks will buy the coins back on an exchange as soon as they’re sold to you, this is more of a brokerage than an OTC trade. In this case, it makes no difference whether you buy or they buyAll-in-all the price is relatively unaffected by OTC desks until the people who bought the coins start dumping them 
2	1525897243	1	There's a difference between OTC that has own stack and the one that is a brokerage. When I sold OTC guys actually put a short on market and covered them later with coin bought from me.
3	1525897877	1	and where would the coin that you sold them come from?
4	1525898175	1	Either you bought it earlier or just before the transaction.I'm just agreeing that OTC transaction can be completely out of the market or it can affect the market the same way that big player would buy on exchange.It's that big player goes to OTC also because he doesn't want to deal with exchange, he puts money on the table and get coins on ledger. No third party risk.
5	1525898302	1	oh for sure, all good I'm just curious, so hope you don't mind a few more questions. where would you buy them?
1	1525894433	1	>would it be logical to buy avoiding exchanges...Yes. Slippage is a real thing when dealing with amounts that big, and they can likely strike a deal at the same or lower than market without incurring exchange fees.>if the first one is true, what effect would this have in the exchange price?Like you said, the price would slowly rise due to lower sell pressure.>how to traders keep track of such activity if it doesn't happen on exchanges?You can't as far as i'm aware, outside of having some level of insider knowledge by being involved with either transacting party.
1	1525895753	1	There is also the splitting it up across multiple exchanges method.  If you do that, and also cost-average over a couple days - it won't have that much impact.
1	1525898117	1	$10 million wouldn't have much of an impact nowadays. Exchanges do $7-10 billion a day. But buying quietly OTC would be the way to go unless you were strategically trying to bump the price up or prevent it from falling. Personally, I'd buy into the big dumps just to fuck with the dummies doing that.

0	1525864191	4	When I woke up this morning to a new low that showed support, and being at the edge of that descending wedge, and at the bottom of our larger channel, I took the quick opportunity to put in a *small* stake.  Good R/R and it'd be easy to know when to bail.!long xbtm18 9220 5X 21.6%Was away from computer until lunch just now, and I happened to check just after the breakout.  Told myself I would add if we broke out so:!long xbtm18 add 9373 21.3%I'll add more if/when we bounce down for a retest if it's not looking like it'll keep going down.  But this second add already took ca up to the beginning of this breakout so I'd like to keep it there for now.  Will close hopefully near break even if it looks like it can't sustain.But its on june futures and a little annoying that before I opened the position, the premium had already taken it near the previous low anyway.  But at least this breakout is still scaling up well.So much for taking a break.Edit: My first target is 9450, though I'll take 9450 profits on the way down, not with upward wick catching.  Second target will have orders at 10k, third will have orders at 10.225k  (those are spot prices.  position prices are in futs)

1	1525839905	9	I already opened one at 8,995. I think the RSI is oversold in all charts. Plus, there is not much room to go below from here, may be we will touch 8,800 and go even lower, or may be not! !long XBTUSD 8995 3.3X 100%

2	1525839632	1	Exactly what I was thinking.. thanks for confirming. Think as long as it stays above 8800 it has a decent chance of pushing back further up in coming hours/days..
0	1525862142	3	Long @ $9150. Seem to be hitting support, although previous ones broke I believe this one will not as RSI is at a good level on 4H and even better on lower timeframes. Atleast a small nice bounce is to be expected. Im ready to sell anytime. Also as mentioned previously Bollinger Bands (BBands) are getting tight and all of this leads me to believe there is a better chance at a breakout upwards than downwards. Ive placed my bet, stop loss is currently an undecided mental one. Will sell if the resistance level we are at right now breaks down on higher volume on +4H charts with bearish looking candles.
0	1525865291	2	Anyone else fear that Bitcoin getting official on Wall Street might somehow fuck it up in the long run?
1	1525865458	5	You can’t fuck up Bitcoin. You can only fuck up the market where Bitcoins are traded on centralized databases
1	1525865350	2	In what sense?
1	1525865888	1	This is not going to come about for some time. It's not easy setting up a trading desk, that too of the magnitude in which wall street would be playing in. Having said that, when it does start, it will ensue a snowball effect of institutional investments, regulations and ultimately audit. At that moment, we will truly see Bitcoin's fair value. Reduced volatility, reduced risk, consistency in growth and easier adoption. Until then enjoy the arena, gladiators
1	1525867824	1	I imagine it would cause a bit of price suppression with all the shorting and manipulation in the short term but more liquidity and less volatility long term. I'll probably stop trading and just hold some if volatility drops off too much, it's a big boys game at that point.
1	1525877191	1	Bit of a pessimist? I am too, I tend to think up worst-case scenario type things in my head and worry about them. But for some reason on this topic, I can’t really be very pessimistic. 
0	1525847745	5	Anyone care to explain why so many people think the bear market has ended or is close? Because I sure as hell can't see any compelling reason to believe it's done with us yet.This has nothing to do with this little drop, I've never believed we left the bear market. If this turns out to be yet another dcb then there are going to be some very painful moments for a lot of people who got on the wrong side of this.
1	1525848177	12	Multiple reasons, breaking out of the falling wedge from 20k, adam and eve double bottom, bullish news for crypto in general, the fact that the bear market lasted 5 months, which is 5 years in crypto, alts going parabolic. I agree that this may be a DCB but claiming there is no reason for the bear market to end is just wrong, there are plenty of reasons, we will find out soon enough if its really over.
2	1525850684	3	> breaking out of the falling wedge from 20kthese are apparently not very good at being actual reversal patterns. we should really be looking more for an A&E or a triple bottom> adam and eve double bottomstill need a pretty hefty 30% from here to confirm that> bullish news for crypto in generalLN came out and we moved up about 1%, news really doesn't matter much post blow-off top, matters more when we've bottomed and are going sideways or are already in the midst of a bull run> alts going parabolici don't see this as a good thing personally, just indicative of the space still needing to be cleansed, keep in mind the two times alts have gone parabolic (june 2017, jan 2017) btc dumped like a motherfucker afterwards
2	1525848461	4	The trend break doesn't mean too much, neither the double bottom as there's no confirmation yet it's a double bottom. Technically we didn't go back to retest 6k as well.I see barely any bullish crypto news and the fact that alts are rising means nothing except that stupid people still buy shit coins.Weekly moving averages still show us a long going way off a bull market, right now we are still in the bear market until proven otherwise. Plus the bear market hasn't lasted 5months. 4months right now, it can certainly last another 4.
3	1525849771	1	Yes, surely you can invalidate all of these points but thats because you are biased, we all are. One thing you cant invalidate though is the good news about crypto, Coinbase hiring massive amounts of new staff, Sillicon Valey shilling crypto, the news about the NY stock exchange considering crypto, banks buying crypto exchanges etc etc. I dont care if we fall down to 6500 again, I'll just buy more on the way down because the writing is on the wall for btc and many alts.
4	1525852915	1	I'm not biased in the slightest. I desperately want the bull market. Right now all that matters is the evidence, picking out positive news in the media is not evidence of anything apart from the fact that you've found positive media articles...that's it. everything now still points to medium term downtrending, long term uptrending. 
3	1525850665	1	And another 4 and another and another 4. We can't really now for sure, but there is a long way for BTC to correct after 10000% rise in three years. 
1	1525849265	3	self fulfulling: if that many people think the bear market has ended, it ended effectively. 
2	1525850468	3	everyone and their mom is gonna argue with me here but tell that to 2014-2015...those dudes kept saying it was over every single time there was a run-up like this...call it gox call it whatever you want, "belief" doesn't change anything. it's people *actually* buying more than they're selling
3	1525855272	2	History doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes.
3	1525855617	2	to me this situation right now has 2014 written all over it. I know that thing don't copy like for like but it really is similar. If this turns out to be a DCB then a lot of people are going to have to take a good long look at themselves for getting carried away yet again
2	1525849876	2	Can be a big difference between the market sentiment that is visible online versus the true market sentiment which is always unknowable (unless you want to say the price is itself the reflection of the sum total of sentiment)
1	1525849114	0	Bitcoin was back on the front page of the NYT today. It was on Silicon Valley 2 days ago. People are starting to get interested again. There are an absurd amount of bullish qualitative indicators for the market in general. Every day Bitcoin is around it gains more credibility and publicity. More people know about it. I do not have enough time to explain why I switched from bearish to bullish about a month ago, but look at the media and the light bitcoin is now being portrayed in and you might find your answers. Yeah I could be wrong, but that is life. BULLISH 
0	1525844170	4	This local downtrend feels bad until you zoom out to the daily.
1	1525844240	5	The daily feels bad because it's continuous red candles. 
0	1525855096	4	I measured the highest and lowest point in every step in the successive drops we have seen since 5/6 and it appears that every time, the difference is about $200. It appears as if the price "waits" until it has reached a point $200 above the last recent low. Based on that, I wouldn't be surprised if the next drop happens after price touches $9160. (This is not intended as investment advice, just an observation.)

2	1525856201	1	Yeah, and I added a warning. It's interesting though. Why the same $200 "steps"?
3	1525856396	2	Trading algo's. 
2	1525856297	1	Can confirm. - Hey, btc is trapped in a range, I'll sell the horizontal resistance that is clearly there from the last three times.Result - it kept going up the fourth time.
2	1525863441	1	Let's see what happens now. Price just passed the "trigger" level.
1	1525860173	2	I'm seeing the pattern as well. Thinking we go down quite a bit more. Buyers seem to want 8800, 8700 maybe even lower. 
1	1525856250	1	More prone to keep an eye on the descending line even if, it suggests your price point:https://www.dropbox.com/s/peqcx0kfc8xamo0/Finex%20-%20BTCUSD%20-%2020180509.PNG?dl=0RSI should go near 50/51 which is has been a support turned  resistance so far.
1	1525857953	1	I was thinking the same as well, so many up and down pumps to near that 10k round nr, and then a linear scale out on 1d scale. On the positive side, at least it's not a giant red dildo. 
0	1525862392	4	I'm sticking to my reaccumulation theory. 9k has a decent risk/reward ratio for a small long. * Close to support * falling wedge * RSI oversold on many timeframes, * 4H RSI as oversold as it was on our 6.4k bottom.[2H chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Zz8CtsTb/).

1	1525866727	2	Good call man.Don't pay any mind the upvotes/downvotes in this sub.  Some people with open shorts probably just didn't want to see this.  Also, enable the reddit feature to show you if a comment is controversial or not.  Maybe you were negative but perhaps there were a bunch of upvotes fighting against it.
2	1525871577	2	Thanks man. Yeah, I agree that votes shouldn't matter, but it can be frustrating to try and add value to this sub, only to see your post disappear due to downvotes. I can handle disagreement, but when nobody even tries to engange me in a discussion, then why the fuck are we even here?Anyway, it seems to have balanced out somewhat!
2	1525867654	1	the votes do matter though as its easy to bury a good comment like this one below the vote threshold, right? 
3	1525868270	1	Yeah indeed.  It's up to people like us to keep it visible then.  I don't see insightful comments get utterly buried though, they usually stay close enough to zero.I meant though that as a poster, don't feel angry about it, and start calling names.
4	1525868690	1	yep that's good advice, agreed
1	1525863022	2	>4H RSI as oversold as it was on our 6.4k bottom.Well the first time we hit 6.4k the 4h RSI was 22, now the 4h RSI is 39 and was 33 at its lowest point.
2	1525863628	2	What exchange? It was 25 on finex.
1	1525867556	1	Upvoted for visibility - there are downvote bots and salty downvoters everywhere, it’s a shame. Agree with the reaccumulation (said this yesterday too). 
0	1525839314	4	Does anyone really think we aren't seeing $8800 or lower?   
1	1525847414	1	I think we will see $8800, and lower. These recoveries are too fast and sharp, and volume just isn't there to support a long trend for this price range. I have been wrong before, though.

0	1525889246	2	In these time I'll ignore everything and focus on the bollingers: https://imgur.com/a/rU8o3UXThis moves compresses the price even more. It doesn't break us up, neither invalidate a future move to the downside. But price is compressing in the BB range.
1	1525889415	1	Would Bbands are tight on the one day trigger something as large as our biggest BGD? Minus the fact that there was 40,000 shorts open 
2	1525890461	2	No. BBands do not catalyze moves, only offer a glimpse at when one may be coming. 
2	1525890311	1	I would not focus on the amount of short/longs. For one, 10k bitcoin is not enough to move the market (only in a short-term window).

0	1525854758	2	Closed my short from $9,400 at $9,050 and opened a baby long at @9,046. I’m still a bit bearish, and i also probably shouldn’t be trading at 4:30’AM, but I’de like to ride out this long to hopefully $9350-$9550 and possibly re open my short from there depending on the situation. Bbands are getting Uber tight on the longer time frames. We are getting close ish to the bottom of wedge and if this thing pops off, i don’t want to miss a low 9k entry like last time. 
1	1525855024	2	Good trade(s)! I think you'll get your 9350 target over the next few days. 
2	1525855110	3	Break above $9,150 would break us out of the wedge, and if we don’t meet too much trouble @ $9,200 I dont see why $9,350 isn’t an option

1	1525873607	11	Seems like a strange time to close a long, at a bull flag that came out of a falling wedge and off the bottom of a multi-day ascending channel, loaded with bullish divergences.  Sort of a bombardment of confluence of signals here that say stay long for short term.What's your reasoning?
2	1525873736	2	We're still having hard time to break through 9.3, going above 9.5 should be bullish enough to test 10k.Not a stupid move, he took the profits and is still long on his cold stack. Better than closing in a loss if it bounces back down.

0	1525892363	1	Is this drop back to under 9300 (hit 9260 now) anything to worry about? I hope it doesn't start going south rapidly again... What are ur thoughts?
1	1525892564	4	It's likely that some form of retrace will happen ( is happening) to determine some sort of channel in which it would climb again. However, there is also a chance that this was a DCB and we keep going down... nobody knows, but I wouldn't get worried until our (arbitrary) support line at 9k gets broken. Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/XpDMYdh9/It's been wicked on our rapid descent from our extreme run-up to 9.75k, but I'm thinking that might've been a blow-off bottom as support hadn't developed yet.
2	1525892798	2	I really hope this wasn't a DCB... have got a long from just under 9100 (a position I entered after a long time) and dont want to lose profits...!
1	1525892511	5	whats more likely breaking 10k or breaking 8500?
2	1525895007	6	lol at everybody 
2	1525892701	1	Probably 10k from here I would say... but thats purely my thoughts.
3	1525892843	1	10k , too much bullish sentiment and consensus coming next week 
1	1525896279	1	It seems to be holding 9.3k really well.  My entry today was just below here, so it feels like it hasn't moved all day.  I'm hoping that it dips just a bit so I can add around 9.1k range, or maybe sell and stay out if we get another quick pump.
2	1525896419	2	Well its already been all the way back to just under 9k and then back here again..! Lets hope it doesn't go back there else may go much further below...
0	1525885243	0	I see this breakout from the rising wedge as a potential formation of a H&S that will ultimately break us down into the 8's.https://www.tradingview.com/x/sKxVNdkd/As I mentioned in other posts I think a potential third fractal (A/B/C/D) is more interesting to look at than likely. But it does show that a move all the way down to retest the old resistance for support and the old support is well within the possibilities so I made a little target potential D zone.Since I've been posting less of my initial trades and don't think I'll be keeping up with the open positions bot, I hate to post a good trade after the fact but trust that I had plenty of bad ones prior. Closed out my short from 9570 at 9110, put my trading stack from fiat into BTC & ETH, got my sell limit orders filled overnight at 9315, 9355 and a great heavier weighted entry at 9395 that wicked up on Kraken. Closed out my 9315 and 9355 positions for small scalp profit at 9290 but keeping that 9395 open. Will be putting my stack back in fiat at 9500, and looking to add onto my short in layers at 9585 at 9685 depending on price action.
1	1525885743	10	I'm a little surprised by the short call after 899x was rejected so summarily and the futures premium returned. Still, short from right here makes at least as much sense as long from right here. We just punched though the next layer of resistance pretty confidently, though.
2	1525891016	1	Yeah after reading your post and doing some more thinking I closed out that remaining short entry at 9325. Hard to believe there won't be an opportunity to get a higher entry. Layering in orders at 9485/9585/9685

1	1525880455	8	This is dumb. Screenshots are easily faked anyway. If someone wants to say they're long from 9300 right now when they aren't, then fine. If someone else opens a long based off that alone, they shouldn't be trading anyway.What traders should get called out for is posting "long from 9100" right now. That's just malarkey. 
1	1525880766	9	Who gives a shit?  If you are blindly following trades you're fucked in any case.
1	1525881024	6	TBH, if i were you i could care less about the position of most traders here. Most of the daily is absolutely biased and most of the trades are hindsight ones. There are howevere few gems (few traders) i take into acccount but you can easily spot them: trades are always declared and quoted upon opening/closing, trades are always motivated, there is continuity in their moves.
1	1525881205	6	Already a history of people posting fake screenshots (perhaps you know who I'm talking about). It's not hard to edit a few fields on MEX or BFX to fudge the numbers. Luckily, the person who was doing this doesn't seem to post here much anymore after I made a big scene about it.
2	1525882297	4	don’t burn bunnies, it’s arsonamirite
3	1525882770	3	One can probably inferno who I'm talking about based on all these hints. Imo, people who post that type of nonsense should be bunned.
1	1525880668	2	> How can we know these comments are not 'fake trades' meant to influence other traders?To say this is to suggest a significant number of people claim fake trades which I find hard to believe.
2	1525881307	2	The alternative is even harder to believe: That a large number of people are bragging about placing high risk trades. As others pointed out, the norm in this sub is that people brag after the fact.
2	1525881099	1	> To say this is to suggest a significant number of people claim fake trades which I find hard to believe.Then you are gullible. I can name a number of people on this sub who obviously post fake trades, including one or two that actually go out of their way to post doctored screenshots of Bitmex. I'm not supposed to call them out anymore though because they get mad and complain to the mods.
3	1525881331	2	You wascally wabbit. You're on fire.
4	1525881406	2	Fake screenshots are sort of my expertise.I'm so tempted to call out the big faker but I'm not supposed to do that anymore. I'm reformed.

6	1525882367	3	Oh, lol. I didn't even catch that. Yes, pyro-maniacal hares have seemingly learned their lesson. Though I notice the still post the same screenshots on /r/CC from time to time.

I see regularly a post about 'hey guys I made 5% on a million dollars woo hoo' and there are 20 congratulation comments. People think he's a hero and might be influenced by his alleged trades later.
4	1525884100	1	For sure. There are reputable traders here and disreputable ones. Only the frequent observer can take note of who's who.
1	1525891475	1	You don't know.  And it really doesn't matter that much, either way.There is certainly a good bit of astroturfing and such going on at times, but you can figure out who some of the genuine posters are and just ignore the noise in here as best you can.
0	1525891500	0	The mini rally to 9300 was predictable, but the trend reversal was evident in today's daily chart with the MA20 crossover, so I'm not surprised by what we're seeing now.Edit: I see on the downvotes the bulls have returned to the sub. 
1	1525891621	3	where to you see it continue to? i opened a short at 9300. Wondering if the retracement is temporary?
2	1525892475	4	I don't want to offer investment advice. I read a TA earlier today that we might see a small rally to 9300, so I expected it. Same analysis said we were heading for $8900, but on the condition that we stayed inside the falling channel on the hourly chart. Since we broke out of the falling channel, I suppose the outlook is less clear now, but we did cross the 20MA on the daily chart. Also, now the hourly 50MA has leveled out, but the 100MA and 200MA are still sloping down. Without laying claim to being any kind of expert, I would guess that we will continue down, and that today's little rally was not a reversal.
0	1525882662	1	This might belong in the alt thread but BCH looks like it's reversing (+10-13% in the last 12 hours and still pumping). When alts go up, BTC is usually not too far behind.
