Buy in based on that, and set stops based on that.  I'll recommend setting stops like you bought in, incrementally (not all at once).  Also, you set your max position size (including max margin use) based on the $ loss you're willing to absorb.  If a 10% loss to yoru stack is acceptable, then set your margin and stop losses accordingly.  Also, ignore orderbooks.  GDAX is extremely liquid and will constantly show 100 - 300 btc buy walls then fold them away instantly.  You're better off not even looking at it.
