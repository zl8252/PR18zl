0	1526302233	62	Let me begin by saying I have tremendous respect for all of you trading this market. Truly, truly so. There is chop and there are scalps to be had. Nevertheless, in any market where trading has become balkanized over a number of exchanges, regulations are lax or nonexistent and (most importantly) volume is extremely low, I am left to conclude that the ability to trade leveraging TA techniques will result in outcomes that are no better than 50-50 overtime. As a quick aside, I’d highly recommend reading “When Genius Failed” about the collapse of LTCM.What needs to be accepted is the fact that far better equipped and resourced institutional participants have entered the fray. Make no mistake. BTC has crossed the Rubicon. Be it Goldman Sachs or the NYSE, every single major financial service provider is taking the entire crypto space as a serious market. They’ve no choice. Their clients are demanding the service and their clients are also demanding the accumulation of BTC at “attractive levels”. I am sharing this with you all in that I’ve operated in this very space (legacy financial services) for more than 20 years. Any name you see as “thinking” or “building” a crypto platform has already begun that process. Know, without question, that these groups are operating in this space, and trading with and against you, as I type.  While I am fully prepared for all of your down votes, I must vehemently counter the fact where many of you continue to press the case that selling and downward pressure occurs solely because “sellers want to sell”. To a certain extent, yes, but when you evaluate the Bitfinex order book closely you will find that this downward pressure at the moment is being very well managed. Without question buyers at present are far and few between. Until that changes there isn’t any chance of a material break out on the upside. At the same time, however, the manner, size and timing in which sell and buy orders arise makes – again for me – it rather clear that there is what I will describe as “forced” accumulation. My meaning behind “forced” accumulation” is simply that the above-mentioned institutional actors will operate in a way where enough pressure is applied so that the more typical market participants (you and me) either sell out of fear of the price falling even further or those selling under the expectation of buying at a lower level. To the latter group I would advise that such a strategy will work until it doesn’t.    Where do I see all of this going? Not that any of you asked (explicitly or otherwise), but take the following as intended; nothing more than one person’s outlook. Over a period of time, and I’ve no idea how long, institutions and accredited investors will be buyers of BTC. Slow, steady and unseen. This will be done through OTC markets and exchanges. There will then come a point in time when the period of accumulation has reached a point of saturation and the price for BTC will then rise and – for me – will rise both quickly and unexpectedly. We are, after all, speaking to an asset class where supply and demand will end up carrying the day. I will remain long term invested and for now I wish you all good trading days ahead.
1	1526303656	10	am i the only one who read this in a deep baritone black man's voice?
2	1526304086	5	"Are you in good hands?" \-Allstate Guy
2	1526304648	3	Thank you!!!  That made me laugh. Am about the opposite of what you've described. Still, that sort of personal connection is what makes this thread, and Redditt in general, such a great platform. 
1	1526303703	8	>What needs to be accepted is the fact that far better equipped and resourced institutional participants have entered the fray. Make no mistake.There's absolutely no doubt about that. And I too noticed the managed downward pressure you're talking about. It suddenly stops when the price dips a little too much, it's very controlled, the buy side too.However I don't think you can put all the big players in one category. Some are here to make quick money from the huge volatility (aka pumping & dumping). It's all a little more complex than that, but you're certainly not wrong.
2	1526304537	2	Very glad that I'm not the only one seeing what appears to be very clear trends in the order book. When evaluating Bitfinex the algos - if that's what they are - applied to the book make it rather clear where the trade range is targeted at any given point in time. Not that the range is always kept in check mind you.  I also agree with the point that there is a need for more nuance in regards to the various groups in question. That being said, I still see a rather clear focus on price suppression over the past 4 to 6 weeks especially given all that we've seen in the alt space.  
2	1526305979	1	I think back to the periods in March or maybe in April also where we have seen days spent between 7800-8200 or 8200-8600 and wondered then if those were levels were intentionally being made support/resistance for a bigger reason. As the news then was of institutions are getting into this etc.
1	1526302436	7	I hope you're right sir! 
1	1526302677	8	great write up, and I could not agree more
1	1526304590	5	Great read and agreed on the effect of new and better equipped market participants on TA. It is the reason I've stopped trading intraday and focus almost exclusively on the +1D charts. 
2	1526305424	2	Not entirely certain that other players are better with TA, for me it is more about the ability among these participants to marshal and deploy resources in a market where volume is so incredulously low that price can be effected.    
1	1526303697	5	>There will then come a point in time when the period of accumulation has reached a point of saturation and the price for BTC will then rise and – for me – will rise both quickly and unexpectedly.This is why I've stopped trying to time the market, and I'm just holding on to my coins now. I can no longer time or predict the market with any sort of accuracy, because at this point there is too much potential good news and bad news waiting to arise. The hardest thing for me is going to be dealing with the regret in price drops, not because I'd be in the red, but because I could have bought \*more\* bitcoin with the same amount of USD. As far as risk:reward goes, right now it's too risky not to have any bitcoin \(from my own personal assessment which I do not intend to imply that anyone else should feel the same. Look around you, draw your own conclusions\).  
1	1526304934	3	Most motivational post I've read in this sub. 
2	1526305208	3	Probably the best compliment I've received in a long time. Thank you. In truth, I've been thoroughly frustrated with how the Bitfinex order book has been "managed" for a number of weeks now and wanted to vent somewhat.Wherever possible, "don't hate the player, hate the game" meaning DCA to the best of your financial ability.  
1	1526303009	3	Thank you.
1	1526305420	1	Just in case you missed this yesterday, I've been seeing something kind of similar. Really great write up, man kudos.https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j1gi0/daily_discussion_sunday_may_13_2018/dywq4z3/
2	1526305599	2	I suspected that others would have picked up on and highlighted the same trend, and what is provided here in the link above is even better than mine. Far more succinct and to the freaking point. 
3	1526305885	1	Thank you, but I think your post is much better than mine, I'm just glad someone else is seeing what I'm seeing!
4	1526306497	2	Let's just say, the manner in which the market is operating at this very minute goes along way to "proving" - whatever that even means - both of our points of view.Enjoy the day my friend.  
5	1526306611	1	;) right back at you, amigo
6	1526307126	1	A favourite quote “if it was easy then everyone would be doing it”. 
0	1526309525	39	Can we now agree most of us don't have a clue what the price is doing short term? 
1	1526309594	10	Or long term
2	1526309849	9	long term as in years? I think we all know where this is going over the next decade or so
3	1526310079	5	You do? Where is it going?
4	1526310091	10	the moon
5	1526310188	2	not beyond ?
3	1526309974	3	Yeah, I know it will either go up or down
4	1526310074	4	up
3	1526315094	2	No one knows. It could be worth millions one day or nothing. You have experts on both sides. No one has a real clue 
1	1526309913	5	Well not really, this was the second attempt on 8800 resistance from yesterday only with more volume
1	1526311814	3	We're all a bunch of coked out monkeys throwing darts at a chart.
1	1526310056	2	It’s a crap shoot at this stage no matter what anyone says. I even think the odds of success are against most of us. 
0	1526290188	38	I decided I’m here for the technology. My portfolio went from 4500$ to 1500$, so I guess I’m not here for the money.
1	1526292263	5	Sounds familiar hahaha. I FOMOed in at 17K, so I have no option but to hodl and wait. 
2	1526292974	7	I bought at 8k, but shitcoins fucked me really bad.
1	1526290933	8	You decided? :)
1	1526301348	3	It could be worse, my altfolio went from $100k to $5k haha. 
0	1526304413	16	So, it's been an interesting 72 hours to say the least. The market spent the entire day yesterday pushing relentlessly upwards, but dropped like a stone when it hit resistance between $8,700 and $8,800. The result was a breakdown below a bit of a janky bear flag that formed following the $9,400 to $8,200 drop:https://imgur.com/a/sI9xlbLThe target for this breakdown would be roughly $7,000, which seems a bit excessive at the moment, but targets are what they are, regardless of whether I think they're especially likely. They're just math. In the short term, there's bear flag-ception going on with a small flag forming on the 30m:https://imgur.com/a/W7nG2A7This one breaks down at around $8,360 at the moment and breaks up at around $8,500 at the moment. So if you're out of position like I am, you're looking for an opportunity to short a breakdown of the smaller formation. Or possibly a short at the top of the formation with stops $50 north of the resistance line if if possible, although we might not get the opportunity.I had a bit of an off weekend with two poorly timed entries in a row (one long, one short). Funnily enough, they were both at current price, so had I been more patient with both I could have closed at breakeven instead of taking losses on them. A good lesson that trading within consolidation periods = bad idea. EDIT: !short BTCUSD 8400 10x 100%While a pump to $8,500 is possible (perhaps even likely), I'd rather get in early than have to wait for a breakdown and for Bitmex's servers to make it impossible to get into a decent position.
1	1526306077	2	Damn, you are out of luck. 
2	1526306213	2	Ya, wasn't so bad though. Bitmex server lockdown actually saved my ass. Spot was in the $8600s while June futures were lagging at $8,450. So I market closed for a small loss. 
3	1526306461	1	When being glued to the chart pays off. I would also like to say that I've been following your posts for about a month, and they're immensely educational and helpful for a newbie like me. So thanks for that (I said it before but dude... you're paying for my pension lol). I didn't always make money following your trades, but I NEVER made money going against your trades. So today marks the first time that I went against your direction and made a killing. Yay! The malfunctioning temporal indicator has indicated the right temporal status once.
1	1526305619	1	>While a pump to $8,500 is possible (perhaps even likely), I'd rather get in early than have to wait for a breakdown and for Bitmex's servers to make it impossible to get into a decent position.The new classical type of metatrading, trading before servers crash instead of markets crash
1	1526305724	1	I got stopped out on my short a decent amount below where you manually closed, and I actually re-opened right about where you closed. I was glued to the charts last night, and I definitely felt for you--been there many times. I'm trying to remain patient with my position. Largest I've ever had--full stack 10x short from 8680 (June futures entry). 
2	1526306064	1	Bot never picked up my position, but I closed it for a small loss at the beginning of that candle. 
3	1526306213	2	I mashed market sell when finex broke 8600, and I was damn lucky June futures were still under 8500 somehow. Got 8490 exit.
4	1526306593	2	Yup, I got out at $8481. 
0	1526276992	23	Edit: Sorry for how long this post got; I was away from major chart watching for the weekend and needed to throw up a bunch on the page to get all my ducks in a row.https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/x4V9yBaR-Horizontal-Analysis/Medium term chart for me is all focused on horizontal levels; the flags I'll talk about secondary. The two main levels to point out: ~8.2k, and ~7.8k.8.2k coincides closely with the 50% FIB retracement from ~6.4k to ~9.9k. In addition, it is the beginning zone of a high volume node (right of chart) that also coincides with a pretty good horizontal support level (orange line). In blue I've highlighted areas of interest for this horizontal support; it served as quite the resistance post BGD (other than a momentary bart above it).7.8k coincides with a slightly smaller high volume node but has also been a pretty strong horizontal support/resistance line on the timeframe we're looking at. It, too, coincides  approximately with the 61.8% FIB level.These are the two major supports I've been watching in recent times and will continue to watch. FWIW, we seem to have topped out in the approximate zone of the 38.2% FIB level.*IF* 7.8k breaks down, we'll possibly encounter some token support at 7.5k but more likely be headed to a retest of the lows.So how do we get some inkling of whether or not 8.2/7.8 will hold? Well, who really knows. But this is where the flags come in. In yellow, you can see I've drawn two congruent flags. Depending on how lax you want to be, you could see them as already breaking down, but with heavy 8.2k support right there below it, in my opinion that's the level to really watch. The target for the smaller flag would be around 7.8k when adjusted for the heavy supports, providing more confluence. If you take that large flag as valid (it's not as well formed, but pretty apparent on longer term charts than 4 hours),  then we're likely looking at testing the bear trend lows again.The flags breaking up is harder to trade if you want a great entry. The current "top" is around 8.8k, but it'll continue going up. Entering here could be a great position if 8.2k does hold and the flags end up breaking upwards; however, that's looking risky. 8.6k could be a decent r/r entry place - if we do manage to get back up there it's likely for a retest of the top of the flag at least; you'll probably have an opportunity to exit at break even if 8.8k fails again or something.Anyway, my current state for those who care: Been 80% fiat since a little over 9k, bought in significantly for a short time around 8.2-8.3k, but exited too quickly at the initial return to 8.35k as I got skittish and held that 80% fiat all the way through 8.7k and back down to where we are now. Planning on entering 30% between 8k-8.15k and another 30% between 7.8k-8k, with stops on those below 7.75k. If we don't get down to those levels I'll be fully bought back in by the time we get back above 8.65k....Longer term chart that's similar to pretty much everyone elses: https://imgur.com/a/Fcf1pHh  Yellow lines are the current big triangles. We broke out of one but seemed to meet heavy resistance at another line. I realize the beginning of the less steep resistance *seems* less convincing, but at the time of that 13k top 13k was really heavy resistance. Huge parabolic walls on order books in the upper 12ks all over the place. Take that FWIW; just what I anecdotally remember. More important is that support line. I don't really think we ever fall under the steeper downtrend again; however, that yellow support seems to be vital and that falling would be the final straw, imo, for a very long bear market somewhat similar to 2014. The high volume node in the low 8ks-high 7ks is very evident here as well, plus the failure swing + bear div apparently signifying the end of the recent uptrend on the daily RSI.
1	1526279800	4	This is fantastic. Thanks for taking the time to write this up. If we drop below $7.8k, do you think there's any meaningful support near $7.5k? If not, is it because the BGD from 4/12 didn't allow any time to consolidate at that level there?
2	1526280711	3	I would certainly expect some support there, as it was pretty significant resistance earlier and traders will remember that. At least, it'll be more support than 7.4 and maybe 7.6. I'd think if 7.8 falls we'd blow through 7.7, maybe halt a bit at 7.6, then down to test the 7.5s. I don't really think we'd bounce there as in over 9k but could definitely see a retrace to 8k+.If 7.5 falls we'd probably blow through 7.4.My feelings on the specifics of that scenario above are pretty much just that I wouldn't be surprised if it happened. Certainly going to be adaptable to what actually takes place. Definitely think some form of bounce at 7.5 would be likely though, just not a sustained one given the relatively small volume node compared to what we'd have just fallen from.

0	1526276661	12	I just found this posted in the ethtrader sub. https://i.redd.it/3pu9czjlipx01.jpgIt's a schedule of the talks at consensus starting today. Maybe helpful for someone here.I just saw that there is no presenter of bitcoin. Is that normal? Is it an event exclusively for alts? If yes, should we still consider it for our trading behaviour this week? Have a nice trading week everyone.
1	1526277548	5	Why does anyone think this will pump BTC? I see 0 btc events
2	1526277785	1	I don't necessarily think this will pump BTC. Just want to consider the chance, since some hyped alts might drag btc up. Not really sure what to think about that.
1	1526277021	1	This list displays **solely**  the speakers affiliated with a particular token.There are many, many other speakers. (from Bitmex founder Arthur Hayes, to Joe Lubin)
2	1526277212	1	Oh, thank you. Do you have a complete list or overview by any chance? 
3	1526277716	3	A google away.https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/agenda/
4	1526278189	1	Thanks.
0	1526289823	12	My short from 8,670 got stopped out by $1 or $2 at 8,755 overnight. Sucks when you're right about the direction but get your stops wrong by just a few dollars. I was long from 8.3 to 8.7 though, so still a good weekend of trading.I torn about re-opening a short here. There seems to be a return of bullish sentiment, but the graph indicates we are going lower imho. I wouldn't be surprised if we just bart around here for a while now.
1	1526291629	1	Yeah as /u/L14dy mentioned before, this probably isn't the best entry for a short, probably want to wait for the top of the bear flag to open one. If anything a scalp long here is probably a better bet. 
2	1526291704	1	Where would you put the top of the bearflag at?
3	1526292082	1	pretty early to say as we might not fully develop it and already get another leg down. our channel would say about 8.5-8.6k, but I'd say 8.5k makes a better short entry here. 
4	1526294429	1	I would second your analysis from TA perspective but there is very low buying pressure at the moment. Let's see if the est coast moves something in the next hour.
0	1526307258	11	Just a friendly reminder to not do anything rash this week.
0	1526308267	31	Reposting this as a top-level comment because I think it's important. As should be obvious to anybody with eyes, the bitcoin market has no fucking clue what it wants to do right now. And here's my opinion as to why. The market is caught between numerous short-term, medium-term, and long-term trends: and they're all conflicting. The medium-term bear trend was broken a few weeks ago when the market broke the [log resistance line](https://imgur.com/a/t3nTPvp) at $8,500. The longer-term bull trend broke several months ago when the [log channel support](https://imgur.com/a/zFMgN4G) broke down.There's a [short-term bear trend](https://imgur.com/a/qERLiOG) formed from the $9,950 high and the $9,400 bounce that's being tested at the moment. The [short-term bull trend](https://imgur.com/a/vOd1kCu) formed after the big green candle was broken to the downside last week.[This is the only bullish trendline](https://imgur.com/a/VUarUvt) that's still intact, and it's quite a ways down at the moment.So ya, we're in a short-term bear trend and a medium-term bull trend...but the trendline for the medium-term bull trend is more than 20% below current price. It's a shitshow.
1	1526308398	5	So....open 50% long 5x and 50% short 5x and just be patient. Close both in profit over the next 10 days. /sarcasm/sort of
2	1526308571	5	The resistance line from the $9,950 and $9,400 highs is going to catch up to current price relatively soon. It's at around $8,950 at the moment. So unless that breaks, a long from down here is super risky. r/r for a short with stops above $9,000 isn't bad. But the r/r for a long right now isn't so hot.
1	1526313073	2	This is what happens when large market moves are singular and performed by institutions that have huge amounts of money to move, and have trading logic that doesn't line up with TA.
1	1526308484	5	Your TA and reasoning is very much appreciated, very much indeed.
0	1526307026	10	Interesting thay you guys are posting positions, while I’m here getting the system overlod error
1	1526307247	3	Just smash that button. Took me about 25 tries to market open my long, which actually saved me about $40/coin. Thanks Arthur!
1	1526307191	2	I’m on the short bus exchange. Sorry for your troubles though. :(
1	1526308073	1	I somehow got in after 3 tries. Usually takes at least 20
0	1526308933	9	Now this is the BTC I like and enjoy to trade
0	1526319034	10	Bull flag broke down:https://imgur.com/a/oOrprWGCould bart, could find support somewhere between $8,400 and $8,700. Crazy world today.
1	1526319211	3	2018: Opposite Day every dayDo exactly opposite of what TA says to do, make money 
0	1526306219	33	It's official. Trading Bitcoin = Gambling.Anyone who tells me otherwise is lying to themselves.Nothing makes sense anymore. It's just barts up and down, and it's a fucking joke at this point.I'm on the right side of this one though.
1	1526306636	14	Day trading is gambling. Value investing actually has merit.Still holding my first coin from $10
2	1526309700	1	well played. I sold mine im December.
1	1526306293	3	Well played sir!
1	1526306340	2	yeah, on the short them at least. If you use low leverage and no stops  or trade a lot I guess it's still fine.
1	1526306399	2	> Anyone who tells me otherwise is lying to themselves.Right and wrong from my point of view.When you gamble it's either you win or lose. In trading you can cut your loss but yeah I got your point and I'd say it's ok, I was long... :(
2	1526306767	1	You can cut your loss when gambling too. Cutting your loss in trading can also be a mistake.
3	1526306960	1	How? are there some high end fancy gambling places?I was speaking of a stupid bet and a stupid trade.I bet $100 that red team wins / red team lost: I lost $100I "bet" that BTC will go up with my $100 but put a stop loss X% down / BTC goes down and my stop loss is hit.
4	1526307319	1	You can cash out of bets during the event in many bookmakers. You can limit how much you are willing to lose in a casino. You can bet on different things with different risk/reward etc etc.Having tight stops doesn't make trading any less of a gamble. You can get your long/short correct, but place your stops wrong and end up losing on an otherwise profitable trade for example.The only difference is that with gambling, your exact expected ROI can often be calculated, so you at least know the odds. With margin trading, we can't even accurately quantify this when making a trade.
4	1526307729	1	That's just low risk low reward gambling, it doesn't stop it being gambling.
4	1526308084	1	> How? are there some high end fancy gambling places?In poker you can fold instead of continuing to play your hand when the cards draw against you.Also the phrase "cut your losses" is often applied to a gambler stopping playing after entering a losing streak.
5	1526308719	1	Speaking about pure gambling not Poker.Cut your loss yeah but I'm speaking about trading or betting with an amount. Of course you can bet with 1% of your stack; I wasn't implying that at all. I meant to trade with XXX USD or BET with the same amount.
1	1526306500	1	agreed, thats why I don't do margin any moreat least without margin you can avoid getting rekt 
1	1526306538	1	you gamble when you take a premature position. this one gave a perfect opportunity to trade after the breakout.
2	1526306735	2	Yes, but only if you were sitting at the charts right then and there
1	1526307289	1	I agree, every move in BTC seems to be artificial and can happen in any direction without any concern for market conditions. Just look at this, this weekend's forced decline, the weeks of barting, etc.I think we have to complete the A&E and break out over 11.6k before we start to see more predictable trading conditions.
0	1526275055	9	This weekend sucked. After 9,300 wedge broke down, I DCA'd at 9,000 and 8,600 (June futures, entry was 9,475) and decided to cut loss at 8,700 on Friday.I opened a short at 8,738 today (June futures) and plan to ride this until 8,100.BTW, ETH ratio is holding up pretty nicely.
0	1526304442	9	I generally think Consensus is a dud for BTC but some cool announcements come from it, e.g.:https://www.leaprate.com/cryptocurrency/exchange/former-oanda-and-alpari-ceo-daniel-skowronski-launches/If you had any experience with Oanda you will know that the matching engine works great. I know mex is working on it but having competition via a smooth platform for leveraged trading *with a fiat onramp* could be a welcome sight for both retail and institutional players.As [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i8m/daily_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/dyyfsav/) pointed out, institutional funds are already here and institutional platforms are working on products.  The funds do not enter in the way that is popularized. They won't just pour money in and let it rise, they will try strategies to get the entry down to where they want it.What does this all lead to? bigger bets incoming -> higher volatility.   I see both recent lows and highs being hit --- 6k and 10k --- on xbtu18 prior to expiry.
0	1526272869	17	Anybody else think the simplest TA methods are the most effective? Trend lines, Fibonacci retracements, H&S, flags, res/sup level, etc.. The more complex and the more obscure patterns(e.g. Gartley), the less effective it seems because perhaps other people don't view it that way and act on it.Also, imo, Elliott Wave is only good for setting target sell price. That shit never seems to work (look at D4rkEnergy..) and people seem to always tweak the waves to make them fit to the current prices ("Oh, that was wave 4")
1	1526273362	14	Trend lines, resistance/support, flags/triangles/wedges, BBands and RSI are my bread and butter. That's pretty much it. 
1	1526281850	3	Personnaly I think Fib retracements are questionable. Draw 5 lines at random points between two values and you'll likely get some that fall on support/resitance areas.
1	1526274976	5	elliot waves are useless, you can justify literally anything with them. That is the case for most TA but if you really look at things objectively, yes, simpler TA seems to help quite a bit
1	1526276256	1	Or was it wave 5 now

1	1526308918	9	I can't imagine very many people had planned for the last 24 hours of market movement. 
2	1526309780	1	did you close your shorts due to risk management or because you think the r/r for shorts isnt high enough for you to be in a position?
0	1526278244	7	Not sure if this was discussed earlier, but was more than a little surprised at both the number AND size of the total liquidated longs listed over at Bitmexrext over the past 5 hours.   Example of one of the larger liquidations below. https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt/status/995865092129525760
1	1526279757	13	If you want to know what can propel us down, its this right there. Longs going up as price decreases, meanwhile less volume on exchanges = fewer traders who are fighting over 5-10% moves. General public still expecting their owed riches right around the corner. I don't know why people can be so bullish right now - this market cycle still is not near completion.
2	1526280435	6	I don't know how you can be bearish since we are essentially ranging between 6k and 11.7k with a range that's growing tighter and tighter. It's completely normal to see volume and volatility decrease the longer this pattern continues. 
3	1526282493	4	I can agree with that, it could take some more time to fall out of this range. I would be more neutral but I just think the trend is down and am not fighting it. I've seen these cycles play out and I wish I would've listened to the bears in 2014 so I'm being maybe a little too vocal.

0	1526298985	9	the bbands on the 4h are getting pretty tight again, volume is kind off picking up although its still pretty low.There is a bullish divergence on the lower timeframe rsi's but thats about it. My guess is that we go up to test 8700 or 8800 again, if we fail this may be the catalyst to push us down to 7800. A bounce from there would be nice although seeing how previous support acts as resistance i find it tough to believe that we will be revsiting 10k in the next few weeks. Either way it opens some nice positions to pick up cheap alts and scalp some extra btc.
0	1526306249	8	This is quite ridicuous.
0	1526306280	7	Is this what barting is?

0	1526308410	8	Just closed out the other half of my 5x long from 8.4 (opened Friday) at around 8.7. This market is just feeling weird so I'm gonna take profit and sit on my hands for a little while. 
0	1526310518	18	Interesting to note that at about the same time as the spike this morning, the Supreme Court \(in the USA\) announced it would allow states to legalize sports gambling if they wanted to. Many online sportsbooks currently accept bitcoin, and there is definitely a parallel between gambling and cryptocurrencies.  I see this news as actually less beneficial to bitcoin, as legalization should push cash more to the forefront and scale back the usage for crytos in this regard, but interesting to note nonetheless.[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/14/us\-supreme\-court\-rules\-for\-new\-jersey\-in\-states\-fight\-to\-legalize\-sports\-betting.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/14/us-supreme-court-rules-for-new-jersey-in-states-fight-to-legalize-sports-betting.html)
1	1526311378	3	I was just about to post this. A major use case for Bitcoin right now is online sports gambling.If Americans are pushed more to gambling with cash wouldn't this be a negative? Really weird. 
1	1526311393	1	Good observation and this makes a lot of sense to me.  I'd imagine states that wanted to allow sports gambling would follow the model that takes place in Vegas now.Curious if this decision would have any long term ramifications to prediction markets like Augur and digital ID platforms like Civic.  
0	1526301237	12	Price action since 9900 seems like its just been a series of bear flags within larger bear flags.  I see bear flags on literally time frame.  It's not as clean but even the daily time frame looks like a big bear flag with the pole from 10k down to 8200 and some chop between 8200 and 8800.  Don't see how anyone can be bullish with price action like this.
1	1526303167	4	Well, all year long a bear case was argued for in big part due to price being unable to break the log trend line. Price broke above it nearly 4 weeks ago, right now it's still about 20% above that line.Many bottom bears instantly forgot all about that line for some reason.
2	1526305421	1	What worries me is that we never went back to retest the line after the breakout which is something Bitcoin does quite often. The longer we go without testing it (if we do end up testing it) the more painful it's going to be. 
1	1526302561	1	If BTC makes some gains soon, could it be considered a cup & handle? Edit: or was the BRD too heavy?
2	1526302999	2	The cup being at 6.4k? or the cup being at 8.8k on the way up? or the cup being 8.2k on the way down?
3	1526303636	1	Yeah I was referencing the recent 8.2 as the bottom of the cup
2	1526303149	2	I mentioned a possible c&h on longer timeframes earlier. We could go down to maybe 7800ish levels before the handle becomes too deep, I think. Sideways chop around here makes it less likely the longer it goes on though.
0	1526305919	6	Biggest BGD in 2 weeks
1	1526306030	3	That was insane and fast and not followed up on many exchanges

1	1526306174	2	What is a BGD?
2	1526306244	1	Big green dildo.
1	1526306197	2	Bigger than last night's BRD with half the volume. Not a good idea to short right now.
2	1526306506	1	I mean if they want to get caught in the impending short squeeze, then it would be a good idea. 
1	1526306290	2	If that isn't some serious surprise buttsecks to all the shorters, I don't know what is.

0	1526306977	5	!short XBTUSD 9400 10X 100%I already opened and closed this position, but i wanted to update the bot to make sure there's not a gap in my trading history.edit: That's going to be a hard one to fix. /u/justanotherlogin I'm going to close it at breakeven in a moment. Could you remove it from the DB?
1	1526307174	1	I think you're off by $1000
1	1526307190	1	You can now send the command by PM to [/u/position_bot](/u/position_bot) instead to update old trades.I didn't close when you closed yesterday and was relieved when it droped, now i have no idea whatsoever what to do... Should i wait till another high (8755) or just cut my losses and escape all this madness?
1	1526307193	1	!short XBTUSD close 9400
2	1526307223	1	You mean 8400? haha
2	1526307309	1	The bot is ignoring this command because it already has one in the top comment. Send the command by PM.
3	1526307343	1	I just did.I'll stick to PMing the bot.
4	1526307422	1	I'll delete the 9400 one that was a mistake
5	1526307502	1	High five. I'll get it eventually!For me it's the order of operations that throws me. Eventually it'll become second nature.
6	1526307816	1	No problem.If you had your position from yesterday still open, would you close it now like you did yesterday?
7	1526308328	1	No actually. I'd close if this line breaks to the upside:https://imgur.com/a/qERLiOG
8	1526308701	1	Thanks. This is just messed up.
9	1526308833	1	Just think of what a shitshow it'll be if this reverses course again off that resistance line. I'm fine with this candle if it keeps going. But if we see a 100% retrace, I'm going to be completely spun around as to what comes next. 
1	1526307333	1	Hey Chew, did you get out just in time before the BGD? The chart looks pretty stupid, but these things usually start a rally. Where do you think we are going from here?
2	1526307454	4	no clue, this is all very strange. But ya, Bitmex's hamster-powered servers saved me instead of fucking me for a change. Market-orders that close an open position take priority over everything else. So while spot was at $8,600 June futures were stuck in the mid $8,400s. I exited at around $8,481 for a small loss.
3	1526307777	1	I've been getting rekt the last few days, but over all lost about 2% of my stack. I respect that you don't call out manipulations etc, but you gotta wonder if we have any influence at all considering the low volume and order book. I may have to sit out for a week or 2 and evaluate my life choices while spending my stack on hookers and coke.
0	1526307660	7	this market is ABSURD, are you kidding me? jesus how can you play with my emotions like that
1	1526308110	7	You are giving it to much credit when you call it a market.

I estimate that had 400 miners running but they are just moving in and look ready to scale at least 20x of what they had running. First time seeing a mining farm of that scale. Anyways to keep this post related to trading, i am still out in fiat and will only re enter once 10k is broken. Still bearish on medium timeframes

The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.**Accuracy of model and recent bearishness** Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it is within *the same order of magnitude* of the price. That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.
0	1526278877	9	Bear flag forming. I think this will go down and test 8200 again. 
1	1526279825	8	Lower. 7.5-8k range. Been in sights since friday
2	1526291490	1	Oh yeah? I sold 8200 two days ago and that was the bottom, it pumped to 8600 as soon as I sold and I had to buy again.
3	1526295882	1	Watch it drop past 8200. I sold at 9200 friday. Im waiting for the bottom.

0	1526313747	8	I'm relatively new as a trader, and have really enjoyed following this sub for the last few weeks. Among the lessons learned so far, the hardest one was to not sell too soon when a trade move is confirmed. I've made the same mistake twice now. When things turn out right it's equally important to keep your cool as when they go pear shaped. 
1	1526313991	2	Patience is seriously one of the top virtues for trading, especially with bitcoin. 
1	1526314247	4	> Patience is seriously one of the top virtues for tradingAs said below, it is one of the most important skill required. Do not worry to much, you will develop it with time, just spend more time in this sub.I also developed greater levels of patience since joining this sub.
0	1526313965	17	Great time to remind the noobies that alot of people in this space succeed in trading less rather than more. I have my long from 6.6 still open. I said I'd close it at 10 and should've but I was away on vacation and I have a strict zero trading policy when with my significant other. I'll look to close it at 10 soon and open another long at 12. I generally hate shorting, but depending on the resistance at 11.7 I may open one, just haven't decided on a target to close it if I do. Best of luck fellas. And to the moon! 
1	1526314090	7	Sell when RSI is above 70 on all time frames greater than 5m, buy when RSI is below 20-30 on all time frames greater than 5m. Never sell at a loss is a pretty good strategy in this 8-10k range if you ask meIf you just hold a long from 6.6k, I would consider that investing not trading

0	1526282350	18	I feel pretty bad for chewy for closing his short at 8700\+Not because of the money, I'm aware it's peanuts in the grand scheme. But I know how much that hurts. Happened to me yesterday when I closed my long from 8250 at 8350 and watched it pump. Felt pretty damn stupid thinking "Why in gods name would you close right before Conensus"?Was debating all day yesterday to short and thought that if we make it to 8700\+, it's a bad idea. Well, it would have been an excellent idea. Going to take a break from trading with this chop. It's brutal. We're just barting around like no tomorrow.
1	1526283190	5	Before I went to sleep, just after it pumped to 8700 and chewy closed his short I said I'm gonna regret not closing my long there.Well, now I'm underwater on my long...
2	1526283492	1	You did indeed. Why didn't you put a stop actually?
3	1526283910	3	Like where could I do that? We just bounced off support line I drew. It's around 8.3 now.This is my second try on long term entry since we pumped through 7k range. I close it when this breaks down and gonna go back to scalping then.But yeah, it's third time I thought that going with hedge shorting my position wouldn't be bad idea and it's the third time I didn't do it.
1	1526283410	4	I've also been dicking around in the market making retarded trades. It's damn hard to read atm and entry/exit have to be really timely and tight to make a profit. We choppin' too hard for me, I'll just wait for either direction or buy some aggresive dips. 
1	1526282772	3	I also closed a short at 8655, shorted again at 8710 though so it ended up working out. The one time a revenge trade actually worked. I might be addicted to shorting...

1	1526297362	2	I closed my full stack 25x short at 8700 yesterday at the top. Got psyched out by past bgd's. Lesson learned: becareful if there's an instinct to trade 100% of stack on a big move. Dildos are designed to fuck two things, your wallet, and your mind. The latter is always worth more than the former. Didn't have the balls to stomach any more moves up but shouldn't have closed all of it so quickly. That said I'm scaling into a long here for a scalp trade. 
2	1526298155	2	agreed, good move
1	1526283017	1	sorry to be offtopic but what does "chop" mean?
2	1526283098	3	it means to meander sideways/up and down listlessly with no meaningful direction to the market
3	1526283272	5	thank you broo
2	1526283201	2	as in rough up and down movement, think rough seas.
0	1526311636	17	Oh yes Oh yes! Somebody give me a bro fist.Humor aside, when I posted [this prediction](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i8m/daily_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/dyyajqz/) a few hours ago, it clearly failed to entertain some of the redditors of this sub, I learnt my lesson!My predictions were based on the current price movements, which largely resembles to that of the period between 7th - 12th Apr and other factors, however, lets not get into the details. It is history now.All the best to everyone, I do not think I will be making anymore predictions here, apart from taking part in the daily discussions by providing my input wherever I can and by seeking advises when I need them. But in no way I am going to post any of my observations/predictions moving forward. :)The only thing I want to say to fellow traders is that be a leader, not a follower, be a learner, not a knower. It doesn't take a hawk's eye to see price patterns, with enough attention, anyone of us can spot them and make winning trades with the right actions. I spotted the price patterns, decided to double up my stack and I am happy with my decision.Those who lost part of their stacks, I pray they make double the amount they lost as soon as possible, and those who won, keep it up, you are doing a great job!As for my long from $8,402, I am riding it not planning to close in near future. Cheers!
1	1526312548	9	With the price at these sub 9k levels anything is likely just a good long entry.8 days ago when we were at 9900 many folks would have killed for 8800 long entries.Now people are shorting 8800 but longed 9900....Brilliant minds huh? Just take a moment to absorb what BTC is.... Look at the funds paying attention to it. Don't people understand that any price dips will simply be bought up and put into cold storage? Are the timeframes here really THAT short-term?Short-term bearish and long term bullish is just such a ridiculous way to think. Shorting bitcoin is honestly one of the riskiest ways to make money. Not that it won't work and I'm sure many folks do well by it but it just isn't a risk I want to take for a rare commodity.
2	1526313401	2	I wish I could upvote this a few more times. It breaks my heart to see people on this sub throwing their money away when "buy the dip and never sell" is soooo easy. It's the best chance normal people have had in all of human history to break free from serfdom, and you just see people pissing it away.That said, I trade a bit, and I've been doing pretty well at it recently only longing with small leverage and never shorting.
1	1526311781	10	Prepare for the downvotes. Permabears are angry right now.
2	1526313499	3	I could care less about their downvotes as long as they're giving me their money.
2	1526311894	2	I actually wished all the best to all traders, I don't know who are permabears or permabulls, but I guess we are all here to make some extra bucks!
3	1526312125	2	Agreed, I love for people to share their perspectives, as it makes it easier to understand the market. I hope both groups can make money both ways. People seem more inclined to upvote/downvote whatever opinions they agree with on here these days though.
4	1526312512	2	What I would love to see people adapting to price movements and changing their so called groups based upon the movements to make money, which I think is necessary in day-to-day winning trades. I do the same, sometimes I short, sometimes I long. I used to have a flair, sometimes bearish sometimes bullish, I removed it because of the above reason.
1	1526314839	2	Yeah the tribalism has gotten somewhat bad here and I feel like it's pushed away some decent traders. I and a few others left a previous trading sub only to find ourselves heading back due to the very reason I just mentioned. Still some pretty good people here though.
0	1526311032	8	Seeing a lot bullish news pop up... ~~ETH not a security~~ (source needed), CME launching a price reference rate for ETH (no futures yet though), Goldman Sachs launching futures for BTC. Florida accepting BTC for taxes lol, the FED dude being rather positive. The dump earlier today and the pump feel a bit manipulated so I'm staying out of position for now. Closed my entire short from 9800. 
1	1526311844	2	eth not a security confirmed?
0	1526301795	13	I'm not sure if I'm even bullish in the medium long-term (next 2 years or so) any more, and It has nothing to do with the price action. I'd like to see adoption increasing rather than just the number of traders/speculators. All bullish news has been about new trading desks opening up etc, while the bearish news has been things like vendors ceasing to accept BTC as payment, increased difficulty in anonymously acquiring BTC etc. The best bullish news we've had is LN, which is clunky as hell and makes BTC even less noob-friendly imho.I'm starting to think adoption is much further away than many people think, and that we will make much lower lows (sub 6k) before that happens. 
1	1526302156	7	Eth had some good news yesterday regarding some startup making a system for retailers to be able to accept Eth,https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/13/startup-enables-users-pay-ethereum-11-million-locations-like-cash/Though not directly good for BTC, any crypto adoption decreases barriers for others in the spectrum. I'm torn, as I agree with you that adoption has barely changed, though I do think public awareness and the ecosystem around it has grown. However, I don't know if any of these things necessarily have to translate into an increase in price. There's no real catalyst to "hoard" BTC in my opinion. It has a very good ad-hoc use case, int'l transactions etc, but is it enough to validate a 10k pricetag?
1	1526302093	4	LN, Mimble Wimble, Bullet Proofs, Cross Chain Swaps, Schnorr Sigs
2	1526303778	1	Megaupload 2.0
1	1526302392	10	I will probably get downvoted for saying this but you are wrong. Adoption is gaining traction, just not for Bitcoin. Projects like iota, ven, icx, neo are getting partnerships left and right and are developing actual products with incredible value. Btc will sadly most likely only serve as a store of value and a house name to crypto, which means its value will derive from investors and speculators and that is not bad, it jusy  
2	1526303478	2	If crypto is hundreds of use cases it will never take off. The world has never worked this way. People aren’t going to have many different coins for different things nor will they keep BTC to trade/turn into these when needed. Adoption is so far Away. Agree on BTC price being tied to investors but I think we may never be in a word where the price of BTC has anything to do with adoption or use. 
3	1526304699	3	That is only true if you assume every crypto is meant to be a currency. The term *cryptocurrency* is pretty misleading because many alts use a blockchain for different [uses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#Uses) than transferring or storing value. To make an example from the ones mentioned by /u/NikGrd:* IOTA (MIOTA): IOTA is aiming to be the backbone of the emerging machine-to-machine (m2m) economy of the Internet-of-Things (IoT).* VeChain (VEN): VeChain aims to connect blockchain technology to the real world by providing infrastructure for supply chain management and other things.* Icon (ICX): ICON aims to build a decentralised network that allows independent blockchains with different governances to transact with one another without intermediaries.* NEO (NEO): NEO wants to automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts and become the backbone of a 'smart-economy'I'm not here to defend any of these four projects and I think many of these applications could be build on top of Bitcoin rather than compete with it. But there is definitely a scenario in which crypto with hundreds of use cases takes off.
2	1526304010	2	You are wrong. I work in this space and everyone is so clueless about how to develop meaningful software that they spend most of the time blabbering about gibberish they don’t understand while BTC devs do the real work.Look at iota’s github. it’s a joke. Go look at githubs like Docker, Kubernetes, Tensorflow if you want to know what production grade distributed systems are supposed to be documented, commented and maintained like.Iota, Ven and all the other crap has horrible documentation with terrible code that is “functional” at bet.Just because pornhun added ven and bosch claims to working with iota does not make them in any way shape or form meaningful. Especially when you know that the people in those companies are largely managment and marketing people.If any one of the technologies behind iota or the like were truly insightful, don’t you think Google would be all over it? They’re a massive software company with hardcore specialty in distributed systems.Yeah... Just because you read it on the crypto news channels does not mean shit
3	1526305038	1	i think you have your cryptos a bit mixed up...ven and pornhub?
4	1526305257	2	oh yeah, that was verge, right?
5	1526305408	1	ah yes ofc, Verge has done that..Well the confusion is understandable =P
3	1526305107	1	The fact that their execution sucks does not mean that the presented use cases are not valid. If IOTA was functional it would actually solve some problems in a project I'm working on in the energy sector. As of now it's all speculation though.
4	1526305245	2	Wouldnt rabbitMQ probably do just fine? Why would you need a tangle?
5	1526307305	1	Yeah, everything we need can be (and has been) accomplished with a combination of existing protocols. However, IOTA promises to be able to offer a simpler solution in which I can see value. I'm not defending IOTA here, since they haven't delivered anything. But IF they deliver I can see it being used in my industry.
6	1526307715	2	Completely agree!
1	1526304793	1	Agreed. We need more users making more transactions and putting a greater share of their wealth into BTC rather than cash or gold or even equities. For that, we need more payment services supporting it, vendors accepting it, clearer laws and regulation, more accountants and tax lawyers who understand it, more brokers making it available as an option, etc. I don't have a reason to think the price will go down, but neither do I see a reason for a surge in demand in the near term. It wouldn't be surprising if it stays range\-bound for months while the speculators drift to altcoins, where there is lots of froth and potential for uptake of some tokens/coins that require less comprehensive infrastructure than BTC.
2	1526311166	1	Agree, but that's not going to happen with 1M blocks.
0	1526308253	11	Going to have a good laugh if we are back at 8400 in a couple hours
1	1526308731	2	I respectfully doubt it sir. most BGD props the price up or jump start an uptrend it seems.
2	1526309104	3	If you can't predict a BGD, you also can't predict when a BRD will happen. Anything is possible here.
2	1526309022	2	I've noticed that too. It makes it quite tempting to buy now or on the next modest pullback.
3	1526310088	1	That's what they want you to think.
2	1526309421	2	Nothing changed if it can't go above 8800. 
2	1526315861	2	did you forget every single bart on the way down to $6.5k?
0	1526298647	7	Going all in today. I might be wrong, but to me the bear pennant seems less relevant seeing as we just went up just hours before we turned down.  Expecting a modest bounce to 8600, but if it fails to materialize will pull out by later today. Edit: I've checked the charts, and we are not in oversold nor overbought territory as far as I can see. I agree with the view that we are going down eventually, but from what I see right now, there's room for revisiting the 8600 region today. Stops at 8330.!long 8400 1x 80%
1	1526300262	4	I feel like too many people are expecting it to happen right now and almost everyone thinks that “all the other traders are bearish right now, so I’ll go against the crowd”. EDIT: I might be wrong, but for me it’s a no-no to go long 
1	1526301169	2	I'm usually bullish but this seems a bit ambitious. Neither the daily nor the weekly inspires much confidence at the moment. However, it's not impossible that we crawl up to 8500 and that might be a good short entry. 
0	1526309137	6	Lift on sports gambling is HUGE 
1	1526310042	2	Good point.  I hadn't made that connection.

0	1526279213	9	Rumors that a small /medium Japanese exchange goes belly under because they mishandled the BCH fork.Basically they would have credited extra BCH that some customers sold and quickly withdrew from the platform...Forks are a nightmare for exchanges 
1	1526280047	6	Any idea what exchange it might be? Would be good to know the scale of the issue. 
2	1526282947	1	Zaif 
3	1526283169	1	Cheers, thanks!
1	1526281859	5	Which fork? It's scheduled for tomorrow and it's non-contentious (no new coin)
2	1526283868	4	I think he means the one from August last year.
3	1526288360	2	Wow, I would have thought 9 months is enough time to split their BTC holdings in a correct manner
1	1526280012	3	I feel like the easy answer to this is to impose an escrow, confirm proper funds via audit then release 5-10 business days after the fork? If there are coins improperly allocated, then simply reallocate them.
2	1526280053	3	They have a serious fuck up. It’s about damage control now
0	1526306627	8	for ultimate pain, this thing will spike up to $8800 to squeeze the shorts first and will then plummet to $6,000 to squeeze the longs
1	1526306900	1	Right. And I see "reversal" in comments . . how many "reversals" have we had in last week? . . lol 
0	1526273021	10	5/14/18 UPDATE. Things have been crazy at the office, so I’m a little more removed from the markets than I’d like to be. I don’t have a forecast on where we are going, but I promise I will put one together within the next 48 hours. My last update was technically on [5/10/18]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ic411/daily_discussion_thursday_may_10_2018/dyrd7oa/), but the last real update I did was on [4/25/18]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/dxyoabr/). In the meantime, I’ve cleaned up some of my charts and have a thought where we might be heading in the ultra-short term…Here are the charts:     Here’s the [macro view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hbx7RMrb/).     Here’s the [new channel](https://www.tradingview.com/x/3RqYyD54/).     Here’s the [super zoomed in view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/V5enyKGK/).     I believe we’re in a small downward channel, which is indicated in black on the charts. Possible sources of resistance are the pink and gold lines within the channel. The pink line is drawn from the ATH to the peak where we blew off the top on 4/25. Further, the gold line is drawn from a top on 4/30, 5/3 and 5/13 20:00:00 UTC. Per the chart, I will be buying in the $8,060-$7,975 range and offloading towards the top of the second bounce up (if it appears). Further, if we decisively blast through the black resistance along with the pink and gold lines — that would be very bullish.
1	1526274425	6	So I now realize you called it a channel in your post, but I'm still posting this here for anyone that just looks at your chart without reading and thinks you have a descending wedge drawn since I spent a little while typing it up...It's important to clarify the black channel isn't really a good wedge. A wedge is more valid the more "filled in" it is, and that one is hardly that. It touched bottom, then rode the top for a long time before quickly retouching the bottom, leaving a lot of empty space. I mean, if you pick and choose points that loosely for a wedge, you can make almost anything into one: https://imgur.com/a/la1oiW0Not saying that image is a valid wedge, just pointing out that picking highs/lows for a wedge is slightly more complex than picking random highs/lows. Additionally, the volume trend within the wedge would be opposite what you'd expect - normally volume contracts as the wedge develops; in the picture (MidnightOcean's) it very much is expanding.
2	1526275162	2	You are 100% correct. Great catch. I actually modified the charts to extend from a channel to a wedge, but forgot to update the language. To clarify, this is my attempted prediction of where we might be going in the next ~10-12 days, but again, this is not very well filled in and Bitcoin's volatility makes it wildly improbable that it will be this range bound. That being said, while volume is growing, I am seeing support for this thesis with some of the MACD and Stoch RSI indicators that I use. Here's the [super zoomed in view with volume](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZQRAWxMr/).

0	1526301143	3	eth and btc both back into the bear flag positions. The only change is that eth and btc are now out of sync, with eth at the top of the rung, and btc at the bottom. They aren't likely to drop at different times, so one of the two is going to be changing the pattern today, likely just a shift to the right with a wider ladder.https://www.tradingview.com/x/bGQmp1Zc/
1	1526301195	2	I don't know, the flags are almost too perfect. I'm getting suspicious. 
2	1526301236	3	agreed
2	1526301355	2	Did you take a look at our rise out from the bottom? It's basically the same thing.  I thought the rise looked manufactured. Normally you don't see it trading this robotically and methodically. btc https://www.tradingview.com/x/FXgzny7S/eth https://www.tradingview.com/x/2EUHiZHt/
3	1526301482	1	True, but in a way BTC movements always seem manufactured. in this case though I'm wary for a fakeout breakdown. 
4	1526301593	2	Using that logic, you could say it was a fakeout bull run then a fakeout bear.
5	1526301758	2	Haha, fair. Needless to say, I'm a confused individual. I'm keeping a close eye on ETH if it falls out, though I expect it to try the resistance again in the next couple of hours. I don't know, a breakdown here almost seems too obvious, but the whole contrarian thing is paradoxical either way. 
0	1526303191	3	How does one quantify the distance between top and bottom B bands? What is that difference called? My arms are getting tired of holding a ruler up to my computer screen. 
1	1526303296	7	I use a bit of dental floss to measure, which I then measure with a ruler on my desk. It's less of a strain on the arms, plus makes the screen smell minty fresh.
1	1526303489	5	There is an indicator on tradingview called "bollinger band width".I've never used it, but this may be what you are looking for.
2	1526303649	1	This is actually good I always subtracted the two values. Guess good for math practice...but this is way nicer. 
3	1526304016	1	Which two values? I use bitcoinwisdom. 
4	1526304061	1	Oh you can see the upper and lower band value in tradingview Bbands. idk in btcwisdom.. 
0	1526303804	3	30m Bbands tight and 4h Bbands tight, we might make a move in the next couple of hours.

0	1526308050	3	Out of my short from last night. Got extremely lucky that June futures lagged that spike, and mashed market close at 8480ish and got out at 8495 when swaps were pushing 8600 [as mentioned here](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i8m/daily_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/dyyj5f7/).I'm not touching this for a little bit. This is madness. !short xbtusd close 8495
1	1526308412	2	Lucky, i didn't place any stops yesterday to avoid messing up and got screwed again. Getting sick of these moves and might go for broke until liquidation... That should be around 10k2.Was relieved by not having closed yesterday and now i'm twice as mad because i could have escaped a 2nd time in profit instead of eating a big loss...

0	1526307636	5	Wasn't it the Wykoff distro that showed we'd go up to this point before going further down? paging u/sloppysynapses ?
1	1526308982	2	Yes, Wyckoff distro shows we would re-test the $8800-$8900 support-turned-resistance, potentially even a couple times before dropping further. With the consensus event ongoing, it’s hard to enter any trade on leverage though. Normies could still FOMO in and push this past resistance, causing all bets to be off at that point.However, if we fail to push past resistance here over the next couple days, I personally expect a large dump incoming. We would likely run out of buyers after consensus (and the BCH fork), and the buyers during this period may get dumped on. Again, this part is just my opinion though.
0	1526309351	5	100-day MA + log-downtrend right above us, let's see how this will go. I really have not the slightest clue. I have lost all sense of direction from the recent movements.https://www.tradingview.com/x/QjpEHuGJ/Zoom-in:https://www.tradingview.com/x/vjP8Cm1c/
0	1526313153	6	This latest development with sports betting becoming legalized in the US is something that is tangibly bullish for the long term:>The Supreme Court cleared the way on Monday for states to legalize sports betting, striking down a 1992 federal law that had prohibited most states from authorizing sports betting. The 6-3 ruling is a victory for New Jersey and other states who have considered allowing sports gambling as a way to encourage tourism and tax revenue. The betting industry in general is well positioned to be disrupted by crypto from different perspectives, both in terms of the platforms used (for example cryptographic betting platforms that ensure transparency and public tracability of internal odds) and also as a payment method to avoid oversight and increase speed/security. Gambling also seems to be a natural fit for crypto ownership, hell most of us here are really engaging in educated gambling by trying to predict market movements. There was a point where half the transactions on the bitcoin network in the early stage were being used to transmit bets to SatoshiDice, one of the earliest bitcoin betting sites.What I would really love to find is some indication of what percentage of online sports betting is done in Bitcoin currently. I've searched to find a source and can't find anything substantial, unsurprising since its so new. What would your guess be for the total % of bets placed being in Bitcoin for sports bookies?

0	1526311052	7	This may be dumb, but I had a 25% stack increase on my short last night and this looks like a bart, not a bull flag. !short XBTUSD 8750 10X 25%edit: entry was at 8810 on June futures. Stops up a couple percent.edit 2: Wanted to post it in case it moved quickly and I looked like a hindsight trader. I'm basically just playing with the profits from my short last night, and I'm willing to take a small hit on them considering I was gifted a much better exit than I should have been. I would not be surprised by a huge movement in either direction here, but *traditionally* these huge 15m candles retrace slightly if not significantly. BTC loves maximum pain and a test of 8500-8600 seem plausible. edit 3: Closed at 8800 (8860 on June futures). No thank you BTC.
1	1526311677	2	Shit, I was just thinking the same thing. We're exactly at the same spot we were yesterday. The real BGD was 1K, this is not that. Stops in between the 0.5 fib line and downtrend line from 9900, so around 8950ish.!short xbtusd 8748 10X 40%
1	1526311357	1	Stops above 8925-8950 puts it above my possible patterns so i think its a good area for a stop.Just need to lose my stubbornness and think about doing the same.Good luck!

3	1526311792	2	With this BGD actually FOMO'ing @9000 with full stack should be a good trade if very tight stops are used.When these small rallies start most likely they will have another legs up and entering soon might be good.
1	1526311406	1	With you in this. Don't want to spam the thread, but I flipped short at 8750, then added a bit at 8775 (order only partially filled). Looking to close at ~8650 or 8675. Minor scalp.Edit: I'll pm the bot for this one. I do plan on being long again very soon, in case anybody is following along.
0	1526312816	7	With the massive amount of resistance above us at $8,800, this would potentially be an attractive place to make a big buy. Think about it, slippage is your worst enemy so you'd want to pick a place where you can expect a lot of sell pressure. I do not know what the price will do from here, but thought this was worth mentioning.edit: interesting...

0	1526306739	3	To my earlier post, consider for a moment that when we do have real volume which direction does BTC move? This is by no means meant as a "victory lap" - I am not anywhere that naive - rather a point of reference for consideration. Nothing more. 
1	1526307200	3	Additionally, consider for a moment that if you wanted to make a big buy without causing too much slippage, you might consider buying at what seems to be a precarious place like $8,350 where sell pressure as the price increases (8,500, 8,600, 8,700) is all but guaranteed. A buyer's ability to anticipate the amount of sell pressure as a result of their big buy (and hence, anticipate what the average buy price will be) is worth a lot of money, if that makes sense.

1	1526308269	5	Everyone seems to be $1K off this morning. 
0	1526310026	2	I'm playing around with trying to apply some Wyckoff logic to what's happening at the moment. It looks like some serious accumulation is happening by some big player(s)...Would it make sense that 9.4 down to ~8.6k was the mark-down phase from distribution to accumulation again? Or perhaps we're in re-distribution right now, to be followed by another leg down for accumulation again?Something like this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/frcJp7x1/Paging /u/SloppySynapses :)
1	1526310206	4	Here's what I posted yesterday morning:If you believe we are still in a distribution phase, or believe that $7.8k is right around the corner, then shorting/moving to fiat makes sense to me.However, to consider the alternative, if we are in an accumulation/reaccumulation phase, the sells/shorts are being used by accumulators to reduce slippage for their buys. (Price won’t rise as high, which is what you want if you're accumulating) I’ve been looking over the BFX data, and for transactions over 1 BTC, I see mostly buys (usually clusters totaling to 20-50 BTC) while for smaller transactions I see mostly sells. Perhaps this is indicative of retail investors selling while bigger players make sneaky buys. Or, maybe it’s just a coincidence and we are indeed headed much lower.Just what I’m seeing, and full disclosure I’m in a long.Edit: also, go call your mothers you filthy animalshttps://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j1gi0/daily_discussion_sunday_may_13_2018/dywq4z3/
2	1526310466	1	Nice! I missed your post yesterday. I think I agree, it very much looks like accumulation right now.
2	1526310663	1	How could a cluster buy that amounts 20-50 BTC could be considered as a sneaky buy?
3	1526310965	3	well, if you're watching the data in real time then it wasn't very sneaky, but if you're watching the market in general it didn't end up moving the market that much because of all of the sell pressure, hence sneaky. you're right though, sneaky probably isn't the best descriptor. 
1	1526310388	3	But I must say, the current patterns look an awful lot like accumulation with "forced liquidity moves" like fake-outs and fake-flags. That's exactly what someone would do to "create liquidity" when buying very large amounts.
2	1526310793	3	This is what I believe it happening. Also, read this if you missed it:https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i8m/daily_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/dyyfsav/
1	1526310498	1	I’m still cautiously in the distribution boat. However, the re-test of support-turned-resistance is generally a low volume rally that dies out before dumping further. This BGD makes things a bit confusing at the moment, so it’s hard to say until we see what happens right here at resistance. If we get rejected here, we will likely dump hard. However, if this continues to push up, its hard to say what will happen moving forward.

0	1526272319	4	Bitcoin faced major resistance last week around $9600, and like mentioned in my previous report, we are retesting the 8k zone.When we look at the indicators on the 4hr candle chart we can see that the bullish momentum is building up in the market again, however there is a ton of resistance above $8600 – $8800. The bulls have a lot of work to do to get us through this ceiling, but with the right price action it sure is possible on the shorter term.I can see quite a bit of bearish talk on the candlestick patterns, as well as a possibility that a new longer term bearish trend has emerged. If this is the case I would expect the support level around $8000, short term, to get tested again, and $7100 could be on the cards should the above mentioned fail.Best case scenario here in my opinion would be some sideways trading for the Bitcoin USD pair, between $8000 and $8800. This will be quite a healthy correction in my opinion and necessary if we expect a break above $9600 to test the illusive 10k barrier.Please remember this is crypto and anything can happen, be prepared, bulls and bears will battle it out this week.

2	1526273478	1	I concur, bottom is looking to be 7200 - 7400 from the 5800, and 6300 bottoms we've had prior. 
3	1526273843	1	Could you clarify where 5800 and 6300 are? You mean 5400 on Nov, 2017 and 6000 on Feb, 2018?

2	1526273710	1	I normally take the pole from the top of the flag as we're heading in the "thicker" support. This is more a personal preference because markets don't fully correct normally. From the breakdown point I get around 7.3k which would coincide with the log downtrend from ATH + the 0.786 retrace at 7.25k. This is probably the area in which to look for a reversal.

0	1526296112	3	I'm surprised how static the price seems. Had a slight surge yesterday which quickly came back to the pre surge level. And here we are again.If you do think we would go lower, who exactly would be selling at these levels? People who bought in run from 8000ish to 9900ish? Perhaps if we hit 7500ish these individuals would be looking to exit, but any further and we are back to the lowest dip level.Anyway that's just my thinking. I was long from 8630, scaled into a larger position at 8430, 8550 and then sold on the surge at 8720. And now I'm long again from 8390.
