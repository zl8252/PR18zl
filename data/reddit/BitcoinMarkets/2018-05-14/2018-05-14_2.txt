0	1526302643	3	Unfortunately received the same email this morning. What a shame, I actually found ABUCoins to be one of the more user\-friendly exchange sites. R.I.P.
0	1526299083	1	Yes same email I got.
1	1526306743	5	I'm sorry to hear that Yoda 
0	1526305487	1	Got my Sia from here. Second exchange I registered to. Sad :(
1	1526313540	1	Same and same. Do you know of any good alternative sites to trade Siacoin on?  For those of us in the U.S.
2	1526317327	1	Poloniex appears to have their act together now that they've been bought out.  At the very least, all of my pending deposits from when they were having SC wallet issues have cleared at this point.
0	1526310428	1	That's too bad.  Despite the pitiful volume, this was a good exchange.  They had a very easy-to-use and well-documented API compared to some of the larger exchanges.
0	1526317663	1	 Very good exchanger, I heard that good of this platform and I was planning to register ... no luck
