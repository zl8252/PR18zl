Submission title: What are some good ways to make passive income using cryptocurrencies? I don't get any interest on my coins in cold storage or in Coinbase vault, which is a shame. Is lending worth it? If so, on what exchanges? Any other tips/recommendations to make income with little risk?

1	1526233495	4	A "dividend generating" currency does not actually generate passive income. The dividend is paid by diluting your shares. You're being paid income out of your own pocket.It can be argued that this is better than with bitcoin, where the diluted shares are paid to miners instead, but that's not the point.

You're being paid income out of your own pocket.This is also how equity dividends work. Your share value is reduced by the equivalent dividend payment. Dividends are still commonly referred to as passive income as you are not actively working for it. 
3	1526290908	1	Equity dividends are from revenue in a traditional income producing company. Tokens paying dividends are like a company borrowing money to pay the dividend or paying you in stock \(equity\) instead of "income". If you get paid in stock, you are being diluted.
1	1526232213	-4	Preferably without having to convert my major cryptos (ltc, btc, and eth) to some obscure coin or a coin used on shady exchanges. 
2	1526232323	5	I don’t think you know what you’re talking about. Both NEO and Ark are reputable and both trade on binance which isn’t a “shady” exchange at all lol. Do some research before you post a stupid question like this. Furthermore, both coins aren’t obscure. I would even argue NEO and ARK are better than LTC and comparable with BTC and ETH. 
3	1526232672	-14	Never heard of either of them, so they are obscure to me. I don't trust any of these new (any coin which is less then 2 years old and is unknown to me) coins with their mostly useless use-cases/features. I have been in crypto for 5 years, so yeah, I can make these claims.> I would even argue NEO and ARK are better than LTC and comparable with BTC and ETH.Ah, and I am the one who doesn't know what he is talking about? You claim 2 obscure, shady, probably scam coins to be better than LTC, but comparable to BTC, even though LTC is better than Bitcoin in literally all aspects? You know LTC is basically an improved version of BTC, right? Also, reported for not being excellent:>  Do some research before you post a stupid question like this.
4	1526232822	7	You’re clearly oblivious to anything crypto if you think the 3 coins on GDAX are the best coins. NEO was also created back in 2014 so  it’s not “new.” NEOs smart contract system is also the same as Ethereum’s so it’s not really “useless” 
5	1526233107	-6	Nice gimmicks and features nobody will really use. These coins won't survive in the long-run. Created back in 2014 is still quite young. LTC and BTC have stood the test of time like no other cryptocurrency. So no, NEO is nowhere close to being as dominant and useful as LTC.
6	1526238320	3	You know shit about crypto.
6	1526255413	2	LTC? Lmao that shit is dead 
6	1526269616	0	Don't let them shit on you dude, your skepticism will pay off. Every fucko and their mom thinks their portfolio is full of game changers. Stick to the tried and true, don't buy the hype as easily as these guys, don't forget most projects fail, you wouldn't know it from the people here, but you've got the right idea.If you want to make some extra on your coins, consider being a market maker. Essentially, you'd place a limit buy order and limit sell order simultaneously at the spread prices (bid and ask prices), thus providing liquidity to an exchange, and in return earn a profit. This *can* go wrong in a big swing, so you'd want a contingency (if a sell order goes through but the buy order does not within x minutes, close the buy order and open it back up higher, or if a buy order goes through but the sell doesn't, close the buy order and open it back up lower). Do a little math on the spread at an exchange and see if it is worthwhile.I believe some exchanges also allow you to provide liquidity for shorts, essentially loaning people coins for a flat rate of return. If you're hodling long term, this can be worthwhile. 
7	1526287758	1	Thanks for your reply and seriousness... you seem to be one of few not promoting some obscure altcoin in this thread. Will check your recommendations out.
0	1526233030	3	COSS and KCS are exchange tokens that pay fee splits to token holders. A bit higher risk, as they depend on the success of the exchanges, but returns could be huge.DICE provides dividends from the profits of it's dice game to token holders. FLIP (Etherflip) will pay dividends as well, but is pretty early stage of development. Seems like a good team.E4ROW pays dividends from it's poker game, but slow development due to a lack of initial funds.DNT may allow holders staked in a district to receive a revenue share from that district (SPANK's red light district for example).QTUM is another proof of stake coin with potential. You have to run the wallet to stake, but can be done on a raspberry pi.
1	1526246241	1	E4ROW still around? Twitter is gone, subreddit private.
2	1526249978	1	Yeah, don't know why they made their subreddit private. They are still semi-active on their slack channel and seem to be plugging along very slowly due to lack of funds.
3	1526250978	1	You'd think they'd want to promote to bring in funding. They had a good idea going
0	1526234406	6	JEsus.... how can someone say that prefer LTC over NEO or ARK?Why are people even answering this guy?
1	1526234702	-7	Anyone preferring NEO over LTC because of features, but not over BTC, is ignorant and a hypocrite. LTC is the most superior cryptocurrency for daily use - there literally isn't any other cryptocurrency with so much history and presence on major exchanges that can actually be used as a CURRENCY. Most other cryptos are pump and dump shitcoins with nice gimmicks that won't have any wide real world use.Also, the discussion was not about LTC. Someone used my main question/this thread as a pathetic excuse to pump shitcoins and scams like so-called "NEO" and "ARK", and that's not appreciated. 
2	1526303003	1	Holy shit man. You’re the one asking dumb questions about receiving passive income ... what did you think was going to happen here? Of course people will be suggesting coins with staking rewards.... it’s the most obvious answer to your question. Also sad to see your some coin fanboy with the inability to have an objective thought.. what a shame. 
3	1526303379	1	No, becuse very early on I commented that I dont want to switch my main non-scam coins to do so (everything that is not eth, btc, and ltc I consider scam, waste of time, and a con-man's/pedophile's coin).
4	1526303547	1	Sadly, I cannot tell if you’re trolling or not...
5	1526305356	1	I am not. Anyone who considers some shit/scam/pedophile coin nobody knows like "ARK" or whatever it is called and NEO (which reminds me of the NEO and Bee scam by the pedophile creator who fled Cyprus) is an idiot and not to be taken serious.
6	1526306278	1	You’re deluded. Keep on shitting in projects you clearly know nothing about. That’ll get you far. There was a point in time where people called me dumb for investing in ETH. Not saying these will reach those levels by any means. Just providing a comparison...
7	1526307824	1	Yeah, I made such bad decision not to invest in random shit coins... Woow, I was so stupid to buy ETH at $3 and LTC at $1... yeah, those are shitcoins... yeah, those two coins are terrible and will never get anywhere, let alone double in value from the points I bought them... yeah sure u are right, I should better look into random shitcoins because the coins I have been sticking to since 2013 are all so worthless and bad performing... 
8	1526309428	1	Holy shit you’re a moron. You’re just rambling to yourself. Arguing on points I didn’t even mention. Bravo. I too invested in eth at those price ranges.. hence me bringing the up on my last comment.. I dumped most my ltc for eth because ltc had so little price movement for years. This isn’t a dick swinging contest though. You sound incredibly deluded. It’s sad. 
9	1526310006	1	Lol... you dumped ur ltc way too soon. But I understand why you did it. LTC is not a coin for amateurs and people who suck hard at trading. It is a coin for real men; men with patience, and men with vision. You were looking after making a quick buck to pay your star bucks coffee. Well, great decision if that was your goal. But for me, I am have a lot of patience... I can wait 5 years and still after those 5 years feel like no time has passed at all.
0	1526243919	2	Bsave.io, Ethlend, Bitfinex lending are some of the avenues available now.  This is an area where you will see increasing development over coming year.  Although because of the unique storage considerations, it may end up like gold which doesn’t generate income but rather costs money to store
0	1526256154	2	Neo, ark, COSS - neo pays your returns with GAS, ark is a delegated proof of stake where you can vote for a delegate (basically lend them your ark tokens to mine more, and they pay you back a stake from mined tokens) and COSS pays you based on how many COSS tokens you hold and how much volume their exchange does, they pay on a weekly basis....take a look into airdrops too. Have to be careful with airdrops because some are a scam so do your research before. 
0	1526242027	2	The organised altcoin shilling is strong with this thread.
0	1526235872	1	Masternodes or lend on exchanges.
0	1526248451	1	park some at satoshis dice.
1	1526250416	3	Went to that site and seems very shady and highly unprofessional. Also, you can only bet, not create an account, and only use BCH to bet. What a weird site.
2	1526250850	1	i gave you the wrong site. satoshis dice is good but i don't think you can invest there. i was thinking of crypto-games.net
0	1526253628	1	Right now, OKB (okex’s token) has a > 10% annual dividend yield.
0	1526258819	1	Buy CLAMS and invest on just-dice. The other sites recommended have too high of a risk of the operator running off with the funds.
0	1526266503	1	Profit Trailer. Monetizecoin has been good to me.
0	1526270914	1	If you play mobile games, check out xenocoin. Make $2-9 for playing certain games. I have cashed out 10 nano so far.  Feel free to ask any questionshttps://xenogifts.com/register.php?r=b4a608d2a90db71e6b1a86d93ec88e99
0	1526271130	1	Invest your crypto into the stock market. I don’t mean sell your crypto for fiat and invest that fiat into the market. I mean use your crypto to buy stocks. Many exchanges exist that do this. 
0	1526240545	1	Buy Qtum and stake
