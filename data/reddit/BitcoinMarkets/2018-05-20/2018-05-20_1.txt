We can see higher highs and higher lows, and where the other markets started to dump Eth kept on going.With that said this is great buying momentum for any commercials to sell into and I will keep that in the back of my mind as the volume continues to dwindle. If we fail to consolidate above 0.084 going into the week, 0.083 will be the next line of defence.With all that said I am a bull on the Ethereum market, however I will put on my bear suite if my above mentioned support zones fail.Lets have a quick look at Ethereum versus the US Dollar.When we look at the Dollar chart we can see that Ethereum is still in sync with Bitcoin when it comes to the USD. This is a good example of a divergence between the two trading pairs and higher risk traders would like to bet that one should catch up with the other.All gambling talk aside, there seems to be a show of force from the bulls above $600, and the bears dropping off their bags above $700. Even though the market has been quite volatile in my opinion this is a good correction after the push to $830.What to look out for?At the moment near term support is around $660 and resistance is at $720. Volume is low so we will wait for the price action to show us the way.Like usual if support fails, expect lower prices, if resistance gets beaten, well, it might be the return of the bulls.[You can find the charts here](https://cryptosignals.trade/forums/topic/ethereum-eth-technical-analysis-may-2018/#post-17662). Safe trades
0	1526824083	5	So, ETH broke out of it's short term downward channel, has held over the one month support, and nothing? https://www.tradingview.com/x/GPp8XsNl/
1	1526840204	1	Check ETHBTC. Have been doing great the past month and re-testing highs. Entering a a ETHUSD long on that breakout is a higher risk since it is at a pretty high point + at resistance (0.085) against btc. Not a optimal breakout.If btc would be showing a stronger trend rather than just being in a neutral state it would be easier to play the USD-pair also. Edit: Check those 4h bband fakeouts to break 0.085 on ETHBTC. Another reason to not go long unless BTCUSD would be pumping hard.
0	1526815334	5	Lets take a look at what the IOTA markets have been up to lately.Many contradicting signals on the market, with a monster H&S confirming the bears are still back in town, and the bulls trying to muster up two double bottoms on the neckline. In my opinion anything can happen.I will look to the support zone should BTC emerge strong this week, putting pressure on the smaller crypto’s. Like usual I will monitor the resistance for weaknesses and possible bets with the bulls.Support on the near term for me is at 0.00020500 btc – 0.00021000 btc, should we fail to consolidate above here in the week i might consider a short. Resistance is strong above 0.00022000 btc and I would expect some fomo to hit the market should the price break to the topside.

1	1526810049	1	Hey I'm really new to this all, could you elaborate/help me understand please. 
2	1526822975	2	Best advice I can give you: if you’re new you shouldn’t be in the altcoin thread. Take some time to understand Bitcoin first.
3	1526828845	2	excellent advice indeed, if you are reading this there are so many scams in this space. plz take it easy on yourselves.

0	1526799624	0	Is ONT sucking all the money from NEO? It seems NEO is dead, while ONT always bounces right back up after every dip. Very profitable swing trading coin.
1	1526827411	1	ONT is behaving EXACTLY like NEO did when it was in a similar price range. Although the supply and distribution are vastly different, so it's probably an arbitrary observation at best.
