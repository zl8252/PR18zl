0	1526920533	18	Short from $8,390.The rising futures premium was just too good of an opportunity to ignore.EDIT: Stops above $8,500. A strong breakdown here could (and should) drop down at least to target support at $8,000. EDIT: Decided that $8,650 is a far better stop loss point than $8,500. Would be content to hold this short through a bounce back to $8,600, but if that point breaks up then I'll be ditching this position very quickly.
1	1526922366	4	Going with you on this one (skipped following you on the long because i noticed a line that could be resistance around 8500).Stops set @8650 but just to try and escape wicks (on Kraken the most it got so far was 8600). Will probably close if we break that resistance line that held us from going above 8500 earlier. This should break either way 12 hours from now the latest when it reaches it's apex @8450 more or less.Will probably add margin if we hit that line and get rejected.
2	1526926053	2	Buyers on June futures seem to be lining up to lose money here. It's uncanny.Either they know something I don't, or they are protecting large long positions from farther down.
3	1526926185	1	What would they be protecting? Hedging shorts underwater?
4	1526926300	2	I'm referring to the orderbook being stacked on the buy side despite the drop through support. The assumption would be that they're adding to existing long positions to prevent liquidation. Or of course they somehow see the break below support as bullish. They're basically treating this dump as an opportunity to buy the dip. Not as a signal to GTFO and/or switch to short.
5	1526926661	1	Oh, i get it now. They could be seeing this as a confirmation of the broken downtrend from 10k no?I don't have that line drawn now but should be around this level.
6	1526926939	2	That line is down at $8,200 though. I mean, I guess they are:1. Assuming the market probably won't make it all the way down to confirm the breakout.2. Assuming that, even if it does get down that far, the former resistance line will *definitely* serve as strong support.I suppose it's not as crazy as I originally thought in that context.
7	1526928403	1	Now we just have to wait and see how this bounces. Above 8380 puts the price above what i think was  the support line so that would invalidate my pattern and make me starting to worry a bit.Bellow i just have the old trend line as possible support around 8250 and some sort of horizontal support around 8180. After that nothing until 7800 (i don't think this is going that low with this bull mentality around)
8	1526928558	1	I really don't understand where it came from either.Here's the strongest bullish statement that can be made at current price/time:"Price isn't as low as it could be."
9	1526929135	2	Broke 20k downtrend, broke 10k downtrend. If 8800 is broken it puts us back in the old ascending wedge targeting 11k or 12k.Shorters scared by these random BGD. Even you avoided opening a short earlier after closing your long.They must feel another 1000$ BGD could come again and push us through 10k and the FOMO would follow.
9	1526929358	1	Chew maybe I’m overlooking it, but I see you comment on lack of follow through from buyers all the time but I don’t see this from you with respect to sellers (like right now.) I know you try to stay as objective as possible so just bringing this to your attention. 
2	1526926562	1	nice
1	1526920642	6	I think support will hold but not a bad risk\-reward proposition
2	1526921255	11	For how much longer would be my follow-up question.I don't doubt that there's probably a greater than 50% chance that this will bounce right now, but to what end? Perhaps buyers have enough momentum to push through $8,600, but there's still $8,800 to contend with after that. And then $9,000 and $9,400. These $200 candles that retrace 100% of the movement over the next 24 hours don't exactly exude confidence.
3	1526921642	1	8440 support turned resistance?  That would be the highest I would expect this to bounce.
4	1526925882	1	nice predict
3	1526925840	1	looks like its breaking down. Gonna add to your shorts?
4	1526925895	2	No, I don't usually add to my positions once I take them.I generally just stick with my entry.Also, buyers on June futures have absolutely lost their minds. They're clamoring to buy the dip here.
5	1526926442	1	lol this is such a shitshow $100 premium i.e premium increased with XBTUSD decreased
6	1526926948	5	It's like they're looking at their charts upside down.
5	1526926670	1	This is... the strangest thing I've seen in a long time. 
5	1526926691	1	> Also, buyers on June futures have absolutely lost their minds. They're clamoring to buy the dip here.I couldn't pass on the opportunity to switch from 5x to 7x with the premium over $100, and I was able to add at 8440 with spot at 8335. Absurd. !short xbtm18 add 8440 2x
6	1526927055	2	There's going to be a lot of sad faces over on Mex if this drops below $8,200. Although I don't see the premium deteriorating unless $7,800 falls.If anything, I imagine it'll continue to climb with every 2%+ bounce between here and there (assuming this does continue to decline). 
7	1526927253	1	I imagine the number of folks with liquidations/stops between 7800-8200 is stupidly high. The bounce off 8300 feels pretty weak, and it could't even retest the broken support as resistance. I share your theory of a BRD from 7800-6900 for cosmic symmetry. At least until *a wild pump appears* out of nowhere and we're back at 8500. 
6	1526934807	1	Position updated with success.* Position: short xbtm18* Opening value: 8,491.00* Average value: 8,468.33* Leverage: 9.00X* Stack: 100.00%* PnL: -0.13%[Check Open Positions](https://www.anotherbot.info/)
1	1526923449	2	Was already small short, but I decided to go ahead and commit. We're bear flagging right now, it seems. A break down *should* drop us right to 8300 or so.https://www.tradingview.com/x/fdPdwsr5/!short XBTUSD add 8290 90%
1	1526928171	1	Also shorted around the same price, but my target is $8150-$8200, then will reconsider
1	1526934084	1	So did you short the Perpetual Swap or June or Sept futures. Sorry if a dumb question.  You said the rising premium, so I am assuming June.
2	1526934295	1	Yes, June. Although somebody else pointed out that the perpetual swap was trading $30 above mark price at around the time I shorted.
3	1526935031	1	Ok thanks, I wish I had a way to figure out the benefit of the quarterly premium vs the funding fee for perpetual when it is negative.  Although I suppose you can't see the future of the rate.I just know when I have been short the quarterly in the past and the market turns around, I get killed as the premium rapidly grows.   I suppose the best time to use the quarterly is in an extended bear market and then can avoid some of the funding fees as well, because they are usually positive in a continuous downtrend.
0	1526905112	40	Hey just a quick thanks to all that add their .02 to these daily discussions it’s rather informative and entertaining, Keep up the great work and best of luck to you all !!
0	1526929295	13	wow check out the volume on alt coins..lot of them have not cracked 100 BTC in 24 hours..
1	1526929909	3	Yeah I tought I saw everything but altcoins bleeding slowly  after bitcoin BGD yesterday? What the hell is going on? Noone can trade because of exchange KYC stuff?
2	1526933454	1	I don't have the time to put together anything official charts, but I've noticed when BTC/ETH pump and alt coins pump, we are in a bull market and when BTC/ETH pump but alt coins remain stagnant/bleed out, we are in a sideways/bear market. Alts pumping when BTC/ETH gained was an indicator in early April that we were in for a decent short-term bull market.
0	1526909829	13	Closed my long at around $8,500 for a negligible gain.I was expecting a strong, and near immediate push back over $8,500 when I entered my long, and instead I'm seeing sellers lining up at that area of interest. Will wait for $8,600 to break convincingly before hopping into a fresh long position.
1	1526909900	2	What price point/behavior would entice you into taking a short position?
2	1526910104	8	At this point, I wouldn't feel compelled to short unless $7,800 fell with conviction.Buyers are still frantically buying the dip with $11,700+ in the back of their minds. This may be a delusional fantasy, but they'd really need to have their spirit broken completely in order to make a short position really worth pursuing. Of course, I say that now. I could very easily change my mind if a good opportunity presents itself. For example, a strong push up past $8,600 that stops dead in its tracks at $8,800. That's a fairly likely outcome in the short to medium term, and might be a good spot for a short.
1	1526909989	2	I would expect a daily higher low in the 8200-8300 region before pushing 8880 for a daily higher high.Bulls might need some time to recharge before pushing this higher.
1	1526911101	2	How much fees do you typically pay for each buy/sell order? Do you factor trading fees into the gains/loss for each trade?
2	1526912063	1	I'm still trading the Bitmex June futures, where the fee structure is negligible. Taker fees (market orders) are just .075%, whereas maker fees (limit orders) actually pay out .025%. I've been placing a lot more market orders than I'd like lately, but they still don't have much of an effect on my gains. 
1	1526910045	-4	We got to test 8150 again, been short since 8510. But we do have one more large leg up (around 10k) before another 6-8 months of gradual down trend. This market is trading almost identical to 2014-15. Short term trades are super risky right now.
2	1526910208	6	I'm watching this support line for another touch point. https://imgur.com/a/OC5Q5x5If it breaks, then buyers could be in trouble. 
3	1526910452	1	Watching that too, at this point I think we'll encounter it with this continued sideways action.
4	1526910683	1	I'm expecting an outcome by about 10PM - midnight UTC latest.
5	1526910985	2	We seem to be finding support with the first attempt at 10k on the 25th:  https://imgur.com/a/mxf1xsPThat would intersect with our current short term support line in 3~10 hours.  I agree with your projection of around the closing of the daily candle to see if the next notable move is up or down.
6	1526912019	1	Interesting trend line. Seems to be holding up for now, but the price is looking slightly heavy. Think a breach of 8400 will send up into a lower 8300 at least, if not lower. I'm just gonna step away from the charts today and set an alarm. Shit ALWAYs goes down when I'm not watching the charts, haha. 
7	1526912780	2	Looks maybe about time for me to stop watching that trendline...
8	1526913018	1	Jeez, gone for 10 minutes and everything starts shitting the bed, haha. Might be a fakeout though, pretty high volume for a mere $100 drop. This could be bought up fast and back in the trend. Will wait for the hourly to close to see what I want to do. Uptrend line from 7923 low hasn't been broken yet, so thats comforting still. 
9	1526913606	2	I longed it...  ca is on top of the bear pennant that is now probably being drawn. Have a few orders at the bottom of the wick to grow it, and stop loss a little bit below the wick, under the support line.This is basically what I was waiting for, though I intended to wait more for confirmation it doesn't continue to go down.  But I'm about to go back to being busy today and cannot deal with that.
3	1526912685	1	That just break?
4	1526912964	3	Not really, no.It may break in the not too distant future, but it didn't break right there.
5	1526914469	1	What do you have the breaking point at right now? About 8350?  
6	1526914958	1	$8,360 or so. 
7	1526914967	1	Thanks.  You going to short if it falls? 
8	1526915434	1	Probably not the breakdown, but I'd maybe short a random bounce that pops back up to retest the breakdown. 
5	1526914566	1	Seems like we dipped below it and are flirting with it hard right now, no? Not considering shorting here? I saw you wrote a longer post about shorting opportunities below as well but this trend line didn't seem to factor into it.
6	1526915182	1	Buyers have soured me on shorting lately. Their behavior is incredibly frustrating. Whenever there's a major breakdown, buyers pretty much disregard that it happened and buy the market right back up above the breakdown...only to let it drop again after.We saw this at $8,100 most recently, and at $8,600 not that long ago. So sure, you could short this breakdown if it occurs, and perhaps buyers will actually capitulate and let price drop below $7,800.More likely, however, is the market will bounce at some point between $8,000 and $8,300 and there will be a strong green candle to kick you out of your short prematurely.
7	1526915387	1	What do you think about a long right here with tight stops?  Good r/r or The risk of getting stopped out just too high?  
8	1526915523	1	It has better r/r than a short, that's for sure. But ya, you'd have to set the stops relatively deep to avoid getting bounced out by a fakeour. 
9	1526916744	1	Gonna sit out for now
7	1526918875	1	I would be interested to know what, if anything, you take from this behavior.  Buyers seem stubborn.  They will buy on dips but don’t follow through.  
8	1526919490	2	It's a recipe for disaster, and if there is a substantial dump in the near future then buyers will have nobody to blame but themselves for the "cheap coins" they'll "enjoy" as a result. "you can't lose money longing bitcoin" is a mentality shared by a lot of investors in the crypto space. And that's a logical fallacy that could potentially explain the behavior we've been seeing. Buyers want the price to continue higher so they can drown in a sea of lambos, but they don't want to put forth the effort to make that a reality. That's somebody else's problem. This type of buying behavior can gradually inch the price higher and higher, but it's not going to bring the market to $11,700+. And eventually, there quite simply won't be anybody left to buy the dip when the market needs it most.There's a fairly strong potential for the market to continue to overextend itself and for sellers to finally get a chance at $7,800. Buyers who loaded up in the $8,000 to $10,000 range will watch smugly as their "sure thing" investment is being sold for a "delusionally low price" and wish they still had some fiat to throw at the market. And if $7,800 falls, they'll either watch in disbelief as the market continues to fall, or they'll abandon ship themselves and contribute to the decline. That's not a "worst case scenario." It's an inevitability if this lack of follow-through continues for much longer. 
9	1526921647	1	Thanks for responding.  Could the same be said for sellers?
0	1526901007	23	Long from $8450 with stops below $8,300. RSI has cooled down and there's relatively strong support here at the moment. 
1	1526901385	5	Nice entry
1	1526901385	1	also quite clear pin bar ( http://priceaction.com/price-action-university/strategies/pin-bar/ ) on last two 1h candles, showing that all dips are bought up. The big question is , do we get a BGD or BRD when  a move comes :D
1	1526901705	1	What do you think about [this](https://imgur.com/a/mrc6M9H)?
0	1526901356	18	Wedges inside flags, inside triangles, inside pennants... Testing the cloud on one timeframe, while inside the cloud on another timeframe, and rejected by the cloud on another timeframe.I'm really starting to become of the opinion that none of this stuff matters at all. Not one little bit. You can paint any picture you like with this stuff.I find myself using less and less indicators as I learn, rather than more. Right now I use RSI, BBands and volume, nothing else. Im learning new ways to interpret the data from these few indicators rather than adding more.I still draw lines on graphs to try and estimate where short term support/resistance is and what direction it's moving in, but that's about it.
1	1526901804	9	>none of this stuff matters at alland afterwards it is always so obvious. "how could I have not seen that coming?"
2	1526902695	3	Yep. But if you go throughh historic data looking at bull/bear flags, or movements into the ichi cloud etc, you can find just as many examples of them not playing out as expected.Like, what use is an ichi cloud for example, if the price turns around and goes back out the way it came just as often as it goes edge to edge?What use are bull flags when they break down more often than up during down trends?
1	1526901541	3	defo, my most successful months of trading was just trading something as basic as horizontal support and resistances, literally two lines on the chart and thats it. But thats a little tough to do right now when price barely moves
1	1526903134	2	I agree that less can be more (and certainly more time-efficient) in trading, though I want to keep an open mind and keep learning.My "toolbox" has (so far) consolidated to: horizontal support/resistance, trend lines, volume, RSI, 50/100/200 MAs and Fibonacci retracements.Only in recent weeks have I started to appreciate the latter two, but now I am firmly convinced that many price movements cannot be properly understood without also looking at MAs and Fibs.
2	1526905278	1	I have noticed MA's correlating with bounces (only because Binance shows  them by default), but I haven't really delved into that rabbit hole.Fibs sound like hocus-pocus to me to be honest, never really looked into them. Although I notice many here seem to like using them.
3	1526907256	1	Regarding Fibs, I agree with you about the hocus-pocus regarding their justification. I believe they attain their relevance simply because so many traders use them in their TA.
3	1526908676	1	The only "fib" retracement I like is the 50% , but that's not even following that sequence it's just I like it from psychology standpoint. And I think the market shows it, we are 150$ -+ from the 8200 range sine a week that is the middle of 6800 and 10k
4	1526913570	1	Same here. The idea that 23.6% between one point and another somehow has special relevance because of 'nature' is hard to believe imo
5	1526914261	1	it's a bit like this http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/forex-trading-strategies/trading-50-percent-retracements-price-actionalso there is a reason stores have "50% discount" as a big sale indicator
6	1526916784	1	that article makes sense. The author acknowledged my main grievance with fib retracements too that if you draw enough lines, you'll invariably get random touches that don't actually have any significance
1	1526903171	2	I've yet to see long term oscillators lie. Formations painted by bots otoh...
1	1526901417	1	Low volume and last minute pump or dumps can allow faux TA formations. 
1	1526901649	1	What time frames have you been looking at?
2	1526901895	1	All of them. I was just ranting about the cloud bit, but I assume I can find examples of being in/above/rejected by the cloud right now if I have about 12 timeframes to choose from.
1	1526903167	1	If you place any weight on BBands, might interest you/us that they haven't been as tight since May 10, right before the $1,000 drop.
0	1526913362	11	Long at 8400, stops at 8090. Still in the mindset until proven otherwise that 7900 was a higher low 
1	1526913663	4	If we're continuing up, that was todays dip.
1	1526914039	4	Me too, same spot.  Though I don't think we have far up to go if we go back up (maybe visit 8600 again).  I think medium term we still head to the bottom of the giant symmetric triangle before we meet its top.
1	1526913544	1	I covered my short and went long here, but just trying scalp a short bounce.  My stop would be about $8399.  You are willing to lose 4% of your money if the price drops...not saying it's good or bad, but I would never do that.EDIT: Ok that didn't last long and closed that out quickly with about 0.15% loss.
2	1526913810	1	I close positions early if I think it’s necessary. I mainly just set it so I don’t have to stare at the charts all day. 
2	1526914119	1	How does one trade BTC confidently with stops less than 1%?
3	1526914670	1	By not getting rekt!
3	1526914194	1	With your brain, if capable.
0	1526919045	9	Bearish div on the 15-min, 30-min and hourly charts. Volume a meager $5.5 bln (lowest since Apr 16). This doesn't look like much of a bull run. 
0	1526920670	9	[So I only had to baby sit this position for a little bit. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ky3fx/daily_discussion_monday_may_21_2018/dzc2pnc)[I am out](https://imgur.com/a/E4f9Ytl) and will make my long term entry shortly after this mess is sorted out.Good luck yall
0	1526875736	28	Exchanges like Binance & Bitfinex made >$300M with 97% profit margin this year. Legacy institutions have taken notice. And believe me, they're coming. We'll hit a tipping point where the market will take off. 3-9 months. Custody is difficult, and it's what's preventing pension/endowments/sovereign funds from entering. It's a long process.Until then, we'll go sideways.Sand Hill road missed crypto chapter 1. They're not going to miss crypto chapter 2.-Novogratz
1	1526882189	4	Sand Hill road is VCs, not pensions / endowments / sovereign funds.But anyway, sure, pump it like a trumpet.
2	1526883063	5	Both Novogratz [and myself] have been on Sand Hill road. I'm aware. It's a standalone point.
1	1526878624	3	Sauce?
2	1526879338	5	Probably the latest Unconfirmed podcast. I listened to it and that's basically the gist of what he was saying
2	1526880994	5	It's probably more. During December, bitfinex was turning over >100 billion per month. These are the numbers for if they were "only" doing 70 billion per month.https://i.imgur.com/nhwXgiR.png= 90-140 million revenue, estimated. Per month.If I had to guess, I'd say Bitfinex took home 400-500 million last year. And already cleared 400-500 million so far in 2018. 
2	1526879333	1	https://unconfirmed.libsyn.com/mike-novogratz-on-why-incumbents-are-still-well-positioned-to-participate-in-crypto-finance-ep019
2	1526894492	1	Unconfirmed.
1	1526883740	6	The thing is i imagine financial institutions are looking at this more like a gold rush. The exchanges are the people selling the shovels. It makes much more sense that legacy institutions would likely get in by taking a %age from people and giving themselves exposure that way. Maybe im totally wrong though...
1	1526881505	3	I’d add to the above that this past weekend's edition of Barron's - which is read by virtually the entire financial community - ran a feature story on BTC titled:"Bitcoin’s Price Drop Doesn’t Scare the Big Money" (linked, but pay wall)https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoins-price-drop-doesnt-scare-the-big-money-1526688001Agree fully with the sideways movement in price and same too with 3-9 month time frame. No matter how quickly these players want to enter/expand, they need to check a whole lot of boxes internally before getting the approval to actually move forward. 
1	1526888623	2	I can't see pension/endowment funds touching crypto with a barge pole in the short or even medium term.
0	1526903121	6	Mex is strongly leading stamp, bfx and gdax.For the last few hours you've seen +25 dollar difference higher on mex and this number gets reduced as prices increase on stamp and gdax.. then another spread by 20 on mex followed by more catchup on the lower volume exchanges the price is based on.This is normally hard to spot when range is tight but on low volume days this lead-lag formation is clear as daylight.
1	1526904310	2	This really doesnt mean anything as people dont buy or sell bitcoin on Mex. The premium (or discount) on Mex is taken into account when funding occurs every 8 hours.
2	1526907763	3	These differences are not corrected by just finding rates, that just takes care of the residual. Bots and market makers position themselves in a way to profit off the divergence in price between the underlying exchanges. 
1	1526904004	1	So this means someone is either building a massive long or closing a massive short?
2	1526907939	1	Likely not someone but masses of people, the price action sentiment and leverage combination feeds off itself. 
1	1526904907	1	Bitfinex spiked to over $8630 twice and BitMEX stayed below $8600 both times.But generally you are correct.
0	1526930884	14	It looks like we have a hidden bullish divergence on the 1h charts. I think we could see the uptrend continue.
0	1526920491	12	Just wanted to say with all this KYC and AML stuff floating around that if you have made enough from crypto to follow the laws and still live comfortably than just do it. I live in California and have paid an exorbitant amount in taxes and I filled out all the Bitfinex FATCA and CRS paperwork as soon as it came in. But honestly, I stopped entertaining negative and greedy thoughts and just looked at how blessed I am and it feels so much better to live that way.
1	1526920997	4	The peace of mind is worth it.

And your advice to just "follow the laws" doesn't work very well for people in China and India...and Iran, and Zimbabwe and many other countries.  Because doing anything with crypto currency is illegal there.It's great if you are fine with following all the current regulations and any that are arbitrarily created in the future.  But some people are not and they aren't necessarily "greedy" to think that way.I pay all my taxes and do not appreciate being interrogated by exchanges for just trying to trade, when I am doing nothing wrong.

0	1526908804	6	Vol is at like 10-11 month low... https://imgur.com/a/98tzwFX I wonder if there is some kind of "technical low" for this or it can just go down and down
1	1526910465	1	Well you can imagine volume cannot decrease below zero.  With so many bots trading the space though you gotta figure there’s a bare minimum until their owners take them offline.The low volume right now is no surprise though, ETH is nearing the end of a daily equilibrium pattern, market is very undecided.  This week is likely to determine the rest of the year for the market depending on how ETH breaks this equilibrium pattern.If ETH and BTC break bullish, we’ll see higher highs in ETH throughout the summer and BTC will be leaning bullish on its weekly equilibrium pattern looking to break late summer i would guess.

2	1526912503	5	A couple of hurdles:1. Variable income: One month you could make $10K, while the next month you could lose $5K. 2. Grocery stores, landlords, coffee shops, etc don't generally accept BTC. So you're going to have to sell btc on a regular basis to pay bills and to fund your life. Depending on the country you're in, this would be a huge pain in the ass from a tax standpoint. 3. It can be boring as shit sometimes. In order to be profitable, you might have to sit and stare at your monitor for 8 hours and do absolutely nothing.

1	1526930606	4	> will make a strong case for a massive iH&S on the daily if bulls are able to sustain a trend reversal for a week or two.I really think that bulls need to be really consistent over here (which seems so be the case in the past few days), so long they hold this for a little longer as you said, it will confirm the reversal of the pattern (which will be highly beneficial for the bulls).The longer the bulls hold this, the quicker the market will move out of this uncertain environment.
1	1526929969	2	With this level of disinterest, wouldn't the rise in price also contribute to progressively lower volumes till it breaks down and sells off? That's literally the definition of a bear flag.
2	1526930606	4	In fact, if you switch to the monthly chart this looks a lot more like a bull flag than a bear flag.https://www.tradingview.com/x/dbYNHUBh/
3	1526932939	3	Not a bull flag
2	1526931471	3	well daily volume has been consistently decreasing since mid March and we’ve been in a  fairly horizontal channel since then. This could just be an indication of big movement in either direction. (neither bullish nor bearish until something happens)But since this is following the fall from ATH in December, it could be seen as bullish since volume is drying up after months of correcting down.
2	1526930403	4	You expect to see decreased volume in all formations as volatility drops, the symmetric triangle tightens, and BBands tighten. The drop in volume is irrelevant. It just shows that the market is uncertain.If it's a bear trend then you need to see lower lows at some point. We haven't seen that in a long time.
3	1526930875	1	But a bear trend isn't simply a free fall. There will be temporary rebounds between drops.  Our last local low was on the 17th, just 4 days ago.

Buyers and sellers don’t seem to have the volume to make this go either way convincingly. This sub switches from bullish to bearish back to bullish about every 12-24 hours which makes sense because of all of these fake outs. Personally, I’m holding my 8400 long and won’t abandon unless 8100 falls.

Both charts have very similar peaks and bottoms, BTC being a little bit excessive maybe.
1	1526908797	1	It's sell for btc because of the excessive movements you mentioned. They trigger sell signals on moving averages. 
1	1526909342	1	I've also noticed stocks and btc kind of tracking each other. But it's weird because btc kind of looks like it's leading and I don't see how that's possible so maybe it's just a coincidence. https://www.tradingview.com/x/1kAzxOtq/I do think that a bear market in stocks would be bad for btc though, and it seems like the trade war is over so maybe stocks will continue their bull run which would be bullish for btc.

0	1526923437	3	Hi all, I've written my own bot and got some advice here on indicators which seems to be working well but made the mistake of using gdax. The volume on EUR is terrible and the spikes are only arb bots not actual trades. Any one know of another exchange with a similar API and fees with decent volume? Margin would be a bonus nothing major 2/3* would be good. Just looking to give it 100 and see how it goes before throwing a bit more at it. Cheers
1	1526927210	3	You're gonna have a bad time running a bot on $100.
2	1526927351	1	Just test money pal before I put anything behind it. Thought the margin would be an idea to simulate larger trades without actually risking money during development. What would you recommend as capitalisation ?
3	1526927568	2	You may not be aware of order minimums. Most exchanges are 0.002 BTC minimum orders...that's $16 right now. Unless your bot is simply trading a single coin in and out of fiat and not employing any DCA strategy, you're going to run out of rope super fast. 0.05 BTC is the lowest I'd even bother with. 
4	1526927943	1	Yeah all in on each trade at the minute between EUR, LTC and BTC trying to arb a profit. It's not the best strategy but the GDAX API is buggy as hell and seems to return old balances/holds every once in a while so I track my balance locally which makes dca difficult due to slippage and crapping out when the API returns an error. Seems to be when there's a good bit of profit on the table not that I'm cynical in any way. 
1	1526931700	2	I would recommend BitFinex for the kind of pilot test you want to run with your bot. Moreover, I think can offer the best environment for your bot to learn as it is the leader in exchanges. All the best! :)
1	1526924417	1	I'd use Binance. Low fees if you use BNB, high volume. With $100 you may run into some issues with the 0.002 BTC order minimum, depending what you'd trying to accomplish. 
2	1526928222	1	Cheers pal,Just had a look through the API and it's very similar to GDAX, thinking I could just swap out the engine and it might work. Do they have a test net for checking API connections/commands?
0	1526930741	3	Binance coin up 5% last three hours while BTC and most other cryptos are down - I suppose it has something to do with its use as gateway coin? (Pardon if this belongs in the alt discussion.)

0	1526893637	22	[My Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZuOvlXdX/)   What I see here is a big move up.  Why: Descending weekly volume is reaching very close to its breakout point, most likely this week or next. The volume will probably decrease after the first week of breakout but it should for sure give us a nice fat candle first.    Weekly MACD is about to flip, every time it has flipped we have pumped _hard_ , I'm talking 100%+ gains   We tested the weekly Tenkan and it held as support for 3 weeks now, same for daily Tenkan as well as 50 day MA which has started moving upwards(currently 8.4k) which will push us up even more.   Weekly ichi cloud is going to push us up within the next 2-3 weeks.    Weekly bands are squeezing, signaling a big move soon.   If we recapture 9.4k(weekly mid band) and it holds as support I think we will shoot straight up, as it was a [major support](https://www.tradingview.com/x/U9QtaXdT/) point in the entire bull run, which means a lot of people are looking at it. If we break it I would be careful FOMOing though, as we did break it 3 times in february but failed to close above it, the best will be to wait until the weekly closes and build a long term long on the inevitable retest.    Tbh the current chart kinda looks like the mtgox chart from april 2013.   However if we dump I will change to cautious at 8.1k and abandon all hope sub-7.6k as this is the 50 week MA. I don't think we can have any hope for a bull run below that MA. Either way decision time is coming soon, the range has tightened to $1.8k.   Also please keep in mind this is mostly on the weekly chart, so don't be surprised if it dumps first..it always does when I post bullish TA for whatever reason   Currently 50% btc 50% fiat   EDIT: now 100% btc after buying 50-day MA, looking to enter margin longs at the weekly tenkan-sen
1	1526894900	6	>  I'm talking 100%+ gainsGod I hope so, that'd be awesome. Really nice analysis on a time-frame not often used. Thanks!
2	1526896476	5	thanks, weird you're getting downvoted. i think the bear-patrol just paid us a visit.  hope people will let me know if i overlooked anything important in the weekly chart instead of just downvoting. i'm an amateur after all so feedback is appreciated.
3	1526897441	5	Yeah I saw bunch of downvotes on all posts few minutes ago. Some unhappy folks popped by it seems. Doesn't matter, here for the information and discussion, not internet points.I don't think you missed anything, and I really like the use of the 50 day & weekly MA. I think 9.4k right now is still a bit far away as it would necessitate a breakout from the top of the massive symmetrical triangle, if we gain some more momentum here we might have a shot in the next week or two. (I also said 8600 was far away yesterday and look what happened, haha) Will be an interesting week, though I really hope volume at least picks up a bit, because right now it really feels like a bumpy slow-bleed reminiscent of the aftermath of the last hype cycle. 
4	1526898683	3	Yep, I think volume is the most important thing to look at this and next week. Any move that doesn't have the necessary volume to break out of the descending volume pattern is probably a fake out. Looking at the daily volume I'd say the breakout should start early next week, around the 31st...
0	1526915067	7	Opened a small short at 8490 on June futures (roughly 8410 spot at the time) on the bounce after we wicked through the line. 10% 5x. Will be adding if the support line breaks and we hold under. Will bail over 8500 spot.!short XBTM18 8491 5x 10%https://www.tradingview.com/x/6ysAxgvh/
1	1526915315	4	Same here, although seems like it would be just as logical to open a long here - although I suspect the upwards movement if we stay above won't be nearly as quick as the downwards movement if we convincingly break below.
2	1526915569	1	Seems likely. I'm already basically back at my entry. As chew has mentioned, buyers are frenetic recently and pump out of nowhere, make shorting very difficult. At the same time we have abysmal volume and drops like the one we just had. At this point I'm basically just hedging some fiat value. 
3	1526915806	1	I know I shouldn't be mad for the market "not reacting the way it should" - but it really feels like that's what it's doing. Very little follow through after big pumps, and yet buyers are eager to buy every dip/dump and don't really seem to care for lines/formations being broken. 
4	1526916070	2	It does feel to me like we're still due a trip to the 7xxxs. There's a part of me that wants to just drop leverage to 3x and add it all. Short 8500 (June) and re-evaluate if 8850 breaks. Just sidestep the chop entirely and target a 7-14 day trade. 
5	1526916682	3	It just seems inevitable to revisit the bottom of this https://imgur.com/rnKsujp
6	1526916876	3	Indeed. Yet this dip buying is insane. It does feel a little precarious. If 8300 goes, it could move quickly. The same can't be said for 8500, though, as we were just there. 
5	1526916541	2	Seems to be quite the battle for 8.4 right now. I think we should know a direction soon, unless we just dip to like 8.3 and that gets bought up with no regard for trend lines.I felt like we were due for the 7xxxs as well, and expected a bounce when we dipped below 8, but didn't really think we'd bounce to 8.6, so shorting kept blowing up in my face all the way up. At this point I don't know what to think anymore and also don't want to "expect" the price to go anywhere. If anything I'm tending toward the opposite and feel like predictions beyond 48 hrs are becoming impossible.
2	1526915743	1	Yeah, upward is a struggle back to 8.6, downward is speed to 8k or more.  Because where we are now is the potential higher low.

0	1526897262	9	*In my opinion*, we just left or are about to leave the E wave of the corrective trend and are starting a new market cycle with Wave 1. There might be one more corrective subwave coming which would bring us between $7k and $8k, but maybe not. Low volume is an indicator for it, though.--Look here at "Horizontal Triangles". The highest point is our "All time high".http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:identifying_elliott_wave_patterns#horizontal_triangles--On the 4h chart:https://i.imgur.com/OJt8c0K.png-->**Wave 1**: Wave one is rarely obvious at its inception. When the first wave of a new bull market begins, the fundamental news is almost universally negative. The previous trend is considered still strongly in force. Fundamental analysts continue to revise their earnings estimates lower; the economy probably does not look strong. Sentiment surveys are decidedly bearish, put options are in vogue, and implied volatility in the options market is high. Volume might increase a bit as prices rise, but not by enough to alert many technical analysts.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_wave_principle
1	1526897639	5	Interesting, seems like a lot of wave-1 is very applicable here, though I'm sure these type of scenarios can be flipped to fit various market conditions. is there any quantification for wave-1? Any particular price/percentage increase it needs to reach to validate itself?
2	1526897941	5	This is not my chart, but this guy gives a good measurement.https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/rstZQtKL-BITSTAMP-D/
3	1526899010	1	Wow, seems a bit ambitious as of now, but good to keep in mind. would be crazy if we get to a new ATH in 6 weeks, but definitely something to keep in mind if we do break out of our symmetrical triangle. Thanks for sharing!
4	1526899376	4	Very ambitious indeed. Hard to believe for me, as well. But the number of waves fits, the market sentiment fits the description. Many things pointing in that direction...

5	1526900988	1	The 5 waves in that chart *could* stretch out over a much longer time...

1	1526902115	5	How did you draw your upper trendline? 
2	1526902352	4	From 03/20/17, touching at 04/09/18 and last week. You could draw it starting from 07/10/17, but that makes it less of a symmetrical triangle and only garners an extra week for the pattern to exist, so I would consider this line more valid.I'm not convinced that this pattern will actually result in any significant price movement, hence why I asked the question a few days back as to how significant this coinciding of lines was. Didn't get any answers which is disappointing as I'm pretty sure there's something to be learnt here. 
1	1526907682	1	So that should signal a continuation of the long term up trend? Edit: wording
0	1526914408	7	I had quite a large long open from yesterday, it did so well after the mini rally, and overnight as well, that kind of influenced me to add to it quite significantly earlier today. I've been stopped out at break even, and have a small position left over...Kind of annoyed at myself. Got greedy. Didn't stick to the plan \(which was meant to have my stop lower at 8300\) and have long term trade which I usually never do...I'm wasting so much time with smaller time frame trades \(which is the majority of trading I do\). Anyway. Not too bad I guess \- got lucky and walking away at break even. Something to add to my lesson book. 
1	1526915210	3	as one of my favorite traders Richard Dennis says, keeping strategy and psychology is all>“I don’t think trading strategies are as vulnerable to not working if people know about them, as most traders believe. If what you are doing is right, it will work even if people have a general idea about it. I always say you could publish rules in a newspaper and no one would follow them. The key is consistency and discipline.”
2	1526915775	1	Good quote, that one!
3	1526915804	3	great book too https://www.amazon.de/Way-Turtle-Methods-Ordinary-Legendary/dp/007148664X
4	1526916003	1	Great, thanks! Just grabbed the pdf.  Will burn through this next time price action is moving sideways !!
1	1526914574	2	I think for short term targets, it's best to avoid adding to it when it's looking good, unless it's near the beginning at confirmation time.  Missed a lot of profits that way.
1	1526914612	2	This is a classic mistake I make.  When ever i get to the point where Im adding to a winning position is usually when i should be taking at least 50% off the table.I now try to identify that *greedy* urge and do the opposite!Like you say, at least you didn't lose any capital.  On to the next one.  If this continues down you should be able to get a nice long entry tomorrow or the day after!
1	1526915284	1	I think my limitation is I'm just not used to trading large positions, at some point a trades changes my thought process and I become less analytical and much more emotional \- especially on larger positions which I've been trying to do more these days \(ahem hence all the tight stops\).There is a point at which I start checking on the price more and more often, and get drawn in. And then I realize I'm getting a bit too obsessed. I never seem to grasp this transition point.
2	1526917163	2	I suffered huge losses when I was actually correct and picked the bottom, 3 times, but wouldn't trust myself. Search for "Mark Douglas" on youtube. Helped me out a lot.
3	1526920693	2	I've actually read one of his books \- trading in the zone \- can highly recommend it. I should probably read it again haha.
2	1526915768	1	My rule is that if I worry i am overinvested. If you have 1% worry it will influence your strategy so never be. Just sell 10% of the position, then 10% more until you have 0% worry. It's quite similar to sports like martial arts. if you ever are worried about getting hit, you will think more about avoiding to get hit that to hit your opponent and can not focus
1	1526919992	1	Short term trades require a somewhat different mindset. The take profit must be executed without mercy, even when you see the price rise another 5%, if it already hit your mark take it off the table.Also, re-adding to a position on the 1h must be done at the 1m range not after the trade goes your way 3 hours later.Its also hard to move from entering positions with a ladder of bids to a strategy of opportunistic market buying, and from stop loss order to "finger on the button" action. People believe day trading is like swing trading when in reality is/should be a lot more like scalping.
0	1526931612	5	Looks like we are in a small descending wedge, i'm expecting another pump. Maybe not as high as 8650's earlier pump but around that. I will sell ly bags there and probably go short 
1	1526934376	1	Is this the one you're talking about?https://imgur.com/a/MIgwFUUI thought there would be at least a little more break to the upside than this.
0	1526897320	8	Higher low on the 4H time frame was set last night at 8436. We also set a lower high at 8582, indicating possible formation of an equilibrium pattern during consolidation. RSI has nearly reset in the 50's on the 1H chart. If we set a new higher low in the next 2 hours, it's more likely than not that the pattern will tighten and we will see a break upward in the next 8 hours or so.

0	1526912593	8	And there she blows mates https://www.tradingview.com/x/OeQk1QlG/Bottom of our ascending channel tested and it bounced off only about 40 ish$. We now have our third point of contact if it holds.A break under $8380 would be a break out of channel and possibly a good place for a short On that note, I closed half my short at $8406 and leaving the other half to ride ( entry $8587) 
1	1526913722	1	I have bottom of the channel at $8365 ..within margin of error I guess
0	1526878597	3	Since all my buys were slightly under 7900 none of them got hit and I have been very patient and not chasing this rally. We'll probably still go down a bit but now I have to figure out where to move my buys up to. I'm thinking 8200 as that has proved to be a very strong support but I'm thinking I should also front run myself. Where do you guys have your buys placed?
1	1526878904	8	I was in a similar boat, closed my short at a loss at 8330 cancelled my orders between 7800 - 8000 and went all in. Sometimes shit happens bro :/

However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.

0	1526915263	5	Watching closely for a bounce here as to protect my short from 8510.xx. My next trade will most likely be a long term trade (7+ days) depending on which way we break. All I'm seeing is chop city the next couple days and I've already been lucky enough to scalp my last two trades this week. Don't want to push my luck on the short term.

3	1526916973	1	Just seems disingenuous to share the profit after margin.  A 1% move on 100 x margin is 100%, for instance.  The end % isn't nearly as important as the move % itself, especially in a public forum.  Just one trader's opinion.
4	1526917527	2	well on the other hand margin is basically a risk ratio, so knowing someones margin level according with their entry can say a lot about their risk thinking
5	1526917898	1	Oh I agree with that, but didn't see anything about it in the parent comment.  I would've enjoyed the whole trade setup/execution/close discussion. But this is all I saw:> Got stopped out on my 8237 long at 8404, for a nice 11% profit.

0	1526922447	3	On May 18, around 12:00 UTC, Binance Coin spiked about 25% (I believe it was the best performing crypto last week because of it). This occurred just a few hours after BTC reached a local bottom and had displayed a sudden rise. Does anyone have an explanation for this? (Edit: These are only two observations, there might have been many other things happening simultaneous in the alt-coin space.)
1	1526923453	7	They announced that holders of 500 coins will get more referral rewards

0	1526891606	7	Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/siKDU2Cc/I'm underwater short from 8350. Not trusting this weekend move. High volume dumps during the week and then a dead volume bounce on a Sunday. Current stop condition is 4hr close above 8616. Seeking low 8k high 7k.
1	1526896426	1	High volume dumps? What?It was 8k BTC on gdax while it was at 8.3k and when it dropped to 7.9k it was 8.5k volume on gdax 
0	1526927576	7	Weak volume under the major 8.5k support (turned resistance again?) is not a good look right now if long.  May need a test of 7.9k for a try at a double bottom since there are no other technically meaningful supports below 8.5 and above 7.8k.  But 1D looks like potential H&S which would now correspond symmetrically to a bart back down to 7.2k putting at risk the gains from the BGD in April if it fails to hold.
1	1526928571	8	Weak selling is not a good look right now if short either... Non-trading day.
2	1526928743	7	Right, but the sellers have the advantage that it is still a bear market; gravity and price bias is still downward on a macroscale (weekly/monthly charts).  Basically, the bulls have a much bigger onus to prove their case than short sellers right now until ATH is broken.  Longs need to create the bull market which will only happen with increased buying, shorts don't have to do anything, the market is with them as a whole until some large time scale bullish pattern finally confirms with volume.
0	1526914528	5	Bounced right off the ascending channel support line.[https://imgur.com/a/WgPGwoS](https://imgur.com/a/WgPGwoS)If it holds, we'll still form a higher low on the 4 hour and prime us for the next leg up.

0	1526934956	7	You guys don't realize what's happened. I've seen the light. The Bottom is IN. Here's the fractal I've been looking at: [March 2017 4h](https://www.tradingview.com/x/V2GHkkee/)[Current 4h](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2dEjOzFe/)Ok, let's break this down. We have our initial drop, then a bounce to the 50 MA cross down. Then another drop, making a marginally lower low on lower volume (bullish, just like the inverse is bearish). We then bounce back to the 50MA, pause, break through (yesterday), then come back to test it as support and bounce. That is the lowest BTC went at that point. What ensued was a slow grind up, golden cross on 4H and then we slowly retook resistance levels.On the daily chart, we have a BBand double bottom both times as well, too lazy to post that though. So based on all of this, I have 3 predictions:1) The low we saw today (8309.1 on Bitfinex) is going to be the lowest we see BTC in the remainder of 2018. (edit: possibly 4-ever)2) We will follow the 50 MA on the 4H as support for the next 1-2 months and retake 11.7k3) BTC will make new ATH (above 20k) by September 31, 2018.Happy trading, when the epiphany hits you its better than sex. Long and strong boys, I am literally leveraging borrowed money on this trade since I actually lost everything earlier this year. EDIT: fixed first link
1	1526935210	4	Lolwut @ your last line> im literally leveraging borrowed money 
1	1526935472	3	A+ for trolling effort.
1	1526935300	3	I'm not very risk averse myself. However leveraging borrowed money seems to be asking for trouble no matter how sure you are. Hope your right for you and your lenders sake. Good luck I wish I was as sure as you about the future.

2	1526912270	1	Of course! These crash patterns do tend to follow a similar structure though.  Same thing over and over again *until it doesn't and we get the moonening instead*
0	1526926538	4	Long stopped for a pizza loss and flipped short at 8350.  Not a great ca for the short.Sept long that was built with dca last week also stopped out in profit.  I had been planning to take it's profits if we got back below 8400.  Will start building a new one.  The previous buy orders are still there from 7900 and below, might refill it up to 8kish depending on how the next few days goes.  If we don't get low enough I'll just buy the position back.Edit:  wtf is this shit!  Surprised that the original long would have still been able to have been closed at BE after we broke that support so decisively.
0	1526895429	4	Let's just all admit it guys, nobody knows what's going on or where this price action will take us. We could be at $20k or $2k this time next year, either price point is equally as plausible and any prediction is no more than a guess at this point.So in that spirit a show of hands please, by this time next month will we be closer to $10k or $6k per bitcoin?
1	1526895809	6	Idk man, my predictions are normally really on point.In that spirit, by next month 1 BTC = 1 BTC.

1	1526895937	0	your first paragraph is misguided. $10k
2	1526896588	1	It's all just opinions, but I'm pretty sure we're all making speculative guesses here
0	1526916786	3	Question for you guys. So when you all do buys and shorts for a low amount aren’t you all losing money due to the fees?I use gdax so my fees are small but I have to make at least a certain amount in order to make a proper gain 
1	1526916969	6	If you use limit orders on MEX, they actually pay you. 
1	1526917714	6	I don't use any exchanges that charge a standard fee for trading.  They are all % based.  So low amount or high amount are all the same.  % is what matters.
2	1526918492	1	Thank you all for the replies and I haven’t used the limit and stops yet I’ve been doing it manually atm I wanted to see how everyone else was doing and see what I should do 
3	1526918905	1	It is tough if you are starting out and undercapitalized, but the trading fees really aren't the issue.  You just have to start slow and sometimes take a bit more risk than is ideal and you can grow your trading stack.  Then can make smaller bets (as a percentage of your net worth) and have profits enough to pay the bills and then some.
4	1526919785	1	Yeah I was about to ask is this an actual job that someone does with no other work? I made 6k and lost it due to the dip I didn’t sell when I should have and bought alt coins and realized you can’t flip them like ordinary coins 😂
5	1526920037	2	6k can hurt, but if you ever become truly successful with trading, it will be relatively insignificant.   I remember early on, I was down $2K on a position and almost suicidal before it came back (in about 30 seconds).  Now that is barely a blip and carries with it no emotion.
6	1526920642	1	Yes man I feel you so much like I’m been so depressed bc of how happy I was making that I’m 19 and no job I could get rn would make me that much money I made it in a week like idk I hope to make a lot from trying the limit market.
7	1526920986	2	Yes it is difficult to trade profitably in a consistent manner, but many people do it.  I am often dumb and make so many mistakes, but I have been able to turn a profit, each of the last 5 years.  I tried to trade the stock market in my 20s and did great and then lost all my money...which was a huge mistake and disaster, but I didn't give up and now I could retire from my gains from crypto trading.So my point is just don't give up if you realy think you can make it work. 
1	1526916989	3	Depends on your trading style/frequency and whether you trade swaps or futures which have different fee structures. For myself (and this is a poor trading style lol) I frequently open and close positions, eating the fees, until I land on a winning position that makes up for it. But I also trade with higher leverage than most here (and have suffered the consequences).
1	1526916951	2	Many here are trading on BitMEX, where you actually get paid 0.25% if you buy/sell with a limit order. If you do that on the futures, you also have 0 rolling fees. However, you have the risk of a premium (or negative premium), if the future price diverges from spot price.
2	1526917241	2	> risk of a premiumOr benefit
3	1526917457	1	True.
1	1526917231	2	GDAX has 0&#37; maker fees.  Are you placing market orders?  
2	1526919116	1	Well I was reading the info about it and it said something about if it has to be spread then it won’t go through. So I feel like it’s not gonna be as good compared to allow taker? Or maybe I’m wrong  
0	1526928550	3	Looks like the dump is stalling exactly at a high volume node: https://www.tradingview.com/x/xDNKUEeT/If it falls, the next big one is around 8100. We could see a bounce there. Shorted on futures as we started to break the line. !short xbtusd 8380 10X 100%
0	1526934559	3	It seems, we just had our "higher low". The slope of the uptrend has changed, but it's still intact.We might even form another, bigger inverse h&s pattern here.
1	1526935110	2	Is that all those weak bears could do? Was hoping for 8170 at least, disappointed. 
2	1526935426	1	They can do the equal, it is simply that the power seems to have been shifted.Plus, everyday is not Sunday. Seems like 8170 is long gone.
1	1526935274	1	Wonder why bitcoin tries to juke you out every which ways.  How can we establish any trust if you keep breaking them?
2	1526936603	1	the trust is there on a longer time scale
0	1526890347	3	We will see a sharp downturn, these two wicks are to fill the order book downside and to prevent shorters from opening shorts by scaring themand to hunt for stops. We are also in an asencing wedge where the wicks perfectly make the resistance line. we brake out of the ascending wedge below around 8505!

1	1526915026	1	You feel good about a $200 drop against your position?   I guess to each his own, but if was me, I would have been frustrated with myself for not selling that spike.  However, I've been guilty of overtrading before, I know many just swing trade.   Also, if you can't sit there and monitor the market all the time, that is probably a better strategy.

0	1526894856	1	I think we're looking at a reversal here.- Hidden bearish divergence on the 6 Hour/RSI (red line).- We just wicked into the median line of our pitchfork (purple dotted line).- Multiple topping dojis.Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/FR5kPwBg/The swing previous to this one experienced a similar divergence (red line with breaks) and the result was a 10% drop.  So we could reach out to some where near the outer limit of the pitchfork which would give us a double bottom reversal point. I am hoping the higher low on the weekly chart is in and am looking for this (daily higher low) as confirmation.
1	1526896455	2	highly doubt it's going to work out this way now, yet of course it is possible RSI and STOCH look good/not that bad on almost any time frame, BBANDS don't look bad eitherstill think btc will go to 9000 first as it's the target from the inverted H&D before having any decent dropedit: it seems to me as bulls are just taking a short break before pumping it up again; 8470 as of the moment of writing now and not expecting it to go much lower
2	1526897662	3	The Inv. H&S is legit. But the volume profile isn’t right. No follow through *yet*. I think a nice well defined higher low would give buyers confidence and make the next leg up easier.Also, hidden divergence has been flawless in this swing from $6500. So I won’t ignore it because of a pattern which is inconsistent in achieveing it’s target. Having said that. A push to $9000 in the coming days would invalidate the divergence. We shall see. I am short and looking to long if it looks like a higher low is in on the daily chart.
3	1526898462	2	good points! let's see what happensgood luck in your trades!
1	1526895217	3	Yeah I also still had the resistance from the symmetrical triangle for a couple of weeks ago and it seemed to perfectly coincide with the wicks  that got sold into almost immediately. I'm torn, things could go both ways again here, though I'm not considering a reversal until we break 8400. Nice analysis! 
1	1526895607	1	I agree, am looking for low 8's to come soon before a move back up and a push into at least the 9's within the next week or two.

1	1526905470	8	This could be fee related. Doesn't mean people aren't using the network, they may just be consolidating into fewer addresses to avoid dust-related fees.>Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.>Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.>George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.>I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the "high-powered money" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. **Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.**-[Hal Finney, first Bitcoiner](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg34211)

0	1526925180	-1	Buyers had their fame and glory yesterday with the BGD. It’s the sellers time to step on stage. Just watched that mini attempt by buyers to break up above 8400 but the sellers just said “ sit the fuck back down”. Crazy resistance above 8400 on binance. We are flirting way too hard with the support line, so on that note I added to my short at $8390. Now have positions open from the high $8500’s and high $8300’s. 
1	1526925961	9	Good timing.
2	1526926239	5	Yea not sure why I’m being raped with downvotes either. Guessing the bulls wore their skirts out today 
3	1526927015	6	No chart no upvote :)Also bringing bear predictions right after breaking the downtrend can have that effect
4	1526927555	-3	My last 2 posts have been TA posts with charts, didn’t want to post same charts again. I also predicted it 21 hours ago saying there will be a retrace to 8400 Ish with a possible test of 8280
5	1526929992	1	Don't worry. Mostly psyops accounts in here in the past 24 hrs. The rest are stupid. Few folks who know what up have been posting, which in itself says a lot of you know what I mean
3	1526927941	7	I downvoted because I found the bulls vs bears commentary a bit irritating.
3	1526926652	-2	Because denial is overwhelmingly popular here 
3	1526929941	1	downvoted for referencing the Binance BTC/USDT market... as if it matters
0	1526924005	2	I don't really know what to make of that shared neckline of the larger IH&S and the subsequent, smaller H&S that formed after.  We keep dicking around just below it now.Between that and the rising TL from 7925 that squeezing in, any guesses which direction we go next?  Just a gut feeling, but I'm leaning towards the rising support to fail.  No rationale behind it really.  
1	1526924378	2	We’re pretty much in no mans land. Gotta see if we violate the trend line with force before making any move. Lack of a bounce isn’t promising though
2	1526924548	1	Yeah, from the looks of it, we could be waiting for a while before there's another definitive move.
0	1526901990	1	An assesment Chewy posted about 10 days ago has stuck with me.    [https://imgur.com/a/hLYAEYi11](https://imgur.com/a/hLYAEYi11)He thought that the longer we went without re\-testing the line but didn't break $11,700 was concerning.Chewy!  I don't think we have tested that line yet?  Are you still concerned by this?EDIT: Link and grammar
1	1526902175	12	link don't work for me :(
1	1526903617	7	Link still not working. 
1	1526902244	2	The longer we don't break $10K is concerning as well...also $9K...at least if you are long, or if you are a holder.  If you are a trader, then it's not really a significant concern at all.
0	1526911734	3	I wish I could view the order books right now. From the info I have available, it looks like this is a very weak dip? Considering closing my short from 8,545.Edit: Damn, I am so unbelievably good at posting things like this just seconds before being proven wrong.
1	1526912053	3	Dip hasn't started yet.  Keep an eye on the reversal H&S on the 1 Hour (we're in the right shoulder now).  If that completes we *might* get a dip.I say *might* cos they can complete and then not follow through.  ETH's is much closer to confirmation.
2	1526912174	1	it needs to drop below 8,436 to get confirmed, right?Edit: nevermind \(I assume it confirmed\)
3	1526912727	2	If we close an hour or 2 hour candle below the neckline.  Still looks like we could be in a bull flag though tbh
0	1526899622	2	BTC is trying to enter an [old rising wedge](https://imgur.com/a/mrc6M9H). It's grinding against the lower bound testing a support turned resistanceDoes this pattern still have any relevance since it was broken already and has only a few contact points?
1	1526900082	1	hmm hard to say, would be interesting if it does manage to pop inside and then see how price reacts to the top of the range. As of now, while it's still below, I'd say not too relevant. 
2	1526900299	3	I think the first test would be if it enters and then checks it for support no?Reaching the top boundary should take some time on such a big pattern.
3	1526900375	1	Ah yes sorry, that's definitely step one
1	1526900119	1	wow this is a very interesting chart, thanks.
0	1526920275	2	The fractality of the current price action (past few days) to that of late March 2017 is fractalicious. Also, if you discount the wick to 6k we are in an inverse head and shoulders on the WEEKLY chart. That is BIGLY.
1	1526920582	5	NICE spot.  On the other hand, if you're a glass half empty type of guy and you include the wick it could be an Inv. Cup with handle, indicating a continuation of the trend down from 20k -6k.Tomato tomato

0	1526893948	2	Just added 30&#37; to my long at 8530. Tight stops once again on this addition. Seem we're on the tip of the recent trend line. I'm holding my main position until at least 9k unless I get SL, though I think there is plenty of room to go higher.

0	1526931992	1	National Geographic Presents.....Charting for Ants: Here we see a classic IH&Shttps://www.tradingview.com/x/zu2waaAm/Sorry for the bored post. In seriousness though, I'm happy to see a retest (as lame as it is so far) of the support line as resistance. The meekness of these movements is not heartening one way or the other, though. 
1	1526933031	8	Buyers are coming back for more too, it would appear. This is nuts.
2	1526933107	2	Could be an actual rejection here, potentially.https://www.tradingview.com/x/mGcDvNcF/You don't even need a microscope to see it.
3	1526933284	5	Nope, no rejection here yet.

2	1526934843	1	Why is a reload / consolidation nuts?
3	1526935354	2	Breaking a support level isn't generally a buy signal. It's a sell signal, or at least a signal to get out of the way until selling pressure subsides. We just saw the opposite. Buyers lining up like that dip below $8,400 was the last time BTC will ever be at those prices again. If buyers follow through here and keep pushing price up through resistance at $8,600 (doubtful), then it's not nuts. If buyers fail to continue upward here, then it's nuts.
4	1526935772	1	Ah yes agreed, if it's not meant to push through 8.6 it's idiotic. Tho it could just be bots playing 1H oscillators games too.
2	1526935262	1	Just read the latest comments. Bulls everywhere. We are swimming against the current it seems. 
3	1526935596	1	I'd argue the opposite. This is just another in a long string of fomo spikes until buyers actually continue moving up.
4	1526935867	1	You are still planning to hold this short if this moves above 8500, correct?  With plans to bail only if 8600 is breached?  
5	1526936011	1	Yup. I'll bail at $8,600 and maybe consider a long above $8,800. Buyers need to prove to me that they won't crumble the moment there's the slightest hint of resistance. 
0	1526887146	1	bulls close your eyes...(seriously, I don't want to annoy anyone)price action is boring as fuck so let's get a 2014 post going to rile some people up. I was curious to see what 2014 people were like when they were at our equivalent of $8200-8500 for the last time. Browsed the daily on September 04, 2014 and found a lot of stuff that makes me go hmmhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2ffb17/daily_discussion_thursday_september_04_2014/The arrow points to the last day it ever hit the ATH % equivalent of ~$8590 ($8500/17.3 = ~$491Didn't hit this price again until 13 months later (which, admittedly, isn't *THAT* long.)https://www.tradingview.com/x/d6nXig4w/##Below is the interaction I'm most interested in. It seems I've had this exact conversation with people over the past few weeks with the same exact canned responses from people who have been repeating the same things for years. Is no one else really worried about the fact that to the general public, almost *nothing* has changed since then? All of this institutional money seems to be going into exchanges...you know, those *centralized* things where they make money off volatility?--->So merchant adoption has been happening but with no positive effect on the market, we've learnt from Ecuador that a country is unlikely to adopt Bitcoin when they can just copy the model for themselves (yay open source), widespread adoption for payment processing seems unlikely other than in import/export businesses, is bitcoin's main selling point now as a store of wealth? Or is it possible we have hit market saturation?in response to this someone said:> It's really hard to observe day-to-day activities, and translate them into long-term perspectives. In five years, we'll be able to look back at 2014, and easily analyze it.>**Merchant adoption is progressing, and I suspect it's very early on the adoption curve (i.e. not yet at the "hockey-stick" of the S-curve), but moving forward.** If/when it hits the hockey-stick, businesses will be scrambling to implement Bitcoin payments, like they were scrambling to get websites in the late 90's. But this takes time. **Fortunately, some trail-blazers (like Overstock) are out there, proving that it doesn't hurt, and actually can contribute to the bottom line.** That contribution takes time too. One week of proof is nothing. If Q3 is better than Q2, which is better than Q1, then people start to take notice. If it is better and growing, that will get more attention!>I think Ecuador's experiment will fail. The analogy is the early-AOL version of networking, when it wasn't connected to the internet. It may help people get comfortable with crypto-currencies, but eventually, it'll prove to be a gateway drug, and it will only help Bitcoin.>To take a longer-term perspective, look at www.bitcoinpulse.com, and compare now vs. one year ago. And picture what that might look like one year out. Or five.another in response to the original comment asking about merchant adoption:> Is this meant to be a parody? Are you making fun of buttcoiners? Or are you actually serious? Just asking.he says: >It is possible to have a negative opinion without being a buttcoiner. I am genuinely serious.then the guy says> **Serious answer:**>**We've not reached saturation. At work the other day, a friend showed me his personal site with a few open source tools for his field of expertise, and I jokingly asked if anybody is sending him donations through the PayPal button. "Isn't it time to set up a Bitcoin button?"**>**He grinned and said that he needs to figure that stuff out at some point, and two other people nearby began talking about how PayPal fucked them over. These guys aren't queuing up at the diving board, but they do have a bathing suit somewhere.**OP responds:>ok but that's anecdotal, and how is bitcoin superior to paypal? bitcoin might fuck you over less as a vendor but it also means the consumer can be fucked over more easily (chargebacks are there for consumer protection). Bitcoin is also slow, it means buying bitcoin which itself poses difficulties for the average consumer, and there are still fees (exchange fees, transaction fees). I can see the protocol being used to transfer value but really it's best at both ends for people to have USD or whatever and bitcoin just be in the middle.guy says:>I'm not saying Bitcoin is superior to PayPal, **just that there are people (or at least, one guy at work in a field unrelated to it) who have heard of it, are interested, but have just been too busy to really look into it yet.**---Some other top comments on the daily that will make you question whether or not I'm taking comments from yesterday or 4 years ago:>http://www.bfxdata.com/swaphistory/btc.php>Shorts just recently hit 9k on Bitfinex.>The last time shorts were this high was May 26th.>Mother of Bull.... For those that don't remember, [this is May 26th](http://i.imgur.com/BnCVyyF.png)---->Not all 9k will be squeezed, but it will be a big move for sure.--->Dont try to rationalize this rise.** The big investors have just been fucking with the small guys and laughing all the way to the bank. Let the price fall to build up shorts, create despair, then drive it up. Drive it up high enough to create hope and build longs, then drop it back down. Rinse and repeat, each time pocketing the cash from the weak hands.**>There is no news. There wont be any news.---ahh yes, the rational bear...>So is this the part of the episode of Bitcoin Markets where they play the happy music jingle as the price pops up $20 in a few hours, and everyone talks about recovery, before yet another slow painful bleed-down? This show is getting really predictable.--->**Shorts are playing a dangerous game.**>http://www.bfxdata.com/combined/btc.php>BTC swaps spiked back up right after this recent price rise... shorts are doubling down, if the bulls can manage to push things over 500 we could see some fireworks, especially if stubborn bears keep piling on shorts without price sliding down.---> Pure speculation here: I think this rise was the first step in a couple of steps up.---Emphasis mine in every commentHow does this not bother anyone? It seems virtually identical. What's so different about now?! People aren't using bitcoin, they're not particularly inclined to start using it, and exchanges are just profiting off of fees, not actual bitcoin adoption. I just feel like I'm going crazy wondering "can people really fall for the same thing again?" Is it really different this time...?

0	1526912131	1	Is there anyone that has explored currency arbitrage together with crypto, or is it not worth to look at?  For example, let's say you bought 1 BTC in January for 1000 USD. Now,  let's say EURUSD is up 5% until today , meaning the "purchaing power" of selling for EUR is better than back to USD. Or do I think wrong, that the market is correcting this all along on the pairs/ratios so it doesn't matter at all?

3	1526913365	1	Yes plus 2 follow up trades to balance it out.But it's happening at every 5 to 50 cent interval cause the order books can be thin at a particular price point so you're doing several smaller trades in a short span.Edit : spelling

1	1526919473	5	Isn't that what you can do with MakerDAI?
2	1526922763	1	I will look into it
3	1526925085	1	Maker allows you to essentially lock up your ETH (not BTC) in a smart contract as collateral and borrow their DAI stablecoin token against it. You need to be careful where you set the liquidation point for your collateral. You can use your borrowed DAI to buy other tokens and go from there so it is a way of margin trading but not exactly in the Bitmex sense. Separately there are a number of projects working on the DEX margin trading problem - check out DyDx, Lendroid and b0x.network - my personal favourite is b0x which is a margin trading protocol that works with the 0x protocol for DEXes and it is also the furthest along in development.

2	1526909710	2	Maybe, generally when I see the volume + price stagnate and ETH/BTC ratio drop it usually means people are cashing out Alts -> BTC - > Fiat
3	1526910207	1	This is why I track alt performance as a metric personally. If alts are dropping while BTC is stagnating, it means money is leaving the market. People generally flee to BTC first if they are trading alts since it’s more stable.
3	1526910760	1	Ja but when btc remains stable and alts are trying to dump its gewd
4	1526911029	1	If you plan on buying alts yes.
1	1526911179	1	The ratios have been out of whack throughout this barting period or whatever you want to call it.  LTC/ETH won't move while BTC fluctuates, one will pump, no change to BTC.   Shoot me.  
1	1526909644	1	I’m honestly a bit surprised to see BTC up here still at this point using alt performance as a metric. ETH/BTC ratio has been dropping for a full day now, and it seems the only alts outperforming BTC now are TRX, NEO, and ONT. Not exactly inspiring, yet we are holding up $8400 rather nicely so far.(Edit: Hi! It dropped 20 minutes after I posted this reply. Thanks for the downvote for apparently no reason!)
2	1526909847	1	You forgot Decred, that shits damn near ath at this point. And I had to trade it all out.
0	1526894828	1	Just a quick thought I had today about ICO "investment" vs trading. The size of all kinds of groups and youtube channels regarding that are magnitudes bigger than pure trading channels and groups. This is because people want free easy money fast, and not put the hard work required into psychology, analytics and risk management that trading requires.The thing I am wondering about though is, why is not (or few) people considering trading like any other skill? Is the dream of catching the next 100x random crypto so much more fun and interesting ?
1	1526903880	1	I think many people try to trade but fail at it, and then develop that kind of hostility towards trading and successful traders. That's why we see so much of that "timing market is impossible" attitude.Also, funny enough, throwing money at random icos is what feels more like gambling for me, rather then systematic trading is
2	1526904223	1	Yep, and this is then fueled by the "haha I bought ripple at 1 cent now I am rich" youtube 20 year old gamblers that are just survior bias. I think it's quite sad, I just want to be a better traderThis is because you have learned about risk and control, I am myself thinking of putting some ETH profits into some protocol hype ICO this year actually but I am quite aware of the risk and it's in a way(but still a bit house money fallacy)  "free money"
1	1526903982	1	presumably the reason is because these people are hoping to find the next Bitcoin/Ethereum/whatever and get in on the ground floor, rather than trying to predict or guess the tops or bottoms of a somewhat established market.
2	1526904179	1	yeah, but then they will still sell too early and not go through the losses and so on to learn a solid foundation of trading
0	1526914426	1	Question: when Gemini verifies your account, then do they send you an email? Or do you have to keep logging into your account to check the verification status? Thanks y'all.
1	1526915409	3	I got an email
1	1526915582	1	Just FYI when I signed up in December it took less than 24 hours to get verified. When a family member did so in feb, it took them over a month to verify.
1	1526921498	1	Just a fyi, fees are high on Gemini now.
0	1526879174	0	Does anyone see an inverse h&s on the 15?
1	1526879300	2	Yeah but I'm like 90% sure those are reversal patterns, not continuation.
2	1526879655	1	I see, thank you! 
2	1526881793	1	Pretty sure that Inverse h & s and is a bullish pattern, and you’d look it is as the downtrend had started at 8600 and brought btc down to 8436 (head)Anyways it’s on a small time frame and within a small range so I wouldn’t expect anything huge from it
1	1526886059	1	I'd be wary of anything on the short time charts tbh. Make sure you look for other signals to confirm!

1	1526894655	1	what alts are you looking at ? The top 5 on Binance are doing sideways if something...
2	1526894863	0	Agreed. They got a bit carried away and pulled back as expected.
1	1526895059	1	I stil have some room in my wedge to go down, maybe test 8400-ish, but we haven't violated the trendline of our upmove yet.Moreover if the IH&S plays out, we should be headed towards 8800 or so, and it would coincide nicely with the horizontal resistance there, plus overlap with the fractal of our descent from 11.7k Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xcyvlo1d/
0	1526928105	0	Can someone explain in more detail what are the Bitmex Up/down contracts? 
1	1526928404	2	A scam. The trade range MEX will allow the market to operate inside of during the given week./s (sort of)As best I understand it, in order to come out ahead, the market would have to overshoot the close prices by double-digit percentages. I don't understand why anyone trades them.

0	1526908298	0	Could we be in [a rising wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/j1BqFuEk/) on the 4HR? 
0	1526933968	-1	Approaching original support line. Crossing it would be very bullish and a sign that our higher low is in on the 4 hr timeframe
