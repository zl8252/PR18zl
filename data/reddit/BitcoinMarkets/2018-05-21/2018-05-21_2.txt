0	1526880749	2	Has the Tron hype train left? Is this a bad entry point now?
1	1526901385	8	Any entry into that turd is a bad entry unless it's a scalp trade.
2	1526903566	-1	Of course, who needs that shit. Just trying to scalp the mainnet news. 
1	1526913387	3	This is around the time most news pumps peak (7-10 days before the news) so yes it is quite a gamble.
0	1526933694	2	Bought some alts yesterday by feeling the fomo because of BTC breaking its trendline. I got XMR, IOTA, ADA, NANO, MAN. Now I feel quite bearish after today btc movement and it feels quite contradictory to hodl alts and short bitcoin at the same time. Do you think it is a good idea to move them back to BTC (or fiat) and wait for this bearish trend to finish? Or just hodl? I was buying this stack carefully, most of these coins are at the lowest btc price they have been ever. 
1	1526934467	2	I think it is almost impossible to do what you are attempting, which is time the market, unless you are one of the whales in control of where the coins go.  
0	1526917548	1	It looks like Decred is holding its value better than any other crypto right now during this bear market.
