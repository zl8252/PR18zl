Which would assume you are a trader to start with who has an approach to make money that can be autoamted.Now, you will ask "why can I not just get one cheap" - well, the same reason you can not get a bitcoin for half price. Making them is work and why should anyone give a working money machine away for free? Yeah, I know " because justice and stuff" - if you believe that, dream on.
