0	1526936657	1	your best bet is to sign up for a signal group like here:https://smartoptions.io/bitmex-signals/some of the signal groups do encourage you to learn and the private chat groups are great exposure to people who try to teach.you have to be careful in which one you sign up for though, not that it is a scam but more for time differences. For example, Bitmex lifestyle is based in the states, so their main active time is like 1am-8am for me which is totally useless (I'm asleep), or Margin Signals which is based out in Australia and would be useless to a person in the states
