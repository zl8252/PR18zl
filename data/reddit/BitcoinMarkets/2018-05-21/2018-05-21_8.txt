0	1526889660	10	Those whale pool guys are given way too much credit and publicity for some reason 
1	1526910133	1	Whalepool and Whaleclub are run by the same people. There a relatively small number of them But they all have multiple accounts to make it look like there are more of them. 
2	1526915349	1	yeah but who cares about what some random guy in a chat says i mean
3	1526918789	2	No one cares, and them moving to another exchange will just make them even more powerless than before since finex basically dictates the btc market.

That's literally half the industry or more. Who in their right mind would hire a *Senior Detective in the Fraud Squad* to **detect fraud**!?!?! Someone call the Hague obviously a war criminal, *"probably"*.In many places you'd be the criminal for posting such unfounded shit as this.> I think this is why volumes are tanking.lol
