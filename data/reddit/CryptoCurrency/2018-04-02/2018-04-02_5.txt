1	1522621905	31	Reverse moon here i come
2	1522623231	33	Earth’s core, here, we, come!
3	1522642910	2	somebody do the photoshop of this with crypto themehttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5669bdc61c1210f372a5014b/t/568aed8c40667aa939c3955b/1451945410477/
3	1522647482	1	Black hole sun won't you come
3	1522647658	1	Red Moon save me a spot
1	1522655016	-1	Exactly. It is headed back there!
0	1522627317	82	Just shows how much room there is to fall.
0	1522631788	13	this is insane, both positive and negative. shows that we can still maybe go up a similar amount or that we are still far too high.
1	1522652297	2	The question is which?  The answer is in the hands of traders, God help us!  
0	1522652803	11	The funny thing is there is literally no going back to those days. Bitcoin does not scale down gracefully, too much of the coin is mined. Electrical cost per BTC has risen 600% from those days. Which means that after $4000 miners will start making losses. 
1	1522665221	1	> Which means that after $4000 miners will start making losses.Yes, they will start shutting down at some point. Are you implying though that they somehow have the power to stop bitcoin price from crossing that line?
2	1522666075	2	No I am implying, that it will be "that's all folks". But do not like to come across like crazy guy with a sign and shouting world will end. So I let people connect the dots.
3	1522686303	1	If that’s the case then then miners will start to leave, the total hash rate will decrease, the difficulty will adjust, and the remaining miners will get payed more BTC per kilowatt 
4	1522686411	1	To my knowledge BTC does not scale down that gracefully compared to modern coins. Especially as very significant part of the workload is caused by the exponential rate of diminishing unmined coins.
0	1522636262	8	Is this the first time all of you people have ever looked at historical prices? I'm really surprised that there are so many "zoom out" posts that all give almost exactly the same info, and all seem to get upvoted. Maybe I'll make one for the hell of it.
0	1522639245	8	LTC investors: does it strike any of you as odd that one year ago, literally eight long years after LTC first went live, it was still only worth $15? There’s a lesson in there somewhere.  Can you guess what it is?
1	1522649994	18	2017 was completely unreasonable? 
1	1522652623	10	That LTC sucks and is redundant? The only reason it went up is because of hysteria?
1	1522641360	2	Hodl? 
1	1522680696	1	prepare to eat your own shamlam doobily?
0	1522622962	23	Ant shares. Binance didn't exist yet. Vechain was listed yet. Neblio didn't exist yet. Walton Chain didn't exist yet. And and and..... Amazing stuff! Crypto is life. 
1	1522629149	-22	I believe VEN is a sleeping giant 
2	1522634043	14	ven is already a crypto giant and top20coin, there is nothing sleeping about it.
2	1522632532	6	DAE heard of Ethereum I think it's really flying under the radar
3	1522691183	1	I personally prefer this one fairly low cap up and coming coin called Bitcoin.
2	1522631403	1	lol
1	1522626422	-5	LAMBO !
2	1522629060	0	And bcash was just a twinkle in Ver's eye.
3	1522629351	-4	I like Bitcoin Cash, for now. Blockstream hijacked Bitcoin. They can go where the sun doesn't shine...... 
4	1522629602	-4	Cool story bro
0	1522614287	28	Thats where we are heading im afraid
0	1522637337	3	Everything reverts back to the mean
1	1522668081	1	Which mean?  We hit the 200 day moving average.  Does that “return to the mean” in your opinion?  Must we return to the lifetime moving average?  Does anything ever do that?  Aside from Enron, WorldCom, etc.  
0	1522635914	5	Corolla!
0	1522621734	2	37 billion, damn.
0	1522651932	2	We are most likely heading back to the pre delusional hype levels again
0	1522618855	4	I am a crypto bear but I admit this is something people overlook. you cant really say a market is dead if its still up several times from a year ago. Although 1 month from now this may not hold true...
1	1522641025	4	I'm just thinking what did people expect was going to happen when BTC was going up parabolic?? Look at any chart of any stock or any crypto for that matter what happened to it. A big crash 100% of the time. People make this more complicated than it is...
2	1522649950	6	Human psychology. It's hard to overcome even for traders. If price is going up, it has a huge future and is going to change everything. Price is going down, its dead and there's no future. With those emotions, you are compelled to buy into the positivity and sell with the negativity when you should do the exact opposite. 
3	1522657586	1	very true
0	1522618595	2	So you're saying we've still got ways to go down?
1	1522620480	2	what goes up...
1	1522621007	2	This is correct I would say. We could see it crash quite significantly 
2	1522652576	0	Implying it hasn’t already. We’ve definitely reached despair. 
0	1522645489	1	About the only coin today you would be down on if invested at these prices is bitconnect coin. Lol
0	1522669026	1	Things are so doom and gloom in here these days. When I sold all my coins back in January when bitcoin hit 10k everyone thought it had bottomed out and was headed back to the moon.
0	1522680529	1	Yea I get more scared when I see those numbers.
0	1522614050	-5	It doesn't matter, it doesn't even slightly imply that we will see another bull run ever again. What happened is utterly and completely irrelevant. Stop pumping false hope into people just to seek assurance.
1	1522619442	24	So instead let’s all keep posting about how we’re going to zero and the sky is falling. Sounds like a great idea. I swear there’s no appeasing this sub. 
1	1522620633	13	I don't even care about another bull run at this point, if bitcoin bleeds to death so that actuall good projects can rise on their own without having to be tied to the fossil, that'd be perfectly fine.
2	1522628365	4	Except for the fact that bitcoin probably has the strongest dev team out of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Some of the best cryptographers and engineers in the world have been contributing to the software for nearly a decade now.Whether you like it or not, Bitcoin is king. You can facilitate smart contracts on it, transfer for pennies (with segwit and lightning, spam attacks will probably never be a problem again), has the largest amount of trust behind it and most importantly of all, is the most decentralised chain.
3	1522641379	3	Ok, well it doesn't matter if the original source code is outdated. It is still massively slower than a lot of bigger cryptos out there. And not scalable. Lightning hasn't proven itself yet.Is the most decentralised chain?? ok so you're going to ignore that 3 mining farms in China controls 51% of the hash rate? You bitcoin maximalists are just delusional. 
4	1522648560	2	I am not a bitcoin maximalist. My biggest holdings are in alts.>Original source code is outdatedWhat? The source code is continually updated daily. Not to mention that nearly every single altcoin is built upon the premise of the original bitcoin source code with the exception of ethereum that takes inputs and stores as a state per address instead of a UTXO.>Not scalable1. Segwit. 2. And yes, lightning has proven itself. You can use it right now. How else are you supposed to prove it?>The most decentralised chain???Yes it is. Any miner can join any pool that they choose. If one of the mining pools decides to do something ```shady```, miners can just switch pools and nothing on the chain will be affected aside from the last block that was mined being orphaned and it taking an extra 10 mins to verify transaction again. Amount of weight per individual transaction verifier on the network correlates to decentralisation of which, bitcoin has the most.
3	1522639485	3	> Except for the fact that bitcoin probably has the strongest dev team out of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Some of the best cryptographers and engineers in the world have been contributing to the software for nearly a decade now.Except that these particular developers have conveyed consistently throughout the years that they do not have an understanding of the market, nor do they care about end-users, usability, or keeping BTC competitive in the marketplace. In fact they have vocally ridiculed anyone who promotes such viewpoints. That’s why BTC is suffering. That’s why so many forks have come about. So keep that in mind when we talk about how “great“ they are at cryptography. There’s been no product development lead in the BTC space, and that’s a major problem with any development project. Gavin Andresen was the last remnant of a Dev who actually understood and cared about the end-users, and the industry. And they kicked him out.  The people left care only about the code. They’ve said that much themselves.You never have developers doing literally everything from start to finish in a project, and thats exactly what Bitcoin has right now. 
4	1522660048	-1	Shut the fuck up for once
3	1522680940	1	but blockchain is not scalable at the fundamental level.
2	1522627270	-1	you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for bitcoin! so show some respect! 
2	1522621458	-11	Bitcoin is the highest tech blockchain we have apart from MAYBE ethereum. If you think your shitcoin have better tech because its faster you missed the whole point and shouldn't be investing your own money. Buy some bonds.
1	1522628934	2	Yep. People who bought silver 12 years ago are up maybe 10%, but they had a huge bubble in the middle that still hasn't recovered. 
2	1522641502	1	silver is a commodity. Cryptos are products.
3	1522647735	2	Some are. Cryptocurrency is a pretty wide spectrum of objects, grouped together because they're digital. 
1	1522641196	2	False hope? BTC has had major crashed 5 times in the past. I just wonder what people were expecting when BTC was goin parabolic for weeks? This just shows me that people in this market knows ZERO of trading. 
2	1522651203	1	You don’t have to know anything when you invest in crypto. Just follow what people say on reddit. 
3	1522657554	2	True, I actually look a lot on the sentiment on Reddit.
1	1522623479	1	Sure it matters. You sound as dumb as the moon boys. 
0	1522626514	1	if nostalgia has you just wait we will be back at btc 1,429 soon enough. 
0	1522637354	1	Yeah but that doesn't guarantee it will go back up. Invest in coins that have a real long term chance
0	1522642884	1	And we're going back there as we speak.
0	1522628542	0	I got fiat ready to go for when shit hits bottom couldn’t be ore happy about these prices.  
1	1522637041	-4	Let’s see if you’re happy about these prices in a month when they’re reduced by half and you’re still clutching onto your bags. 
2	1522658492	2	I agree it’s gonna go lower hence why I said, “I have fiat ready to go when this hits bottom.”  
3	1522664257	0	So how are you going to know when it's the bottom?
4	1522667359	1	Good ole fashioned wait and watch.  
5	1522667749	0	Lol look forward to seeing your post "is it ever going to go back down so I can buy in?" 
6	1522668026	1	Thanks.  Good to know the crypto community is as supportive of each other than ever.  
7	1522669844	0	I hope you do well bro, but "Good ole fashioned wait and watch" doesn't sound like much of a strategy. I was hoping you would be supportive by offering some useful insight.
8	1522670932	2	If I had any useful insight good sir believe me I would share it.  What I will be doing primarily is seeing if BTC can break its downtrend.

1	1522619497	11	God knows random steem articles should be the number one most trusted source of market analysis...
2	1522619873	-6	I source the paper in the first paragraph you.... Clearly you didn't even click through 😂
3	1522620111	6	I did. I’m saying that random steem articles aren’t always to be trusted. You can find 100 articles stating similar or totally contradictory points of view 
4	1522622451	-2	So basically what youre saying is there are tons of academic articles pointing to different views. Because the steemit article is just taking passages from the research paper. Theres basically no commentary in the steemit article. 
1	1522628916	1	I would love to buy at $1-$2k my cash on the sidelines is gathering dust.   PS looks like your link is broken.
