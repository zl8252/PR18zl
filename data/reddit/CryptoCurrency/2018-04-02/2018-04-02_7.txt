That they'd get some free money? Seems to be the major problem with cryptocurrencies at the moment. People really expected to have that december run to happen every few months and to make a quick buck. That's not how investing works.
1	1522655968	2	Well OP explicitly cited “lambos and moons” which were words literally thrown around this sub daily 4 months ago. Nobody in investing is anticipating their stock portfolio to “moon” > 1 year, so it’s safe to say that a quite loud layer of this sub was irrational, delusional, or had crypto as their first form of real investment. But kudos to everybody I **do** see in here doing the research, hanging on, and *investing* wisely. They will see great gains in the next 5-20 years I feel. 
2	1522657574	2	I agree that being invested for upcoming 2-5 years could potentially be very rewarding.Realistic people know this isn't a 3-month-get-rich thing. People saw the succes story of BTC going from mere cents to ~20k, however forget how long it took to get there. I woildn't be surprised that +90% of who bought in were expecting some massive gains within months.
1	1522623110	-5	How does investing work?
2	1522627499	4	Win and lose but there's no infinite growth either. With a normal equities, a few percent above inflation a year is acceptable. If I look back at some of the wins and losses i've made historically.- tech did OK. 3x to 10x, but the 10x took 8 years and I was lucky with timing - in hindsight I shouldn't have diversified as much into other areas and stuck mostly to tech as it's what I understand- energy stocks ... meh... lost overall. Some OK gains but a couple went to zero- mining. always stayed away as it's a shitshow except for a couple, but no major gains either- DOW... not many more gains overall than a good bond. Some wins but the losses flatted out (mostly around 2008)Tech was the best overall gain. Had I thrown more into ones like APPL or GOOG I would have done much better in hindsight, but instead diversified with varying results. Ones like NVDA were countered by a disastrous decade for AMD, and ho hum results for ones like MSFT and INTL.Overall came out ahead, so I'm not bitching.Crypto is still just in the first inning. Much more volatile, and I firmly believe 80% of these projects will drop off the earth, but the one's that make it will be huge. I'm mostly into lower cap alts now, but salivating at their potential futures.
3	1522641150	5	Honestly, being in mostly low cap alts is not the way to protect yourself from the assured 80-90% clearing of shitcoins imo.
4	1522656959	2	Depends on what you consider a shitcoin. :) I do have holdings like NEO, XLM, BNB, etc. Used to have a fair amount of NEO but now re-positioned to other alts during the dip (and got out of bags of it around $130, so much more than what I got in at).But also very long on ones I think had terrible timing and just came out at the wrong time. Low cap I mean $30m to $200m. Really excited about NCASH, NULS, ITC, MOBI, ONT and GTO. I don't expect any of them to be the next ETH but I think each have a niche and lots of potential. Oh, and UTNP. Cheap as chips... 
0	1522614516	57	Same. Guess we're the only 3 still buying. Lol
1	1522641888	8	I just bought some REQ.
2	1522653762	4	On that REQ train too. 
1	1522615222	6	So good. Lol
2	1522618873	8	Nah dude, i am also buying but at predetermined prices (btc 6k, 5k, 4k) I will liquidate my btc in alts when the market is gaining. I will pull out when I have my 70K goal of paying of my future student debts. It’s a gamble for me because countries and governments can really fuck this market up if they had reason too. I hope for the best but prepare for the worst hope you guys do the same. One side note if you lost more than you wanted to let your coins stand don’t check the value for a year and then come back. I hope that everybody can profit on this amazing technology!
3	1522633699	1	Me too. I have been buying each dip. Most of my spare money goes into it. No doubt in my mind that crypto will be the norm in 5 years
1	1522641229	1	Now we're 4

0	1522621701	50	In Game of Thrones there are many references to young soldiers excited for war, who have never having experienced a truly harsh winter. They have no idea what depressing and brutal reality was heading their way. The ones that eventually experience and survive those wars and winters, they lose their youthful shine and optimism. They become more somber, hard humans.  You are still seeing the December Lambo Moon buyers, they've just gone through changes. The ones that have survived this far, anyways.     I'm with you, by the way. Still buying. Averaging down and investing in things I've had my eyes on for a while. Pacing my investments far apart, without FOMO or FUD, but with a calm and more calculated demeanor.  Good luck to you.
1	1522625653	28	Crypto and game of thrones? What is this, a cross over episode?
2	1522631131	12	Man this subreddit has gone too far comparing crypto going down to people who got scarred in war wtf
3	1522633195	17	Welcome to the West in the 21st Century; no personal experience of conflict means people are unable to put things in perspective. Clean food, water, air, rights, access to work, no physical oppression, free from disease etc.Yeah but fuck that, my crypto investments have tanked 70%, **I've seen shit man** *I've been through it man*
4	1522634496	2	Bro my girlfriend came as an immigrant from Korea but her grandmother was a North-Korean escapee..Stories I've heard put literally *everything* I've gone through into perspective.I recently got a concussion and lost a top notch internship that would really have launched my career forward this summer.. And I *still* can't feel sorry for myself after what other people have been through.I posted my first comment as a joke, but it's actually really sad just how much it rings true.
5	1522637664	2	Similar story here mate, been living in China for the past few years and always love chatting to old people. They talk about the horrors of the cultural revolution and living in absolute poverty and oppression, probably very similar to NK.I can't stand this subreddit any more because of the amount of privilege and lack of perspective most people show.
6	1522640971	4	I mean, you really have to consider that suffering is completely relative. That doesn't take away from anyone who has suffered immensely, but in some circumstances, being down 70% (for someone who invested waaaay too much or needs it to live) is traumatic. For example, if the worst thing someone's experienced is chronic depression, or losing a loved one tragically before their eyes, for them, that actually is the worst it's ever been. In many ways it's psychologically on par with what others that experience "true horror", or however you want to describe it feel. The human brain adjusts incredibly quickly to emotional extremes, and it's not your place to judge how someone feels. It's like when people tell someone with a mental illness "it'll get better", yet they literally cannot know how that person feels at the time. Just some food for thought.
7	1522641818	1	I get what you're saying about only being able to relate to personal experience but perhaps my point may not have been explained properly. Learning, understanding and truely being sympathetic to what other people have gone through should be a way to negate a lack of experience. I have never suffered mental illness but have been directly affected by it through relationships and family - reflecting on this I am able to put my own health and fortune into perspective. This also extends to hearing stories and reading about the events of the past; most people are aware of how things were during WWII (for example) but are still complacent about their health, rights and freedoms.That is my grievance
8	1522648037	2	I totally get where you're coming from as well friend; I believe many of the problems we face as a society could be helped if more people made a concerted effort to learn as much as possible, in addition to being more sympathetic to their fellow humans.That said, as a student of history (and I was kind of referencing this with the "horrors" and immense suffering in my last comment), I realize that in some cases there's only so much that learning and trying to put yourself in someone's shoes can do. When you know people were literally reduced to lard and turned into candles; babies torn from their mothers hands seconds after stepping off the trains - in some cases thrown onto fires; when you see the actual images of the pits full of bodies outside the camps; you know humanity has no limits to its cruelty. Yet at the same time, you can't truly understand, not ever. And so problems in the developed world; be it mental health, a horrible breakup, a life-ending investment, something like rape or a family tragedy, are often (at least in terms of brain chemistry) quite similar. It's really crazy to think about, but there's a ton of studies out there on topics relating to stuff like this that are great reads. It's wild, but there are a ton of investors, both in traditional finance, and crypto, that have ended their lives due to substantial losses. Whether they were acting wholly logically or not, or whether there may have been a future rebound isn't really of great importance, as that's how they felt at the time.By the way, (on a somehow lighter note) I'd suggest checking out Survival at Auschwitz and If Not Now, When? by Primo Levi, and Night by Elie Wiesel. All amazing books that help showcase the extent to which people suffered throughout WWII.
2	1522647646	2	Well, they did foreshadow that winter was coming... y’all should’ve listened.
2	1522650473	1	Death cross over or golden cross over? 
2	1522691265	1	see r/ravencoin for more crossover episodes.
0	1522614857	16	Well thats why most traders lose money. Not that easy to buy when there is actual blood is it?
1	1522632001	5	I dont have the money to buy, but im not selling for years and i barely even look anymore.
0	1522631515	12	I swear that I've read this exact post at least a dozen times this week.
1	1522638986	5	See a lot more posts characterising people complaining than actual complaints.
1	1522642161	0	I suspect it's Astro turfing.
0	1522636287	26	Price high:  "oh I wish it would drop so I can buy lower..."Price drops:  "omg why is the price dropping I want it to go up oh please please...."Price goes back up:   "damn why didnt i buy when the price dropped.... please just drop one more time... i will buy the shit out if it!"Price drops again:  "no god why another crash... fuckin whales i hate this manipulation......"
1	1522677283	2	Exactly this
0	1522635088	6	 Yup, people were begging for the prices they are now crying about.And I just put more fiat in.
0	1522623069	7	I'm buying, but I've been in since July, so I haven't been down since August. Even after this crash I'm up 2x, and taking maximum advantage of the new buying oppurtunity. 
1	1522630358	1	How are you only up 2x if you’ve been in since July? Saying that, it’s nice to see someone who’s been involved since before December, seems there’s barely anyone on here still in profit.
2	1522631720	2	Yeah, I don't really understand being up only 2x if in since July unless it was 100% in Bitcoin. Some of the altcoins went up 15,000% from July-Dec.
2	1522638268	1	I bought btc at 2700, and now it’s 7k, so maybe closer to 2.5x but whatever 
3	1522639107	1	Fair enough.
0	1522629725	3	Picking my coins with precision, think after this market gets settled shitcoins will keep dying off while the coins with real potential live on. Happens every now and then just brace yourselves never a dull moment in crypto lol no balls no glory 
0	1522664117	3	People have been buying the 'dip' since BTC left the 20k mark. All the way down to 5k. And then it went up to 13k again and dipped to 5-6k again and people kept buying that dip.After a while of buying dips the people who actually can/will buy those dips runs out of money. And sure there are a big percentage of people who are now too afraid to buy any dips until we start to bull again.But that's why that quote and similar ones work, buying in bear period is tough.
0	1522636508	2	I am buying as well and I will keep on buying :). Just that back in fall I had more money that I wad willing to lose. 
0	1522653648	2	December buyer here. Bought and watched everything drop ~70% in 3 months. Fuck it. I'm in this for life. 
0	1522617475	4	The truth is even Mcafee is sh*tting himself :D
1	1522634777	3	how would you like it prepared, sah.... poached or fried?
0	1522616358	2	I’m with you! Buyin that dip like bitcoins going to a million
0	1522616474	2	I've bought every time eth dropped by a hundred starting at a thousand. I'm way over spent. Just gonna chill this time. If eth goes to 100 maybe I'll buy more. 
0	1522621747	2	10 dollars for btc 😥if btc  goes  below   200 I think something is very wrong  
0	1522643407	1	currently buying, every paycheck. Dropped 2k on eth about 2 weeks ago, as well, kinda on the fence about buying some tokens now or later, probably now. Not touching any more BTC, too technologically behind, and i already hold enough in case it rises again. 
0	1522643967	1	Amen.
0	1522650321	1	As a buyer from early last year, I'm buying and averaging up. 
0	1522653528	1	I'm waiting patiently....bitcoin  @4,000 I'm buying
0	1522686403	1	I'm still here... $XXX.^XX into my crypto's of choice twice a month like clockwork.Nothing changed for me but how much I can get with my bi-monthly allotment.Doesn't feel good, doesn't feel bad. I'm hoping my calm and rational outlook pays off in a couple years and for the most part dollar cost avg.'ing never killed anyone.^(As far as I know)
0	1522686826	1	Cant invest more even if I wanted to, without switching banks. Even my credit union doesnt allow crypto purchases
0	1522614547	1	Hahaha you are a legend
0	1522615544	1	still here aint going 😎
0	1522615614	1	Wait for $100 to buy tho 
1	1522619135	2	Haha if it goes down that far I hope to be already out😂 
0	1522616292	1	Yup. Still loading up every chance I get!!
0	1522623747	1	Waiting for what I believe is going to be the bottom. Still think we have a ways to go, BTC 5000-5500, ETH 250-275 but if ETH has sustained levels above 400 for a couple days I may put the rest of my money in. 
0	1522630752	1	>I wonder where are those 500Bn dollars of people which were mad for the Lamborghinis.They sold their crypto and bought lamborghinis.>in fact I feel like I’m the only one buying, anyone else with me?Not quite yet. You're pissing against the wind. 
0	1522636440	1	>I wonder where are those 500Bn dollars of people which were mad for the Lamborghinis.It's worth noting that $500b market cap decline != $500b dollars taken out of the market. 
0	1522636441	1	I don't own a single coin right now.  No point.  I'm waiting for the dip.  I'll buy and hold til it runs out of gas.  Rinse.  Repeat.  It's not about masculinity.  I'm just trying to make money.  Those of you that talk about this like it's some kind of battle watch too many movies.  I'm all for green sticks all day every day but I know that's not possible so why not put in a little work and learn how to make money even when the market sucks?  It is possible.  
0	1522673950	0	In the current price region, I am not buying or selling a lot. I can see BTC go down to nearly $3000 or bounce and reclaim $10K. Either way, I am waiting till it declares itself.Personally, I think $7K is hilariously overpriced for the lack of utility value BTC has.
0	1522613958	-5	I'm buying too. Now is the worst time to stop (assuming you buy coins that have a product). Fuck BTC though. 
1	1522614293	7	The irony in your comment
1	1522629669	4	Your comment is bad and you should feel bad.
0	1522638279	-1	You know that quote about buying when there's blood in the streets...that was about real estate.
