1	1522666236	102	Perfect explanation of the market. 
2	1522686350	19	This is how I feel. Threw in 4k this year, that's worth 1k now -_- can't wait for the market to recover and laugh at this time in crypto history. 
1	1522676874	18	What you got to do isPut it inTake it outDouble in
2	1522679273	1	I've seen this before.
3	1522685919	2	Get dumped onGladly buys low when it goes sidewaysFind out how low it goes!!!!
1	1522671625	29	You got so poor you even lost a C.
1	1522685855	2	>2018- put money in any coin and become poor.Can confirm, as of yesterday I'm down ~70% on my original buy-in USD value. Thought I was intelligently dollar cost averaging by spacing out my buys but it turns out I was just dollar cost averaging across a couple-week plateau at the market's peak.
2	1522689851	0	Even though I made out good already , watching the 15 grand I left in crypto turn into 4 grand isn't cool .    I could of payed off property taxes the entire year with that much , or threw a crypto theme party with cocaine and escorts
1	1522676988	1	Pretty sure that's correct.
1	1522684663	1	i put my money on sureremit, and i became rich, april 2018. no joke. bought in at 1c, and now it's 3.5c whammagonnado.
1	1522688306	1	2018- a hell of a year in crypto history, but the coins that will survive are surprisingly the realers!!
1	1522689744	1	Unless it was December 30th 2017 lol
1	1522689248	0	Perfect explanation of how the bubble is about to burst and everybody will be triggered to find out 99% of coins are scams
0	1522645730	439	Holy shit what the fuck. I'm outrageously jealous, but congrats to you. 
1	1522646239	144	Thanks, I just wanted to share this for so long. Lol not mesnt to make anyone jealous.  It was just too good not to share 
2	1522646607	21	Lucky you. Make good use of that money!
3	1522674464	4	buy a multi-family rental property, invest this as a downpayment....
4	1522686510	6	Buy another family
4	1522688871	1	My man... Exactly.  If you buy a house you are reliant on one renter.  If you buy a multifamily property, let's say a 4plex. Now no matter what you have monthly income. Use it to live, use it to invest with, whatever who cares. 
2	1522682659	1	Hey Its Me Ur Brother
2	1522690436	1	Good job man, I envy you, but wish you the best, you made smart moves ;)
1	1522671322	14	Not so happy story: I opened my xdn wallet and somehow 1.6m DigitalNotes were deposited into my wallet. I have no idea how they got there. I talked to the "developers" who thought there was something wrong with my computer, and that i needed to go hang out with friends for a while. When i came back, it was all gone. Thanks developers. 😚Lesson: never do anything with digitalnote. It is a corrupt coin, or I just happened to be talking to the wrong people. Either way I'm not ever touching that stuff again.Proof https://ibb.co/e7cWEn
2	1522677594	5	Interesting...  So the devs can edit balances huh?  What does the block explorer say about your addresses?
3	1522681033	6	zero. It doesn't even see any transactions.
2	1522678402	4	Shoulds transferred and sold it all! 1.5btc man
3	1522681070	1	I was naive then. I assumed that it was safe in my wallet and that xdn was going to go up. Also, it was worth about 70k when I had it.
4	1522682548	1	damn :(
1	1522681559	1	Well that's not free That is some decision making skills u got their Ppl whi make good bucks here need those and offcourse presence of mind
1	1522671062	0	Good for you man, hope I find similar luck :) 
0	1522655254	206	“um um NO NO NO!”Who did the voice of Carlos ? 😂
1	1522666102	20	Upvote for Carlos. 
2	1522689675	1	Who’s Carlos?
1	1522682275	7	Yes word is not anymore iz used to be um um no no no
1	1522677858	5	*"My wife still doesn't believe in me!"*
1	1522675791	1	"The world is no longer how it was!"
1	1522676874	1	That's totally how I read it haha
1	1522677102	1	Mandatory
0	1522650813	397	So you turned $50 into $55,000?? Damn dude, I'd give my left nut for this to happen to me! Would solve about 77 of my 99 problems right now. Now you just have to do it again with the $55k into $500k lol.
1	1522655090	202	When you really think about it, *would* you sell your left nut for $55k?
2	1522664134	29	having already paid for a vasectomy I might even go lower
3	1522669267	4	I was going to say this!!  I mean they are pretty much for show only at this point anyway :)
4	1522679674	6	They create and regulate hormones ... I thought
5	1522681700	5	They. You only need the one...
6	1522687347	1	One huge one.
3	1522679977	2	That's not how that works, vasectomy just cuts off the sperm, your balls still regulate hormones and stuff. Also, the vas deferens aren't technically part of the ball, they lead away from it. 
4	1522683322	3	I don't care, for $55k you can still pick your ball
2	1522656718	42	For the average worker, thats about a 1 year salary. So probably not :).
3	1522661905	30	55k in 1 year salary is a lot different from 55k in cash.  It would take the average worker making $55k years of saving to reach that amount in spendable cash, and that's assuming they are actually saving diligently and not accumulating debt and buying stupid shit, or have some catastrophic event such as a natural disaster or a health care issue that ruins them.
3	1522662332	51	> For the average workerWhere? In USA maybe. For me its around 6 years of salary.  In many countries that would be more than 10 years of salary.
4	1522678653	1	Americans have higher wages, but spend a lot more on health and transportation.
5	1522685529	2	Don't forget about rent/real estate, especially where salaries are the highest.
3	1522669974	9	I made 70k a year right now and no doubt would I sell my left but for 55k. Cash in hand and doctors appointment paid for i will call my girlfriend to drive me there right now
4	1522677947	8	damn you guys really don't value your nuts. 
5	1522686469	1	you only need one. the remaining one usually compensates for the missing one by producing much more.
6	1522688655	1	> by producing much moreI learned something.You also need a back-up nut in case one nut is corrupted. The Dev can't help you if you don't have a back-up.
4	1522689056	1	Okay now here's the real question. How much for both nuts?   
3	1522657479	13	When I had a "real job" I only made $12,000 a year after taxes. So that's like 4 years w/ some spending money! Lol
3	1522663559	3	That’s actually more like two years salary after tax. I would definitely sell my left but for that money. Edit: not fixing it 
4	1522672591	5	55k is way to much for one butt. I can rent a butt for like 30$/hour.
3	1522666151	4	Actually no, it’s not. Maybe closer to an average college graduates salary. However, salary is a lot different from an untaxed gift. An average post grad working citizen will save maybe 500 a month. So, that’s more like 7-10 years of savings. 
4	1522668296	-1	Uh, preeeeetty sure he has to pay taxes on that.
5	1522674988	2	That’s not the question. He’s not getting 55k if he’s paying taxes lol. Left nut for 55k. Not left Nut for 55k before taxes lol. 
6	1522675110	2	Oh yeah you're right. I was just skimming through and thought you were talking about the original post. my bad.
3	1522657052	1	The average worker wouldn't partially reinvest that in other moonshot projects :>
3	1522662192	1	In the US, maybe.
2	1522657365	3	I mean probably not at the end of the day. Maybe if it was a lot more but that's another conversation. Hah
2	1522663790	3	I would 100% if It was done by a proper medical professional.I'd also be allowed to legally go onto TRT (Testosterone replacement) and be much much happier with the world.  
3	1522663891	4	If you sold both you could do all sorts of crazy WCGW stuff without hurting ya' balls. 
4	1522664259	14	Could also use the missing ball area to keep my Nano Ledger S !
5	1522689191	1	Need /u/awildsketchappeared to post a sketch of some dude plugging his junk(hidden behind boxers) into a computer.
2	1522675595	3	What if you already lost your left nut? Asking for a friend. 
3	1522682543	0	Then his remaining nut is technically (also) a left nut. Price is the same. Decide. 
2	1522670919	2	I've had a vasectomy so i would happily sell both for $100,000. That's a $10,000 saving for whoever buys the pair. Imagine sitting down and not catching those fuckers? I already have 4 kids so no need for any more unless they moon then in that case i'm well up for adoption.
3	1522683266	1	Thats like saying you dont need a liver anymore because you're eating gluten free. 
4	1522687387	1	The thing is tho, my testicles are doing very little for my body besides helping with testosterone and aesthetics. So while i would miss them $100,000 would provide enough money to buy a 4 bedroom home in the UK (deposit on mortgage) which is pretty much my only goal in life right now besides staying keeping my kids safe happy and healthy.
2	1522673279	1	Am I aloud to have a prosthetic testicle?   Is this gonna be done by a surgeon or with a steak knife on a bar stool?  Can I have a lifetime of human growth hormones and monthly testosterone injections?   When i was 20 i would say no.  being 40 in debt, i would say 'maybe'
2	1522677097	1	Yes. Without a doubt.
2	1522677602	1	Yes.
2	1522680349	1	In a heartbeat
2	1522686632	1	Your right one produces twice as much when you lose your left
2	1522687244	1	Absolutely. 
2	1522659373	1	Thats 2 years salary for me. So probably
2	1522660414	1	Well... I am a student who earns only minimum wage, $55k for my left nut sounds pretty appealing haha.
2	1522663410	1	i actually looked into it, and it turns out that was just a nonsense facebook rumor.
2	1522665468	1	I actually would. If you came up with $55000 USD for me, you could have my left nut sitting in a jar on your mantle.
3	1522665513	3	Please don't sell your nuts for money. 
1	1522666024	19	Some suckers turned $50.000 into $50 though to make this happen.
1	1522653003	33	I cashed out already.  And 50 in Nano would of gotten you $300,000 when nano was over $30 lol it was nano was .007 each once.   Even if you held till now after rhe crash you'd have $55k Nano moon was almost as good as BTC lol 
2	1522667764	7	Xrp would have got even more no? It went like 35000% last year. 
2	1522673620	1	Sir, When private group sir?
2	1522666479	1	almost? really almost? 100x increase 
3	1522668251	4	BTC has gone *well* over 100x
4	1522676673	2	The time frame for nano's moon was unprecedented.
4	1522674244	1	in a month?
4	1522677178	0	#XRPTheStandard
1	1522678067	4	Yea it’d cover about 55 of my 82 problems (student loans) 😅
1	1522663935	3	Is a bitch one?
2	1522669939	3	22
1	1522657500	4	What problems do you have right now that could be fixed by 50k?
2	1522657909	10	A lot of it revolves around the fact I own a small business. I won't bore you with the details, but i suppose that's the life I chose. I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually. I kind of look at it as a short term sacrifice for a long term gain.
3	1522669971	2	What kind of business? Anything online you can market on reddit?
4	1522670704	4	Yes, probably in many different ways, but the people of Reddit are picky about how you promote your stuff. Ya can't just go shoveling product down their throats, shilling left and right. Haven't cracked the code just yet.
2	1522659730	4	When you asked, i thought about it, and the answer is: none.At most i could buy off my car for 14k.It is not enough to buy an own flat.I don't have any dept.50k would literally just give me security to fuck around for a bit. (like traveling and throwing money out the window)I think it's sad how 50k is a ton of money not able to change a life
3	1522670276	2	Well quit throwing money out the window and make it work for you instead.
3	1522660011	3	It can if invested properly and compounded over time. Just can't touch it for 20-30 years
4	1522666289	3	well, ok, i thought about short term. Like "which problem would it solve NOW?". throwing 50k in crypto or something long term will/ could be a life changer in future, that's true
2	1522676715	1	Medical debt for sure
1	1522665488	1	ready to give me your nut in exchange for 55k?
2	1522670540	1	Let me have a kid or two and then we can talk after they're not really needed.
3	1522686850	1	oh sure! I can wait
1	1522674821	1	Do you have 99 Problems but smartcash aint one
1	1522678976	1	Would you sell your left nut if we crowdsourced $55k in doge?!
1	1522680816	1	Trey would give his left nut just to be able to play YEM every night.
0	1522654385	150	> Also, my wife was telling me, "you gonna lose all your money"> I said, "um um NO NO NO!"Das a scam!You are very financially independently. The world is not anymore the way it used to be.
1	1522661632	28	Whatamigunnadooo???
2	1522666131	5	WHAAAAT!?
1	1522661327	21	My wiffffe doesn't even believe in meeee
1	1522673280	7	DISCONNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECT
0	1522650396	89	Short version?
1	1522651977	295	He was moving his stash between different alts during a huge hack (where someone “minted” tons of coins). The devs froze everything and in the end in order to undo the minting, they had to recredit everyone double what that or something. Somehow this happened to him on every transaction so his coins all got doubled multiple times landing him $55K between his different coins which he cashed out and paid his debts.Edit: Only because people are asking; you can use Cointippy to gild or tip using BTC or if you prefer more direct BTC tipping:1LxGw3doBJgKKkhDpVCTGY9dv21C4EsWWy: )
2	1522652854	62	Any way to gold a comment? That's a perfect short version. 
3	1522656437	163	Click on "give gold". I'm sure you can afford it.
4	1522661877	42	Give an alt-coin. I'm sure somehow you'll get it back

4	1522673207	4	Savage
3	1522667808	3	hoping this is not a clever way to shill SmartCash. because i bet after reading this people will google and buy smartcash XD
4	1522682583	2	I had the opposite feeling. If SmartCash was hacked and the coins were doubled and thrown around like nothing then I don't feel confident in the project. It's moon must've already passed. The 25% wallet interest is ridiculous too.
3	1522677250	1	srsly.
3	1522678676	1	You can use Cointippy to gold or tip using BTC or if you prefer more direct BTC tipping:1LxGw3doBJgKKkhDpVCTGY9dv21C4EsWWy: )
1	1522651988	20	A hacker duped Smart Cash like how in Diablo 2 peopled duped Stones of Jordan.He tried selling them across many exchanges. Every exchange and his web wallets kept rolling back/crediting him for smart cash tokens he had there temporarily. He went from 50 dollars to 55000.
1	1522653288	0	he's rich
2	1522673908	3	50k is the median salary for a year of work in the USA. It hardly makes someone "rich."
3	1522676459	1	Think globally. A lot of people in countries outside of the US absolutely consider $50,000 USD as rich. 
4	1522678586	1	Okay... median income globally is 10k. So 5 years salary max. That's still not rich by any means.
5	1522681274	1	What are we even arguing here? 
2	1522671075	1	50k is not rich
0	1522661470	39	> Also, my wife was telling me, "you gonna lose all your money"> I said, "um um NO NO NO!"I'm telling her “Well honey this is real” “No no no no no no, that's a scam!” And I say “But wait I'm gonna go to the banks, I'm gonna get my bitcoins, I'm gonna actually put it into dollars, here they are right on the table!”> However I noticed Coin Exchange low volume they were still paired with DogeCoin at 48 cents each. So... Screw it, I sold 5k for 17cents each, and sent the remaining 12k to CoinEx.Nice to see Dogecoin saving the day once again.
0	1522664530	14	That is going to be a nightmare to tax, isn't it?
1	1522668781	6	Depends on jurisdiction. In the U.S., the duplicated funds would technically be counted as income, same as mined/forked coins.
1	1522690735	2	Not really.  Multiple CryptoCards under my aunts name in Puerto Rico lol. In return I bought her a brand new 60in Flat Screen for 2k, and a laptop/printer for her grand daughter for school.     Shes 88 years old living in the mountains. She will be dead by the time they even attempt to get taxes from her lol.  I saved about 10 grand in taxes.  
2	1522691925	1	Oh god, delete this comment. That's worse than the fucking taxes man.
0	1522663015	68	Free money doesn't exist.Someone lost money to your benefit. In that same hack I presume.
1	1522664920	18	Yeah, but probably in this case was the exchange
2	1522667142	1	Exchanges tend not to lose money, they simply take a percent.  Nope, he unknowingly helped defraud other investors.  Oops.
3	1522668457	16	Wrong. If the exchanges were the ones crediting the accounts (they were), then it came out of their cold storage accounts.
3	1522668650	9	No, this time it was the exchanges that lost money. The duplicate sends were from their addresses. Unless exchanges rolled back the balances on the exchange during the hack (and they would never do that) the 'extra' funds came from their wallets.
3	1522676366	1	So quick to assume you know something that you can't possibly know, and that all the facts point the other direction from
1	1522667570	8	But who? If an exchange doubles your balance, who loses?
2	1522670331	21	Everyone with that tokens lose a little bit.
3	1522677035	-2	If everyone loses, no one loses 
4	1522678615	4	Not true, everyone holding that coin, except him loses a little bit
2	1522668681	8	The exchange. Do the double entry accounting.
3	1522675802	6	Don't know details of this coin's hack, but I doubt exchanges would take a hit for anything that wasn't their own fault. Sounds like what happened is that devs inflated the coin by forking and replaying txs, then asking exchanges to accept the new fork/minted coins. At the end of the day, the hodlers lost thru inflation. 
4	1522681563	1	Without knowing the details of the hack, it's impossible to say what happened. I do have first hand experience with exchanges making mistakes in the users favor, and even coinbase had an error up until november that would allow for balance inflation without the proper deposit (forcing the contract to fail). Maybe I'm biased, but with how immature the crypto exchange space is, it wouldn't surprise me if such behavior a was overlooked. 55k is peanuts compared to the size of some tickets that get ignored for months.
3	1522677005	1	It’s their choice to keep the coin though. They could delist it 
2	1522686733	1	Every investor in future looses money. Exchanges do not really care about highs/lows. They always get their money with fees/withdrawels. 
1	1522670450	2	But in the case of many scammy crypto projects, they're literally printing free money.
1	1522669407	1	unless it is digital money.
1	1522675096	0	> Free money doesn't exist.Sure it does.  Value is subjective.  It is created and destroyed out of thin air all the time.
0	1522659151	10	Moral of the story, checking your blockfolio once in a while is definitely not such a bad idea at all. Hodling, and never checking might not be a good thing m
0	1522645636	15	Wow, that is crazy. I wonder how many other stories like this there are.
1	1522645911	23	Not many.  The frozen transactions at the time were maybe totalling about 0.1% of the total supply.  I was just one of the few unlucky but lucky enough to be shut down during a pending transaction.  All my withdrawals took place with a couple hrs.  
0	1522681009	7	And this is exactly why crypto is not ready for mass adoption yet. Imagine if this had impacted millions of people.. If lots of people got 'free money' you end up with hyper inflation of goods and services.
0	1522681153	7	He turned $50 into $55,000 with this one trick! Wall Street hates him, learn how he did it!
0	1522662633	11	April fool's!
0	1522658965	5	To think that I held Smartcash at that time and did nothing with it...
1	1522680460	1	I held mine on coinexchange so i couldnt sell it anyway lol. 
0	1522673308	5	Send this verbatim to IRS and ask them how much you owe in tax in total.
1	1522674720	5	Brilliant idea.  They will literally throw their arms up in the air and be like wtf?
1	1522678237	3	Despite the terrible weather and existence of chavs, the simplicity of capital gains tax in the UK alone makes me super glad I live here and not in the US. Pay a % on your cashed out profits, simple.
2	1522684152	1	If only it was that simple in the US smh. Talked with my cousin this past week who is an accountant and stays up to date on tax law and even he doesn't know how to deal with crypto taxes cause its such a clusterfuck on regulations.
1	1522676746	2	Lol I think about that whenever I hear success stories. Sounds great and all, but you better be damn sure to pay what you owe in tax at year end. Otherwise it'll bite you in the ass later
0	1522669928	12	If you already turned it to fiat, please please please remember taxes. You owe income and capital gains tax on the earnings. EDIT: Looks like we got bamboozled. This seems to be an April Fools. Still if you're reading this, and something like this did happen to you. Always consider the tax implications. The IRS doesn't fuck around.
1	1522675139	3	Also worth pointing out, that if you need to pay [quarterly estimated taxes](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf), the next due date is April 17th.
1	1522681748	2	nice MEME
1	1522683571	1	What crypto? This guy doesn't have any crypto. I dont't know what you are talking about.
1	1522690856	0	Hell no. Lol accounts under my 88 year old aunt in Puerto Rico.  "I manage her money"  She got hooked up. 
0	1522679682	4	Posting this wasn't a good idea. 
0	1522663567	6	>the team came from DashThere's your problem. 
1	1522679363	2	That's your jealous problem.  The trolling isn't working anymore.  People are forking a new Monero because they are sick of the devs trolling other projects. 
0	1522661078	3	You got a TLDR?
1	1522691421	1	It's an April Fools.... Dude didn't get anything lol
0	1522678772	3	Tldr?
1	1522691417	1	It's an April Fools.... Dude didn't get anything lol
2	1522692139	1	Ah gg thanks
0	1522649756	6	I'm super peanut butter and jelly as well as happy for you!
0	1522645421	7	Haha you are super lucky. That’s awesome though. 
1	1522645752	16	Wrong place at the right time .  
2	1522646392	4	Congrats on the luck of timing. Enjoy it in good health! 
0	1522671135	3	In don't know all the details regarding the hack but it seems to me from reading this that the developers panicked and tried to stop the hack occuring to third currency. Ultimately that caused weird issues like this which only devalue and compromise the integrity of the currency. It's an interesting thing developers have to choose to do or not do. But when you think about it, we are living in pretty absurd times right now that any one can create a currency, let alone so many people out there are unqualified to handle it, not saying smart cash was.Just really crazy what we are witnessing and how scammers and people are making money out of thin air.
1	1522678219	2	In context, it's even worse handling because the same bug was solved by other zerocoin coins by invalidating the fraudlent mints rather than rolling back the chain.  Smart has since removed the privacy mechanism from their coin
0	1522678935	5	TLDR? Ain’t nobody got time for a reddit novel
0	1522664430	6	When anyone asks why I don’t think cryptocurrencies are mature enough yet for widespread use I’m just going to point them here ;)
0	1522656113	2	Love reading these stories! Well done! :)
0	1522659286	2	Some people have all the luck. Congrats you bastard
0	1522666047	2	Well done man, thats one lucky score right there.What is more amazing is that people are actually prepared to sell a testicle for only fifty five grand !!WHats sort of a world do we live in  ?:P
0	1522674456	2	If this is true, you have so many taxes due
0	1522674552	2	Just wanna let all of you guys know this looks like Chinese from an outsider's standpoint
0	1522675488	2	It feels like the devs had a script searching for wallets which made transactions within a certain time frame.  If it found them, it checked for the current balance versus the previous balance, and then credited the difference.I'm guessing this was done a few times to ensure that anyone who effectively lost money due to the hack was made whole.  With naieve or no tracking....Because you were so on the ball here about moving funds, I'm guessing you appeared to be in a deficit that 17,300 coins, so you were re-credited.  Uh, a few times.Anyway, I'm just spitballing but as an enterprise developer who has written a lot of 'hack' scripts to fix a problem quickly, I can totally see how this happened.
0	1522675965	2	Not a bad narrative! Sounds like you did some good arbitrage trading and thought on your feet quickly to lock in some good returns.Really interesting about the rebroadcasts. Nice to see a regular user benefiting from hack prevention. That's certainly a lot better than letting someone malicious run off with the coins.Sounds like the SmartCash team handled it well considering the limited options. Nice you were able to benefit!This is why a governance treasury is helpful for a coin to have. That enabled them to do this by using the team funds to settle the accounts.
0	1522676277	2	This story shows why governance / treasury coins are more resilient and antifragile.Quick, smart thinking on behalf of the mod/developers gave them better choices to handle it.Hodlers benefit and not a hacker. That's sweet justice :)
0	1522676971	2	Does this sound like a good investment? 
0	1522677790	2	"My ripples were up"Oh are they now? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
0	1522678367	2	Well... there is one litte thing. CoinEx never had SmartCash.
0	1522679178	2	Cryptocurrencies can't generate cash out of thin air.All this free money that cleared your debts has to come from someone else.Would that 'someone else' care to share a story? :)
0	1522679382	2	> Yeah you guessed it. They rebroadcasted all transactions also. Yes, I ended up with another 5k in my webwallet, and 10K on Cryptopia.> Yes, Cryptopia rebroadcasted all deposits, CoinEx rebroadcasted all withdrawals , and the web wallets also reset . That's how I ended up with a free $55,000. That of course got cashed out. I'm debt free now lol. Also my original 17k SmartCash is still back. I traded off half of them for alts, then donated the rest back to SmartCash.Well, you're not technically debt-free. You owe around $20000 to the tax authorities.
0	1522679855	2	TL;DR: got lucky
0	1522679866	2	I don’t think you were ‘entitled’ like you said. What makes you...
0	1522681975	2	Cool story, bro.
0	1522684905	2	Legit question:  how the hell do you calculate taxes for this shitshow? Ps:  you stayed diligent throughout-  well done

0	1522691718	2	'there was also this rewards program where you get 25% a month' /facepalm This guy has half of his 'facts' completely wrong and that's not how any of this works please stop reading this nonsense he's likely just making it up for free attention. Go educate yourself and stop listening to kids: smartcash.cc has all the proper information about everything including the hack which affects all zerocoin based coins hell maye even zcash still and noone would ever know. This is why we disabled it permanently in favor of Bip47. Stealth Addresses like samurai wallet has. 
0	1522671115	1	Thinly veiled smartcash advert 🤔
1	1522678092	1	Except what people should be reading from this is that smartcash destroyed their coin's immutability and removed their zerocoin privacy mechanism because they couldn't handle it.  Other zerocoin coins just invalidated the fraudulent transactions and kept developing
2	1522685488	0	From the zcoin hack in February : We also could not blacklist or burn those coins as they have been bought by the market and neither could we roll back as too much time had passed since the exploit was first used. https://zcoin.io/zcoins-zerocoin-bug-explained-in-detail/ please stop making things up the would have rolled back again if they had the chance but since we caught the bug and informwd them before they even knew we were the only ones fast enough to stop him from selling. But by all means keep living that salty life. 
3	1522690641	1	OP is talking about the bug around October.  You've linked ZCoin's february bug
1	1522683061	0	I got the impression that the coin is scammy and unprofessional. Such a high interest rate on a wallet like that is ridiculous and reminds me of bitconnect.
0	1522679250	4	**it seemed like a pretty good idea helping out 3rd world countries****the website was very presentable****I also liked the experience since the team came from Dash**if only I knew sooner in life it was this easy to get people to give me their money

1	1522664509	15	it's the story of luck. Don't think like a child.
2	1522690065	1	Well he didnt have to secure his profits, he could have said you know what I am going to see how high this baby goes. No instead he said let me secure my profits and didn't get greedy.
0	1522667065	2	Have you paid your taxes?
1	1522670219	5	are you the IRS lol
2	1522674943	1	He’s asking because this is a situation where tax code isn’t applicable.  How tf do you figure that shit out
3	1522675867	3	I would just avoid any trouble and claim the rebroadcasted coins as a $0 base 
2	1522686709	1	i am
0	1522679116	2	That's why shitcoin will be shitcoin. Hacked. Coin supply accidentally doubled. Dev Freeze transaction. Dev gave hacker back their stolen coin. Lol 
1	1522691516	1	That's not at all what happened but by all means keep circle jerking to whatever narrative you choose do believe. 
1	1522682164	0	smartcash is a fucking disaster, im glad i got out after the unfreezing and actually turned a profit during the january crash

0	1522664566	1	Oh yeah, this was when the protocol smartcash was using Zcoin was breached. They decided to swap to a different one BIP47 afterwards if I recall correctly?
1	1522668516	2	Yup, they removed zcoin protocol that day.
0	1522667380	1	That sounds so interesting, you must be a lucky guy cause things like that never happen to me.
0	1522668979	1	That’s awesome!
0	1522669210	1	I really enjoyed reading this story....lots of cliff hangers....congrats on the wedding and becoming debt free.
0	1522670202	1	After reading about the wife saying you'd lose all your money and you saying "um um NO NO NO", I was wondering if this was a joke post you made of a fake story about Carlos from Bitconnect.
0	1522670409	1	"The future of money"On a side note, by coincidence I saw the dump of coins live on HITBTC, had nothing on balance, tried to send LTC across to buy, but didn't make it in time. Later found out it was that exploit.  
1	1522680309	1	So their exploit was to lower the price? or because they got hacked the price was going down?

0	1522677615	1	i didn’t get that lucky, but when i bought my Smartcash a whilr before the hack, i did it on HITbtc and since it was worth barely $100, i didn’t bothered sending it to a wallet. so i got to sell the top on that exchange also when others were frozen. 
0	1522677898	1	To the OP:  can you do a TL:DR?
0	1522678088	1	"The price was so low about half of a penny".

0	1522679829	1	Congrats man, I got SmartCash at 30 cents and now am HODLing still. The node payout and Smart Rewards as well as the DASH team is why I got into it but it is rough, wish I got in earlier I guess. I am sure it will go back up though! Are you HODLing Smart still or did you sell?

0	1522687556	1	What are the odds of this happening to anyone.
1	1522689673	1	Like slim to none lol.  Even if someone knew that was gonna happen you only had maybe a 20 min window to be caught in the middle of a pending transaction while they froze it.  The transactions had to be frozen while you sent, otherwise you get nothing, 
0	1522688019	1	You should have listened to your wife ...
0	1522688688	1	$32,000*
0	1522689981	1	Here comes the tax man
0	1522691309	1	And now smart cash is down to 7cents a pop. Hmmmm tempted to be the sequel to the story but knowing my luck I'd get Bittttcccconnnecccttted!!!! Good for you being debt free! All is well that ends well, until you log back onto CMC in 2021 and see SmartCash is $10,000 each, and you sell the story of how you could have been a multi millionaire but didn't think things through... Gonna end my story there before it gets too dark... 
0	1522691362	1	There was only ever one rollback so he's full of crap. The first time the hacker just sold and moved on and the hive team burned thier own coins.... https://forum.smartcash.cc/t/smartcash-zerocoin-related-issues-and-the-path-forward/1359?mobile_view=0

0	1522661890	1	Make sure you remember to file taxes on your gains. 
0	1522668469	1	And this is why we have proof of work. How did you end up with 55k in crypto for free? You double spent because people didn't do their homework. The exchanges gifted you those funds because of their incompetence. Somehow, I don't think this bothers you.
