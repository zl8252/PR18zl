0	1522677193	76	That's actually very likely profitable for the team.
1	1522690970	9	Not for long now that people are aware of the game. People used to mistake his tweeted projects as something he fundamentally saw potential in. Now they know he's just getting paid to say it.
0	1522678287	24	So in reality the "coin a day" scheme was just to get material to justify charging so much because now he can prove every coin he tweeted about "goes up in value by at least 100% with a single tweet."
0	1522673790	250	I would too if given the opportunity. Don't hate the player, hate the game.
1	1522675274	89	Thats easy money. “My thumbs made me $105,000 today. What did your thumbs do?” 
2	1522678984	86	You don't want to know.
3	1522680387	21	its reddit, we all want to know
4	1522686101	4	Trust me you don't want to know.
5	1522689713	3	TELL US.
6	1522690324	6	They tied my shoelaces. There, I said it! ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?
7	1522690391	2	NOT REALLY, NO.
7	1522690933	1	Did not live up to expectation! 
2	1522687667	1	My thumbs are useless. 
2	1522691440	1	who types with their thumbs, other then hitting the space bar?
1	1522680819	24	When the game is shafting people, hating the player is warranted. 
1	1522681316	3	You could get paid to push things you actually believe in...
1	1522687096	8	>Don't hate the player, hate the gameWho came up with this silly proverb and why do people keep repeating it as if it has some sort of argumentative value?No, you can very much 'hate' the player. They choose to be a part of the game. The game wouldn't exist without the players. They are very much to blame for taking part!
1	1522683357	4	I follow him to look at comments. Then I look at who is following him. Then I find the smartest people in the comments and look at who they follow. Then I look at their comments. You gotta dig deep in this shit. Remember... DYOR. 
2	1522689355	4	Is this sarcasm
1	1522684859	1	Yup...everytime when I snag a good deal on several graphics cards. 
1	1522684443	1	But it's unethical. And him not being transparent from the beginning destroys all his credibility. 
0	1522675404	25	I will take .00001 of a tweet.
1	1522688292	1	Binance when
0	1522677476	48	Never trust any bullshit John McAfee knocks outs. It’s pure pump and dump shit.
1	1522679694	27	No way, him getting paid to put out crypto tweets are pump and dumps?! I thought he truly believed in those projects 
2	1522682089	-15	If you wasn’t joking I would call you delusional
3	1522684560	15	if you didn't easily realize he was joking i'd question your judgment.
1	1522682311	8	They dont pump anymore, his shill tweets used to pump coins as high as 80% just seconds afterwards... and all those pumps had massive (unnatural) volume right before his tweet indicating insider activity by the ones who paid him, they were accumulating and waiting to dump at the top leaving bagholders.   I dont get why the SEC asks people to "report crypto pump groups" when the captain of the USS CryptoPump John McAfee runs amok 
1	1522690533	0	What about his prediction? Are you saying it may not come true??
0	1522680664	25	A man who says he will eat his dick for some stupid price prediction which definitely will not be true, should have no effect on crypto. Its crazy for people to react for his lunatic tweets. I would do exactly the opposite of what ever he says for now, as he has no clue what he is talking about. Just pure pump and dump schemes in my opinion.
1	1522681449	20	By your logic he will soon be able to extort projects by threatening to promote them if they dont pay for his silence. Win win
2	1522685974	1	I think he can.
1	1522686696	2	I think it is somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most people know his tweets aren't worth much, but assume that others will think so, so they buy into the pump anyways. Enough people think this, and the pump becomes real.
0	1522679859	4	I think McAfee can eat a dick.... oh wait..
0	1522677604	8	Goes with the profile. The man was a huckster right from the start, he exited AV early, and it was the rest of the crew that did pretty much all work and research anyways.
1	1522679447	17	Back in 2013:"Do you still write code, perhaps for fun?McAfee: I haven't written code in 20 years. In truth I was a terrible programmer. At all the companies I worked at I did everything within my power to avoid coding tasks. I was just good enough though to be able to spot the truly outstanding programmers. At McAfee I hired the best and then stayed out of their hair. If I had been responsible for even a tiny amount of code I fear we would never have gotten off the ground. "https://features.slashdot.org/story/13/05/07/2017203/interview-john-mcafee-answers-your-questions
2	1522679596	6	That is putting what I heard over beers years ago with a positive spin.Well, he founded the company and got off the ground. That much I have to grant him.
2	1522691848	4	All else about him withstanding, that's a valid management style.Identify and recruit talented people, point them at a task and keep everyone out of their hair so long as they stay on target.
3	1522692395	1	That's definitely true and it's very good management style in IT in my opinion. 
0	1522682703	6	I mean, if you buy or sell based on what this crack head is shelling, then you deserve to lose your money.This guy hasn't been relevant for about two decades. 
1	1522684717	4	He was never really relevant.Way back in the days he was successful in hiring couple talented guys, who were not entrepreneur types, and then rode on their hard work, until he skipped out when actual managing would have been needed.
2	1522685042	1	Yeah, I imagine him as a less talented salesmen and scammer than Marc Cuban. 
0	1522678035	2	Damn I'll do it for lessJust give me some $ so I can BTFD
0	1522683507	2	where to i buy TWEET?
1	1522692212	1	On Janicepussy.io
0	1522689870	2	Just so wrong...Especially since so many people actually follow his payola advice that the markets actually moves based on his tweets.
0	1522676024	2	Shill it baby 
0	1522678734	2	not bad, John
0	1522679017	1	So how much did he make to make that prediction?
0	1522682306	1	Everyone should do that.
0	1522688525	1	And the site doesn’t just offer promotional tweets. It offers many services for startups who wish to conduct an ICO
0	1522688673	1	Is there a list of all the coins he's shilled? Would make an easy way to tell which ones are crap.
0	1522690040	1	wouldnt you? you guys sound insane LOLlittle kids are out and about in this sub man woah
0	1522690331	1	We'll he will need some money for dick transplant, can you blame him? :D :D :D
0	1522690662	1	What a f*ckin scam!
0	1522690760	1	I'll tweet for $1. Who in?
0	1522691333	1	What a coincidence, that is exactly what I charge.
0	1522691404	1	And he should- jack ass has to save up for a prosthetic dong after he eats his own on national television!What sad is that people actually think his opinion counts for anything. 
1	1522692354	1	Herd. Sadly there's a wolf to devour them too. 
0	1522691467	1	Bitcoinprivate lol that coin is such a hyped up sham it hurts.
0	1522680526	1	 The computer scientist, often accused of causing financial losses to his numerous followers, seems to have succeeded in his transformation to crypto shiller.
0	1522680024	0	Good for him, at least somebody squeezing out one of the last opportunities to make some good money in crypto
1	1522689516	2	Last opportunities? What are you on?
0	1522688274	0	Anyone who takes that nut job seriously deserves to lose their money.
0	1522688760	0	I knew he is nothing but a shill
0	1522689934	0	The ultimate shill
0	1522690437	0	Can we stop giving him attention. 
0	1522683774	-1	Don't get baited by any coin that McAfee suggests, it's gonna be pump and dump 100%.
0	1522686467	-1	Truly a monumental shite of a man.
0	1522675335	-6	[deleted]
1	1522676585	3	No its not, all it does is cause pump and dumps
1	1522676986	2	How is promoting scam coins doing any good for crypto?
0	1522677016	-12	Fake
1	1522679802	0	Not fake. On the first thread, people thought it was an April Fools but it turned out it wasn't if you're referring to that
2	1522682138	2	He means 'fake' in the modern sense, which is a faster way of saying "I not like! You not believe since I not like!"
3	1522682275	1	I don't think so. I think he just saw the other thread, where everyone called it fake.Edit: [Found it if you're lazy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/88httn/mcafee_selling_his_tweets_for_105k/)
4	1522683126	0	I'm lazy, but I can still manage to read past noted expert 'turpajouhipukki' calling it fake and everyone else disagreeing with him. 
5	1522683723	1	The two first responses to his comment came pretty late into the thread. When I, and probably also the other commenter read, people were mainly saying it was fake (and even now, except for myself it's literally only two people responding it's not fake). (Also note how his comment has much more upvotes, which means people agreed with him)I don't know, man. What about the statement "in the other thread everyone believed it was an April Fools but it was not" is so unbelievable to you that you feel the urge to respond?
