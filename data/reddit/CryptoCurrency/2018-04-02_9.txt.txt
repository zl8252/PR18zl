2	1522678680	4	Hands down would pay money for this.Do you guys accept tips?
3	1522679079	6	Appreciate that. I may be looking to fund the development of further content. I'll release the final version and offer a means to do so at that stage. For now, the best thing is that the teaser gains traction. So sharing is the best and most appreciated way of getting it out there. I'll be in talks with a number of production companies and mainstream networks about the project and view counts mean a lot when it comes to pitching.

1	1522668828	6	Haha, cheers. Luckily, Ripple is one of the few I managed to avoid buying ATH.

0	1522674226	5	Hey hey heyyyy
0	1522676980	3	Release it already lol.
0	1522677487	3	RemindMe! 7 days
0	1522680223	3	Nice!  Can I ask what you shot this on and what your budget was?  I‚Äôve made some small films before an am impressed with your production value.  Thanks üëç
1	1522680637	4	Altogether probably set me back about 6k. I haven't yet added everything up though. I pulled a lot of favours. Everyone was working at a low daily rate. Shot on a Red Raven. Brilliant camera. 
1	1522680296	2	Ditto. Would like to know more about production
0	1522680611	2	Man this actually looks really good. Can't wait to see the whole movie.
0	1522681964	2	Dude this looks hilarious!  Bravo!  Can't wait to see it.
0	1522685738	2	I think I speak for everyone when I say this exceeded my expectations by 1000%. Super well done and ultra professional! Need a bit of satire during this bear market depression.
1	1522686249	2	Much appreciated, and glad to provide a bit of respite. Better times ahead... Hopefully. In the meantime, you know what to do ;) 
0	1522686585	2	Looks promising. I would hold.Hope you get this on Netflix or something. If you do any sort of social media deal geared towards them, I'll gladly help share it.
1	1522686928	1	Thank you! That's something I'm going to be pushing for. As a series, developing more satirical films / sketches based around technology. For now, I'm hoping to generate traction with this trailer. When it comes to commissioning projects like this, views count, so sharing is very effective and very much appreciated. 
2	1522687767	1	Do you guys have a Facebook or anything? This video would rack up the views and build traction fast.If not I will share the YouTube link.
3	1522688653	1	Good point. I have a makeshift Facebook page with a video link here https://www.facebook.com/buythedipfilm/
4	1522688780	1	Gotta get that uploaded to Facebook. Will automatically play in Newsfeeds and show up on related videos.Just trying to help this blow up! I think your film will contribute to crypto as a whole. 
5	1522688901	2	Thank you! I certainly hope it will. I'll get the Teaser file uploaded to Facebook itself later today. 
6	1522689167	1	Let me know when you do! I got a ton of friends that will love this.Also unsure if you do anything with the paid Facebook advertising but that can also lead to a lot of views too. You can choose the target audience by likes/interests. My friend ran a $5 a day at 4-5 days advertising campaign for a product video and got around 2k views. I just checked on it and it was up to 6k views after he quit putting money into it.
0	1522686672	2	Can't wait kilobits done. This looks quality.
1	1522686987	1	Cheers. Kilobits done after next week hopefully ;) uploaded soon after. 
0	1522687695	2	Nice production! 
0	1522687961	2	That was so awesome and the quality rocked
0	1522689000	2	Fuck it looks amazing. High quality content there. Are you working in the cinema industry or is it just a hobby?
1	1522689127	1	I'm an actor and screenwriter. This is the first thing I've directed though. 
2	1522689182	1	Okay that's why it looks pro af. Can't wait for the release. It will buzz for sure :D. Good luck!+/u/sodogetip 50 Doge verify
