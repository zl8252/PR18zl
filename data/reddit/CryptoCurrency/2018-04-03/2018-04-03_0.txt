6	1522764164	22	What has caused us to come to this point? Must we keep going until the whole thing is one shade?I don't see why not...
7	1522765950	23	We need a bot that keeps responding to this bot.
8	1522766857	8	I'm wondering is it against the terms of reddit because it will cause a flood of messages going on in a loop causing a lot of system stress. But I like the idea. We need a bot that can maybe do Needs more JPEG a 1000 times and share the image.
9	1522767745	6	Probably against the terms lol and also not very friendly to the jpeg bot.
9	1522770751	4	We should just get /u/morejpeg_auto to automatically run like 10-15 times then post a gif with each frame.
6	1522765326	4	Needs more JPEG

1	1522772517	7	What's JPEG? Is it a new crypto? Should I invest right now?
2	1522775726	2	It's happening...
3	1522775807	4	I sold all my TRX and Doge for JPEG. Can't wait to drive my lambo to the moon. 
4	1522778904	1	You sold your dodge for JPEG? Is that a new Japanese car?
5	1522779029	1	Wow. Your post is so bullish. Expect a market rise in the next few hours.
6	1522779178	2	Instructions unclear.Going all in on soybeans futures.
4	1522780244	1	I'm going to get a lambo body kit for my Tesla and win before you can.

1	1522763754	14	Old story but we have alot of newcomers.
0	1522755520	247	Rejected 175 times LMFAO, gonna hop on twitter and roast them with this post. Top quality content my dude!Here's my tweet, I did my part:https://twitter.com/JuicyJerky/status/981172181903097856?s=09
1	1522765841	73	what a madlad

3	1522768272	20	Somebody gold this guy. 
4	1522775570	6	I would, but you can't buy Reddit Gold with Crypto yet, and I'm all out of fiat after buying all the dips lately...

1	1522760914	24	Post the link! Fuck JP
2	1522765242	41	That awkward moment where reddit helped me cyberbully a corporation. The world is a good place.
3	1522765280	11	Well deserved! They bullied my wallet!
4	1522777417	3	Oh trust me, the wallet will fuck itself up ü§ó
5	1522777522	1	That's true.
1	1522771775	3	Sick burn!
2	1522775030	2	Thanks! I learned my style from Big Money Salvia.
1	1522773562	3	Damn dude. You stapled their balls with that one. Nicely done. 
2	1522775067	1	I'm savage on twitter. Don't tell my mom. üòÖ
1	1522769527	4	Retweeted lol
2	1522770708	1	Appreciated. I wonder what they'll do if they see it. ü§î
1	1522776057	1	Casual sexism for the win. 
2	1522777003	1	Where do you think the stereotype for the sexualized secretary comes from? I didn't create it on my own.Not sure if you were nagging me about it but now I'm actually curious and want to look into it.
3	1522777093	1	Except that secretaries (personal assistants) are no longer only women, mate. Jesus. Welcome to the 1980s. I don‚Äôt even care. I just thought it was funny how outdated the joke was. A lot of the bosses are now women. JP Morgan included. Hah. 
4	1522777223	1	I know that. It's part of the joke. I see JP Morgan as an out of touch corporation clinging to their archaic ideology.
5	1522777352	1	They have women on their board. And you were making a joke about them being archaic by making an archaic joke for them to ask their ‚Äúsecretaries‚Äù (implying they are all women and would get it)?Okay. Doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. But, humour is subjective. So, my bad. I was just pointing out it seemed ironic. 
6	1522777594	1	Okay let me break it down:JP Morgan has been around so long that people view it as a cartoonishly rich corporation.When you're cartoonishly rich, you have hot female secretaries and live an excessively lavish lifestyle which is commonly associated with the 1980's "businessman" culture.I was basically talking to the corporation as if it was a rich man. "Your secretary will love this joke" is a zinger on how out of touch this "business man" is.
7	1522777884	2	I guess. So, you are calling people out of touch by being out of touch? Like I said. Humour is subjective. No worries. I just found it funny how you put it. It‚Äôs all good. 
8	1522778611	1	It's just the first time so many people looked at one of my tweets. I don't wanna come off as a dick lol.
9	1522778724	1	I totally didn‚Äôt see it like you explained. But, fuck it. Who cares what I or anyone else thinks. You be you, man. You don‚Äôt seem like a dick to me. Unless I was JP Chase. Haha. 
0	1522764150	52	[I'll just leave this here](https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/jpmorgan-chase)  hmmm, which one is a scam now?
1	1522765680	14	That just makes me sick, how can they still be a trusted business after all that. 
2	1522766357	23	They're not the only ones doing it. Those huge fines are simply seen as "expenses" to them because they make more money from doing that scummy shit than how much they get fined for doing it so it's merely a business decision to fraud people.Nothing to see here "business" as usual. 
3	1522771789	5	So...we need to change the regulations to make the penalties higher than the profit for breaking the law. 
4	1522773266	3	Good solution., No great solution üëë
5	1522778301	1	Really? I mean that sounds like a pretty great solution
3	1522766842	2	That‚Äôs exactly why it makes me sick! And that‚Äôs business as usual for most billion dollar companies I assume.
2	1522768932	1	Other side of the argument; they were practically forced by the US government to buy Bear Stearns to prevent immediate bankruptcy. A lot of the fines come from the Bear Stearns legacy deals in the subprime mortgage market, which JP Morgan had to pay for. 
1	1522769509	3	Am I reading this right, Penalty total is 29 Billions?  
2	1522772566	3	If 1000 million = billion, I know it can vary depending on local definition. Then, yes.  That's a vast sum of money. Wow.
2	1522771567	1	No it's 29 dollars
3	1522771848	1	Phew, no wonder they keep doing it then!
1	1522772197	1	Lol! 
0	1522760425	56	JPMorgan is  a scam.
0	1522766846	19	JPeg Morgan
0	1522764400	16	pro-blockchain; anti-bitcoin
1	1522773313	9	Yes. I'm not sure if you're trying to point out some sort of hypocrisy or oxymoron, but blockchain has the potential for many applications outside of cryptocurrency. It's a legitimate view to believe crypto is a scam but see the usefulness in the technology it's built on.
2	1522774566	3	I don‚Äôt think OP was being sarcastic or anything, but probably completely meant what you just said. A lot of people who first heard about crypto kind of wrote it off but still see blockchain as the next big tech. 
3	1522775921	2	Fair enough, my b. Not sure why I read it with a sarcastic tone.
4	1522776993	2	It‚Äôs cool, you still made a valid point. 
0	1522762221	22	Big banks are the true scams...
0	1522753095	14	Hear what I'm saying, don't look at my actions. 
0	1522773893	6	All currency is a scam. BRING BACK THE BARTER SYSTEM. 
1	1522776512	0	WE ALL DITCH CURRENCY AND TRADE WITH SOJ'S (STONE OF JORDANS)
0	1522770521	3	so a business executive is trying to push technology that will make him money and shitting on something that will lose him money?color me shocked
0	1522772957	6	Unpopular opinion: I don't think most people who are calling bitcoin a scam are talking about the payment system but are actually referring to the fact that the coin has no real underlying value or government like backing.
1	1522778101	4	It's not just lack of government backing. Bitcoin has large imbalances in ownership at best or might be considered a ponzi scheme at worst. Mining requires unnecessary amounts of power and is just inefficient and wasteful. The main chain is extremely difficult to upgrade. Transaction speeds and volume are low on the actual blockchain, requiring sidechains to do the job that the main chain should be capable of. Blockchain on the other hand is extremely useful for the public verification of data. I would not be surprised if Bitcoin fails and other blockchains survive.
0	1522762627	5	old story
0	1522765253	2	Jamie Dimon is a scam
0	1522765327	2	Hey I‚Äôve heard about this thing called coinbit or bitsofcoin it was released around 2009 I think it‚Äôs like internet money.
0	1522767025	2	I wanted to make an image macro of Dimon in the top panel calling BTC a fraud, and then him lying on a couch in a psych office in the bottom panel with the therapist saying "Show me on the doll where the bitcoin touched you". Never did though
0	1522767524	2	I think we know what the scam is in this story...
0	1522769419	2	I keep thinking the font will get clearer like when a high res photo slowly loads.
0	1522775995	2	Is this sub filled with morons or is this just part of the bear market fuck the facts and boost morale campaign?Blockchain technology is amazing and JP Morgan trying to patent their own blockchain solutions or even their own cryptocurrency is completely separate from them saying bitcoin is a scam. People who don't understand this lack a basic understanding of technology and even cryptos. Let's say JP Morgan is more interested in global payments with a crypto pegged to fiat or ffs just tokenisation of assets what the hell does it have to do with bitcoin? Nothing!This whole sub is starting to feel completely alien to me...
0	1522776508	2	Goddamn this subreddit is such a joke lmfao
0	1522776795	2	"The bubble will burst" a quote form the same people that thought 2012 was the end.
0	1522777508	2	Think he confused but coin with Ripple...
0	1522777943	2	It's a fraud and a scam and they want in on it.
0	1522778157	2	I am going to tweet this at JPMorgan and their CEO
0	1522762501	4	If it's not yours, then of course it's a scam /s

1	1522777296	1	Yeah, recycling is good for the environment.
0	1522760801	2	This is probably why Amber Baldet left J.P.Mogan to start her own Venture.https://www.google.com/amp/s/cryptobriefing.com/amp/amber-baldet-leaves-jpmorgan-for-her-own-gig
1	1522768822	3	Good for her. When I first saw her, I thought to myself how she could waste her skills for such a bad company. I guess she must have thought the same thing after all. :)
0	1522757273	3	Old
0	1522767831	1	I like how after little Jami shit all over bitcoin he had his cronies buy up a ton of it when the market inevitably dropped. If that's not market manipulation, I don't know what is.
0	1522768162	1	Ah kinda like in Mr. Robot. 
0	1522768222	1	It is, and like many people, he wants to participate in it.
0	1522768839	1	Hahahahhahahaha
0	1522769377	1	Shouldnt this be borderline illegal? Using popularity/media attention to suppress the price while you most likely  are accumulating in the background
1	1522777556	1	> Shouldnt this be borderline illegal? Borderline illegal?  Is that like being borderline pregnant?
0	1522770698	1	needs more frying
0	1522771717	1	This is just the efforts of the blunt and obvious trying to fight cryptocurrency. Who knows what else is going on that's too smart for us to watch.I'm a pessimist, and I don't believe that Crypto is going to get away with openly challenging the financial world. There's some small hope it works, but it is small.
0	1522774145	1	This is exactly like that ecoin guy in Mr Robot.
0	1522774801	1	Someone made a mistake big fucking deal.
0	1522775555	1	The multiple news articles dont really add anything to the case. 
0	1522777495	1	LMAO looks like someone is panicking, lol JP MORGAN you sir are a fuckin turd!
0	1522777505	1	I mean, would you hype up your competition if you were a CEO?
0	1522777743	1	JP Morgan haven't understood Bitcoin properly. 
0	1522779510	1	As a former chase employee! I totally agree!  
0	1522780246	1	>I don't actually understand what he said and possibly the fundamentals of crypto currencies.Seriously, you don't have to like the guy or banks in general but this is embarrassingly stupid. Filing a patent for blockchain tech is not he same as believing bitcoin, the alternative currency, is legit. This is a company with a competent blockchain project team.

0	1522761939	0	Only reason some of these companies are so big is due to patents.  They wait for someone to infringe then sue ... b.s. 
0	1522768573	0	Honestly can someone explain to me what is JPM trying to achieve that is not already achieved by XRP/BTC/ETH? All the other coins specialize in some niche market.
1	1522773062	2	Probably planning to use blockchain for something else. Cryptocurrency is not the only thing that can use it...
2	1522775324	1	"Bitcoin killer" "payment system" "Bitcoin alternative" this doesn't sound like using the blockchain to track anything related to scientific research. 
3	1522775879	2	I'm not talking about scientific research. "Payment system" is more along the lines of what I was talking about. It's conceivable to use blockchain for regular old USD transactions.
