0	1522724271	42	Why would an endorsement from Mayweather be looked at as beneficial to anyone? Isn't he widely thought to be functionally illiterate?

3	1522759110	1	Make Bitconnect great again -Trump probably.
1	1522740076	2	“It’s in the prospectus, Floyd.”
1	1522730753	1	Rumor has it that he keeps all of his money in one bank account.  It’s in the hundreds of millions...
2	1522752316	1	Well he is an idiot

0	1522736803	1	There seems to be a wide level of coordination between several govt departments and even foreign govts to clamp down on ICOs. 
1	1522738798	-1	About time.
0	1522763664	1	Who only could have known...
0	1522774209	1	Exactly what we need....government oversight
1	1522776764	1	I hate it but it is a sight better than community oversight right now.
0	1522778455	1	Who in their right mind thinks DJ Khaled is a good spokesman?  Did you guys watch The 4?  He's an idiot.
0	1522779124	1	Did SteveSegal coin get sec charges as well?
0	1522744692	-1	Here is my proposal:Repeal the Securities Act of 1933.That means no mandatory registration with the SEC to sell a security to the public.Replace it with a new law that creates a voluntary government certification program for securities. Any security that passes the test is allowed to display a seal on their website/promotional-material stating that they are government-approved. Big companies would find it cost-effective to register, because the reputational boost would be worth the expense of getting registered. Small businesses would very likely opt out, given the legal costs of registration, but unlike now, they would still have access to the public capital markets, given registration would not be a requirement for selling stock to the public.Limit the SEC's mandate to policing false advertising, fraud and other deceptive practices, and providing public resources for investors to better appraise potential investments. Educate, instead of restrict. Don't prosecute people for selling a security without registering. Certainly don't try to expand the scope of securities laws to digital tokens, that unlike securities, provide no contractual claims to an underlying asset. Limit police action to those who commit actual fraud, like the people behind this token sale, not the misnamed "securities fraud", which includes activity that is not technically fraudulent.
1	1522750266	1	Where would the States come in your proposal?I could not support anything that erodes a States right to govern itself. The USA is a republic. Securities registration provisions originated in Kansas in 1911 after all...
2	1522763627	1	>Where would the States come in your proposal? States have a right to regulate however they want. 
3	1522765366	1	sweet
1	1522754528	1	>given registration would not be a requirement for selling stock to the public.You do know how corporations work right? A corporation can easily sell shares, they don't need to be on the public market, the investors just have to initiate contact with the company rather than some robot buying their shares at random online.
2	1522763669	1	I mean offer stock to the public, which is a necessary prat of raising capital from the public.
0	1522741149	-2	People on the SEC bandwagon now since they shut down a scam? People always want it both ways, hate on something they don't understand and then praise them the next day. For people who think SEC in crypto is bad are obviously clueless on how things work in the world.
