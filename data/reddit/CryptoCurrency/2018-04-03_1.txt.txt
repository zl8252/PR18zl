0	1522728128	737	I am shocked, shocked I tell you, that a professional Boxer who cannot read was incorrect in his assessment of the value of a cryptocurrency asset. 
1	1522732660	169	But Floyd DOUBLE checked the white paper three times? 
2	1522734378	84	That mother fucker can't even read!
3	1522734956	33	Kinda want an ebook of mike tyson reading white papers now. 
4	1522747946	92	Cryptocurrenthy
5	1522756841	19	You son of a bith.
6	1522759887	2	Careful... He'll bite your ear off
5	1522769558	2	Whereth my lambo
4	1522740701	8	Kinda? That is one of the best ideas for humor in a long time.
5	1522754439	3	Even the mere thought of it has me in stitches. Please for the love of god Mike - just give us one brief explanation of Byzantine Fault Tolerance!
4	1522735463	3	https://youtu.be/XNwoowL2u24
4	1522758228	2	An audiobook is what the world needs
4	1522769804	1	Mike Tyson is actually way smarter than Floyd, maybe crazier, but definitely smarter 
3	1522738994	6	But he's Floyd MONEY mayweather!!! You don't need to read money 
3	1522759870	3	This is my first thought when people claim he is a "genius" (because he promoted his boxing well and made money). He's not a genius. He's athletic and so much of an asshole that people will pay with the hope that he gets his ass whooped. People equate being rich with hidden genius even when you can't read. 
2	1522756350	3	Probably just did ctrl+f and searched "Scam".
2	1522763287	1	His understanding of a white paper is a blank piece of letter paper.
1	1522740215	6	Maybe they did up a special picture white paper for him... 
1	1522736763	13	If you actually believe that any assessment into the project went on than you're incredibly naive. More like "hey we'll give $xxxx,xxxx to say  this on your social media" Floyd: send the check.
2	1522742495	1	They probably gave him coins that he sold when it pumped. Guess the SEC will find out :) 
3	1522762150	1	Like he knows how to do that stuff haha, and I’d say it’s not hard to figure it out, but it kinda is if you can’t read.
4	1522762270	1	I’m not sure why everyone thinks Floyd is some idiot when his entire career and the business he’s created is a testament to his genius.I know businessmen that didn’t even make it through high school but are savants when it comes to money.
5	1522763449	4	He knows his persona, and he knows how to box and how to get a reaction from people. But the fact is, he can’t read. That’s not the same as successful businessmen not finishing high school. In addition to that, I don’t trust someone with for example a carpenter business to understand the crypto space. You can be very successful and smart, but at the same time lack the knowledge needed to understand and use the crypto space. 
3	1522756283	0	What's inherently wrong with that?  They'd have to prove Floyd was complicit in the fraud.  You don't have to understand a product to endorse it via a paid ad, and if anything Floyd's agency would be under fire.  I guarantee (via smart contract), that Floyd won't personally receive any backlash 
2	1522754809	-1	Exactly! And please please don't forget, Floyd is a better business man than pretty much everyone here. These comments look pretty dumb
3	1522763363	1	Really? Is that why he owed almost 30 million back taxes? Mmyes a illiterate genius. 
1	1522739204	2	don't have to read if its worth shit
1	1522732717	1	He wasnr incorrect in whatever they paid him. He gives zero fucks about crypto.
1	1522740927	1	Is this still true of his ability to read or a meme that has just persisted?
1	1522741007	1	It seems like participation of a boxer in ICO is a bad luck: https://www.icoexaminer.com/ico-news/holyfield-backed-1bn-ico-closed-sec/
1	1522760998	1	Magnitude... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c-Q7IGb0czk
1	1522775784	1	Doesn't this make him liable? I think the FTC or SEC or whatever is cracking down on celebrity endorsements promoting scams. This might hurt his bank account by like 0.0001%.
0	1522713317	357	Any crypto tied to celebrities should be at least questioned...  Any crypto tied to Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khaled should absolutely never be trusted. 
1	1522713436	175	You smart

2	1522748464	2	If that passes for smart then I'd hate to see dumb.
2	1522722068	1	smaht
3	1522761744	1	Wicked
1	1522738506	16	You mean taking financial advice from someone who's job is to take blows to the head is a bad idea?
2	1522760041	1	As if you wouldn't accept $400 million to get punched in the face
2	1522739070	0	This
1	1522742239	3	Floyd still scamming people even after retiring.I imagine DJ Khaled posting "Another One" with  a link to a new coin. 
1	1522742778	3	> Any crypto tied to Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khaled should absolutely never be trusted. Good thing I only listen to Paris, lets go Lydian Coin!  
1	1522762973	1	Sportyco is one of them that I found lol has ronaldinho in it
1	1522767753	1	WASA WASA...!!
1	1522768218	1	I LIKE DAT.... I LIKE DAT...
1	1522730074	-28	Actually there is one totally legit Crypto Floyd promoted . that was Hubii Network.   Hubii is totally legit, and pretty massive as far as their close connection with a major telecom service called Telenor , but that's a super long term hold, and the only legit thing he promoted I think.  But I basically get what your saying... Cryptos that are promoted by Celebrities that are legit are far and few between.  True

1	1522734331	-11	Youdindunuffin.
0	1522721091	96	celebrity endorsements almost always make me think less of something tbh.if the product was good, it could stand on its own.  
1	1522732031	8	Yea, but where would Nike, Adidas ect. be without them? Celebrity and athlete endorsements have a place, they can propel a good product to new heights, but if the product sucks, it’s still gonna suck, nothing is changing that.
2	1522734077	54	There's a difference though. Nike pays a basketball player to promote their basketball shoes. Paying a sports athlete to promote a cryotocurrency doesn't really jive. 
3	1522739032	5	What doesn’t jive is paying *anyone* to promote a cryptocurrency. Advertising in crypto through use of celebrities is one thing but it should be abundantly clear that the celebrity is no more than a spokesman, has no involvement in day-to-day activities, and isn’t expected to have any understanding. But unfortunately every time a celebrity promotes something in the crypto space it’s intentionally done as a way to deceive people into thinking that celebrity is actually interested in the fundamental project behind the crypto.
4	1522746644	3	I think at the moment, at least since december, with more laymens looking into it, getting someones favourite sports star to push a crypto is not a bad investment. "Hey my favourite sports star is talking about that thing I only just found out about, fuck yeah Im gonna buy" will be like, majority of people who don't know shit about computers, and don't fact check anything. I'm pretty sure that only a minority of people fact check, it's much easier to share and get those mutherfuckin likes that everyone so desperately wants.
3	1522762517	2	The word is jibe. Not jive. Unless you are referring to its lack of proficiency in a form of outdated african american slang. 
4	1522766554	2	I am
2	1522755667	-1	A wise person once told me that everything on TV is shit. It works pretty well as a mental model.Nike shoes are cool looking, but they aren't good for you. They're terrible for your feet. Best thing for your feet is going barefoot as much as possible.
1	1522746861	1	*cough* EOS *cough*
1	1522724994	-24	That's not how it works. How would you know about a new product without advertising. Reputable celebrities don't really endorse things that are sketchy 
2	1522744482	3	[Oh really?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/896gkd/that_ico_floydmayweather_was_promoting_it_was_a/)
3	1522749706	3	Does Floyd Mayweather seem reputable to you? 
0	1522728514	23	Well we all know he didn’t read the white paper lol
0	1522718022	23	Is anybody here really that surprised regarding the news?
1	1522746822	5	I'm surprised SEC is finally cracking down on crypto coin fraud.  This is good news for all legitimate coins.I wish the SEC stepped in before we hit 1000 different crypto coins, we're now at 1599 according to coinmarketcap.
0	1522743187	12	People who take boxing advice from, say, Vitalik Buterin and crypto advice from Floyd Mayweather, what can I say about you. 
1	1522751349	-2	Did VB push CTR?
2	1522751592	1	Nope. 
0	1522736995	9	Hopefully Paris Hilton’s is still good

1	1522760042	3	Tittycoin won't die
1	1522756185	2	at giving head! ;)
0	1522736070	10	I don't understand how they thought they would get away with this.  Past ICO scams were operated from countries with lax enforcement of laws and/or the scammers carefully remained anonymous.  These guy did neither, and they thought the US wouldn't prosecute them for fraud?
0	1522746254	8	Floyd doesn't give a shit what he promotes, he only cares that he's seen as someone who can promote. He understands crypto about as much as a dog understands calculus. 
0	1522712885	12	i wonder how many more scam ico’s are going to be revealed
1	1522722624	64	Verge: 4/16:18.  Set your calendar 
2	1522740464	10	It's already been pushed to the 17th. Apparently the partner likes releasing news on Tuesdays, I guess it was too much trouble to look at a calender before they said the 16th. 
3	1522740988	6	As the date approaches don’t be surprised if they push back the day a few more times. Next thing you know they announce the “partner” has pulled out last minute. Lulz
2	1522733872	2	may i know why you think verge is a scam? no hating just wanna find out
3	1522734116	37	Im not saying its a scam, but begging your community to raise money so you can announce a partnership is fucking pathetic and shady. 
4	1522734546	7	I see, that does seem pretty fishy
5	1522737255	5	100 percent scam
6	1522737290	2	when you have 98 percent of crypto people, telling you its a scam, it's a scam. BItconnecccccttttt
7	1522760420	-1	Yes, the 95% of kids on here that own 0 lambos know so much about crypto, stupidly ganging up on whatever coin is in the news with meme level thought processes.   0 chance 95% of these lambo holders could be wrong.  It's even dumber when you bash a coin that actually has a working product lol
8	1522760487	0	Lmao Bitconnect have a working lending platform that was a scam. If you won't listen to 98 percent of the crypto community you deserve to be scammed. 
9	1522761379	1	Lol. It's not "98% of the crypto community"...Verge has plenty of supporters so many that they apparently got banned from talking about the coin on this very thread.  So many that over 2,000 people raised 75 million xvg in 4 days.  You are a Monero shill, and mindlessly call things you don't like "a scam", without even understanding what is going on.  I could call monero a "scam" because it has a private ledger and will NEVER be the most used coin in circulation by businesses, ever, or some FUD like that it "hides your money " from taxes blah blah, or any other stupid thing.  That is the level of what you are saying.   And crypto is much more than the cryptocurrency Reddit page lol...where they block certain discussions...and most are teenagers with a combined... 0 lambos.  Mindlessly piling on to the groupthink narrative meme level thinking...gets you no money, and just makes you look unintelligent.   
3	1522734364	30	1. Verge sets up a "crowdfunding" event asking the community for essentially $3million in donations to announce a HUGE partnership, the largest in crypto history (their words). They promise to drop the name on 3/26/18 if the goal of $3million was reached.2. The goal is reached within that timeframe and verge releases a video the next day essentially saying: just kidding... we will announce partnership on 4/16/18. ROFLMAO!
4	1522735147	3	Ahh thanks for the backstory, so dirty on their part
5	1522741069	0	Better go sell your Verge
6	1522741178	2	not a verge holder but have a friend who bought in at 10 cents and he expects a x10 in June
7	1522759256	2	Tell your friend about it. Then he can make his own decision.
4	1522739566	3	While that makes me skeptical I will play a little devils advocate to what you’re saying. It’s common in just about all businesses for companies not wanting partnerships announced until its set in stone. It’s possible Verge has been working on a partnership and got to a crux in negotiations where financial expectations were set out and Verge needed $3 Million raised to meet that expectation. Once Verge got the money the deal moved forward but doesn’t go through until 4/16/18 and it would be very inappropriate to announce a partnership until everything is in the clear. There have been times where a crypto announced a partnership before everything was official and it blew the partnership.I’ve worked on deals where it came to the day to make everything official and then for some reason or another it was delayed. While what Verge did obviously isn’t confidence inspiring it’s no reason to call for the apocalypse.Of course it’s just devils advocate. I say this as someone who holds no Verge and doesn’t understand its core concept, what I do understand is business though. Announcing a partnership early can be suicide for the partnership in *any* field.
5	1522740338	2	Well this was their exact terms. Read the last paragraph I circled. They made it sound like it was a done deal and name would be released that day...https://imgur.com/a/2yyTR
6	1522740491	0	> I’ve worked on deals where it came to the day to make everything official and then for some reason or another it was delayed. While what Verge did obviously isn’t confidence inspiring it’s no reason to call for the apocalypse.It’s not the first time a deal has been delayed to close to the expected closing date. Once again, not defending them just playing devils advocate through some of my general business insight. I’d be annoyed to if I expected something tomorrow and then had to wait another ~3 weeks. I’ve been working on a deal that was supposed to go through first week of the new year and got pushed back to June the day of for reasons outside of our control.I just think to call something a scam because a partnership got pushed back a little overkill. Unless Verge has done some shady or questionable shit before this I feel jumping right to scam is hasty. 
4	1522757178	1	Surprise! Our new partner is SATAN!!!!!    Peace out
2	1522751217	1	Where's that date from?
2	1522734414	-4	I don't think they're a scam. But I definitely don't trust them. The team is probably serious, just very incompetent. 
3	1522737386	9	Lmao. It's a scam.
4	1522768336	1	Possible. It's irrelevant to me tho. Not going to be buying any. 
1	1522712954	10	Technically all of them since none have registered with the SEC. 
1	1522730793	2	It's gonna be easier to count the legit ones.
1	1522738666	1	The prediction I'm pulling out of my ass is that the market will continue to slowly contract until BTC is at least 50% dominance again.
1	1522728781	1	The one that guy from shark tank tv show (forget his name, bald guy) is promoting is definitely a scam. That guy seems like a psychopath and is completely self interested, last person on earth I’d trust. Sad but he will probably make millions dumping his shit coins on the gullible.
0	1522755139	16	Not a bigger scam than the Mcgregor fight.
0	1522734297	5	Anyone taking crypto advice from a person, a person who for fuck's sake may not even be able to read this post, deserves everything coming their way.
1	1522747192	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl3UHdMtlxs
0	1522736178	4	the dude can't read. wouldn't take advice from him on anything more in depth than see spot run.
1	1522762337	1	Well he’s a business genius so I’ll take advice from him on that 🤔
0	1522731409	8	I'm just curious why CTR is only down 60% on the news ...
1	1522739734	6	If no one will buy it the price can’t drop.
2	1522740193	-5	Nobody buying it causes the price to drop..
3	1522740268	5	No.... If nobody buys it the price can’t change. Or better yet, how does the price change if no orders are filled?
4	1522741225	-7	If no buy orders are placed, sellers will lower the price. They're not just going to keep the coins sitting there not selling if no orders are getting filled
5	1522741297	7	Do you understand if there is no volume, meaning nobody buying it, the price can’t change?Once again, how does price change if no orders are filled? Just because somebody lowers their sell price doesn’t mean the price drops. Price only drops when an order is executed. If no order is executed, meaning nobody buying, the price can’t change.
6	1522749430	-1	Assume there is only a single seller (and no other sellers). This seller wants X amount for a coin, so the price is set to X for the buyers. Nobody is buying this coin (no volume), which forces the seller to sell lower assuming they still want to sell this coin. So the seller then needs some new price Z, where Z=X*Y, Y ∈ [0,1). So we now have our new price of the coin, Z, even if nobody buys it yet (still no change in volume), this is still the price of the coin as someone could come along and purchase it from this seller. How is that not the price changing? Unless of course the seller decides not to go any lower, then the price doesnt change
7	1522763324	1	it only becomes the price when an order is fulfilledorders do not make the price, only actual sales/buys at that price
7	1522749875	1	I’m not sure how else I can explain it to you, price does not change until an order is executed; an executed order is defined as an exchange between buyer and seller, volume is required for an order to execute, volume is required for the price to change. In your example no order was executed, that is how that is not the price changing.Please go to investopedia and just start reading about trading.
8	1522751608	-2	I point you to [here](https://www.quora.com/What-happens-when-you-want-to-sell-stock-and-no-one-is-buying-it-in-intra-day-trading), particularly what happens to the market's equilibrium when there are no buyers (hint: it shifts downwards to accommodate! i.e. a price decrease). For other answers see [here](https://www.quora.com/What-happens-if-there-are-no-buyers-during-a-market-sell-off) or [here](https://www.quora.com/What-happens-when-there-are-only-sellers-no-buyers-in-a-trade-market) (although this is not as applicable since crypto doesn't have circuit limits). If you prefer Investopedia, i'm sure you can read about market equilibrium there as well. The dynamics are identical for cypto, or any other buy/sell orders
9	1522751660	1	Holy shit... I can’t help you. Maybe someone else can.
5	1522742624	2	If there is no one to sell to, the price will stay the same. You don't sell to the exchange, you sell to other people.

1	1522757964	2	Thoughts and prayers.
0	1522754585	1	Not surprising 
0	1522755855	1	BITCOIN CASH OR GTFO
0	1522757436	1	I would maybe say that they were just overzealous and moved too fast. However, looking at the Golden symbol they used for their icon, it just screams scam. Never has there been a good coin to use something like that, plenty of shitcoin scummy ones though. That is a strange thing.
0	1522757569	1	I hope SEC will be after DJ Khaled and Floyd Mayweather too,should see them in court.Well trevon and Craig has court cases why not this rich cunts
0	1522758094	1	...which anyone with a brain should have recognized immediately.
0	1522758309	1	It's not just Floyd, so many other celebs have been doing this. I wonder if they even know what is an ICO or cryptocurrency
0	1522758351	1	Lets see what 50Cent has to say about this ;)
0	1522759552	1	Wonder how many other ICOs will pull down their fake teams/partnerships after this?
0	1522762323	1	Uh huh. Would I expect anything else from a bag holder? Bitconnecccttttt
0	1522762605	1	That's why i like Mcgregor.
0	1522764911	1	Well obviously, always look into the team first. They had zero credibility therefore nothing to lose. We are pretty well networked so we only do private sales with ICO's whose team we're familiar with through connections or meetings.
0	1522765876	1	99.99999% of the ICOs are a scam.
0	1522766005	1	i'm glad these scam artists are now getting properly punished. Will be great when celebrities will also be held somewhat accountable. 
0	1522774096	1	*"We allege that Centra sold investors on the promise of new digital technologies by using a sophisticated marketing campaign to spin a web of lies about their supposed partnerships with legitimate businesses,” said Stephanie Avakian, Co-Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement.  “As the complaint alleges, these and other claims were simply false."*Why does this sound like the entire crypto space and this reddit combined?
0	1522776109	1	Interesting that the market is up on the back of this news 
0	1522777598	1	Wasnt that STOX
0	1522777918	1	Sorry but if you invested in an ICO solely on the basis of a picture form Floyd Mayweather, DJ Khaled or Paris Hilton, you deserve to lose it.Taxation on stupidity. 
0	1522778632	1	No! Floyd was in it for the money? I am in utter disbelief.
0	1522714535	1	Khaled sux! He tries too much to be hard!
0	1522741793	1	People in this thread making fun of Mayweather cause he can't read but too fucking stupid to understand what paid content on social media is.
1	1522762496	0	Yea man so many people in this thread calling him an idiot but don’t understand how this guy is a hell of a businessman.Reading might not be his strong suit but that man sure knows how to milk people for money and that’s a skill in itself that I would personally take over reading.
0	1522713034	1	Yea no sh*t. Didn't people know this last summer? 
1	1522726563	1	Yeah, I'd say people knew. Never saw anybody talking about it, no shilling after the main post from Floyd and a decidedly low market cap indicating nobody really cared to buy it. If anything this article is just some comforting closure. 
0	1522727708	1	Buy XVG in two years, it will be on sale for $0
0	1522731914	-2	Looks like people love to be protected by the government, instead of people protecting themselves by doing their own due diligence. People love to be enslaved, which is a shame... 
1	1522750055	0	In the USA we govern ourselves.its a great model. Maybe one day your country will try it.
2	1522751106	-3	No you don't. You think you do, that's the beautiful illusion to make you feel good about yourself. That's what sophisticated slave masters have accomplished, they make you believe that you have choices, whereas they give you 2 choices and you choose and you feel good about yourself. It's laughable that you guys owe $21 trillion, and the super elites will pay non of that, it is you and the middle class. The same thing happens in my country, but not to the same extent as the so called land of the free. 
3	1522765528	1	I spent 17 years becoming a citizen of the USA- biggest achievement of my life.I respect your opinion but nothing could ever take me back to the country I originally came from.
0	1522729778	-1	Floyd can barely read.... I doubt he understands crypto....
1	1522730088	4	In all honesty, Floyd posted on instagram like 2-3 years ago to invest in Bitcoin. He is probably wealthier in crypto than he is in fiat. But yes, he probably doesn't know what its about.
2	1522734394	1	These people are absolute morons. I bet floyds out of crypto right now.
1	1522737135	1	He might be borderline retarded but he knows quick money. I’m sure he saw an opportunity however grey and took advantage even if he didn’t understand it.
1	1522734896	-1	Almost no one truly understands crypto. If you can't rattle off the SHA-2 hash algorithm and DSA implementations off the top of your head then you don't understand it either. If you can't read the C++ source code of the old sourceforge SVN repository for the original Bitcoin then you don't understand it either. If you haven't read the original white paper then you don't understand it either.
2	1522741854	5	Have an upvote wise one!
0	1522726006	0	I hear he’s gonna defend its title. 
0	1522733439	0	It's a good thing I don't get my financial advice from a domestic abuser who gets paid to punch people.
0	1522738936	0	Any more coins promoted by boxers? Nothing says blockchain like people beating eachother up for money. Every time I see people fighting I think, THOSE guys can be trusted about computer technology!
0	1522743307	0	*cough credits *cough cough
