0	1522721675	219	Gotta fill in that roadmap somehow.
1	1522742119	51	should add entries that state "update roadmap"
1	1522758952	13	Q3 Announcment: There will be an announcement on our progress on the Merchandise Store.
2	1522766454	4	Q4 Announcement: Merchandise store launch has been delayed to 2019. 
0	1522728887	132	I guess all those donations were for the partnership with Vistaprint 
1	1522764313	6	Everyone's getting business cards
0	1522720220	170	It's Verge. what did you expect? real development? 
0	1522745938	71	*"maybe this dip will mature the market and get rid of shitcoins"*Today; Verge up 30%*Whelp*
1	1522757574	8	We are all saddened. 
1	1522765476	1	I mean it‚Äôs all speculation... team, white paper, actual released products don‚Äôt really matter.Every few days there‚Äôs a coin‚Äîshitcoins or not, doesn‚Äôt really matter ‚Äî that starts increasing its value through rumors or pumps. Everyone jump on board and after a few days when it‚Äôs high enough the drop starts. If you‚Äôre fast enough you make some money, otherwise ‚Äúhodl‚Äù lol.Then we move to another coin. Repeat and repeat. All the TA and various analysis don‚Äôt really make sense.
2	1522778717	1	They are announcing the announcement of a partnership in 2 weeks. They say it will put verge within thr top 3. Wouldn't even be surprised if they exited. 
0	1522724740	38	Gonna get me a ‚ÄúITS NOT A SCAM‚Äù shirts
1	1522730655	27	"WHADDAMMAGINNADO"
2	1522779292	1	MM MM NONONO
0	1522722331	41	What are the chances that the donations were for t-shirts? 
1	1522735204	-4	We still dont know the partnership?
2	1522751600	-1	It will be announced the 17th, and no, it's not for tshirts
3	1522753397	11	It's for Hats with "Penis" on the front instead. 
4	1522764918	1	this was my first ever spit-take.. well done sir/madame
3	1522757488	1	Are you sure? Seems very plausible. Biggest partnership in crypto could very well mean biggest choice of t-shirts than any other crypto. 
4	1522762103	2	Maybe a lead verge developer is getting married to an exceedingly fat or tall person
5	1522764973	1	What the
4	1522757563	1	Well I guess only God knows
0	1522735472	16	I'd buy some merch. Cool novelty item in the future. I really doubt the merch will even get to me though. That's how capable they're looking right now
0	1522721255	18	Maybe they will succeed in making awesome shirts. They can‚Äôt be bad at everything, can they?
1	1522764859	5	"blockchain shirts", just every shirt sewn together
1	1522742915	5	Holy shit you opened my eyes. Bought 100k.
2	1522765967	1	shirts?
3	1522769430	3	Is SHRTS the next 2FA?
0	1522739963	11	Excited for the Fruit of the Loom partnership 
1	1522743567	1	That's a very quality brand, as a farmer I can confirm :)
2	1522762157	0	I bought some cozy Fruit of the Loom boxer briefs, best money I ever spent.
0	1522727974	8	LiNk in BiO
1	1522739002	3	o7
0	1522751732	11	Pretty weak critic, there are clearly other things on the roadmap aswell. Merch is something people have been asking for so they just made sure to let people know that they're working on it. I mean I understand people have technical concerns and stuff but at this point you're just being petty
1	1522766436	2	Definitely; if this was Nano people would be praising the team for subsidizing marketing and adoption. 
1	1522764376	-3	Merch is important. Cant make the Ponzi work without new money. 
2	1522765170	1	You can't just call everything you don't like the development of for a ponzi scheme. I can absolutely see that some have technical concerns (both misguided aswell as valid) but calling everything around you for a ponzi that you dislike is childish
3	1522765235	2	I read this sub alot, lots of talk about tech of a coin. I almost never hear about the actual tech of this coin. Just the fact that the team doesn't deliver anything. So seeing tshirts is kinda hilarious.
4	1522765683	4	Well in an age where we have etherum tokens without a working wallet as a top 100 marketcap coin verge is far from the most underdeveloped out there. Verge has I2P and Tor integration in most of the wallets and with wraith you can, with the click of a button create stealth addresses. As you can see in the image posted they are also working on more privacy features such as RingCT. Tshirts is just a nice thing to have you know.Btw, hope you don't see this as shilling, I'm just defending it from all the attacks here
5	1522766047	1	I dont mind, nice to see a post about the tech instead of a joke about the creater making an announcement about an announcement.
0	1522731932	9	I don't believe in Verge either, but is it really that bad for these currencies to release Merch and focus on marketing? In the end, it will be those that provide a good value prop + market themselves well that end up succeeding. 
1	1522732948	0	Yeah but as the first thing. It seems really short sighted and like they aren‚Äôt focusing on the real development of their network. 
1	1522737327	2	When your product isnt working as advertised there is a problem with foocusing on marketing 
1	1522757673	0	This just isn't a roadmap deal. You can get someone from the community to work on this really really easily. When it's sitting there above RingCT, it's borderline a joke. That is the advertising they're telling anyone who is paying attention.
0	1522764132	4	Look at the haters lol. We up 38% boys lambo soon!!! Lol
1	1522765524	6	If you make money gambling on it, more power to you, but gains =/= a good product. At some point XVG will more than likely crash 90% and never recover, much like other scams out there.
2	1522766035	1	High, high probability of failure
0	1522740866	10	#Shitcoin
0	1522766308	2	Instead of pointing only that out it would be fair to mention the adding of RingCT. This is great from a technical point of view and it would be weird to not say. 
0	1522740774	3	Well they have to put out something, why not a clothing shop to delay the inevitable. Why develop improvements when you can sell tshirts lol
1	1522752035	7	Both RingCT and Android I2P wallet is literally in the picture. This is the biggest circle jerk of shitting on I coin I've seen in a while."Hey guys here is two ways that we are planning to develop the tech within the next couple of months""Cool""Also since you asked for it, we are gonna make tshirts which you can buy with the coin""HAHHAHA ALL THIS COIN CAN DO IS TSHIRTS HAHHAHAHHAHAHAH.... upvote me plz"
2	1522778521	1	The point is that those things will be delayed and delayed again...
0	1522763771	1	Too bad it's not checked off.  Another missed deadline.
0	1522765511	1	Q2 Finally cancel that unused fitness club subscription.
0	1522767344	1	You guys are laughing but I kinda want some of that merch. Don't you wish you had gotten some MtGox merch while you still could?
0	1522767717	1	ITS JUST A SCAM BRO
0	1522775523	1	when people dont take you seriously as it is and you try your hardest to be the laughing stock in town
0	1522779270	1	Be sure to like comment and subscribe and don‚Äôt forget to download our merch!Link is in the description 
0	1522733705	2	No coin has been as successfully fud'd to me as verge. I know nothing about it besides finding out its a privacy coin last week but i wouldn't  go near the thing. 
1	1522752439	9	Verge is the coin that Reddit loves to hate. There has been some actual concerns but a lot of it is just shit talk. A lot of actual fake stuff was leaked about the coin like when some random dude set up a website with a bunch of random ip addresses and claimed it was from verge users, of course it wasn't but that didn't stop people from jumping the gun and calling it a failed project despite the fact that there are a lot of coins that have proved way less and and still get way less shit.I mean at this point people are shitting on them for making tshirts, pretty pathetic IMO
1	1522749423	-1	If you want privacy, Monero is your safest bet!
2	1522757638	-4	If you want centralised, NEO is your safest bet!
3	1522758461	2	How about USD? 
4	1522758546	3	If you want mass adoption, USD is your safest bet!
5	1522759373	5	If you want ponzi schemes, bitconneeeeeeeeeect is the safest bet! 
0	1522735575	0	Privacy coin. Haha
0	1522743420	1	Excited for the Chuck'E'Cheese partnership.

0	1522738071	1	If I'm not mistaken, Titanium did the same thing with t-shirts after ico. And Michael Stollaire works in both projects. Coincidence? 
0	1522740208	1	It's almost like with most of these shitcoins, the product is you, the "investor" 
0	1522745186	1	Prices are good at the moment. Trying to get rid of this shit with profit ü§òüèª
0	1522759310	1	LOL ^^
0	1522733237	-2	A roadmap with merch is lame.If you guys want merch.. I can make shirts or decals with your crypto logo of your choice.Unemployment sucks brothers.
0	1522747279	-3	Sell out mode. This is really a shit coin.
0	1522751364	0	On the verge of collapse.
0	1522731543	-1	I like how merch is above any semblence of Privacy RingCT would bring to this shitcoin.
1	1522757737	1	They want to use merch for advertisement, but all they're advertising to me with the roadmap is that they could care less.
0	1522739287	-2	That just screams of "we have no substance and no real product to speak off"
1	1522752598	7	They have a real product and as you can see in the picture linked above they are actively developing it further. The community has asked for merch so now they are making official merch. I don't see the problem here.
2	1522757819	1	It's fine, but make it a side project and not a roadmap. If the community is asking for merch ABOVE ringct, it should tell you the type of community they have is just all for hype and could care less about an actual product. I love merch, but it's not a roadmap item.
3	1522758268	4	Totally worth a frontpage spot then, I mean what a disgrace, a project that doesnt follow the exact guidelines of what is "roadmap worthy" to some random reddit people. This is by far the biggest shitcoin I've ever seen
4	1522761084	1	I mean, if you're saying a bunch of random reddit people find it important, then it will probably be a frontpage thing on .....reddit.It sucks because the coin sort of looked like it might have promise, but it rose to fame too quickly and under suspicious circumstances. There are projects out there with so much more going on, less resources, no shady crowd funding, that are worth 1/10th of Verge. Verge has the capability to capture such an audience, yet one after another they have so many shady shitcoin tropes that they do. They could just develop and work on their project, but instead they pay for tweets, and start crowd funds that break every promise so far. 
5	1522763591	2	Good point... got a little passive agressive sorry dude. I don't think it's as shady as you make it out to be. Verge has a working product and is activly developing it and people was hating on verge long before they did the crowdfund. I understand people are sceptical to XVGs take on optional privacy especially since XMR has been the standard for a while now, but I think more of the hate comes from a misguided view of the project.Ofcourse the crowdfund might be a scam and I will stand corrected in a week or two but there is really no reason to doubt it any more than other coins on the market (I would say less actually since verge has been around for a lot longer than a bunch of these smaller marketcap coins). at the end of the day, even if you think it's hyperbolic marketing, verge has a product with a handful of working privacy feauters and are activly making them better... and soon there will even be tshirts ;)
6	1522767390	2	@Hattyman well done fighting the FUD today mate, it is always anti XVG on the sub it seems. As you say who is really sad enough to make a post about Verge having a merch shop on their roadmap and then the ensuing comments about other shit to top it off üòÇ Really gets me every time! Honestly think it can only be fear at this stage, roll on 17th where critics will be silenced or we can eat some humble pie haha 
0	1522751679	0	Makes me think that is the only legitimate entry.
0	1522757559	0	I immediately said this when they were doing the fundraising. RingCT for our Anonymous coin? Nah. Merch. LEGGGOOO
0	1522731222	-4	They forgot the ‚ÄúBiggest-All-Time‚Äù shitcoin announcement in Q2, anyone contacted a dev. about this to get it on the roadmap?That is a narrow map that leads to whereverin shitcoin hell that bitconnect resides. edit: apparently people still believe in vergeconnect lol.
0	1522746183	-4	Haaaaaa Verge shitposting resurrected after 3 days..... 
1	1522757838	2	It's going to keep going until whatever happens the 16th
0	1522742943	-1	They seem to be getting publicity from it.I could tell you why some other coins have actual value. It probably wouldn't hit the front page of r/cryptocurrency, though.It seems incompetence is an effective marketing tactic in the crypto markets.The pink they're used on their site is quite nice. They've got that going for them. Some pink.
0	1522750956	-1	It's missing a step called "penis"
