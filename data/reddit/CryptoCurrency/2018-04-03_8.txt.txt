0	1522759862	44	While I think REQ has a future, and am invested myself, it does annoy me when I see this kind of low effort 'reminder' posts that just keep regurgitating old news in an effort to keep the coin on the front page of this sub. PRL is pretty bad for it at the moment too.
1	1522769543	17	Don't forget stellar and IBM partnering every day 
2	1522779027	2	It's a low news cycle I'm surprised I haven't seen the following:.     "What is NANO? 0.00005s transfer!".     "IOTA partnership with my mom, Bosch, and the God particle".         "WTC patented another thing".       "XRP partners another bank, again".         "[some coin] partners with Jesus - breaks bread!".         "A world leader sneezed and it strangely sounded like NEO!".

2	1522769345	3	'believing' in a project has absolutely nothing to do with  repeatedly posting the same positive news stories to make sure they're always on the front page, and everything to do with wanting a quick profit.
0	1522751888	46	so how many times is this going to get posted? 
1	1522763025	9	I own REQ and am tired of seeing this repost. :/
1	1522756193	6	One million times I think
2	1522760524	25	Every time a REQ thread is posted, a small number of upvotes get burned. This drives demand for upvotes by lowering the supply.
1	1522762956	1	I just wanna know how many times people are gonna upvote it to the front page 
2	1522773900	0	Req needs to be banned like Ven was... this garbage is toxic to this sub: [https://i.imgur.com/Mmjh0e2.png](https://i.imgur.com/Mmjh0e2.png)
1	1522765790	-1	This many reposts actually decreases my confidence in a project.  Good projects kinda speak for themselves
2	1522767949	1	I see you are a nano fan, RaiBlocks wouldn't be where it was if it wasn't for all the Shill over reddit, it went for over a year unnoticed.
3	1522769397	1	I got sick of those repeat posts too
0	1522745884	16	This is very interesting and they couldn't have gotten a more appropriate partner for what they're trying to achieve. Good things have come to REQ. 
1	1522754802	5	I agree. I aligns well with the platform's long term goals. Why I'm actually excited about this one. 
0	1522747109	10	Since when are they bigger than Deloitte?
1	1522756347	7	You are right. PwC is #2 but when looking at revenue and number of employees etc it's almost a tie. More accurate to say one of the biggest. 
2	1522756797	3	Yeah doesn't really matter much. Interesting to see though that PwC are really getting into blockchain/crypto more than the other big 4. Atleast publicly. 
3	1522756973	6	Oh for sure. I'm just tired of hearing people say "well it's only PwC France". Like a company is supposed to go balls deep in a project that still has at least a year left before it's project has all working components put together and then many more years for optimization, adoption etc. 
3	1522775685	2	As someone working in tech at PwC, we recently had a small presentation about what blockchain is and how it works (by one of my colleagues), to get everyone up to speed on the technology as it's growing. Very much feels like they want to be the de-facto firm out of the big 4 for crypto/blockchain
2	1522756804	-2	I thought PwC was third after Deloitte and Ernst & Young.
3	1522760344	2	Fuck EY (Iâ€™m a former EY employee). Deloitte and PwC usually switch between 1st and 2nd.
4	1522761283	1	What's wrong with EY 
0	1522743906	3	This is a very impressive project with a HUGE potential for growth and expansion. I am sure that the public sale will achieve all expectations!
1	1522766382	7	This is literally a robot account.  Can these get banned please?
1	1522765098	4	lol what a paid marketing shill
1	1522774785	1	So Req is using bot accounts that literally post the same thing over and over and r / cc is okay with this?  https://i.imgur.com/Mmjh0e2.png

0	1522742329	-14	Partnering lmao. The word is used in cryptos  so casually its worthless. Simple rule, you are not a real partner unless the other side announces as such. 
1	1522745207	25	Here ya go.https://twitter.com/PwC_France/status/978248098022658048

1	1522745929	12	Rofl, you are hilarious man. I love how you stopped saying anything as soon as you received proof that it was a real partnership. 
2	1522746319	-21	PWC France is merely a franchise of PWC. Watch Netflix's "The China Hustle" and you will understand. It's scam.
3	1522756678	9	Proof that it is a scam? Everything I read points to the opposite and as far as I know PwC France is being used for it's blockchain lab. I don't understand the hate people have for REQ. People should want it to succeed. 
3	1522746634	6	Yes PwC France is not the entirety of PwC but it's still one hell of a partnership.
1	1522744109	6	Pwc had a tweet about it. I don't remember the exact words on it but if i remember right, they confirmed a partnership. Correct me if im wrong. :)
