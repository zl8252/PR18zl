Submission title: An excerpt from Andreas M Antonopoulos's talk from back in Nov 2013. As per him we were in at laughing-at-us stage back then. Now they are fighting back. Bitcoin is not dead, its that financial world is fighting back. This was supposed to happen.

0	1522732041	19	That's a Ghandi quote lol
1	1522746395	9	*Gandhi. 
1	1522770312	1	The quote is commonly attributed to Gandhi but it doesn't actually originate from him.

1	1522767461	2	He's the Bitcoin Sherpa
0	1522759571	5	Just wait till all those old, middle-aged bankers retire, and when the students educated in blockchain solutions, distributed systems and cryptocurrency start entering the workforce and start working for big companies.I'm seeing universities now teaching subjects on blockchain, distributed systems and cryptocurrency. If you want to predict the future, just look at the current educational trends happening right now in the universities.
1	1522765795	0	Bro literally none of what you mentioned has anything to do with finance. Why would people want some computer science expert advising them on their money? Blockchain is a fucking data structure, distributed systems is a CS concept. Cryptocurrency, as it is now, is all just speculation.
2	1522775796	1	Technology directly impacts finance. Think, global remittance, and the fintech industry, and how cryptocurrency/blockchains enable instant, near-feeless global money transfers, thus increasing the value of whatever company utilises that tech.All of this impact's the demand for cryptocurrencies as regulations get better, and cryptocurrencies become more prevalent.

1	1522765718	1	Bro you're going to disrupt all the hodlers as the price plummets and their shitcoins become useless
0	1522734423	11	Remove your tin foil hat, the financial world is not "fighting back", I doubt they care less about crypto or see it as a genuine threat as it stands, which lets not forget, was deemed so insignificant currently by the G20 that a global approach to regulation wasn't necessary.  What you see is banks protecting themselves from user chargebacks through stopping customers buying crypto with credit cards, Google stopping ads to protect themselves from being associated with ICOs which go wrong (i.e. the Centra ICO).You have Goldman Sachs and others starting crypto trading desks in the summer. If they wanted to fight back they could and would have easily driven the price of BTC into the low hundreds through creating panic selling. Instead they are showing interest in what could become a recognised financial market at some point.
1	1522761577	1	I guess it depends on how you look at it. I agree, banks are definitely protecting themselves for the most part. It's a very a hectic, quick environment rich with people looking for a new scam. Someone had to be dull to not think that would be part of it. There are regulation fightbacks though, such as Binance and its Japan regulation issue. I think years ago this would not be something even thought of. I think banks would be worried in a way, with how some important people are talking. Any major bank would absolutely have brought crypto up at this point. It looks like some of them are choosing to adapt to the technology though which is good.
1	1522765841	1	People here are delusional. The banks right now are far more concerned about the real market, they could give a fuck about a bunch of shitcoins and their one infamous relative bitcoin.
1	1522753300	-1	"not a threat"FBI, NSA trying to spy the shit out of it. Many banks banning crypto txs.Choose one
1	1522735156	-7	Oh get lost you ignorant noob. So dense, thinks the world is in order when it obviously isn't.
2	1522744581	3	Well you are way more dense than him
0	1522737494	2	I saw him speak in LA 2 months later and he mentioned the same thing. That was one of my "ah-ha" moments in blockchain and crypto.
0	1522738272	2	crypto still kinda is in that stage in my opinion, people still think it's a scam or just doesn't have a use"haha bitcoin... of course"I guess we're starting to see the fight though 
1	1522755888	2	This. All my anti-crypto friends (well not anticrypto, but rather feared of crypto) who knows im mining and trading crypto are like "bubble popped" "bitcoin is going down". Im taking this as a laught from them at me... well, the sides will switch.
2	1522756102	1	I wouldn't say they are wrong with "the bubble popped", late 2017 was crazy. :Pmaybe there's an even bigger bubble we're in, maybe not, who knows.but yeah, crypto is here to stay 
0	1522750026	2	This will be the John 3:16 quote of the crypto bible. 
1	1522756001	1	And also "Be the change you want to see in the world" -Gandhi
0	1522726406	2	I'm hard
0	1522716956	1	Crypto should adopt president obama's election moto.....YES WE CAN
1	1522719682	0	Chew soap 
2	1522720127	-7	Bite me...retard
3	1522720470	-2	This is about the level of intelligent discourse I'd expect from someone who voted for Obama.
4	1522720698	0	Let me guess...your a trump supporter"make idiots great again"....fuck off
5	1522721700	-4	2 genders, 2A, 2 scoops, 2 terms. Make America Great Again!
5	1522721422	-10	History will look back at Obama as the worst president lmao. And before you lose your shit... I'm an Australian. Thank fuck Trump won. 
6	1522726042	7	> History will look back at Obama as the worst president lmao.How the hell does shit like this get upvoted?  This is by far the most ignorant thing I've read today.  Even if you don't like Obama, you'd have to be braindead to think he even comes close the worst.  Most historians rank him around 10-15 (inb4 "fake news" "liberal historians")
7	1522736120	0	Call down there fella. He’s an Aussie and everyone knows they aren’t used to critical thinking. Probably just drawn to the bright colors of the red hat. 
6	1522724123	5	So many simpletons including you in this whole drama queen episode...I used a stupid political slogan to cheer on crypto,but i guess its too much to expect people to pull their head out of their behind and make it political...do you think it matters if your an american or australian in supporting trump...i just feel sorry for you nevertheless.and I for one believe they all suck and in it for their own interest,ambition or ego...may the concept of "thinking for yourself and not assuming anything about anybody" rest in peace...now lets get back to making some money.
7	1522731149	1	>I used a stupid political slogan to cheer on crypto,but i guess its too much to expect people to pull their head out of their behind and make it politicalUmm, what?
6	1522733348	2	I'm not American but everyone already calls trump the worst president of all time and it's only been 1 year lmao 
6	1522721988	1	Some of us don't need a time machine to observe our condition.
7	1522724060	3	Can we just not talk about this shit here? This is one of the few places left that I can get away from this reality show shit.
8	1522724364	1	But I deleted facebook.
7	1522723528	2	Great. Let's fight amongst ourselves, it will be easier for the financial world to beat us

0	1522743230	1	I think it's more interesting to debate the notion among those who actually believe in bitcoin that bitcoin should not be seen as a store of value. I find it tiresome at best to deal with this constant back and forth about "bitcoin should be just like fiat cash" and those who say "bitcoin is the digital gold." I personally think that it's neither of those things, but we will not reach an accurate definition as long as we are super focused on beating those over the head who don't believe in bitcoin. Let it be. And they shall be surprised. it will do it's own work. 
0	1522744101	1	This sounds cult-y
