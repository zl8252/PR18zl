0	1522840989	188	Every time someone posts one of these threads, I wake up down another $5k
1	1522856848	49	Stop going to sleep?
2	1522859889	36	Or stop waking up...
3	1522864161	2	How in the hell can you go to bed alive and wake up dead?
3	1522861811	1	Yes! Finally, we found the problem. This guy should stop waking up!
2	1522860201	1	Or sleep forever. ;-)
1	1522857929	3	I have finally stopped looking.
2	1522863087	4	How do you do it? Asking for a friend...
1	1522862501	1	How can you sleep?
1	1522862968	1	I think we need a balanced perspective when it comes to crypto and economics in general.  People in this sub will definitely have inflated views of cryptos in the moment but it's like all technology where it takes time for adoption and regulation for the public to hop on.  It's also not wall street's traditional view where cryptos are all just going to crash and go away.  The reality is somewhere inbetween.  There will be tons of speculation going both ways.  Personally I think there needs to be better groundwork laid by governments to regulate exchanges but it's hard when we're in a global space of trading with a bunch of different laws in different places.  Bitgrail has left a bad mark on nano even though it appears to be a decent crypto.  The security aspect to wallets needs more wide spread info and adoption.  It's tough to try and pull from grassroots info systems like Reddit and youtube.  If you had a friend or actual place you could go to for help and it would greatly grow adoption.
1	1522863754	1	Every time someone post one of these threads it's just to shill their own coins. OP owns ven, qash, bnb.
1	1522865902	1	It's another desperate attempt to generate hype, which is the only thing that sustains the price. 
0	1522825793	817	One thing you need to add to the list is ‘greed’. Never underestimate the human desire for money. This is why I personally think it will boom again. Crypto is the young kids stock market (that actually interests them). 
1	1522838387	45	> Crypto is the young kids stock market (that actually interests them). spot on brother
2	1522859842	2	But, shares generate income. Im lucky to hold cryptocurrency from 2016 so I'm happy to see value rise.  But I also love getting dividends from shares.Perhaps as a thirty something I don't get to claim I'm young but I would suggest looking into both.Even when the stock market goes flat, I still get those nice payouts. My crypto does nothing and you just have to hope it's on an up cycle when you need it.  
3	1522865104	1	Right on, you are right. And the fact somebody downvoted you tells me crypto truly is for the young and greedy. People here are so quick to dismiss stocks for no reason other than "no moon in 3 months".
3	1522860337	1	I receive about 60 LSK every month - which has fluctuated between $200/mo and $2300/mo depending on the LSK price - I guess what I'm trying to say is it is possible to receive "dividends" in crypto as well
1	1522829724	60	You can also make money by shorting btc...
2	1522830734	42	Yes, but how many „traders“ really know how to short? I’m talking about the typical small trader, that seems to make up most of the community. Maybe 10% tried shorting somewhen in the past? Did it work? Will they continue to do it? Buy and hold are the easier and way more convenient alternatives.
3	1522850244	25	I tried snorting once. It didn't end well.
4	1522851667	5	That's how LaCleetus got a Tic-Tac stuck in his brain!
5	1522858947	1	That really happened?
4	1522853195	3	Gotta get back on the horse! Learn from your mistakes and try again when the time is right (hint: not now).
5	1522854882	6	Well that escalated quickly. I was just snorting, now you want me to try horse.
3	1522849063	6	Short with MARGIN. BOOM
3	1522858074	2	This is how you lose all your money."typical small trader" also can't move markets and trade on emotions
3	1522860454	1	Also, shorting is has the potential to be significantly more risky.  Since you have to buy at whatever price it’s at. It can cost you more than your original investment.
3	1522865193	1	Compare /r/investing subscriber count to /r/wallstreetbets subscriber count and you have your answer.
3	1522849865	-3	99% of the money in the game knows how to short. every single whale does. guys with billions crush people with thousands.
4	1522850987	2	I thought we were talking about the general population, not whales. Of course whales know how to short, martin trade or move a price in their desired direction.
5	1522857246	2	Tell me more about this Martin trade. 
6	1522859531	1	He snorts.
4	1522855699	1	99% of the money does but your ordinary man on the street hasn't got a clue. You wouldn't believe the number of people asking why they were losing money on eToro because they have opened a sell position.
2	1522833861	5	can you explain how exactly ? i saw futures on OKEX but never dare to use it
3	1522836618	11	If you think it's going to go down further, you can sell, and buy it back later when it's cheaper. That's the simplest.
4	1522841345	6	>f you think it's going to go down further, you can sell, and buy it back later when it's cheaper. That's the simplest.how do you sell it if you don't have any? can you buy options on bitcoin somewhere?
5	1522842433	3	check bitmex leverage trading tutorials on youtube
5	1522845873	1	eToro
5	1522851556	1	https://www.ccn.com/did-the-futures-market-negatively-affect-bitcoin-price-and-the-entire-industry/
4	1522849899	1	If you short something you need to close the position before maturity date, no matter the price.With crypto it's a realy realy bad idea to short unless you have a lot of spare money to close the position if the price skyrockets instead of falling like you thought it would when you shorted.Imagine for some reason shorting bitcoin last october, with maturity date in december. That shit would hurt a lot more than just buying it in december and selling it now, because you already gave the money you were willing to lose when you bought it. If the price starts to rise after you short it, you don't know how much you will lose until you close the position, in theory it could be unlimited if you wait until maturity to close the position. Just imagine shorting now with maturity date a month from now, you don't close the position until then, but bitcoin increases to $100.000 (hypothetically). You would be super fucked.
3	1522849524	2	Go onto an exchange and put in a short position.  Generally they only allow a 5x leverage.EDIT: To clarify, you must own BTC to do this.  But if you own 1 BTC, you can put in a short for 5 BTC.
4	1522849616	3	That is the part I need explanation .. I did that once and 100bucks instantly disappeared.. wtf never tried again
3	1522852724	2	You can apparently trade btc futures on Ameritrade as well (just got my futures approval). Huge risk - unlike calls and puts where you risk only the premium, with futures you can lose everything. I plan on doing much more research into hedging opposing contacts and why that may be beneficial to options before jumping in.
2	1522852081	1	This might well be the answer to forcing market makers to reverse trend.  We just need enough people to get in on low margin shorts to make bait.
2	1522857972	1	The average joe doesn't know how to short. 
2	1522858429	1	Where is the option to “bet against” btc on any exchange?
1	1522855253	8	I invested in crypto first and foremost because I believe in greed. Next time it booms, it's going to boom hard.There needs a trigger though. But this long period of the market performing poorly is making people forget that ETH for example was $45 just 12 months ago. I'm still not convinced that the crypto market has "crashed" since it has deflated so little compared to how much it has grown in a short period of time. A stock market crash by comparison sets the market back years.The next 12 months could be just as much of a roller-coaster and end with ETH reaching something crazy like $10,000 then crashing to 4000, who knows. People were starting to believe back in end of December-early January that the growth couldn't keep going forever, and lots of people wouldn't invest in something that just went up 5x in no time. Greed and fomo have their limits.I'm convinced that this current bear market is essential to a future bull market. The main risk is if it happens in 2 years and cryptocurrencies have started to be irrelevant due to new tech or new concepts.I'll be honest, I invested most of my crypto investments about 7-8 months ago, just in time to miss the huge gains, but early enough to not have lost any money as of now. I have a lot less to lose than people who have already lost a lot.edit: I'm also very curious as to what will happen to crypto when the young people investing in it start having real careers and decent salaries. Most investors seem to be young students working part-time...
2	1522860262	3	It could well be years before we get back to the last peak.  A lot of greedy people are regretting their involvement right now!! And they will share their stories.  
2	1522858216	2	Agree for the most part. Greed is an interesting beast as well.. we'll have to see how it plays out. I think this whole thing can run a lot further than people think it can given the amount of liquidity in the market. 
2	1522865707	2	>I'm convinced that this current bear market is essential to a future bull market. The main risk is if it happens in 2 years and cryptocurrencies have started to be irrelevant due to new tech or new concepts.Disagree. I'm more worried about the opposite. The tech is not ready for mass adoption yet. Scaling is a big issue for almost all cryptos right now. 2 years from now sounds like the ideal time. The tech will have matured and be ready for mass adoption.
1	1522831748	77	Absolutely. I was never even interested in stocks because they were too slow and boring. 2x money in 10+ years didn't seem worth it. I wanted that money asap. Even with this bear market, I've made more money in 5 months than I will ever have made in stocks in 50 years.
2	1522847058	116	 “I've made more money in 5 months than I will ever have made in stocks in 50 years.”I don’t think you understand the power of compounding. Yes you may of got lucky and participated in the crypto boom that happened and very well may continue to flourish. But you sound foolish when you make a claim like that. 
3	1522848146	31	Foolish indeed. Also there's no self-awareness that if the main reason for doing something is "get rich quick", there's almost certainly something deeply wrong...
4	1522864616	1	To be fair anyone who invested heavy before December experienced "get rich quick". I invested in some early ICOs and I don't think I'll ever see those kind of returns so fast in a long time.
5	1522865777	1	> To be fair anyone who invested heavy before December experienced "get rich quick".Sure, but if you're early to a Ponzi / pyramid as well, you get rich quick, but something is still deeply wrong with why.
3	1522847982	45	Yea a smart person would do well to invest in regular stocks as well.
4	1522850114	9	It`s all about diversity within diversity. High risk and low risks stocks/bonds,High risk Real Estate and lower risk revenue property,High risk low market cap crypto and lower risk top 5 coins (although crypto market hasn`t stabilized enough for this strategy)
5	1522855312	12	There is no lower risk crypto. It's high risk and higher risk
5	1522860130	1	I was interested to read about people diversifying into insurance backed investments.  Actually, most investments are linked to the prevailing economic wind.  But link yourself to catastrophes and you have a genuinely diverse investment.  There is no correlation between natural disasters and the global economy.  So you really want to diversify :D
5	1522863196	1	All coins are high risk
4	1522858128	1	Trust me, I'm looking at stocks for long-term stability as well.

3	1522863031	1	Compounding is beautiful 
2	1522849899	11	As someone who bought the 2008 recession hard, 10-20x stock gains happen as well.  Diverse investment is a strong plan, stocks, etfs, roth ira, gold, crypto are all good to have for their strengths. 
3	1522852544	1	How did you time your buy-in?
4	1522855265	3	Historically you’re getting a pretty good deal when the S&P500 has a P/E of around 7 and dividend yield of 6%. Also at that time the news will be talking about how stocks are dead and no one wants to invest, etc. The 2009 dip didn’t get quite that low but that’s what Fed pump gets you.
5	1522857790	2	Be bold when others are fearful
3	1522857428	1	I got 20x + on a marijuana stock 
3	1522860566	1	2009 was the best year to buy stocks in our lifetime 
2	1522853103	1	Lol if you aren’t risk averse there are faster ways to make money in stocks besides buying and holding. 
3	1522857841	1	HFT with near zero feesThat is the way brothers
2	1522855709	1	> I've made more money in 5 months than I will ever have made in stocks in 50 years.S&P has done about 9% over the last 50 years, that's doubling about every 7.8 years, so doubling over 6 times in 50 years.Have you multiplied your money by 64 over the last 5 months? If so, kudos to you. I've multiplied mine by about 1.
3	1522858728	1	Well like I said, at one point it was over 100x (for one of my hodlings, XRB) during the bull run. Obviously it's much lower than that now, and I also have VEN to worry about. But now after 5 months since I started, I'm at a total of a little over 6x the total fiat that I've put in throughout these past months with my current hodlings.
2	1522857421	1	Buffet became the richest man in the world by simply returning 20% on his money every year (which is really, really hard to do by the way, because as you get more money you have to make bigger and more diverse investments, i.e. riskier)
2	1522859928	1	And you'll lose it just as fast ;-)
2	1522860098	1	I agree with @abominationz777 im also making good money in the bear market, anyone that says ooo your lucky is what we call STUPID MONEY.
3	1522860309	1	Well I haven't actually made money during the bear market itself; I'm just a holder, but everything that I've lost hasn't outdone my gains x)
2	1522860364	1	> Even with this bear market, I've made more money in 5 months than I will ever have made in stocks in 50 years.You should check back when you've been in Crypto for 50 years and compare to stocks.
3	1522860633	1	People are missing the point of what I said. Yes, crypto is for short-term, explosive gains. I'm definitely going to diversify into stocks down the road. BUT what makes the younger generation so much more excited for crypto is the hopes of becoming a millionaire in just a few years, as theres so many stories of those. We think, why wait for when I'm 60+ years old to be filthy rich when I can do so when I'm young? We can do so much more when we're younger too, and so many more years to enjoy it. It is the hope itself of becoming a young millionaire that drives the youth's mentality in this market. Edit: Besides, crypto is still so new, no one really knows. But I can tell you that crypto has done much better in 8 years than the stock market has.
4	1522863172	1	> the hopes of becoming a millionaire in just a few years.So many more people have singlehandedly destroyed their chances of being a millionaire in their 60's by not diversifying their portfolio and "investing" in speculative bubbles on well intentioned hopes of being a millionaire in a few years. You hear a lot about the successes, the guy who bought at $1 and sold at $20k, and less about the failures, the guy who bought at $20k and is still holding at $7k. In order for someone to win, someone else needs to be holding the bag, but someone holding the bag is not going to be bragging about it online.This does not mean that you remove speculative investments from your portfolio, it means that you build a balanced portfolio of investments around them. Your talk of "diversifying into stocks down the road" is scary because that means you've got 100% of your investments in something volatile, like Crypto. Sure you could be lucky and buy before a run and sell right at the tip of it, but those points are only obvious in hindsight. When it is dropping, it feels like it will never stop, when it is rising, it feels the same. When do you buy? When do you sell?Having a portfolio of something crazy aggressive like 30% crypto, 60% stocks and 10% bonds, diversifying within those percentages so you are not in one coin/market and rebalancing on a set schedule regardless of what the market is doing will be much better on average than having 100% in anything.In 3 months (of whatever your rebalance schedule is) if crypto has done well so it is now 50% of your portfolio while stocks have shit the bed to 40% of your portfolio and bonds stayed at 10%, you sell 20% of your crypto to bring you back to 30% of your portfolio and use that 20% to buy stocks to bring you back up to 60%. Crypto might keep going up, so you are giving up some profits there, but you don't know so at least in the meantime you've taken your crypto gain and put it into something that is down, so when stocks come back that 20% is doing work there.It isn't sexy, but it gives you a much better chance of a good return at the sacrifce of maybe not having the best return (but only in hindsight). Doesn't even need to be stocks on bonds as your alternate items, just things that are unrelated to Crypto so if one goes down the other doesn't necessarily follow.
2	1522861552	1	Don't forget about taxes. Kid posted yesterday saying he was  trading crypto, made $150K, but owes like $50K in taxes. Spread it across alt coins and then lost the money. Oops. Uncle Sam doesn't care. Still owes $50K in taxes.
3	1522861724	1	True, but theres no taxable events where you're just hodling. And at this rate, I wouldn't say I'm making money, but I've simply made money since I started 5 months ago. My portfolio has really just been fluctuating, this past week or so, but I am still at an overall profit. 
2	1522863024	1	stocks arent boring tho once you get into it and start building a portfolio
2	1522833206	-30	You've obviously never heard of trading with leverage have you? 
3	1522834343	30	with margin trade you can't make a bad trade and hold position for months, hoping for the best as you can actually trying to do with cryptos
3	1522834487	2	Yep. You're absolutely right. Just looked it up. Great concept,  but even so, crypto is just so much more accessible, and the multipliers are MUCH faster. Yeah, with leverage I can put in $10,000 and get a 50:1. This will put me at $500,000. So if I earn 5% in a year, which is standard, that gives me a gain of $25,000 in a year. Yes this is a lot of money, BUT there's just been so many stories of people making millions with only a few hundred or thousand after  a few years in the crypto world; this of course makes crypto MUCH more exciting. I can tell you at one point during the recent bull run I had seen over a 100x multiplier in 3 months. Obviously that is MUCH lower now after a total of 5 months, but it's still more than what I would have made in the stock market with a 50:1 ratio in a few years. THAT is what makes this so much more appealing. 
4	1522835614	12	But well the thing is: margin sucks. If you do 10.000 on a 1:50 ratio this means if it goes down only 200 bucks your 10.000 will be called. With margin trading only the exchanges and the big players (that have enough unspent money to back the call up until market goes in their favored direction) win.
4	1522839330	16	> Just looked it upThis is gold. 
4	1522845942	3	It’s two sided though. Huge potential gains = huge potential loss.
1	1522855907	3	>  Crypto is the young kids stock marketI don't see why future stocks can't be issues as coins. Stock trading would be so much easier. Your share in a company would be digital, that could tie into voting at stock holders votes... really crypto could explode here....
2	1522866176	1	There's no benefit on running the "stock" on a blockchain. Besides if the trading happens on exchanges, it's basically no different than the stocks we have today.
1	1522836752	24	I don't think people are going to get rich in crypto any more, generally. The money is being spread amongst too many shitcoins.If people only bought coins that had plausible value, there could be a concentration of value. But since anyone can start a shitcoin, and then have it take some of the market, the value is diluted.It seems the best way to get rich today is to start a shitcoin and then do some merch. No need for anything that's actually useful -- like cryptography. Who needs that?
2	1522838826	30	If I'm getting downvoted for my comment, I don't think people grasp the problem.Electroneum had fake mobile mining, and people still seem to be buying it. If scamming people isn't enough, then what does it take for people *not* to buy a shitcoin?There's going to be more shitcoins whilst it's easy to make money from them. Incentives.Those shitcoins are going to take investment away from other projects.It's death by a thousand shitcoins!
3	1522842875	12	Only partly correct. Some people will still get rich, just like in regular investing. It's all about making sure you are researching what you are investing in, and a large element in luck in terms of the projects you invest in being able to crack through on both building product, finding product market fit, then scaling appropriately for adoption.At the moment, most projects are still in the building phase, many have already failed at this point, not many projects have even reached a beta or testnet phase yet. Hence the high failure rate of ICOs from last year... that's excluding the scams. It's similar to the tech startup world... most will fail.
4	1522844010	1	> Only partly correct.Yet to be established.Whilst the market is going down and crypto assets are highly correlated it's hard to see how any reasonable number of people are going to get rich from crypto picking (like stock picking).And if we're in an environment where you can't make money from rational evaluation, what makes you think 'smart money' will invest in the sector?You think Goldman is going to start buying Verge? So where's the of money going to come from? As the market gets larger, it requires more money for the same returns.Some Dunning–Kruger mofos aren't going to be able to support the market.Maybe they all have to get rekt before 'sanity' comes. And by that, I mean lose nearly all of their invested money.And another point: Ideological projects will continue in an annihilated market. Get-rich-quick hucksters can't.
5	1522845755	2	100% agreed sir
5	1522845132	1	Smart money is already moving in. Goldman is not smart money. Polychain Capital, a16z, Sequoia, Union Square .. they have already started. It's still early, just like in the web 1.0 days. there will be a few winners, but also a lot of losers. All about learning the product lifecyclkes understanding adoption and the support networks that every project builds around them.Already it's easy to see which projects are focused on building, and which ones are focused on promoting and pumping. Most companies at this point should be focused on building and finding product market fit from a Minimal viable product.. particurlarly if they are backed by advisors or a board who can help them build their product... not ones who have 'generic' blockchain advisors.. unless the product they are building is for blockchain devs.Look for those projects, they will be the least risky and should have the lowest failure rate. My expectation is that 95% of the projects out there will fail.. of the ones with  support from experienced start-up backers (and not financial but network support) I would expect to be more towards 85-90% failure rate.
6	1522847142	2	> Polychain Capital, a16z, Sequoia, Union SquareUnion Square Ventures has Coinbase and CryptoKitties. They ain't buying at the spot market rate. They're investing in infrastructure. Like Novogratz has: starting up a merchant bank and pulling plans for a crypto fund. Smart money indeed.Polychain were the first crypto fund I think. They bought at good prices. They got Monero at around $30 a pop. They got in early.VCs also get better prices on ICO token sales, from what I've seen. So the best connected aren't even playing the same game.Yeah, investment bankers are stupid. Right. Goldman's revenue is around $40B per year. Normal hedge funds are full of morons. They get paid a ton of money when anyone could do their job. I don't think that's correct.> Already it's easy to see which projects are focused on building, and which ones are focused on promoting and pumping.That isn't playing out empirically.> Look for those projects, they will be the least risky and should have the lowest failure rate.It's doesn't matter if they fail or not if the price doesn't go up. Whilst money's going to shitcoins rather than decent projects how is the price going to increase to an appreciable degree?What's the point of taking all the risk if the price doesn't increase much?
7	1522847207	1	Because if you're investing.. returns are usually on a 5-7 year time scale, not a 5-7 month timescale. Even the most recent global successes such as Uber where started in 2009. It takes time for mass adoption. Spotify 2008.Goldman makes money from money.. They are not company builders, they are middlemen. The 'Seed' VCs are enablers, not just money men. The fact they got in early is to their advantage sure, but the fact that they are more likely to support their investments vs looking to cash out quickly which the pure 'money men' will do gives those projects a better chance.EDIT: forgot to add, at least for me, these type of investors get to have a better level of due diligence then what regular people can access, so there's that extra level of vetting that is done as well.
8	1522848219	1	If people continue to buy shitcoins for the next five years or so, it's the same situation.That may change or not.I'm invested in an ideological project which is still early enough to turn a profit in a fucked market. There could well be positions that make sense. Diamonds in the rough. The best of the best will likely be okay regardless.

3	1522851884	2	Yes, I agree, and that's the irony of this subreddit when they spew that altcoins should decouple from Bitcoin. As if Bitcoin is the one causing problems.
3	1522852679	1	Electroneum is just building their network. Im sure eventually the app will actually mine
4	1522853057	1	It still doesn't mine?!Jesus Christ.
3	1522853056	1	Because the space is never going to mature beyond this, right? Just like how the internet never took off because it was too flooded with companies trying to make a quick buck with their website, right? 
4	1522856224	3	I can think of a scenario where the cycle is broken. More adoption.If some cryptos start to get used and gain network effects then that's something shitcoins won't have.I would now say, no one is getting rich until there's reasonable adoption -- broadly speaking. Until then, shitcoins will likely remain attractive enough as to saturate the market and spread the capital out.I think it's fair to say,1) We don't know for sure if there's going to be mass adoption.2) When that will be.I'm bullish on AEON though. A private cryptocurrency aimed at mobile/low-end devices. That could get used.That's not most people getting rich. That's early investors getting rich. And that's for what I consider the best idea in the sector: the currency! Driven by adoption, not only speculation.
3	1522853387	1	Regulation. It will come and things will stabilize but it takes time and will probably get worse before getting better. I'm neither for or against this but do see it as inevitable.
2	1522847079	1	I think yes and no to your comment. I agree 99% of the projects out there are pure bullshit. I think pretty soon these projects will start to die completely and money will congregate in real projects that will still be around in 20+ years like ethereum and VeChain.Then these cryptos will make more slow and stable gains.
2	1522852636	1	A lot of the shitcoins will get regulated out.Theres still a massive growth coming for whichever coin wins for daily commerce / some type of voting coin / medical records coin / power coin. 
2	1522856105	1	> I don't think people are going to get rich in crypto any more, generallyI said the same thing after bitcoin hit $1,100 back in Dec. 2013
3	1522856616	1	I've given a specific reason. It could be wrong. Currently, it looks correct to some degree.I have modified my position some (link below). Now I'd have to be right about multiple things. That doesn't feel great.https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/89mwk0/why_i_personally_believe_cryptocurrency_is_gonna/dwsqgpo/?st=jfl9f8ah&sh=0f8fe0b3
1	1522841321	1	true but greed takes you down more than it raises you up
1	1522845565	1	He didn't forget it's just greed is the primary motive behind a capitalist society. Also greed isn't exclusive to bitcoin...
2	1522846277	2	Why the fuck are you talking about. Where did he or I say greed is exclusive to bitcoin?The topic is about ‘why he thinks cryptocurrency will boom again’
1	1522848660	1	Not to immediately be called a shill, but this is why the majority of what I hold is in FUN. Greed is one of the main reasons I have support for it. At this point it's a waiting game, and I can at least say I'm *only* down 50% on my stack right now. I feel bad for those who bought at the ATH who might not even break even before 2019 at this point.
1	1522855826	1	Wouldn't it be ironic if it never pumps again and you're left holding the bags, and it was because of your own greed that you expected people to buy them up?
2	1522856709	1	Yes. Very ironic. But very unlikely. Hodl til you’re old. 
1	1522858705	1	Greed is the key to the boom. 
1	1522858982	1	That last sentence I believe to be very true. Especially because of the volatility right now.
1	1522859702	1	Cryptocurrency: ‘A revolution disguised as a get rich quick scheme’ It’s no wonder in 2020 Millennials will make up 1/3 of the population. And we don’t trust governments with our value...
1	1522866123	1	I think the greed phase is over. It's become painfully clear, even to young kids, that btc has stagnated, if not declined. It is not a good avenue for their greed.
1	1522841189	1	if only it wasnt such an energy hog.
2	1522845685	1	good point, that's one reason the govn will use if/when they decide crypto is too much of a threat and ban it.  'Apparently' it's destroying our planet.  Source: Some articles I read in the newspaper.
1	1522849098	1	Which is pretty bad. The current trends of crypto is betraying everything it was created for. It was created to be a low fee/fast/easy acces/fully anonymous means of buying goods and service and now it has become a tool for speculation and quick gain.
2	1522852487	1	Bitcoin core STILL isn’t able to handle mass adoption that they planned and hoped for for 8 years. So now people realized it’s uselss for that and need something better and it set crypto back
1	1522849324	1	👏👏👏👏
1	1522852926	1	I don't think you can compare the crypto market to the stock market. If a company liquidated or got bought out, you would receive value for your shares. However, crypto is only backed by the belief in it. You could own a lot of bitcoin, it loses its hype/adoption and then it's worth zero
1	1522842742	-1	Until feb came around and every kid who traded last year is finding out they are in total financial ruin now. Many of whom will likely end up in prison due to tax fraud. 
0	1522823050	238	As soon as normal people can buy/store coins safely via a reputable source without a hassle everything is gonna moon imo
1	1522826851	80	Yup, agree. I know quite a few people that are interested in cryptos but have no idea how to setup a wallet or buy BTC. 
2	1522828868	40	Same here.It's hard to promote crypto to the average joe because crypto in its current state is physically risky to own.Most normal people probably don't want to invest thousands of dollars into something that could  get stolen very easily. Compromised computers, losing or having your wallet information stolen, etc are all ways to lose your money in an instant.Eventually some trusted-brand intermediary will  let the average Joe who knows nothing about crypto insert money, buy a coin, and have it safely stored until he wants to sell. It's not an if, it's a when.
3	1522831560	4	QUOINE's exchanges have cold storage  for any crypto you keep on their exchange and probably have the best security out of all the exchanges. which I feel like would appeal to the 'normal' people since they can comfortably keep their currency on an exchange without having to faff about with wallets.
4	1522831728	1	maybe but boy they're slow to approuve anything (withdraw, kyc, etc ..)
5	1522835568	3	They are setting up "white exchange templates". The idea is any company from anywhere in the world can launch the exchange in their country and setup a local exchange with their fiat. 
4	1522861109	1	They also have numerous withdrawal complains due to that, and also I've never seen any exchange that doesn't allow withdrawal during weekend ..
3	1522851380	1	I imagine Robinhood is that “trusted-brand intermediary”; at least the most likely right now, imo.  
3	1522838446	1	Revolut is pretty much this - they don't let you transfer crypto in or out though yet, only buy and sell at their prices (which are reasonable). Not great if you actually want to use the crypto to buy things etc, but fine if you're just in it for the investment.
2	1522852463	1	Was interested in bitcoin in 2013-2014.  Then I realized my "wallet" was a piece of paper.  Thought that was a silly idea.  So much regret.    Luckily I went back in at 2016 with Ethereum and a better understanding of Blockchain.  Have to agree, once there is a easy and 99.9999% secure way for people to own crypto either on their computer or mobile, the flood gates will open big time.
2	1522859662	1	I am currently working on an educational website that works towards lowering the barrier of entry for people just like you! I will send you a pm once the project is complete and the website is live 
2	1522843435	1	I consider myself somewhat tech savvy, but it took me quite a while to figure out all of this madness. I can only imagine how long it’d take someone who can hardly work a cell phone. With the options available right now, that is.  
1	1522835829	28	So basically a bank?So we're right back where we started. 
2	1522846426	12	Not really, it could become a "bank optional" ecosystem where technophobes can use a bank and technophiles can be their own bank. 
3	1522848535	1	I sorta get the point but honestly using web wallets or phone wallets is just as easy as using a bank website. I dont think having an optional centralized system to hold your crypto would really actually be easier. However it might be safer. I think the main appeal of that sort of system is that it your crypto could be insured. Also if you lose your login information you could just go to your bank prove your identity and regain access. Thid makes it safer for people who dont trust themselves to handle their money safely.
4	1522852500	3	It's like how walking a tightrope is "technically" equally easy with or without a safety net.  The net just makes people more likely to try it and less likely to fail on account of anxiety.
2	1522839317	11	God damn this really is a terrible irony if you think about it. 
3	1522850541	6	This is one of the reason i don't think cryptocurrencies will be used in the form that it is in now. Right now people trust their bank more than they trust themselves. If you have millions in crypto and want to secure your secret key somewhere, where do you put it ? Yeah, most people would say "In a bank vault".
4	1522858162	3	I'm kinda new to the sub, but I've noticed a distinct lack of serious environmental concern as a potential reason why crypto might not be picked up. What's the consensus? Do we think that mining is a sustainable practice when more and more people join? Do we ignore it? Do we laugh it off? 
4	1522859906	1	To be honest, they shouldn't trust themselves.  Just look at how many people almost lost a lot of their coins on binance due to users falling for MitM attack and going to the wrong URL.  Most people do not understand the technologies they use everyday.  I am a Network Engineer and I don't understand a lot of the technologies that are used everyday.  They are very complex.  We pay banks to pay security people to keep our stuff safe.I'm not denying all the shady things banks do, I'm just pointing out the problem that we must tackle if we want cryptocurrencies to grow.  Expectations in this community is one thing that I believe needs to mature as well.
3	1522860029	1	Not really. You don't have to store it in a bank.
2	1522855469	1	Well, no that’s not right. My bank never gave me the private keys to my checking account and I’m pretty sure they can freeze that money whenever I want. Correct me if I’m wrong but there’s a variety of fundamental differences between crypto and fiat even if you did want an authority controlling it. And for everything else, there’s ledgers/trezor.....
2	1522859992	1	A hardware wallet.
1	1522829671	6	I think the principal problem for a worldwide adoption is 1st it’s complicated, 2 it’s expensive A ledger is like 80$ for example, way too expensive for many countries around the world. An easy access to trading and payment is the key, for now we’re still far from there. 
2	1522848997	1	A lot of the wold has phones which makes crypto significantly more accessible. On the nano roadmap theyre looking into making a hardware wallet that can be used like a debit card with a chip. Im sure thats cheaper than a ledger. I imagine other cryptos will adopt this as well. 
1	1522836913	5	Nowadays, you can link your bank account / credit card to your NFC-smartphone and it's also convenient. Don't see the advantage in crypto in this case (no trolling).
2	1522860088	1	Bitcoin debit card?
2	1522840354	1	Yeh, banks taking the profit from shop owners. Convenient for the consumers. Also you pay an annual fee to the bank for the credit card.
3	1522851982	2	Most places you do not pay for a debit card with a checking account, and many people have no annual fee credit cards.
3	1522848780	1	And the shop owners pass the fees onto the consumers as well. Its an illusion that consumers dont have to pay fees or get cashback in most cases. A lot of cryptocurrencies have less fees, but to the consumer it seems like they are having to pay more than with fiat because in crypto its the consumer that sees the fee whereas with fiat its the shop owners.
4	1522855489	1	Processing fees for debit purchases are twelve cents.
1	1522844100	5	I'm expecting FairX to release the floodgates. 
1	1522837345	1	As soon as people can move their money from one reputable centralized source to a new reputable centralized source were going to moon? I think you need to step back and think about that. Why would anyone bother, particularly when they'll be owned by the same companies?
2	1522837563	2	Because the average joe will see cryptos as a stock exchange on meth and will want to be a part of it (this has already happened to a small degree).
3	1522840941	2	Average Joe doesn't even have a stock market account.  Perspective...
1	1522841409	1	I do wonder what this reputable source has to be in your opinion ‘cause i’d think the sources that are available now are not that shady or hard to get to.
1	1522847642	1	If not each country develops an e-fiat. By passes all coins on the market. Sweden is doing it so lets see how well that is going. But I doubt that the established monentary system will collapse just because crypto is a rebel's coin.
1	1522854573	1	Do not underestimate how many people still think Bitcoin is a physical object. We may have a long ways to go before this
1	1522855690	1	Coinbase is pretty damn near that... Not saying they are perfect but it's not a hassle and it's as convenient as clicking a buy button on an app on your phone
1	1522837190	1	I think the answer will be TokenCard TKN - be your own bank. You will be able to spend your crypto via their contactless enabled Debit card, exchange for FIAT or other crypto in the app itself and most importantly, you own the private keys. They are going to launch soon worldwide, keep your eyes peeled.
2	1522847321	2	All talk the talk and no walk the walk with those crypto debit cards
1	1522829289	-1	Buy and store on Coinbase???
2	1522830033	3	Coinbase isn't a well known or trusted company to the average consumer. Putting thousands of dollars into what seems like a random site will instantly turn people away.Coinbase is a good stepping stone but not quite accessible enough for your average joe.Just try to imagine a conversation with a dude interested in investing in crypto. When he asks how you say "deposit thousands of dollars into a site you've never heard of that isn't partnered with any reliable company, give them pieces of your ID, make sure you pay with only specific banks, o and they only have the basic coins"
3	1522860144	1	Their app was in the top ten a month or two ago.
3	1522834648	0	? Coinbase is regularly audited and even won lawsuits in the past against the IRS what are you talking about?
4	1522834839	6	???Coinbase isn't a well known or trustable site to a large majority of the population. I'm not saying I personally don't think it's legitimate. I'm saying the average consumer won't know what it is and won't trust it with thousands of dollars.
5	1522846268	1	Not yet at least. A number of large US banks are actively working to allow their customers to view their Coinbase balances within their own banking app.
2	1522837780	1	You must be fucking joking. Put "fuck coinbase" in the search bar up there and hit return.Furthermore, it goes against the principle of decentralization. If all the new users used coinbase we'd have an even bigger market player dictating how the industry is run.
0	1522827863	125	Which stage of the psychology cycle is this?
1	1522850583	72	This is delusion.
2	1522851827	14	This is the correct stage.
2	1522855927	11	Yea. Adoption is actually going down right now, not growing. Not saying that won't ever change but OPs "facts" are bullshit, and most are opinions
3	1522864490	1	Opinions are like arse holes, everyone has one. 
2	1522858659	1	Yup. Blockchain - or something like it - will one day run the world. Simply due to its efficiency. But there are going to be a lot of ups and downs on the way there and it will take longer than you think.
1	1522852874	2	I feel this way all the time. I love the tech and the potentially huge movement it represents.
1	1522862269	1	All this boom , moon , lambo talk while we’re still in a downtrend is definitely the “retarded” stage

1	1522828498	-10	I think it's Acceptance & Hope
2	1522841273	77	lol it's definitely not acceptance. Closer to denial or bargaining. Definitely not "acceptance" none of those things are happening right now. 
3	1522841750	48	This thread is proof we are in the denial phase
3	1522844733	2	No, he accepts that crypto is entering a bull run. He is already past both denial and bargaining.
3	1522842528	1	i dont think you can use the state of one sub as an indicator.Talk to the postman who told you to buy Bitcoin, see what stage he is in.
4	1522845085	10	Is there a "desperately trying to make my beliefs *become* true by shilling my favorite coin" stage? 
2	1522848175	4	That's a weird way of spelling "Denial".
0	1522828524	48	One of Sweden's biggest online electronics/games shop accepts btc. Paid all my mining rigs with btc from there.I must say it feels so damn good to actually use it and not just speculate on the prices of the coins.
1	1522836953	7	Webhallen! Now we need Inet as well
1	1522845359	4	I wonder if it felt damn good when that guy bought the pizzas for thousands of bitcoins. 
2	1522851708	1	Probably at the time it did
2	1522853466	1	Considering he had 30k Bitcoin back then, he's probably doing alright for himself.
3	1522858800	3	He ordered a 2nd pizza not long ago. There is a video somewhere. From the looks of his house interiors i guess he is doing quiet well.
0	1522823676	113	Sure but first 99% of the tokens need to go away as the are plain out scams.
1	1522828538	84	I believe more in the 20/80 rule: 20% of the coins will keep 80% of the market. 
2	1522841731	14	Tell that to all the people who bought tron
3	1522858979	4	Wait why tron? I haven't really been keeping up
4	1522859385	2	Theres just a lot of people who fell into the hype of buying shitty coins at peak lrices. Many of these coins will never come back or may even fade away entirely yet a lot of people are really hoping they bounce back. My biz partner bought tron at 17 centa. I highly doubt it will evwr get back there
5	1522861811	1	Ahhh got it. Yeah I bought some tron yesterday. May sell off short or long term
5	1522864577	1	Everyone fell into the hype of buying cryptocurrency. That doesn’t make Tron a shitcoin. Shitcoins get pushed daily with zero repercussions cause the criticism gets downvotes to hell, why(?), because of shills. Tron is a legit token and soon to be coin. Tons of partnership, roadmap, a now fixed white papers, a huge team and a good handful of partnership for future practical use. Stop spreading misinformation cause your buddy (and you?) got screwed over like everyone else who invested in crypto in general when it all tanked.
3	1522842855	-2	Tro(n)lolol
3	1522858092	-1	Or Bcash
2	1522842380	3	that is a reasonable asumption and way to put it.99% are not just going to disapear, they just made to much money in the ICO.  Maybe noone will trade them, but they will stay for years to come.But 20% taking over the current market cap of the top 200 seems reasonable. That plus lost of failing icos these days (less new coins instead of old ones dying).
3	1522842825	3	Alot of ICOs who made millions didnt do this to start/finance a viable business, or dont understand the mechanics of business anyhow. But went 'public' to serve themselfs & keep up the appearences for speculative purpose. Alot of initiators of ICOs will be brought tot justice, some will dissapear.The most important group are the others (mainly those with good non-viable/-realistic ideas at this moment) whom will be the base for future cryptos. Which is why we still need (bad) ICOs, to find out more perspectives and possibilities which could be used in the future.
2	1522834672	1	yes i think so too. It's roughly a natural law
2	1522861505	1	Well currently the top 9 coins have 80% of the market...
1	1522830446	5	They will still create more shitcoins.
1	1522828572	1	Honestly, this is how it will happen. Just like the dotcom boom (the second one), 99% of the crap died out and the remaining big dogs like Amazon and Google got huge boosts from this.There's a very, very good chance the coins that end up being big (if any) aren't owned by you or anyone you know.
2	1522832134	5	Google was post dot com technically, at least in the public market. And as I recall something like 50% of the tech companies in that era survived the dotcom bust. Many got acquired and many weren't household names but exist in some form to this day.So I don't think it'll be quite as bleak as some claim or fear, but I agree the shit has to be flushed out. 
0	1522835132	312	Here is why I personally believe Cryptocurrency is gonna fucking fail:* Loads of exchanges getting Fiat pairings will eventually lead to shit ton of regulations to deal with.* Adoption is seemingly going up, but when you look into the majority of announcements, everything revolves around partnerships, alpha versions of untested apps and systems, and so on* Everyone knows that Bitcoin is a cash grab for greedy people, supported by unstable and manipulated marked and it is a hassle to use compared to simple good old fiat* Cryptocurrency is going to be centralized, projects bought out and decentralized useful stuff will remain underground* Everyone who is rushing to get merchant adoption is trying to get ahead in the game of a highly unpredictable and volatile speculative business*  Majority of stores use bitcoin to draw attention, especially online, to get more business. Most stores don't want it because they don't even understand it* I am repeating all my points because I care, but realize that no one else does as everyone here is just greedy and want to get rich. When everyone cashes out - and cause another huge drop in the prices, who is going to want to adopt the crypto?* An absolute insane number of projects is going up, and as history shows, a huge majority of these projects will go bankrupt* Students and scientists putting in work is related to development, and has no relation to money - as it in fact is developement of technology - which once again will be bought out by rich companies.My point is: don't fall for the one side of the coin.This subreddit is extremely biased. 
1	1522841149	52	One more:A large number of people got burned in december/january, who will very likely *not* invest again. 
2	1522848158	41	They will be back at the next ATH Fomoing in lol
3	1522856429	5	Exactly, once they realize that if they didn't sell at a loss and kept holding for a good profit, a lot of those people will be back.
4	1522856862	2	Then the rollercoaster ride goes down again, fear gets to them and they panic sell. Rinse and repeat.
3	1522859027	1	"it looks safe now..."
2	1522847393	10	Conversely lots of people will see the price drop and say "hey now's my chance" and they'll hop in. Most of these points have a rebuttal and most of the rebuttals have rebuttals. This is why I think these threads are useless.
3	1522855497	14	You overestimate the average joe's intelligence. People HATE buying at lows. They think "see, this asset is now worth shit, why would I buy into it?". And when its worth a lot they think "see, this asset is GOLD! I need to get in!" And hence speculative bubbles burst.
3	1522848798	3	I agree these threads are useless but the average joe will absolutely not look at tanking prices and think 'here's my chance'. 
4	1522864983	1	Really? Is it not common sense? Or am I little smarter then I give myself credit? I figured this was common practice for anyone doing investing of any kind.
3	1522851222	1	That's called debate. Which is good
3	1522851569	1	Exactly. Both are right at the same time 
2	1522853764	1	Almost no one bugs me about crypto anymore, but when I ask, they are all interested and are still adding positions.  I'm still not sure a large number are no longer interested.  Market cap, does not equal interest or lack thereof.
2	1522857188	1	Oh yes they will. Months will pass and those burns will heal, coins start increasing in value and these guys will FOMO right back in. Once you start, nobody leaves crypto.
2	1522862708	1	🙋🏻‍♂️
1	1522838466	15	Thanks, this can end pretty bad without comments and people like you
1	1522852674	20	Half your points only apply in the short-term, and the others mostly seem to come from a desire to be contrary. It's like someone scoffing at the invention of the automobile:• everyone has horses right now!• there are no roads to support automobile travel!• there are no gas stations!• no one knows how to drive an automobile!Economic systems do change.I do agree that the majority of projects will simply fail and disappear, as they did in the 2000 tech boom/bust.
1	1522849986	3	If you're worried about regulations then buy Ripple
2	1522857530	1	that way you won't have to pay capital gains tax
1	1522855352	1	>it is a hassle to use compared to good ol’ fiat If you can send an email you can send crypto. The hassle is dealing with fucking coinbase and Gemini and other paper-debt liquidity providers. 
1	1522861319	1	That being said, do any of these really apply in any meaningful way in 50 years?There is an amount of us around here who know shits not going to change in months or even years.I wish the conversations around here were about more longterm things.
1	1522865749	1	>  lead to shit ton of regulations to deal with.Regulation if anything provides authenticity across governments for the cryptocurrency space. Amazed at how many people fail to see this!
1	1522836769	-2	Just upvoted! Great answer. The proof is you are being downvoted by cheerleaders
1	1522850231	1	I hate to agree with your but I do. Big money investment will never happen until a crypto currency can boast stable prices. Which means centralized governance.. corporate controlled block chain is what will likely take over the world unfortunately.. not gonna be fucking ripple lmao.
1	1522838574	-8	Crypto has to be centralized. I don't know why everyone thinks we should go back to the days of trading with gold, because that's essentially what decentralized currency would be like. Centralized currencies are the most likely to be adopted in my opinion
2	1522841506	7	If it is *truly* decentralized then it is better suited as an international currency and would be more stable than whatever is printed.
3	1522846815	1	Crypto at it's current state being decentralized isn't even stable. I can spend a dollar today on something, and still get the same thing with a dollar tomorrow. That doesn't happen with crypto. 
4	1522851472	3	That's why I emphasized '*truly*'. There aren't many out there that are trustless atm. With adoption and development, we shall see who come out strong. You can't just put all 'crypto' under a blanket statement. It's an entire ecosystem of different ideas and methods for decentralization. And your dollar reference is only true for *now* because this is on the cutting edge of development and adoption as well. The dollar was only worth something stable once it was largely implemented. Be open minded to change. Even today, a dollar in California buys you different things than it does in New York.
2	1522840291	5	That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.
2	1522843060	2	Sure ripple is faster than other currencies. But it goes against the entire philosophy of how and why cryptos were created in the first place
3	1522845995	1	To purchase goods in the safest anonymous way possible? Because that's what it's mostly being used for right now 
2	1522842623	1	why would it be crypto then, what would a Centralized Crypto do better than fiat?  This Statement makes 0 sense to me.
3	1522847320	1	It's not about being better than Fiat, it's about being better than a decentralized currency
4	1522847455	1	so what you are trying to say is you think fiat is better than crypto. Fair enaugh.Because centralized crypto makes no sense what so ever. If you think otherwise id suggest buying petro or something.
2	1522840205	-1	This question has been asked in the past and the fact is that the majority of the people in this sub who want crypto to be decentralized and/or anonymous are anti-government idiots who want to avoid paying taxes
3	1522842671	4	Centralzed Crypto = Fiat.Wtf...are you guys for real?
4	1522847393	1	What's so bad about Fiat? 
5	1522848351	2	Inflation (i know its not only bad)not owning the Money (dispossession)central controll of money printing (in the us its even a private Company)not beeing backed by anything (same as most crypto)no fast and cheap transfer 24/7counterfeitno banking for the poordont get me wrong, i dont think fiat is all bad (i use it every day ;) )But the value decline and central control are a problem

0	1522848230	4	Here is my issue with crypto: people seem totally fine with paying for things now with existing methods. Crypto booming seems more related to people being greedy and wanting to make a profit.If people think that cryptocurrency is going to keep going up in value, they aren't going to buy things with it or want to pay anyone with it.
1	1522850678	3	As far as currency goes, it will come down to price.  If merchants can save money on transaction fees (with security and chargeback ease being equal) then there’s a market.The good news is that currency is just 1 of many uses for blockchain tech.
0	1522838066	19	I'm of mixed opinion on the future of crypto. I think crypto will stick around, but I'm not sure it'll ever "mainstream" in the way that a lot of people hope. So I'll go over my concerns. 1. Too complicated for the average person. Cold or hardware wallets, private keys that can be lost and as a result you permanently lose access to all your money, wallet hacks, the presence of thousands of different cryptos with thousands more on the way, etc. Massively more complicated than fiat and credit cards. That's not even considering the extreme volatility.2. Most of the activity in the crypto market caters to the already existing crypto market. A lot of projects are geared towards making it easier to trade crypto to crypto, or building social media for crypto addicts, or enabling other cryptos to be created, etc. None of that expands crypto's base.3. Much of the effort towards adoption at merchants has gone unrequited. People keep saying "it's getting adopted by more merchants" but I don't see that as being true at all. It's still a small fringe, and many of the merchants who allow crypto payments only do so under the condition that those payments are instantly converted to fiat by some third party. That's not really crypto acceptance. Sure, a customer might spend their crypto, but the merchant only accepts it as fiat. The merchants who will accept crypto as crypto are very rare.4. I don't think crypto will ever replace fiat in the wider economy. Crypto has too many macro fundamental problems to displace fiat. Fiat has macro problems of its own, but I'm not convinced they are worse then macro problems of crypto. Again, it comes down to volatility. Businesses need to have a predictable flow of income and costs in order to operate. They can't have their cash going +- 15% in a day.5. Many of the "problems" crypto is taking aim at--banks, fiat currency, governments--just aren't seen as problems by the vast majority of people in the world. There are very few hardcore libertarians or anarchists. In that way, I think a lot of cryptos are "solutions" in search of a non-existent problems.6. The sheer number of scams people encounter in the space, plus the very large scale wreckage that many enthusiastic new buyers have experienced in the current crash. My non-crypto friends were once very interested, but now think crypto is all one gigantic scam. The few who I convinced to buy crypto now aren't speaking to me anymore because they blame me for the money they lost.  I think the crypto-core is really underestimating the damage done in the last few months to crypto's public image.Crypto is designed in such a way that it is incredibly user unfriendly to the average person. The current situation reminds me of Linux promoters in the late 1990s who were convinced that Linux would drive Microsoft Windows out of the market and every computer would be running Linux. Obviously that didn't happen and today only a tiny fraction of computers run Linux. Why? It was (and in many ways still is) very user unfriendly.
1	1522844761	17	Most devices in the world run Linux one way or the other. Linux is an immense success and it only continues to grow. Out of top 100 supercomputers 99 of them use Linux. All Android phones use Linux, NASA uses Linux. Linux is in a league of it's own and just because regular users have no idea that their Tesla car or washing machine or whatever car they own runs a Linux kernel that doesn't mean that it's unsuccessful. If crypto can achieve at least 10% of what Linux has already then we would all be rich out of our fucking minds. BTW, I run Linux and have a new Macbook Pro and a Windows laptop at work and Linux blows them out of the water with minor configuratons. Much faster, prettier, I've got an uptime of 47 day and counting,  no glitch, never had to shut it down or restart, I can install software without ever interrupting my workflow.
2	1522847010	1	I'm referring to consumer level access, not IT and computer science people. Tech geeks love linux, partly because they are free. I've tried Ubuntu and Mint distros and they were flat out awful to work with even though I have a greater than average knowledge of computers.(BTW, I have IT friends who will punch anyone who says in their presence that Android is Linux. They tell me that Google used a highly nonstandard Linux kernel but that everything else is different)
3	1522854650	1	That is false.  Just the security on Linux will beat Windows any given day of the week.  I have used Linux on my Laptops since 1998 or close to 20 years and I have no anti-virus all these times, no hacked or malware incidents.  In recent years, Linux on the desktops have improved tremendously.  What you can do on Windows can be done on Linux for the same experiences or even better and certainly there are areas Windows might be better such commercial apps.  It is not entirely because Linux is free.  It is the freedom to pick and choose and modify and customize Linux to your likings.  It is the peace of mind knowing that your laptops won't get compromised easily without antivirus software.  It is the time saving knowing that your Linux will perform as good as yesterday and not degrading with times.  It is realization that you can understand how software on your laptops work because all config files are text files instead of some freaking mumbo-jumbo registry.  Well, can you say anything like these about your windows laptops.
4	1522856579	1	Not sure who you are arguing with. I said that tech geeks love Linux, but that it is unfriendly and difficult to use for the average home user, which is true. I said nothing about Linux security.
1	1522844072	22	I'm sorry, but [Linux runs on 67% of the world's web servers](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wired.com/2016/08/linux-took-web-now-taking-world/amp).  That doesn't sound like a failure to me.
2	1522848697	2	If we're comparing to the early 90s, the proportion of servers using Unix or Unix-like systems only went down. This isn't a bad thing, we all benefit from a diverse ecosystem.edit: a better argument would be how a huge amount of embedded devices and phones now effectively run some flavor of unix.
3	1522856465	1	I don't disagree that Linux running on embedded devices is a better argument - but the argument about web servers is a clear refute of a perceived lack of adoption of Linux as a core technology stack.  Point is, visibility != adoption.
1	1522854646	3	>  I think crypto will stick around, but I'm not sure it'll ever "mainstream" in the way that a lot of people hope. I'd say businesses/institutions will be the major adopter of cryptocurrencies. Smart contracts have the potential to create a lot of efficiencies that businesses and institutions can take advantage of.I imagine it will start with companies/institutions using private blockchains to improve their own internal systems (since for the most part nobody wants to risk things on a public blockchain). Then they will find they can improve things more by interacting with other company/institutional's private blockchains (that data is useful afterall). Having the interactions between these private chains is where a public blockchain will come in and facilitate these interactions (just like how the internet isn't just a few private intranets between a few companies). This is why I'm going big on interoperability blockchains (ICX, AION, WAN) and smart contract platforms (ETH, NEO).
1	1522852699	2	Many servers run LinuxSo if we want to use that as a comparison we would likely see crypto and block chain being used behind the scenes in the financial industry, but to the average users they will not really need to learn anything new to be "using" it.

0	1522822266	17	Agree sir
0	1522838792	14	The YouTube channel Coin Mastery made a very valid point yesterday:Large financial institutions are buying up huge masses of cryptocurrency OTC. Once they have what they need and with systems and processes in place, they will start to offer cryptocurrency investments to everyday humans. That's when the price will go boom
1	1522855465	2	Is there actual proof of this?
2	1522856103	2	Not proof as such but there are a lot of people talking about ithttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-otc/otc-crypto-market-flourishes-powered-by-skype-idUSKCN1H91P4
1	1522846507	-3	If that were true, that would be driving up the price right now. The whole reason the prices have dropped so much is because everyone is selling off.
2	1522847066	5	Not sure how reliable the source is,  but when they state OTC it means the trade doesn't happen on an exchange and thus we don't see the price or it's effect. 
2	1522847306	2	These are OTC salesPlease see - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/over-the-countermarket.aspPlease also look into 'Coin Mastery' Youtube channel. It's a very good educational channel

0	1522823004	6	What are privacy coins good for again besides illegal shit? 
1	1522823564	80	Good question! Let me tell you why I use Monero everywhere that accepts it:The year is 2038 and everyone is using Crypto. I go to the store and I pay with crypto, I go to my friends house and he tosses me some coin. Everything is great.But one day, my wife comes back home. She's in *tears*! I say "Honey, what's wrong?" and she shows me her palm-phone. It's my Bitcoin wallet from when I was a kid in 2023, and it has all my past transactions. I gulp in fear, as she scrolls through the list to the one I hoped she wouldn't find - the time I bought someone else a wedding ring.It wasn't my fault.. I didn't know my wife at the time. How was I going to explain that? I never told her I was engaged.. I didn't mean to lie, but it just never really came up. I panicked and froze as she looked at me and screamed "It's true!??" - I didn't know what to do.^^^^^.*****^^^Thank ^^^you ^^^for ^^^gold ^^^Nemisis ^^^<3^^^.The blockchain never forgets. When crypto adoption goes wild, there's nothing stopping governments and insurance agencies scanning your texts/emails to determine which address is yours. They line up all your transactions and can serve you better ads, learn where you like to shop etc etc.. Basically everything that already happens today.Except now it's not just the government, it's *everyone*.Even if you're not doing something illegal, you're putting your transaction up for the world to see. That's why I think every blockchain crypto will eventually adopt some form of privacy, and why it's important that you start now ;)
2	1522825379	48	Plz keep writing... I was emotionally invested in that story
3	1522825741	56	I looked at her in dismay.. Do I lie? What would I even say?I mumble for words as she throws herself on the floor. "How could you not tell me about this!??", she exclaims through tears. I didn't realize what heartache it would cause, but I guess I should have known.I wish I had never even proposed to that other girl.. She was crazy. I just wanted to move on after we broke off - I found new friends, changed my fashion.. I even live in a different city. I just wanted to move on.. The past is in the past and I can't take back my actions.I know I should have been honest.. I wish I did. But it didn't really matter.. And seeing my wife the way she was, now sitting up against the sofa just made me reconsider everything. Will it be better now that she knows? They always said honesty was the best policy.She looks up at me again and says.. "I know.. I get it I didn't mean to look through your history.. There was just a dApp I could do it on so I checked it out.". I understood where she was coming from, but I felt pretty helpless at the same time. God damn, I thought.. I wonder what else of mine is out there.She looks up again, and says.. *"is there anything else I should know?"*

8	1522842812	2	Glad to see another smart person in this space. Feel like reddit is sleeping on AION and is only interested in ICX. Give me a team that performs ahead of schedule and is transparent over other projects any day. Here's to a big mainnet push!
6	1522837688	2	What makes them sister coins?
7	1522839247	1	Same algo, similar ideas.Aeon is basically lightweight monero with optional privacy, intended to be used on phones.Masari is Monero with a great DAA which has been upstreamed to Monero (not yet decided whether they are going to use it), smaller block time, min mixin size of 12 and intends to work on sharding and mobile wallets.
7	1522850954	1	Most coins that fork Monero or otherwise copy Monero are total scams. Those 3 are examples that implement the same protocol, but are done correctly and actually work with Monero contributors to test out and research new tech

1	1522829017	7	You reckon you'd ever be hired if all potential employers could see the entirety of your browsing history?Public open blockchains have their uses but currency isn't one of them.
1	1522831931	6	For everything. What if a cop shows up to your house and wants to search it? Surely you should be fine with it if you have nothing to hide. But this is not the case. Everyone deserves privacy. Imagine if even your cash flow was trackable by some ledger of blockchain. Just knowing your privacy is infringed is not a comforting feeling. 
1	1522823342	3	For staying anonymous duh
2	1522826676	3	I think the question is why is anonymity needed?
3	1522832323	20	Unless you are willing to post the last 10 years of your bank statements right here right now then I think you have your answer.Assuming full adoption, I'll give a few scenarios why privacy is needed:* If you think targeted advertising is creepy now, think what it would be like if Amazon had access to every one of your purchases ever, as well as access to all the purchases made by everyone you know.* Your employer & insurer can now see your entire purchasing history.* Every vendor you interact with now knows how much you are worth* All your friends and family now know what your salary is and how much you are worth.
4	1522837987	8	Oh boy, I got downvoted for asking a legitimate question. I simply wanted to extend the conversation further than "anon, duh" with some detailed examples, which you perfectly wrote out, so thank you.
3	1522830838	2	The gubherments!!!
1	1522840033	2	The new GDPR regulations in the EU could mean that ONLY privacy coins that can effectively obfuscate user identity on the blockchain will be widely acceptable in e-commerce. If your transaction history is easily trackable using a blockchain explorer and you have not explicitly consented to this then your payment processor could be liable under GDPR. Privacy is a human right. 
1	1522854637	1	For people that want to hedge their bets that live in a world where the government can hack your electronic services without a warrant, seize your assets without a criminal charge, and can slander and discredit you until you are driven to suicide (see Aaron Schwartz ).Another analogy is: people say privacy focused folks are nutjobs.  You have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide, right?Do you shit with the door open?  Why do you hide that act since it’s not illegal?

2	1522827485	25	Yes. Also this year's top 10 is going to consist of 30+ different coins.

2	1522830738	3	Google: “[name of crypto] + news”You’ll find an article titled “why x coin is undervalued, sleeping giant, blah blah.”Not saying they’re all wrong, but it’s obvious many of them were written to shill for the bounty programs.
1	1522826935	4	You can take your qash shilling elsewhere. Binance fiat pairing is already making you guys obsolete. Not to forget the 5 other new exchanges in the works with fiat pairing and decentralized architecture.
2	1522830822	7	Not when people can use Qash's liquid platform / world book to potentially buy their crypto cheaper from other exchanges.World book beta on its way on days...Why go direct to only one exchange when the world book will allow users to easily buy at the best possible price from multiple exchanges?

0	1522822279	2	Bit-COINNNNNNNN!!!!!! Thanks for sharing your feelings. 
0	1522826526	1	I would actually like to hear more opinions and explanations why people think crypto is going to bust.
1	1522829165	10	I think the price will bust. Not the tech.The main reason I think the price will bust is because everyone that entered the market late last year - mums and dads, and people that know nothing about the tech - have been rekt. Rekt badly and publically.If they’re hodling they won’t buy more. If they’ve sold they won’t reenter anytime soon. The face that they’re local supermarket now accepts crypto is mute. They’ve been burned. And they’re done. And they’ve told all their friends and brothers and sisters how much they’ve lost.The core crypto community are the only people buying, seemingly as more and more banks restrict transfers to crypto exchanges. This occurring at the same time as regulators start to get involved and tax authorities start looking for revenue to pay for the huge amounts of debt governments have accumulated.Crypto will survive, and prices will be resurrected. But it will be crucified first.
2	1522831141	9	Nobody tells his friends and family how much they lost, because nobody wants to look stupid. People just stop talking about it, while silently holding and hoping for better times. In my experience the way you describe it is not how humans work on a social or psychological level.
3	1522832003	3	I don’t think people are saying I lost $X dollars, but people will be vocal about losing 70% of their investment and being burned. 
4	1522833077	3	If they sold = definitely yesIf they hold = äääh ... investment ... longterm ... technology ... paradigm shift ... fundamentals ... ;)
2	1522843708	3	For an alternative take on this:There's a good chance that most of the money which has entered the market at some point is money which tends to stick around in some capacity. I imagine many of the people who bought in during December, got burned and made the decision to cash out, are at least curious enough to be watching from the sidelines and are checking back from time-to-time to see what happens to the market. Many will be waiting to buy back in once the market shows strength, or even if they don't intend to right now, they'll be nervously checking the prices every couple of days to make sure they made the right decision. Knowing its history, this is not the kind of market you sleep on. I know quite a few people on here have talked about how in December even their grandma was calling them up to ask about Bitcoin, but personally I didn't see it myself. I don't think we quite reached that level of widespread mania yet. Since it made news headlines a lot of people were at least *aware* that Bitcoin exists, but although they may have been curious about it, I don't think it went much further than that for the masses. It may have come up in conversation, but very few people I know expressed actual interest in buying in - and by the way, the masses for the most part are aware of Bitcoin and Bitcoin alone. Chances are your average Joe hasn't even heard of Ethereum unless he's gone out of his way to do research on his own (let alone anything else in the top 20), and in that respect I think we still have a long way to go.Many who held off buying in will see this crash as a way of validating what they already suspected "See, I knew it was a bubble! I'm glad I didn't buy in during December after all!", but if the market does manage to recover back to its all time high and beyond and the media attention comes back "Bitcoin rises from the ashes!", I think a lot of these people that were left unconvinced will begin to think differently about crypto "Gee, if Bitcoin can recover even from that, it must be the real deal after all!". I think that's where the real mania phase and media attention will begin.

4	1522847893	1	Well, bitcoin hasn't had trouble finding enough new buyers to push the price up for the last 9 years, I don't see why it needs to suddenly stop now. New investors become interested at all points along the way - It seems to have found a way thus far. Yes it takes more money to move the market now, but I guess it depends whether you think last year was a one-off or part of a natural increase in public interest on the road to adoption.Personally I think it could manage a *partial* recovery on the path back to 19k just from people who were already in the market before and are waiting on the sidelines with their cash (whether it's fiat or tether on an exchange). I imagine larger quantities of new buyers would come in when it starts making news headlines again and people realise that no, bitcoin isn't dead after all.
2	1522829785	2	Damn, this shit is real.
2	1522830931	1	I hope it won’t be as bad as that, but reality can be harsher than fiction.
2	1522840793	1	*moot <3
1	1522826564	3	Check out /r/Buttcoin - Sometimes they have an idea or two.It's just 24/7 FUD there.
2	1522827059	3	Yeah, I would rather something not retarded.
3	1522828534	2	You're shit outta luck then my friend.
0	1522827548	1	Well, glad you got that one sorted. At least my shitposts are genuine shit. 
0	1522829479	1	Fine, we now just cryptocurrencies actually useful as currencies.
0	1522829626	1	I was standing in Brighton (UK) train station waiting for a train. On their electronic billboard above the train times they show adverts. The usual stuff. Car adverts, perfume etc. But recently they've been showing a Cryptocurrency advert for some company called [EToro](https://www.etoro.com/). Made me do a double-take.Made me excited because if the 'general public' get involved in Crypto Currency, wow, it certainly could explode. Lets hope the tools and software to get involved are user-friendly.
1	1522835353	2	I was in London and that shit was on every tube I went on, as well as long as the huge electronic billboards at Waterloo.
0	1522830354	1	I can buy my coffee with BTC, not actually doing it tho. Nice option anyway.
0	1522830894	1	I think the biggest drag is Bitcoin BTC's stalling in term of currency use.  If people found BTC useful for online purchasing small items or sending money to family or friends, they would also get how cryptocurrency lets you manage your own money, without third party of governmental control, and how easy it is to load up on for savings.It helps that other cryptocurrencies are getting some traction for online transactions, but they don't have the name recognition that unadorned "Bitcoin" has with the uninitiated yet.
0	1522831652	1	I agree with many of your points but Its going to take a long long time, lots of people are down with the banks and scared to lose their " stuff "It also needs tobe a lot more user friendly before many even considor adoption.
0	1522832518	1	Wavesplatform is a dex and already have fiat gateways :) 
0	1522834735	1	Haha yeh agree 
0	1522834908	1	Very well seen!
0	1522836405	1	Not everyone knows about Bitcoin still, I am traveling in Thailand and Malaysia the past 2 months and many people I meet still haven't heard of it.
0	1522836804	1	These are good arguments for crypto gaining adoption and become an increasing part of life, but not for crypto doubling and tripling in value every few months, which is obviously what 90% of people in crypto want and hope for (and probably the only reason they are in it).You can have good tech and useful projects whose tokens are not valued at hundreds or thousands of dollars. Like, there is no reason Stellar can't work with Lumens being worth $0.10. In fact, that would be ideal for them.
0	1522837205	1	* I'm repeating all my points but I don't care... The best point you made by far lol 
0	1522837658	1	I have a friend who knows about bitcoin and has been following the price  but didn't have any idea how to buy any of the alts. The majority of people just haven't even heard of some of the biggest players in this area like Binance etc.
0	1522837706	1	You are not alone. It could make banks relevant again to everyday people. We trust them with our fiat, we should be able to trust them with our cryptocurrency. There should be another wave of interest as things progress.
0	1522838775	1	We just have to give it time :)
0	1522840233	1	I’m still not sure why anyone would want to accept, or pay with, bitcoin when the price is this volatile.  You just paid with bitcoin yesterday, what if the price jumps 5x today?
0	1522840917	1	yes and no. We desperately need regulations, whales are ruining the industry.
0	1522841277	1	Its going to boom because it's going to start being used in real world customer and business cases. Especially the DApp space 
0	1522842350	1	I personally think that once crypto gets around all the "regulations" it will see a huge boom. I remember reading a story in r/Ripple that said ripple could have saved this company like 40 million dollars. And the only reason the company didn't do it is because it was a crypto. In the long run, companies use what makes them most profitable, so i think once one of them starts to use it, they will all start to use it.
0	1522842723	1	Not everyone knows about it or gives a fuck about it. My wife my boss and everyone at my office. So settle down there .
0	1522843056	1	"has there ever been such a revolution?" I guess you weren't around when the internet was new
0	1522843595	1	So buy Enigma coin? 
0	1522843843	1	"everyone knows about Bitcoin" ok.
0	1522844810	1	I agree, I also think Robinhood coming into the space is a great thing.  It not only allows people to invest in crypto from fiat, but is also a simple and easy way to bounce from the stock market directly into crypto.Say the market tanks, some people may vary well pull out and directly throw that dough into crypto instead of their mattress because it's an easy option.
0	1522845007	1	Hello everybody! I ve heard about some blockchain platform - CREDITS. They claim about 1 million transaction per second in June.  I got interested and I ve joined their Telegramm channel, where I was amazed that they have 24/7 support and always answer all your  questions, this project looks transperant and that makes me confident, they also published the component of their code on Github which proves that they use P2P platform. Has anybody heard of them and could advice me to invest or not in them ? Im newbie in cryptocurrency sphere and would like to hear opinions from experienced people.
0	1522845450	1	When do you reckon exchanges like Binance will start to get Fiat pairings for alts? 
0	1522846639	1	> I'm repeating all my points but I don't careDefinitely your most convincing argument
0	1522846869	1	Boom? 
0	1522846962	1	What exactly do you mean by "boom"?   That cryptocurrency will eventually become a viable alternative to current forms of currency?   or   that the prices of cryptocoins are going to go up very high?   because its it going to be one or the other, it will not be both.   A viable alternate currency will need to be readily available (i.e. cheap and easy), fast, secure and most importantly stable not volatile.   A speculative commodity or asset that stores value is volatile by its nature and in the right market conditions can rise up very high in price, that type of property is not conducive for a viable currency.
1	1522847767	1	Not sure if he means a Boom in Adoption or a Boom in prices. I assume prices and carry on to the next post. blah blah.
0	1522847301	1	I’ve heard this before, when i SEE it i’ll BELIEVE IT
0	1522848553	1	When you consider that, in terms of market cap or trading volumes or number of individuals holding accounts, that it still lags equities or forex by a couple orders of magnitude, the upside becomes crystal clear. If you missed 2017, there's still room at the table. All you missed was the fruit cup.
0	1522848767	1	Don’t forget about the economy. The stock market is on the verge of crashing, gold and silver are overvalued. Bonds are paying negative interest and most importantly the dollar is crashing. I believe this is the perfect storm for BTC to really capture some market share.
0	1522848845	1	It's not about making people use Bitcoin. We don't want bitcoin here anymore. We want to de-couple from Bitcoin.
0	1522849790	1	Everyone knows cryptos are not going anywhere. The question which ones will last. One could argue even bitcoin will be overpowered by some other coin created by a bank or something. People are so dumb they would rather trust that just because they have heard of "said" company before. Apple, amazon, google, some bank. When or if one of these big companies makes a crypto, DROP money in it because it will be adopted. Most cryptos out now will die. It's naive to think otherwise.
0	1522850201	1	> Everyone knows about Bitcoin nowIf you think this is true, then that is really bad for Bitcoin. That means that awareness is saturated, which means there is little potential for it to go up any more, compared to before when awareness was growing rapidly. > It's now about making them use itNo one really wants to use it. It’s highly inconvenient compared to traditional means of shopping. People only want to get rich, and if, as you said, “everyone knows about it” and yet the price is still not going up, that means most people have seen through the fad and no longer believe it will get them rich. All of this explains bitcoin’s stagnation. 
0	1522850607	1	Neat set of arguments. I don't think anyone would actually doubt that crypto would boom again. The question is when. It has been interesting to see how people are predicting the rise again, and how they're betting on it.
0	1522850981	1	I personally know of a good number of individuals who dipped their toes in the water over the last month or so after finally getting their Coinbase etc. set up. They have been buying a tiny bit and I know these MFers are gonna FOMO hard when we hit the next bull run. They are just hesitant right now because most regular people only want to buy when it's going up
0	1522850994	1	>Everyone knows about Bitcoin now - It's now about making them use it  I am not sure you know how this works....
0	1522851182	1	A new big one for me is Dorsey, the CEO of Square, endorsing it, and sees Bitcoin as the future currency. Imagine if we could accept Bitcoin using Square or immediate convert to fiat with a small fee. I would be all over that as a small business owner.
0	1522851596	1	Also there is so much money invested in it, new jobs created, new companies created.  If crypto died tomorrow then too much money will be lost.Crypto is pretty much a big Kickstarter campaign for money 2.0.
0	1522851720	1	Adoption Is just going up, is it? Can you name 3 big companies that added support for crypto in 2018? Because I can name three that dropped it in 2017. Seems to me that adoption is exactly where it was 5 years ago: a handful of legitimate companies trying to use it, realizing that nobody actually spends the stuff, and putting it on the “back burner.”
0	1522852023	1	/r/circlejerk
0	1522852102	1	Ok, there's the beginning of a US-China trade war, and BTC is *still* tanking. What gives?
0	1522852143	1	None of these points tell me the pros about cryptocurrencies and don't argue with cross-border payments that's bullshit.
0	1522852388	1	Has it... has it not already boomed yet?
0	1522852932	1	wait until FOTA starts threatening the derivatives market. too much money there
0	1522853393	1	Yeah I mean long term it’s bound to boom, but people might be disappointed in how long it will actually take for the market cap to really take off. Blockchain is an extremely useful tech, but whenever it finally takes off, a lot of altcoins will be left behind
0	1522853829	1	I legit don't even care anymore, I just open my portfolio and laugh. I used to obsessively check every day to see how much money I made but now I just check so I can see just how far this ship can sink lol
0	1522853860	1	Don't forget, blockchain has many potential uses that aren't "currency related."  
0	1522853973	1	Here's why I personally believe that Cryptocurrency isn't going to boom again like it did last year...We're moving past the wild speculation phase as more and more projects release their working product. Their use will define their valuations now. The bubble popped. 
0	1522854075	1	My only hesitation (I’m definitely hodling btw but being critical) is no one will spend an appreciating asset. When was the last time you bought a coffee and thought “yeah, cash is great, but I wish I could spend the Alibaba stocks I own like it was currency and then file capital gains with the IRS...”Personally I believe BTC, ETH, ADA, etc. will appreciate because they are either stores of value or provide utility for programming platforms. XLM and XRP (both of which I hold) I have my doubts about, because the goals of investors are at odds with the goals of the developers. Investors want it to appreciate but the devs want it to be used in daily transactions. I like the inflation built into XLM but I don’t think 1% is enough. People on the forum cite inflation as a negative of using fiat but from a behavioral sciences standpoint, it is a powerful tool. The government is motivating people to re-circulate their money back into the economy through spending and investment, rather than hoarding an appreciating asset. For a lot of these coins I think the use of them will explode but not the value. 
0	1522854195	1	>projects like Stellar, Monero and VeChain are just too usefulCan you explain what makes these CCs useful right now?  What exactly can I do with them other than gamble my money?  This is not a sarcastic question.
0	1522854649	1	Ive been telling everyone basically the same thing. Crypto is here and this is the ground floor. In ten years time well be talking about crypto like its always been here. Early adopters who where brave enough or smart enough to invest in a few sound coins will be doing alright. :)
0	1522854692	1	Don't forget though, it becoming popular and it being a good investment are different things.  
0	1522854995	1	Thx for sharing. I really care about the oppinion of ppl i dont know

0	1522855915	1	more people know about crypto ingeneral
0	1522856223	1	Well, let me tell you why I think crypto is going to drop. There was a post yesterday on personal finance about some guy that supposedly had to pay 50k in taxes and only had 20k to show for it. I think it was a seeded fake post but personal finance people believe that shit.
0	1522856284	1	Has there ever been such a revolution? No, not concerning currency. However the larger revolution happening right now is with Automation/AI. It will have a far a larger impact on the world.  
0	1522856775	1	I'm with you man! I think it will take a white but its going to be humungous!!!

0	1522857420	1	I can make it boom. Anybody want to try
0	1522857501	1	>Everyone knows about Bitcoin now - It's now about making them use itYou're kidding right? Not even people here use bitcoin. They use it as a stock.No one gives a shit about actually using cryptos as currencies.. They just want to make some money trading it.Cryptos are worthless because no one actually cares about using them for what they're meant for.The mantra of the sub is literally "hodl" as in, don't use it.
0	1522857816	1	I also believe the Same. 
0	1522858050	1	Good post, but "cryptography students" made me lol.
0	1522858269	1	The very news of fiat pairings is humbling bitcoin and will continue to do so. I'm expecting a $3500 btc soon. As soon  as we see crypto fiat pairings it will be the beginning of a whole new market :)
0	1522858317	1	Agree, bit bit people are join to the cause.
0	1522858360	1	Everyone knows it's going to boom again. We just don't know if it'll boom in 3 months or 3 years.
0	1522858654	1	It’s not gonna go up. It only exploded because millions were blindly throwing their money at crypto and it was on all the App Stores and buzz everywhere. That’s gone. “Trusting the tech” doesn’t drive the masses more than “omfg I’m gonna be rich in a month!”. It’s over...we lost.
0	1522859006	1	“Adoption is just going up” sounds like something someone would say to pump something without having any evidence to back it up. 
0	1522859987	1	fiat pairing is only significant up to a point - if no one wants to buy it doesn't matter that you can buy with cash or convert to bitcoin before buying.BTC transactions are at 2015 levels and some major retailers have stopped using it.Although crypto is extremely useful and important, the truth is that people dont need to use it that much. whens the last time you sent money overseas?I agree that there are projects that can be useful in the future.Doesn't necessarily correlate to an increase of price nor is it completely true.genuine development =/= boom. There are ceo's who sleep 3 hours a day and spend millions to get their companies running and still fail.
0	1522860117	1	And you'd be correct in your assumption. 
0	1522860714	1	I also believe in the future of the cryptocurrency as an asset class. But i'm not too sure who the winners are going to be. There will definitely need to be a culling of shitcoins that are overvalued before we can be more confident of the long-term growth and stability of the market. Right now, I'm just passive indexing the top 20 cryptos with a bot I made for Binance. Saves me brain juice, so I don't have to think about it. 
1	1522863148	2	Did you code your own bot? I've started looking into how to get a bot that will do this for me but have no experience coding and am worried about getting one online with the recent scandals.
2	1522865485	1	Yeah I did! I actually launched a hosted version of it last week.You can read about it here: https://medium.com/hodlblog/hodlbot-cryptocurrency-investing-on-autopilot-dce2e4c9a7f7
0	1522862155	1	I can already promise revolution is coming. I have a friend who’s creating a whole new block chain that will be much better then ETH and it will be a better thing for new players in the game to adopt. I have a lot of information I could give if he’s willing and I’d have to ask him. He already estimated the actual release and announcement of this project to be this summer. If anyone is interested or have questions I can relay them to him.
0	1522862362	1	What a low effort shit post can we ban op please 
0	1522864453	1	I agree with all of this.  I agreed with it five years ago too.
0	1522864809	1	You forgot about Abra. Abra is massive for the crypto world (sidenote: Monaco, TenX etc will also be big for crypto). It's the start of taking crypto to the masses so it's easy for them to use without getting confused over what a wallet and private key is etc etc. Your average joe already know how cold hard cash works and don't like change, even if it's for the better. Abra fixes this 'confusing' part of crypto somewhat. Your mobile phone number can now be your wallet. Any business could accept crypto through Abra, so long as they have a mobile...    &nbsp;  It won't be too far off where merchants will start to solely only take crypto as payment, I believe which will force people to learn crypto if they want to buy whatever it is that's being sold.    &nbsp;  What I'm trying to get at is ... Once crypto gets to the point that users are using crypto (I should really say blockchain, sorry) without even knowing it, that's when the whole market will *truly* thrive.    &nbsp;  Look at VISA's PayWave. People use that (it's not old school cold hard cash) not knowing how the fuck it works, they just know it works. You swipe it, it does its magic behind the scenes which no one cares what the magic is or how it works, and now I get to walk out of the store without the police being called with this bag of goodies.    &nbsp;  VeChain I believe (yes, I'm bias) will be the first to make blockchain and crypto as a whole go mainstream without the mainstream actually knowing they're adopting and using blockchain tech - especially if the likes of DHL are looking at implementing VeChain into their business model. Soon the mainstream goats will go to their post office and ask for a postage stamp, but will get a unique QR Code instead or the option of an RFID chip for extra tracking features. Research and lightbulb moments of 'wow, blockchain really is game changing' ensue.    &nbsp;  Am trying hard not to make this all about VeChain, as I know /r/CC for some reason dislikes it (sadface.jpg) but I truly believe VeChain is what's going to (help) dig crypto out of this rut sooner rather than later. That National level partnership where they're running VeChain in the city of Gui'an - if/when that trial is a success, they'll no doubt spread wider into China. I'm being way optimistic here, but imagine if the whole of China ran on VeChain what that would do for crypto awareness and how much FOMO other countries' governments would have seeing China's success in being turned into a smart country    &nbsp;  Sorry, I rambled.
0	1522864904	1	PRADA bags with VeChain when? :)
0	1522865298	1	> Everyone knows about Bitcoin nowNo. Not everyone. Just talk to some random strangers on the street and you will see that this is not correct.
0	1522865649	1	Problem is that adoption is going up too slowly to justify the valuations.  Is there a single dapp  that is being used (for things other than coin speculation) by millions of people daily?  Nope.  Until that happens, crypto market cap can be anywhere between $100 - $700 byn.
