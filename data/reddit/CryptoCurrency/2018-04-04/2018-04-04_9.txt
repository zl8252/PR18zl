1	1522866247	1	Those HOLDING will probably laugh at this in a few years, seeing the gains they have 
0	1522861031	38	So true -- and more importantly..Those that were HODLing that were not scared off by Jan - Feb 80% drop....Won't be selling now because of the current prices.All those that would have sold because they are way down.. will just HODL.The ones that would have sold.. already have sold..
1	1522863596	1	At least you should move away from BTC. Crypto may survive, BTC is a dead man walking
2	1522865694	3	and be replaced with what exactly?  Btrash?
2	1522865156	1	Nope, BTC will always remain #1.

5	1522866068	1	!remindme 5 years
3	1522865715	1	BTC won't remain #1 when its no longer the main trading currency.
3	1522865797	0	!remindme 5 yearsI just want in on this too. random messages are fun.
2	1522865611	1	Nah, BTC will probably remain #1 forever because of segwit. Its going to become the final settlement layer for most other cryptos. As much as I'd like to see BTC's broken hashing algorithm die, its most likely here to stay.
3	1522865749	-1	Unconvinced, but time will tell.
4	1522865820	2	> UnconvincedBut why? I'd love to be convinced otherwise, tbh.
5	1522866068	1	There are just starting to be many other coins that do the exact same thing faster and cheaper, and it’s not going to stop, more coins will outperform these coins and more will outperform those. Bitcoin paved a way but honestly why would anyone pay for a transaction and wait anywhere from 10 minutes to a day for its confirmation when there are alternatives that transfer instantly for free. Ultimately the coin that wins will be free and instant, because only then will it be a viable online alternative to cash.
6	1522866306	1	Because you want the basic layer to be as decentralized and secure as possible, there is nothing which comes close or will ever come close. 
2	1522864368	-2	Maybe, but not this year
3	1522864566	1	Or maybe next month. Even most coiners agree that BTC is going to die. Do you really feel safe keeping something like that. 
4	1522865096	3	I have never own BTC, but it would be foolish to sub estimate its impact on the crypto ecosystem, if BTC were to die next month January bubble would look cute in comparison.BTC will lose dominance but it will be a slow process.
5	1522865213	-1	Let’s see. I think it will go with a bang
4	1522864989	2	BTC does so much less in comparison to other coins, it's not gonna stay in the top 10, I can't think. I'd get rid of it now, chances are alts will move up similarly, and you don't want to end up being a bagholder at some point.
4	1522865472	1	> Even most coiners agree that BTC is going to dieDid you pull that out of your ass?
1	1522863591	1	Not necessarily true. I have to talk my friend down from selling every few days it feels like. The lower it goes the more he panics. I keep telling him $5k btc is gonna be OK, he'll be fine, but he freaks out about "how much money I'm losing every day" at this point. 
1	1522862090	0	If there are so many hodlers near the top than that means its going to cause massive price resistance at 20,000 because people are going to want to take profits. Which might cause it to create a double top and tank even harder.
2	1522862492	5	possible -- yet what usually happens is that the euphoria takes over.Look at all the BTC cycles --- each up goes higher than the past one.ANd you'd think there was a cap on this...But really -- the money is coming from FIAT currency -- and there is quite a lot of that to go around.This cycle may be slightly different though, as there are a few coins that could top BTC off its perch --- So maybe best to look at the next bull cycle in term of overall mktcap increase.. rather than just BTC...BTC is now at a big disadvantage due to BTC futures and Mt. Gox. over some other coins like Ethereum and XRP.NOt saying BTC is still not great (it is)... just that the other coins that could take the number 1 spot.. do not have this gray cloud looming overhead....
2	1522862555	5	Never underestimate peoples greed..when it goes back to 20k then people who bought at ATH will no longer look to break even...breakouts in BTC's history have tended to go up exponentially once an old top is reached.
2	1522862964	1	nah they gonna hold right into 2x gainz
2	1522864612	1	If they are hodlers since 20,000 the resistance is likely to be 25,000 or even higher, it's not profit till it's profit...?
0	1522863174	8	remarkable words from mr trump. In my case, when you are down 20k , you make sure to pick up a sidejob so you can pay rent :)
1	1522864374	3	Down 20k... try 400k and still having no job lmao 
2	1522865700	2	I lost about $1MM during this crash :/At least I have a job, I guess!
3	1522865895	1	Peter?
4	1522866205	1	Keith?
2	1522864920	0	heard that brother :) (i is a tiny fish)
0	1522865080	3	Binance is bring FIAT > Crypto pairs this year fear not.
0	1522864060	2	I have to say, I'm down. Though, I shifted everything that I didn't believe in and I think everything is traded at a loss now...so, if it doesn't come up enough by tax time next year I'm not in trouble. Haha.
0	1522864731	1	I’m looking at all my projects and seeing what they accomplished from last quarter. I DCA’d most of my bags, so I think I’m in pretty good positions. It was tough when it dropped lower and lower everyday. But paying attention to what a lot of my fellow Redditors say and doing my own homework, I’m actually seeing how the bots work and some of the manipulation. I’ve never surfed before, but in crypto I’m seeing you gotta ride the wave sometimes. If and when we make it back to ATH, I’m consolidating and putting it back into different projects I’ve looked at. But I’m not taking any money out the market
0	1522865708	1	Just curious, what's ur overall PF performance right now?Mine -55%
1	1522866271	1	About -66%
0	1522865984	1	$500B down?  Maybe he *is* talking about crypto. #bullish

0	1522866223	1	I see you have played your trump card
0	1522860498	-4	I love this guy!
1	1522862752	22	Greatest memes president of all time; no one can deny that.
2	1522862999	5	but those Bamma Biden memes
3	1522864726	2	Thanks Obama.
2	1522863142	3	To be fair, he did get elected during the golden age of memes
3	1522864534	4	He was a driving force in the Great Meme War of 2016.

0	1522863815	-2	*we banned memes* my ass
0	1522865056	-5	Bought at $600, sold at $6800. After tax I didnt make too much, but at least I got out before this whole shit show crumbles to the ground.
1	1522866132	1	Good luck when btc hits 100 000$ in a few years
