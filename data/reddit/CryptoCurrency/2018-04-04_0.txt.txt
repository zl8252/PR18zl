0	1522793690	179	What a joke of a statistic
1	1522843151	14	>The company conducted the experiment with 50 participantsEh... it think its enough.
1	1522857289	1	Payday: Damn banks are closed I'll have to cash out my crypto tomorrowThe next day: oh great my paycheck dropped in value 350 dollars while I was sleeping. Thanks crypto!
0	1522792737	250	I doubt 36% of employees even know what crypto is
1	1522794539	57	I'm shorting the scientific rigor of their study. Perhaps 7/20 people that visit an obscure coin website said they'd accept it.
2	1522832246	2	Agreed no chance 
2	1522840051	0	If only it was possible to click the link and find out
1	1522793683	15	Maybe 3.6%, and Iâ€™d be surprised if it was even that much. 
2	1522839212	0	SURPRISE!!!
1	1522824491	9	i guess nobody even looked at the article as usual, they asked a total of 50 people from 5 companies.its even less diversified and credible than me asking some strangers in the bus on my way home.
1	1522798243	2	They know that Bitcoin is a craze.
1	1522800035	3	over 5% of americans own crypto apparently, wouldn't surprise me at all.
2	1522814418	2	non crypto-news source?
3	1522816231	3	https://www.nasdaq.com/article/survey-polls-american-awareness-of-cryptocurrencies-and-icos-cm87261231.60 percent of Americans have heard of Ethereum and 18.20 percent of Americans are planning to invest in ether ( )The survey showed that American awareness of Ethereum trends toward a younger (millennial) demographic with 58.49 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 having heard of the cryptocurrency and 32.08 percent of the same demographic planning to invest in Ethereum as an asset for the future.47 percent less Americans have heard of Ethereum compared to Bitcoin based on a LendEDU conducted a month prior on Bitcoin. When asked whether or not they would invest in either cryptocurrency as an asset for the future, Americans 25-34 showed the most interest. The number of these respondents saying they would invest in Bitcoin was only 6.68 percent greater than those saying they would invest in Ethereum.On the opposite end of the spectrum, only about 1.34 percent of Americans 55 and older plan to invest in Ethereum as an asset for the future. Across all age groups, 37.80 percent of respondents were unsure about investing in Ethereum, which could indicate a lack of knowledge about cryptocurrency as much as general uncertainty about future investing.Ripple:22.20 percent of Americans have heard of Ripple and 14.80 percent of Americans are planning to invest in Ripple (XRP) At the time of writing, with a market capitalization of approximately $8 billion, Ripple is the third-largest cryptocurrency (depending on whether or not you count Bitcoin Cash). That's one-fifteenth the size of Bitcoin's market capitalization. Since the start of 2017, the price of Ripple has grown from $0.006 to $0.201. As can be seen by these numbers, LendEDU's survey respondents showed awareness and investment interest in Ripple at similar levels to those for Ethereum.In a recent , the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, made the point to elaborate on the differentiating value propositions for each of the three largest cryptocurrencies:"In 2017, people have realized there isn't going to be one crypto to rule them all. You're seeing vertical solutions where XRP is focused on payment problems, Ethereum is focused on smart contracts, and increasingly Bitcoin is a store of value. Those aren't competitive. In fact, I want Bitcoin and Ethereum to be successful."ICOsIt's no secret that initial coin offerings (ICOs) have risen in popularity this year as much for their innovative investment opportunity as their regulatory controversy and scams. In September 2017, China declared ICOs to be illegal, while the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  claiming to be backed by real estate and diamonds to be frauds. 24.90 percent of Americans have heard of ICOs and 15.10 percent of Americans are planning to invest in startups via ICOsAs seen in this chart, almost two-thirds of the American population polled are not sure whether or not ICOs are illegal, while 21 percent believe that investing in them is illegal. As a comparison, in the Bitcoin survey from September, only 10.69 percent of respondents incorrectly believed it was illegal to own bitcoin in the U.S.SummaryAcross all questions, LendEDU found a group of respondents who have yet to hear about these specific cryptocurrencies but are open to the idea, or at least unsure, about investing in them. All this to say, in the U.S., cryptocurrency cannot be considered mainstream: Ethereum is not quite as well-known as Bitcoin, most are unsure about whether or not ICOs break the law, and Ripple's market capitalization is not a strong indicator of its success as a currency. 
4	1522831962	0	Why bother lol, they don't agree crypto is already in widespread adoption despite their bags, you get your hard dick in your hands and buy the despair. This is as good a cue as any for the people who know the real rate of adoption. You know what to do.
3	1522815215	1	or even crpyto news source so i can dig deeper
2	1522850250	1	less than 1% of the world owns crypto.
3	1522856406	1	Idk, maybe this time last year yeah.
4	1522857310	1	Yeah, or maybe 4 years ago!!!!
1	1522816573	1	Sure they do; they "know" it's a scam and "know" it's nothing different than some flowers they heard something about a long long time ago.
2	1522852203	2	Tulip mania happened because of a few influential traders with ties to East India Trading Company and rare strains of Tulip with a disease causing them to grow random striated colors. They took many years to grow. Tulip Mania did not crash the Dutch economy. It was more about some rich guys buying futures of rare flowers in taverns and 20% of the Dutch population dying of plague. Here's the thing. Tulips never stopped being a commodity. The internet was not just a fad. Adoption will come. 
1	1522831577	1	If you we not alive or died leading up to December 2017, I could understand your comment. The media pushed hard.
1	1522844103	1	i'm guessing those are the 36% that said they'd accept it because they heard about bitcoin before. What sane person wants part of their paycheck to come in a form that's value may drop in half within a week. 
1	1522852884	1	They probably asked 11 people in a computer department somewhere, and 4 said yes.Edit: just read the article, 50 participants ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚
1	1522796263	1	> I doubt 36% of employees even know what crypto isEven my janitor knows, it's not a niche underground thing anymore, sorry boys.
2	1522809416	5	There's a difference between hearing about Bitcoin on the news and actually having some understanding of it and other cryptos.
3	1522826950	-1	Do all people understand computers even they use it? I don't think so?
4	1522843698	1	Have computers had decades to become user friendly? I think so? And yet there are still people that are absolutely clueless when it comes to even regular computer use.A janitor hearing about BTC on the 6pm news is vastly different than a janitor knowing how to buy, send, and store cryptos.
3	1522815354	-2	There are plenty of people who have no understanding of stocks or investing yet put money in a 401k.
2	1522813346	2	Your janitor like a lot people still probably thinks it's "like digital money and probably a scam".
3	1522827040	1	Supposedly 36% don't think it's a scam and probably more don't want it because it's volatile.
3	1522859301	1	He would not be entirely wrong though.
2	1522808403	1	People have heard of it but most still dont actually know what it is or how it works, let alone want to trade a significant portion of their salary for this thing they hear is super volatile and unstable
0	1522786483	158	I'd accept a small percentage similar to how I put 5% away into a 401k.  Why not? If this became the norm, mass adoption would be here.Accepting anything significant would be too much of a risk for me though. Too volatile at the moment.  I need to eat lol.  
1	1522788027	42	I put 3% in crypto every payday, so it would save on fees for me if my company did it for me and just gave me the ETH or whatever.
2	1522797318	46	Yeah, I've been steadily putting 200$ in every couple weeks.    Price drops everytime I do though so my bad everyone. 
3	1522807184	12	Well technically if you didn't buy it would have dropped even more... So thank you. 
4	1522813037	11	/\ This.You've been saving the industry the whole time, plot twist.
5	1522844643	3	Shift + 6 on your keyboard will get you this nifty guy ^
3	1522814571	4	Dollar cost averaging. The smartest strategey, honestly
4	1522816083	5	I though the smartest strategy was buying at the ATL and selling at the ATH.
5	1522816631	4	Didn't you learn anything in the last few months? You have it backwards 
6	1522824620	3	Losing money is fun if you gain knowledge. My knowledge portfolio has been on a bull run for months! 
5	1522837790	1	No one can tell when ATH and ATL is.
3	1522824072	1	See if you can reschedule to the weekend dip
2	1522803399	5	I know several devs who get paid 100% in ETH. They love it.
3	1522814370	15	Start working January 2018Get paid in ethEarn less than McDonald's worker
4	1522829991	1	I started Dec and get paid monthly. It's definitely fun
3	1522818159	1	Iâ€™m a dev and I get paid 100% in crypto.Plenty of ups and downs, but I love it.
4	1522850178	2	How do you declare income at tax time?
3	1522822650	1	Arenâ€™t there minimum wage laws about this.
2	1522820332	1	If you ever wanted to do some part time trading, simply waiting to buy on the big 15-25% dips are good for account building. A little patience goes a long way. 
3	1522851771	1	How about now? :/
4	1522853501	1	I'm buying in at $6k and $5k. Right now is not so bad it can continue lower
2	1522824368	1	it wouldn't save you anything because for absolute sure the fees will still come out of your pay.
1	1522797233	5	Garlicoin it is then
2	1522807970	1	You know it 
1	1522813746	2	Agree. I would accept it like my 401k . a small percentage of it to go to my retirement funds. 
1	1522825343	2	Exactly , 98% of people will not take the risk of getting paid in crypto because there's a chance you will go hungry for a day/week/month. It's a huge gamble.
0	1522798930	49	They surveyed 50 fucking people. Like almost all surveys, this doesn't mean shit *edit fixed typo
1	1522811780	7	Surveyed?
2	1522813650	13	No they survived them.
3	1522815558	4	they played 50 person Fortnite match 
1	1522825386	1	How did they survive?
0	1522792652	17	as long as its USDT
1	1522801194	8	As long as itâ€™s DOGE
1	1522793235	5	1 USDT = 1 USDTmost stable coin
2	1522808465	7	1 DOGE = 1 DOGE
0	1522804217	9	Like others, I'm going to call bullshit, but for 4 specific reasons.#1. Their sample seems to be 20-somethings. This group would likely be far more open to taking part in crypto.#2. They never say how much of a % people were willing to accept in crytpo. There's a big difference between "Sure, give me 1% as a gamble" vs. "Give me 25% in crypto"#3. I didn't see  where they specified when these interviews were done. If done in December 2017, I'm sure they would get a lot more yesses than if they asked in March 2018.#4. These people were jobless, so how many would say "yes" with the thinking that they'll take it for now because some income is better than none, but they'll look for another job immediately?
1	1522832076	-2	Lol as if everyone else is not jobless either. 
2	1522838282	3	I dont' know if you have a job, but I can assure you that most adults do have jobs. Even in bad economies like Greece, 80% of adults are already employed.
0	1522789147	23	I doubt the validity of this
1	1522821747	2	the acting in this read like a cheap porno. definitely was not a real experiment.
0	1522789548	14	What's the point, just buy crypto with your salary 
1	1522805318	6	But the fees man...
2	1522825503	-2	What fees?
3	1522835154	0	'asking dumb questions' fees
4	1522838219	0	FYI, I pay zero fees to buy BTC or ETH from GDAX.
5	1522838939	-1	good for you, but you do know what fees are? you can google them first so you dont have to pay them for stupid questions.
6	1522839451	-1	Pay what fees?
7	1522839808	-1	for you being dumb, you pay them for the rest of your life
8	1522840431	-1	yes, but what fees?
9	1522841647	1	im sorry i cant help any further, i think its best for you to seek profesional help. just remember, this failure of yours is nothing to commit suicide, you can get through this
1	1522815517	1	not sure how possible but you could negotiate for part of salary to be in crypto (say 0.1 BTC). Both you and employer take a gamble, if BTC falls then employer wins and vice versaI know it looks unhealthy but I can totally see some new start up in silicon valley do that
0	1522793516	3	I already do, I get  some extra for supervising and asked my boss to pay me for that in btc. But then again, I don't know/ever heard of anyone else doing it, so 36% sounds way off.
1	1522824582	1	the "study" asked 50 people, it has absolutely ZERO meaning.
0	1522796915	3	Load of bullshit lmao. There's no way
0	1522789572	9	no
0	1522798107	2	I seriously dont think 36% is accurate. Unless were talking about 5% or lower of there salary and I still would think 36% is high.
0	1522800596	2	There is approximately a 0% chance that 36% if the worldâ€™s, maybe even American, employees know what cryptocurrencies are 
0	1522815005	2	I asked two coworkers and found out that 50% of coworkers would accept part of their salary in nostalgic, potentially valuable in years, VHS tapes of Jim Carey movies, specifically Ace Ventura and Jurassic Park. 
0	1522834491	2	Definitely, with no taxes to be paid 
0	1522838389	2	I second that, back in 2017 January I paid one of my employee in BTC when it was $1200 and later on he quitted because Bitcoin price was close to $10K or I was probably not a good leader. :|
0	1522845245	2	Maybe 36% of 18-24 year olds
0	1522795177	3	36 percent my ass. 2 month old reddit account gtfo.
0	1522794833	4	I wouldnâ€™t,  not with 70% drops in a few months time. Would gladly put some of my salary in a crypto retirement fund every month
0	1522801448	3	Why not just convert a portion of your salary into crypto? 
1	1522826032	2	Because people do silly things like trade control for convenience.
0	1522820916	2	In *Bitcoin, I hope ------Yeah bring on the downvotes bitches. I know you're all into whitepapers and conferences and partnerships and "mainnets"  and you think anything with a blockchain does everything bitcoin does  but let me tell you something kids... I've put 25% of every paycheck into BTC since 2013, except for last year because I quit, tomorrow will be my 1yr of no job. It was the best decision ever and I'm still not done, because it will happen again, because all the reasons I did it are still there, except stronger than ever. Enjoy this bear market, these next few months will be the best time to do just that while the market takes out the trash, again, and the cycle repeats, again. Just don't be fucking stupid
0	1522806886	1	No they wouldn't, or they'd put that amount of their salary into crypto already.
0	1522812168	1	False.
0	1522812219	1	Sample size of 50, only done with charitable organisations, misleading title perhaps?
0	1522812508	1	Yes pay me 50% in bitcoin 
0	1522813406	1	Never.... only to find next day your 100 % has dropped to 10 %, due to some rule in a country I have nothing to do with. 
0	1522820716	1	word is cheap. 
0	1522821348	1	Employer: "Now, your salary. You have done a remarkable job here, so I think its time for you to get a notable raise. You are ok with receiving it as Bitcoin yes?"Employee: "Sure why not"Employer: "GREAT! Well that would be 2,000$ raise then? No, wait a minute, I mean 1,500$, fuck it went up again! 3,000$, shit back to 1,000$-"Employer: "Ok fuck this, you get what you get."
0	1522822071	1	95% of all people on the world know what bitcoin is99% of all people own atleast 1 single bitcointhere's a 100% chance that bitcoin will be back to 20k tomorrow
0	1522822924	1	Like it 
0	1522824677	1	36% of the time it works everytime.
0	1522825299	1	how did this get 740 upvotes?
0	1522826257	1	36% is a surprisingly big number. 
0	1522827484	1	Altcoins, to be more specific.
0	1522828481	1	How about salary in fiat. Bonuses in Crytpo. You could even use a smart contract to implement 4 years vesting with 1-year cliff similar to how some companies handle RSU's. Should help retention of staff and could see some interesting new trends. 
0	1522829134	1	Garlicoin pls 
0	1522830349	1	cash is king! what if the crypto drop then you be losing out on them $$$
0	1522830935	1	To be honest i would rather have my pension paid in as crypto aslong as someone at the treasury is moving the crypto from Ripple to Monero etc... as the prices raise and fall.    On average if i paid Â£2 a week in to my work place pension in 40 years time that's Â£4160 which is fucking nothing... Now if that Â£2 a week was  paid as Ripple and as the prices changed some experienced trader moved it back and forth for profit my Â£4160 could end up as Â£10,000 or i risk it all and i end up with nothing but the state pension because the prices tanked.    So as a working class man working minimum wage jobs Â£4160 in 40 years time is fucking nothing and is kinda pointless so i'd rather risk it in crypto then gain Â£1 a week on top of my Â£65 state pension or whatever i'd get in 40 years time.    I'm 31 years old and have nothing to show for my life apart from my beautiful kids. My single goal in life right now is to save for a home. Over the next 7-10 years i'm trying to save Â£20,000 for a deposit on a mortgage for my first home. I'm currently mining ETH to help boost that... I'm making Â£7 a week roughly (Nanopool calculator)    Sorry went off topic a little.  I do need to learn how to trade and find an exchange where i can move Â£10 at most without being fucked by fee's. I would love to trade some ETH for Ripple and other low cap low price newish alt coins but that last exchange i used burnt me after relising i need to spend Â£10 in ETH fee's to move my Â£3 in Zcash off the exchange.    Would love to find a penny exchange or something of the sorts.
0	1522833688	1	Aaand this is why the social sciences are ridiculed. Not because experiments can't we done well but because they are so easy to do maliciously. 
0	1522835072	1	Lol this is the strawiest strawman of a poll ever 
0	1522835983	1	Can't downvote more
0	1522836788	1	Funny video) Thanks for good emotions.
0	1522836905	1	I wouldn't mind to get paid via crypto
0	1522841305	1	What the fuck is this? There's no way this is true unless this was done at coinbase or a crypto based company 
0	1522843370	1	>  50 participants and 5 international charitable organizations that are not related to the cryptocurrencies.lol take a math and methodology class. What population are you generalizing to?
0	1522844087	1	Idiots
0	1522848110	1	If I could lock my salary in Ethereum right now I will probably be be making the equivalent of over $1 million /yr a few years from now.  Ya sign me up..
0	1522850230	1	36% of employees are dumb as fuck. Why gamble on the price of BTC with your paycheck? Put the money aside yourself and purchase on dips/dollar average cost.
0	1522852418	1	No they wouldn't. 
0	1522855279	1	I love crypto but I would only put 10 percent of my bi monthly check in it max
0	1522856080	1	This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://coindimes.com/social-experiment-36-of-employees-would-accept-part-of-their-salary-in-cryptocurrencies/) reduced by 80%. (I'm a bot)*****> The company Midex, which offers international crypto-currency exchange services, carried out a social experiment in which several employees, who were being hired by different companies around the world, were offered the option of receiving their salaries in crypto-currencies.> Overall, the study found that 36% of the workers were willing to accept a portion of the salary with cryptocurrencies; while 2 of the employees agreed to accept the entire salary with those assets.> Of course, the volatility factor can work both ways: on the one hand, as with any investment, there is the risk of loss, but on the other hand, with the increase in the value of a given cryptocurrency, the employee could see his or her salary increase in a short time.*****[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/89qiax/social_experiment_36_of_employees_would_accept/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ "Version 2.00, ~305623 tl;drs so far.") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr "PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.") | *Top* *keywords*: **cryptocurrency**^#1 **employee**^#2 **salary**^#3 **accept**^#4 **several**^#5
0	1522857025	1	Title should read: **18 people said they would accept part of their salary in cryptocurrencies**
0	1522859332	1	I bet lot more people receive by cryptocurrency.
0	1522859655	1	Treat it as self-employment income and account for market value gain/loss between receiving and spending.https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdfAlready successfully finished my 2017 taxes.
0	1522797724	1	I would happily take the majority of my paycheck in crypto. 
1	1522806274	-2	You trying to be homeless or something?
0	1522787799	-3	Dumb clickbait article, not even going to bother reading.If I asked my closest group of friends, 100% would say they would accept part of their salary in crypto.
1	1522796204	2	your closest friends must represent everyone in the world
2	1522796373	2	Asking his friends is just as valid as this article. Clickbait.
2	1522812332	1	The article in question surveyed 50 people from charitable organisations only, might as well just ask your friends
2	1522797171	0	You're completely missing the point. My point is that articles like these are dumb. Sample sizes are way too small. Even if 10 million people were surveyed, it'd be too small.
3	1522808370	1	I agree with that. Your statement didn't come off that way
3	1522814282	0	Wtf you talking about moron? Have you even taken a high school level statistics class?Even less than 10,000 respondents would give results with a high level of confidence
3	1522800687	-1	Do you know anything about statistics? Do you think valid surveys survey their entire relevant population? I agree that this sample size is skewed, but you donâ€™t have to survey an entire population to get an accurate measure of something 
0	1522795591	0	I wouldn't accept because I would be relying on a company to invest a portion of my salary into cryptos I didn't choose. It would be similar to being paid in 10% stocks and shares chosen by someone else
0	1522791096	0	If I can use my 401k to put a small percentage in, heck yea. 
0	1522795312	0	I would most definitely not lol. Why wouldn't I just get paid in cash and invest what I personally want?
1	1522795905	1	i would only do it if i was getting the investment/ crypto at a massively reduced fee than i normally would have to pay
2	1522800878	1	Or the perks of a 401k
0	1522796008	-5	As an engineer, let's say I make $100k. I'd be happy to take $50k in USD instead and get an additional $100k in pure cryptocurrency. Otherwise, it's still a bit risky at this point. Also, I'd only do it in a bear market. Im not looking to get paid at ATH.
1	1522800822	8	Yeah, I'd also take a 50k payraise
