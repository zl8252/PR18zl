0	1522790513	26	You can download them for free at https://lukaszadam.com/illustrations
1	1522793900	6	I don't really know anything I can use them for atm but if I do do you want to be credited in some way?
2	1522824314	4	The license he provides them under is the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), which makes no stipulations that you must credit the author of the copyrighted work. It would be good form to do so, though.
3	1522824323	3	**MIT License**The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, an excellent license compatibility.

0	1522790225	8	Looks like Fallout theme coins
0	1522801027	12	Can you make more!! Like monero
0	1522818417	4	Make a Dogecoin one with a cute shiba!
0	1522791866	3	those squiggly lines make it look like a strained eyeball
0	1522814090	4	The red one, although cool looking, the logo fades into the blue inner circle.
0	1522793872	3	Looks cool!
0	1522797580	3	Needs more contrast. 
0	1522803783	3	why the random dots and sperm?
0	1522811675	3	Too busy. Would not render well in smaller versions, especially for apps.
0	1522792759	2	Lovely
0	1522809041	2	that Bitcoin is a bit dim...
1	1522810363	2	agreed OP, I think it's a good start but a lot of icons are quite too dim or washed out feeling. 
0	1522810528	2	Where’s Ripple?
1	1522812372	1	The pre-mine scam?
2	1522831097	3	MY WIFE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN MEEEEEE
0	1522811590	2	Looks like pokemon gym badges.
0	1522812340	2	Substratum! 
0	1522813503	2	Awesome. But I think the color should not look as faded as it does. Considering that cryptocurrency is a scope of what the future could look like and how disruptive it is to traditional industries, the colors should reflect a futuristic/electronic/industrial feeling to it
0	1522816055	2	It’s great just sold them for money, thanks!
0	1522816227	2	I am using an old laptop and a crappy old monitor in a dual screen setup for the moment, so excuse my poor display tech, but on either screen the "S" logo in the center of the Substratum coin looks quite dark. Like I almost have to tilt my display to be off viewing angle so I can see the subtle S against the dark background. Otherwise, it's a really nice Icon set. So, hopefully you don't mind my little bit of criticism, I just wanted to chime in and let you know. :-)
0	1522818112	2	That's not how cryptocurrency works. 
0	1522819967	2	I would do without the squiggles but otherwise nice work 👍
0	1522821404	2	CryptoSperm
0	1522823378	2	can you please attach a license to these? e.g. creative commons share alike, etc?good work m8
0	1522828074	2	Doge?
0	1522828754	2	No thanks but no. Not a good trend to start. They need to be the same throughout everywhere and easy to be recognized and not to be confused.

0	1522797565	1	Good job. The graphic designer in me thinks the inner dark circle is offset from the outer though and it's giving me the heebie jeebies.
0	1522799843	1	Bloody shwicked, especially love the Substratum :D
0	1522802521	1	I've been working as a graphic designer for around 5 years. Doesn't give me any sort of authority, but these look good! Thanks for providing these for free. 
0	1522803739	1	Thanks How Cool!
0	1522806991	1	I like them, but what's the S?
1	1522807892	2	Substratum
2	1522809323	2	Hmm I know nothing about it but my brother likes that one!
3	1522851790	0	Check out their website. It's a great project dedicated to providing an open and censorship free Internet. The substrate token is used as monetization for the platform. Likely to launch open beta with their software this month!
0	1522807879	1	Your Icons are missing Icon, duh!
0	1522808912	1	The download as zip button isn't working for me :(
0	1522810259	1	Cool, honestly though the little squiggles kind of looks like seamen. 
1	1522818812	1	They look like sailors? *semen
2	1522819041	1	Yes lol 
3	1522819078	1	Sorry, couldn't resist.
0	1522813000	1	awesome ! I think if it be more attractive if you can make it shine and more metallic
0	1522814534	1	Beautiful.
0	1522815360	1	Love them, thank you,
0	1522817581	1	Monero?
0	1522818050	1	Remove the sperm flying out from the letters. No need to be honest and doesnt look smooth.
0	1522819078	1	Can you make one for IOTA? These are awesome.
0	1522819596	1	The substratum one is really hard to see on night mode for my screen. Impossible really.  Other that that I love them!
0	1522822760	1	Nice. Substratum getting some love
0	1522823494	1	Hey dude, I love it! I just joined your mailing list, I would love to use your icons for my business cards! I run a small computer repair shop and these are perfect, I really appreciate it.
0	1522823634	1	Stunning! Well done mate!
0	1522823807	1	I only know 2 of them. Bitcoin and litecoin
0	1522824778	1	Stylish and very nice. Great work
0	1522825686	1	Looks great but I would make NEO green and Substratum logo more read.
0	1522826635	1	Neo should be green though
0	1522828234	1	They are cool and collectible items, but, the real Lambo profits will only come from hidden gems of the next Top 20 potential coins. DYOR for coins like TAU, DRGN, CPX. 
0	1522829138	1	I also dont understand the sperms 
0	1522831424	1	Missing DOGE. :(
0	1522832661	1	I love your coin choices. Especially because I have all my holdings in these 6 :D
0	1522832722	1	Cant see XRP
0	1522835454	1	pity the contrast between the main color and symbol makes them hard to read
0	1522837188	1	No Dogecoin? What kind of a monster are you?
1	1522837881	1	There is no excuse, you are right!
0	1522837241	1	They look great!
1	1522837936	1	Thank you!
0	1522837907	1	Thanks :)
0	1522838000	1	Awesome icons
0	1522839403	1	Ripple?
0	1522841459	1	not bad, I like it
1	1522851609	1	thanks!
0	1522844508	1	They look like the Infinity Stones
0	1522844968	1	Will you make one for Monero?
1	1522851601	1	Yes I will in the future, I think all of the coins. You can subscribe to my newsletter.
0	1522852580	1	Web 2.0 gradientsSpermWhy? 
0	1522854594	1	Cool work bro.. The 'S' on the Substratum coin would benefit from some further contrast, maybe thicken the lines on the 'S' a bit so it stands out more?Also, I'm not really digging the 2 color fill on each coin, you should play around with that more. Looks great though.
0	1522856648	1	We need a Wanchain Icon
1	1522858136	1	I will add more in the next couple of days! stay tuned
0	1522861114	1	These are awesome. Good start.I'd also recommend https://github.com/cjdowner/cryptocurrency-icons. There's a ton of variety and also very good quality. I'm currently using it for the crypto app I'm building :)
0	1522861895	1	Pretty neat looking, some constructive criticism, I would had made neo green. The logo on the last one is not visible at all. The Bitcoin design is not consistent with the others and the logo could do with increased contrast.
1	1522865971	1	True! Thanks for that
0	1522865202	1	Can I use these in my crypto currency wallet? (The wallet will be free)
1	1522865963	1	Sure! 
0	1522865574	1	Would you be able to do a slightly altered set?More recognisable colours, less sperms, include BCH and Monero.
1	1522865950	1	Yes I am currently working on it, I will post it in a few days
0	1522815907	1	Needs more XLM
0	1522806656	0	They don't really look that 'usable' as crypto logos by anything serious. I appreciate the work you're sharing to us, just trying to give you some criticism so you don't waste your talent and time!
0	1522791736	-4	Wow someone not charging $20 and plugging their low quality ecommerce shop.  About damn time
1	1522791787	2	What do you mean 
2	1522794395	1	I appreciated that you actually have free.  No one here likes ecommerce advertisements.  
3	1522812470	1	*cough* pokerchips *cough*
1	1522794141	2	But then we find out hes not charging $20 cause it's actually $24 and a subscription fee of $99 per year per image used. Lol
2	1522794435	1	R u srs.  Whelp.  
3	1522794643	1	No haha twas a joke maybe I shoulda added a /s after lol
4	1522794747	2	Was heartbroken for a sec haha.  
0	1522793925	-1	Could you make me one for Vertcoin? I would love to get it added as an emote in the official discord :) 
0	1522803217	-1	Could you make a Verge icon please?
0	1522805545	-5	Could you make one for Bitcoin Cash? I'm sure a lot of merchants would find that very helpful! 
0	1522802875	0	Nice but you're missing a few 
0	1522812780	0	Love it! Can you make a NANo one?
0	1522795783	-5	Out at TRON
