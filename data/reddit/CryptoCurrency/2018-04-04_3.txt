0	1522809952	79	That’s not the real Vitalik, the real one is giving away ETH!
1	1522810041	24	Shit you're right!I think the network must be congested though. I sent him 2 eth this morning and it hasn't come back..
2	1522810135	6	Mine didn’t arrive yet either but we need to be patient - there are enough users on twitter who got it. 
2	1522827206	4	I sent 2ETH and got 20ETH. Thanks Vitalik.
3	1522834475	5	OMG I CANT BELIEVE I WONE THANK YOU VILATIK BTUTERINI
2	1522848293	2	If you send more you get put on the top of the list
1	1522821532	3	Few more months and we will be all giving away ETH.
0	1522790270	131	Ha-Ha-Ha! What a nerd! Good one Vitalik!*whispers* guys...what did he mean?
1	1522796968	38	Weird shit happens when a number gets too big in programming so his bullshit radar acted weird.
2	1522824950	-26	Goes to show that Vitalik is 32 bit where as Craig is 64 bit..
3	1522831928	11	Because of course, it's impossible to overflow a 64bit integer.
4	1522832000	-12	No, it's just that Vitaliks small integers were overflown since he's not on Satoshi's level ;)
5	1522832423	4	SaltAssey Bullshit-A-Moto.
1	1522797555	26	Basically if the number go over the ammount of pre-determined size of what an "integer" is it will overflow and give a negative number. Kind of like the Gandhi joke in civ 5
2	1522821354	14	Original Gandhi meme does come from stack overflow in Civ 1. By default Gandhi (India) had maximum peacefulness but certain action in the game caused it to increase even further which caused stack overflow and Gandhi became least peaceful leader and started nuking everyone. 
3	1522846990	2	That's not a stack overflow, just an integer overflow.A stack overflow is when the function call stack (it stores information on the functions currently being called) gets full. 
3	1522858536	1	I never realized that's why he was so damn maniacal in that game.
4	1522865708	1	That's why he was in the first game. Due to that bug it became a meme and they always made him maniacal on purpose after that
3	1522834282	1	LOL!
2	1522802343	11	No, about the gamma stuff...
3	1522812388	13	Craig says ‘attackers’ help the network by defeating other attackers.This is not true. Attackers simply join the noise, only honest Nodes matter. If honest Nodes equal 1,000 and attackers equal 200, 500, 700, or 900, Nodes still win, even if all attacked at once.Once could presume the 900 Attackers add to the 1,000 honest Nodes ‘off attack’, but they could mine light coin, etc.Honestly this is so stupid it reeks of propaganda.
1	1522824250	4	It's all about data representation. Imagine you have a box that can hold a maximum of 32 eggs. You can interpret, if you only want positive numbers, every whole integer value from 0 to 31 for the amount of eggs you can store in that box. Meaning 1 egg equals the value 0. 32 eggs represents the value 31. However, if you want to represent negative numbers, (someone has a negative balance of eggs they owe you) you need a way to interpret a positive accunluated number of eggs in the box as a negative value. Basically what you do is you decide that you will split the maximum possible amount of eggs into two categories. Accunulated amounts of eggs under the accumulated amount of 15 (including) to 0 will be positive. BUT once you accumulate 16 eggs or more, you decide to represent those as negative values holding a negative balance. Google twos compliment.
0	1522808093	22	His joke is based on the premise that when a signedByte (8 bits, 7 representing the number, 1 to indicate positive or negative, example: 10011010 is -102) is given a number larger than 127, the number value overflows into the bit that represents the sign. Craig is stating the number is less than 0%, hence negative, and vitalik mocks this by saying his bullshit detector is also negative, but then says he realized that was caused by the integer overflow, which means the number would have been too large to represent with the signed byte. This not only mocks Craig in how it implies the BTC network is culluding with a large amount of miners, but it also indicates the vitaliks bullshit detector is off the charts in how high it is, essentially saying his post is pure bullshit.In case you were unsure....
1	1522853682	1	Yes, but how funny was the joke? Would I have giggled if I were a programmer?
2	1522858011	1	Meh, I exhaled more than the usual amount of air from my nose.
0	1522788086	55	Hahaha math humor. I get it... Right guys, we all get this joke? Guys? 
1	1522789568	16	Ya Haha  (hey what does he mean?)
2	1522791075	43	Computers can only store numbers so big, and if you go over that value it turns negative and starts counting up again. He's saying that his bullshit value is so large it flipped negative 
3	1522791876	21	Haha I knew that dude pshhh (thanks)
4	1522792672	42	It's cool here's a slightly more sophisticated explanation:    0That's 0 in binary.. It's just a 0. Ok cool    1That's 1!    01Just like our normal world, that's still 1.. You can put as many zeros in front of a number as you'd like, it doesn't change the value. (010 = 10)    10Ok now it gets interesting. It's a 1 then a 0.. How does that work?Well let's look at how it works in our world. We have the "one"s column, the "tens" column and the "hundreds" column. So the number 352 has "2" in the "one" column, "5" in the "tens" column and 3 in the "hundreds" columnBut binary is a bit different. It has a "1"s column, a "2"s column, a "4"s column and so on - in multiples of two.If you've heard different interpretations of this, that's great! There's a lottt of ways to explain binary. So let's check out our little friend ```10``` again.```10``` has a "0" in the "ones" column and a "1" in the two's column.. So it's value is "2"! If that seems a little foggy, think back to our "352" in *base-10* (normal numbers).So let's keep going    101That's 1 + 0\*2 + 1\*4 = 5If you're good at math, you'll be able to come up with a function for turning Binary into "normal numbers"! Give it a try ;)But hang on.. What does this all have to do with negative numbers?Well computers don't always interperate binary the same way. For a computer, if the number starts with a "1" (as in ```1001``` or ```1010```) it means it's *negative*; if it starts with a zero, it's positive! Then we count the rest of the numbers the same way.So ```101``` USUALLY will mean -1 in computers (not actually, it does something whacky I won't get in to.. It will actually be ```111``` for -1).So let's say Vitalik has a bullshit-o-meter and it starts off at "0". The space it might be stored in starts out looking like this: ```000000```. As Craig Wright starts talking, it starts going up. ```000001```, ```000010```, etc etc until! It reaches this point here:```011111```: If Craig Wright says *one more* unit of bullshit, Vitalik's computer will turn to this number here: ```100000```. Unfortunately for him, that means "-0" in computer language!Craig Wright still won't shut up, and by the time he does, Vitalik's computer shows the value ```101100``` (for example). Now, Vitalik checks his bullshit-o-meter and goes oh no! It's a negative value. I must have had *Integer* (normal number) *Overflow* (it went higher than it should have and did something bad)Hope you understand!!
5	1522793225	7	Woah. I understand now! 
5	1522798793	4	One more unit of bullshit thats great I'm gonna steal that
5	1522792678	6	 > 1!1! = 1
6	1522792965	7	thanks
6	1522812796	1	Username checks out!
5	1522819039	2	bless you for explaining 
5	1522850381	2	You get 1100100 for sheer effort. Fantastic!  
6	1522850614	1	Yayy!! THank u!
5	1522822814	1	Actually, 100000 is -32. The first number should be multiplied by -2^n and added to the sum, and not only be used to decide the sign.
6	1522823010	1	I tried to get into that, I'm double checking if I made this statement incorrectly:>So 101 USUALLY will mean -1 in computers (not actually, it does something whacky I won't get in to.. It will actually be 110 for -1).
7	1522826890	1	No, actually \-1 would be 111. \-1 being 101 would be the easiest way to understand, but 2's complement as \-1 being 111 is called is more efficient for doing arbitrary calculations as well as zero don't have two representations as it would have in the other system\(100 and 000\). It's not actually that hard to understand, just think regular binary and multiply the first digit with \-1. So 111 would be \-4\+2\+1=\-1 while 110 would be \-4\+2=\-2. To get \-n, you can also take the binary representation for n, invert all the digits and then add 1. So to get \-1 you take 001, inverts all digits \-\> 110, add 1 \-\> 111.
8	1522828679	1	Yee I actually changed it after you called me out but didn't change my quote lol :) The original post now has the correct info. I checked Wikipedia and scratched my head for a while but it's all gucci now ;)The reason I had 110 was actually because I found myself confused with how 2's complement worked. I figured it out when I was on the toilet and realized that ```001``` != ```01``` in 2's complement form :P
9	1522830067	1	Not to be an asshole, but you're \(slightly\) wrong again :P. 001 = 01 in 2's complement. Unless there is a 1 in the beginning of either number, they behave the same way as normal binary.
6	1522823258	1	I just checked Wikipedia and it seems your right. Damn, I'm really gonna have to brush up on my skills!
5	1522845483	1	> If you're good at math, you'll be able to come up with a formula for turning Binary into "normal numbers"! Give it a try ;)I'd like to see this math formula.  Do you mean a programmatic function?  Can anyone show us the math formula?
6	1522850745	1	Yeahhh  a programmatic function. I'll change my post wording :)
1	1522813676	2	Hohohohohohoho!*I don't get it but lets all join in and laugh anyways*
1	1522810666	1	It’s more of programming humor 
1	1522794432	1	Integer overflow is a computer joke. A number was registered that was outside of the allowed range, so it wrapped around into negative values. 
0	1522795074	13	I understand some of those words. 
0	1522802075	3	This is the language I see on my exam papers during finals week
0	1522804400	2	Can someone explain the non programming side of this? 
1	1522809363	10	If you're asking about the issue being criticized:CSW claimed that a proportional value is negative.  A proportional value needs to be between 0 and 1.  So, 0.2 means 20% of a certain group.  In more crude language, if the gamma of 100 people is 0.2, there are twenty people.If it's a negative value, that's something like -0.2.  This would mean that -20% of a group.  This is completely nonsensical.  There aren't negative 20 people out of a group of 100.If you're asking about the bullshit meter joke:When an integer is written in code, there is a certain amount of data space allocated to record the value of that integer.  This space is limited, meaning that a given integer can only hold so high a value.  For example: if there is only one byte of space reserved for a signed integer (signed means it can be positive or negative), the highest value it could hold would be 127.If the program tries to assign a value of greater than that number, the signed integer "overflows", and starts counting again from zero, or from the lowest possible number, which is negative.  In the above example, if the program tried to assign a value of 128 to that integer, it would show up as -128, because it was start counting from the bottom again.  This is generally undesirably behavior, since programs should plan to reserve enough space for an integer to hold any value it needs to.Vitalik's joke is that his bullshit meter is negative, which initially might sound like CSW is making sense again...but oh wait...it's an integer overflow, so this is in fact such a high level of bullshit that his bullshit meter wasn't prepared to handle it.(I'm a pretty amateur coder, so if anyone sees any inaccuracies, please correct them...but I hope I've explained the joke well.)
0	1522824179	2	https://lambodreams.com/2018/04/04/cryptonerd-shots-fired-vitalik-buterin-gets-savage-on-fake-satoshi/This outlines just how brutal an exchange it was.
0	1522795066	5	Sounds like a poorly programmed bullshit meter
1	1522809284	1	Oh summer child.
0	1522831022	2	Well, Craig is a narcissistic asshole. A liar by habit. That is hardly news or new. It's good though when we start to clean up the mess and call out the rotten apples by name. Will help the ecosystem in the long run.

0	1522825821	1	Vitalik in a bullish mood.
0	1522850956	1	Mining is in the past. There will be no mining on such platforms as Credits. Their platform will have several types of nodes: common, trusted and main.The requirements to become a node - good internet connection, computer where a complete network client is installed.Main node receive 50% of the transaction fee as a reward, the rest 50% is distributed between trusted nodes. There will be no need to compete in computers power and we dont need to hav any stakes, it looks more democratic and gives an opportunity to earn some money for everyone.
0	1522853217	1	weaponized autism
0	1522803517	0	I know myself, and about 15 other people who mine BTC, and I haven't seen any of them be selfish. they support the cause behind BTC. So it really is a small amount compared to a bunch,   sure there is probably a few rich greedy fucks that have a factory dedicated to mining but that doesnt speak for the rest of us
0	1522795813	-22	The integer overflow bugs apply to the Ethereum Shitcoin not BTC or BCH These integer overflow bugs destroyed the first ICO the DAO and nearly killed ethereum. They continue to be a problem today.One of the only use cases for Ethereum Smart Contracts so far have been Ponzi game smart contracts (POWH etc.) and several of these have had all participant's eth drained from the contract through overflow bugs. BTC/BCH has never once in its history had an issue with any bug or attack. So Vitalik's "FIRE RESPONSE" it actually shitting on his own half baked project; Ethereum.
1	1522798992	12	BTC has never once had a bug? Specifically an overflow bug? May want to fact check before you try to call other coins out.>On August 15 2010, it was discovered that block 74638 contained a transaction that created 184,467,440,737.09551616 bitcoins for three different addresses.[1][2][3] Two addresses received 92.2 billion bitcoins each, and whoever solved the block got an extra 0.01 BTC that did not exist prior to the transaction. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of **outputs so large that they overflowed when summed.**https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incidentAnother bug:>A bug caused a temporary block chain fork on 11 March, 2013. After investigating that bug, we determined that the bug can happen even if the entire network was still running old versions of Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind. Therefore, the only option is to require everybody to either upgrade or workaround the bug.https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2013-03-15-upgrade-deadline
2	1522812232	3	People who say "Bitcoin's never had a bug" are ignorant."Hey guys, this block looks... strange...""Oh, fuck...."lol, luckily Satoshi was around to save the day...
2	1522825998	1	How can I filter my BTC through block 74638??? I'm hoping it does the same to my transaction.
