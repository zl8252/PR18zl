It is very reasonable for the company Alibaba to make the claim that the coin's creators are using the company's standing to reap financial benefits at a detrimental cost to Alibaba's reputation.Law does not operate in a robotic manner. Jack Ma did not use the Arabian tale to mislead people into a false valuation. I do not shop at Alibaba because I am under the impression I am participating in a tale. The tale does not lose its integrity because an e-commerce site exists. "AlibabaCoin" on the other hand IS intentionally misleading, and can cause significant damage if people think that the company has an affiliation with a scam coin, which is a real risk. Any reasonable person can see that.
1	1522813796	12	Spot on.
1	1522839979	4	Reasonable? Have you checked what sub you're in pal
1	1522861615	2	I agree with you. This is actually quite responsible for Jack Ma to do. People could be mislead and very easily buy into  'AlibabaCoin' thinking it's supported by a big company. He is actually protecting investors by fighting against this. 
1	1522835540	-5	Ok, how about when Jack Ma said that fakes are better than the originals? 
2	1522837048	3	As if that has any legal ramifications to trademark cases 
2	1522839653	3	That's just stating the facts. There are indeed very high quality fakes that are better than the original.
0	1522784817	18	What an interesting situation. Update us on the outcome :)
1	1522812771	6	This is quite interesting indeed! If I was an investor and saw a widely known business title "alibaba" i would think it be affiliated with the multi billion dollar company that we all know. 
0	1522826793	8	So when is Vatican sueing jesus coin...
1	1522854091	1	I don't think the Vatican has a trademark on Jesus. 
2	1522856753	2	But it sells like hell and is the best buisness model ever invented on earth. Isn't it.
1	1522837612	0	never heard of it does jesus coin really exist?
2	1522845602	3	Google it...Its there
0	1522828556	2	Alibaba made its money from knockoff
0	1522844765	2	I thought that the Chinese liked to defend all the copyright abuse that happens there to US brands by saying "Well we just have a different view of IP over here, it's seen as no big deal". Why is this different? 
0	1522805975	3	More forking... -_-
0	1522795110	1	so who exactly are they sueing?
1	1522797891	8	You can't sue anyone if it's decentralized. The vast majority of coins are centralized pretending to be distributed, so sue the founders/owners.
0	1522814283	1	But he didnt sue WTC for saying they had a partnership. I wonder what that could mean...
1	1522840786	0	Walton Coin could be sued by Walmart because it’s name implies that it has a connection to the Walton family who own Walmart.
2	1522862253	1	I would guess less than 10% of people who shop at Walmart know who the Walton family is.  
0	1522834013	1	Oh, will keep an eye on this. It's very interesting how everything will end in this case. 
1	1522837641	1	True.. 
0	1522783451	-9	What's funny is that Ali Baba is of Arabian origin (Syria they say):https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_BabaSo who's the thief stealing the name? ;-)
1	1522817679	18	This is just as stupid as saying Amazon stole the name of the South American place or the Amazons from Greek mythology, or that Apple stole the name of a fruit. 
2	1522835288	-2	>  ;-)See the above smiley?
1	1522784831	4	That was Alladin! Prince Ali BabaEdit.. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_and_the_King_of_ThievesThe film is inspired by the tale Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves from the 1001 Arabian Nights, replacing Ali Baba with Aladdin, and for the first time since the original Aladdin, the film has a completely new soundtrack instead of the rearranged music from the original film for The Return of Jafar and the series.
2	1522813339	5	That is not correct....Ali Baba was an ancient arabian tale from current day Iraq...the irony when it comes to this particular story is that the title "ali baba" is a shortened version of the original story title "Ali baba and the 40 thiefs"
3	1522816473	0	https://youtu.be/aEryAoLfnAAListen to the lyrics. They literally call him Ali BabaEdithttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_and_the_King_of_ThievesThe film is inspired by the tale Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves from the 1001 Arabian Nights, replacing Ali Baba with Aladdin, and for the first time since the original Aladdin, the film has a completely new soundtrack instead of the rearranged music from the original film for The Return of Jafar and the series.
4	1522819779	3	they call him "Ali Ababwa".. not Ali Baba

6	1522843758	1	**Aladdin and the King of Thieves**Aladdin and the King of Thieves (also known as Aladdin 3: Aladdin and the King of Thieves) is a 1996 animated film and the second direct-to-video sequel to the 1992 animated film Aladdin. It serves as the final chapter of the Arabian Nights-inspired Disney stories beginning with the first film, and continued with its first direct-to-video sequel The Return of Jafar and the animated series of the same name.The film is inspired by the tale Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves from the 1001 Arabian Nights, replacing Ali Baba with Aladdin, and for the first time since the original Aladdin, the film has a completely new soundtrack instead of the rearranged music from the original film for The Return of Jafar and the series.Though the film serves as the finale of the series, the characters also appear in a 1999 crossover episode of the animated series Hercules, titled "Hercules and the Arabian Night", as well as the 2007 direct-to-video title called Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
2	1522791530	-11	Yeah, stealing a well known name from a country far away and suing others for stealing it from them. Hipocrisy at its finest. 
3	1522793183	12	That's business though. Apple didin't invent apples, but if a business opened up shop under the name Apple, wouldn't that be trademark infringement and misleading?
4	1522840973	2	Apple itself had to settle with Apple Records (The Beatles’ record company) when they entered the field of music.
4	1522799688	4	yes a hundred percent but the problem is people in the crypto world are living in a la la fantasy world where rules and regulations dont seem to matter or in their minds shouldnt apply. You learn this crap in basic business law or by reading but half the people on here just want to make money and want free speech and to be able to do whatever for everything wa wa wa.
3	1522824079	1	I wonder what would happen if I made 'Amazoncoin'?
0	1522825644	0	https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2016/06/15/jack-ma-says-fakes-better-quality-and-better-price-than-the-real-names/It is ironic when their products are using other companies’ trademark Jack Ma was totally ok with that.
1	1522827158	2	He was not ok with that. He just said what was true. People bought real luxury bags from boutiques, returned a fake one days later and the shops always accept them because they can't tell if they are authentic. The extremely high quality fakes makes it hard to crack down on them. 
2	1522854858	1	Now this is just ridiculous, anyone with common sense know what IP stand for and why it is worth so much money: it is about the design, the reputation.Quality wise of course it is easy to copy. There are thousands of great leather workers in the world, but there is only one Gucci.If China is so great, why don’t they have brand like Gucci? They don’t even have brand that can be compared to Coach.
3	1522860736	1	What? Nobody is denying that fakes are bad for business, not even Jack Ma. It's that the quality of fakes are so high that it's hard to verify them. Even the experts from the brands themselves have a hard time identifying and distinguishing the fakes and originals which makes it hard to crack down on fakes. And no, it isn't easy to copy at all quality wise. Not at all. The source of the leather, the stitching, the source of the threads, are the exact same for AAAA fakes, and the workmanship is done by ex employees of the actual brands. 
1	1522826593	-3	Oh that’s rice. Get fucked Jack. Nobody wants Chinese knock offs. 
0	1522787575	-7	Tron? 
0	1522826870	0	Baba is my dogs name. Can I sue them?...
1	1522837654	2	Lol you are funny
0	1522847922	0	Just like Bitcoin who should sue bcash for brand theft 
0	1522852757	0	So is Keanu Reeves going to do the same and sue Neo?
0	1522807733	-22	[deleted]
1	1522808671	13	That's like saying Apple can't sue people because they got their name from a fruit. Yeah they can; And yeah they do
2	1522809868	5	Ehh, you know what? That's a fair call
2	1522816899	2	And get sued themselves because they stole it from the Beatles. 
1	1522824167	5	Amazon is the largest rainforest on earth, as well as the name of an old mythological people in Greece. Yet if I made a company called 'Amazon Consulting' do you think I would get sued?
0	1522812144	-5	if alibabacoin is actually a coin and anon devs.. alibaba company ia phukt
