1	1522883887	89	It’s hilarious that he has tricked that community into thinking he is some sort of genius. 
2	1522884165	44	They legit worship him. I've read "all hail Sunerok" typed out in the most non-sarcastic way a bunch of times on their tg group. 
2	1522888980	27	Vergefam...  It's nothing but a cult now.
2	1522905278	5	He was smart enough to figure out how to ban me.
2	1522901153	10	I sold today at 40% loss. It was lower a few days ago, I was considering dumping anyway. This was it for me. See ya verge. It was a good bet but it was a looser. Way she goes bubs. Way she goes. 
3	1522901977	7	Very loose. 
3	1522919820	1	I sold at a high point and am waiting for it to drop again. Not that I believe in the coin (I don't), but if the community keep on like this, it is going to keep going up in price for no reason and I'm more than happy to take advantage. 
3	1522905146	-5	Come on over to PIVX , good dev team , about to be the first true zerocoin staking coin.
4	1522908317	2	What staking with zero coins ?
5	1522908611	2	Zerocoin is a coin mixing protocol that anonymizes transactions, and staking is a way to secure network transactions by keeping a wallet running with a balance. Think of it as interest. The more coins you have, the more money you make. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zerocoin
2	1522887025	-108	No one has been "tricked".  You guys just sound so jealous lol...Satoshi is also hailed as someone quite intelligent.  I respect people who do what they do for idealogical reasons, not those who do what the prevailing consensus is.  If not..bitcoin itself would not exist.  I do not care about corporate coins or how much a coin raised or how big your team is, or any other nonsense (all fine) but...I don't go bashing other coins for having a "good team" lol, but no adoption.  or an awesome pre-sale/ICO..but no working product.  This guy has made it himself and it is a working product with much potential..and its like you guys cannot handle that lol...strange things happen in life.  Some of you cannot or will not ever understand that.  Made a ton of money on my XVG investment thus far (I also own 30+ crypto's) and am going to make much more....the average person in the world, does not care how big your team is, or what tech cred you have, or any of that.  Adoption is what matters.  and if Verge gets adoption...it...wins.and when people are confronted with some of these truths...they go crazy lol....
3	1522887816	62	“I made money on Verge and therefore I’m right” isn’t an argument.
3	1522888215	24	>Satoshi is also hailed as someone quite intelligent.Because he was/is...? I don't know, literally creating the blockchain and the first successful cryptocurrency is a bit more impressive than being the lead developer of a pure shitcoin/borderline scam. 
3	1522887855	21	man you’re blinded by the enormous bags you’re holding
3	1522887179	10	[removed]
4	1522887644	-25	Wow, thats smart.  When you insult the person...and not address the argument..you already lost the argument.  You don't win a court case by insulting the other lawyer or the judge lol...you get...thrown out.  More high level thinking exhibited on CryptoCurrency here.  
5	1522888046	23	He's not participating in a formal debate with you genius, he's laughing at you.There is no argument.
5	1522929723	3	We found him! The facebook crypto genius is here! Oh, *GUSH*
3	1522890221	7	Ok maybe that’s enough crypto for me today, I’ve now seen the Verge scammer compared to Satoshi.
3	1522887770	35	1). You got us. We are just jealous and we don’t understand the genius of a dev who copies and pastes broken code. 2). 30+ cryptos!? Holy shit man. That might be one of the worst investment strategies I’ve ever heard of. Good luck. 
4	1522890528	7	Just passing by, as I saw your 2) - why would the amount of cryptos be important for the success of a trading strategy? Honest question, because there are so many coins that diversifying shouldn’t be a bad strategy per default, or what am I missing?Of course the coins itself matter a lot and 30 might be a bit too much to process on a daily or weekly basis but I could think - out of the top if my head - of maybe 25 coins that have potential and chances to improve their positions in the marketcap during the next year.On the other hand, if you pick only let’s say 3-5 coins, all of them could fail. 
5	1522894884	8	For me it’s way too many to keep track of and I would rather do some serious research before investing and only pick projects that I truly believe in. Sure you could argue that someone invested in more than 30 has done this and believes in them all, but it’s unlikely, especially in this case because this person is heavily invested in Verge so I imagine they are mostly making investment decisions based off of hype and don’t actually know a lot about what they have actually thrown their money into. Sure you could pick 3-5 that all end up failing, but I’d still be more comfortable with this knowing that I did my due diligence and being able to discuss the ins and outs of the technology, what problem it solves, its strengths and weaknesses, what kind of people actually make up the team, etc. Ask someone holding more than a dozen cryptos to do this and I strongly doubt they could. Sure you could pick 30 different ones and get really lucky on one or even a few but is that actually going to balance out the losses on the ones that end up being vaporware or in this particular case likely a scam? Not to mention that in a bear market like this that is way too many alts. Last year you could throw darts at a board to pick and still make money but you would have had to know when to pull out and a lot of people didn’t do that and most of the tokens they are holding are way down and will eventually become worthless when they don’t deliver while projects with actual innovative tech and solid teams will survive and eventually make a comeback. A good comparison might be the dotcom boom. For every google and amazon there are a hundred other pets.com and askjeeves that people lost a lot of money on. Honestly though it’s all speculative and very risky as we all know a bit too well at this point, and I could very well be wrong about the projects I put my hard earned money in, but I’d still like to feel like I did everything I could to mitagate the risk.
6	1522899666	1	Good summary, thank you!
3	1522896965	7	ROFL! Hahaha!A currency that is insecure, has no developers, is 'adopted', really? You are just delirious.
3	1522895979	4	Nice try Sunerok!!
3	1522887863	16	Let's just make this simple. Verge is a scam. Enough of the boring rhetoric.

3	1522889402	2	Is one of those 30 coins bitconnect??
3	1522896429	2	Nice try Sunerok! Try again with a unintended hard fork. 
3	1522895427	3	If you would have just made the adoption statement, that would have been fine. But then you just like...kept going
3	1522907405	0	the most downvoted comment i've ever seen.
1	1522896467	71	Holy fucking shit>Sorry to mess up this thread and topic a bit, but after i do not get for hours an answer on twitter, neither does the email function on the Verge homepage work, nor does someone respond on the Verge Bitcoin thread i have to try my luck here.>I visited some hours ago the official Verge Twitter profil to read the news about the hash hack. While reading the tweed i noticed several messages offering a compensation for the attack by Verge. Send x Eth and you get some bonus back. Sounded legit to me as it was affilated to the hash attack and i suffered from it as well having had some hours only orphaned blocks on all my baikals, hence i fall victim to this damn scam on the official twitter page.>Now, while i have myself for sure some vault for this i'am seriously angry about how on the official verge twitter page 100s of scams and fake messages that say they got the ETH back are tolerated and nobody cares about it?!?! How is this possible. After i realized i got scammed i even made a post in this tweet that its a scam and to remove it asap, nothing happened and people still fall after that scam. Only on that scam by now 12+ Eth have been transfered the last hours. >Damn, i'am not a twitter guy and very rarely use it, but from an official Verge twitter profil i personal await its clean and at very least if this for some reason is not possible that there are warning messages about these scams!!!! But no, nothing, the whole official Verge Twitter profil is FULL of scams that are tolerated and people like me, fall victims to it. Fine, i lost some 1.8 ETH, but hourly these scams seems to collect a huge amount of ETH that way and nobody there at Verge cares? Guys, we found the idiots actually falling for these. It's the vergetards.
2	1522904467	27	Can you please pm that person and let them know I'll send them 1.8 ETH to replace their lost ETH. They just need to send me 3.6 ETH first to confirm that the wallet is active.
2	1522901618	11	Yes i saw this and thought it was a meme post...
3	1522913572	1	Yes it's like a meme, but it's not.  Nostalgic.
3	1522904358	-2	it absolutely is. so does that make /u/haramburglar and the 20 people who upvtoed him dumber than a vergetard?
4	1522904730	5	absoluetely not, assuming that other 20 also don't hold XVG
2	1522904762	9	Dude this guy is a paid shill for Sunerok. He keeps trying to hijack the thread and make it about twitter scam bots to distract from the conversaton. When told to stop, sunerok supports him and tried to close out the thread with a weak attempt at the issue's been resolved. below is a direct quote:["We've already covered the OP. i thought his post about the twitter scams was relevant."](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3256693.200)
2	1522915543	6	Well you actually have to be retarded to invest in XVG.
2	1522907704	4	I laughed too hard at vergetards holy shit
3	1522928997	1	Their on the verge of going full retard, and you never go full retard! lol
4	1522931769	1	There about to deverge from there money.
2	1522901760	1	Is it illegal to run those scams on twitter? Seems crazy not to, these people don’t deserve their money. 
2	1522928550	0	lol retard
1	1522888805	9	Also a dude in that thread fell for a twitter eth scam looooooooooooool
1	1522885246	31	He bitches somebody out for their concern over this attack that he said won’t be fixed until the following day. Lmfao. “You’re invested in the coin, right? Why so concerned?” And continually says it only happened for 3 hours when it won’t be fixed for over 13? Yeah, that makes sense.This guy is next level mentally impaired when it comes to dealing with the public. I want to facepalm every time he hits the keyboard. The team should shut him up in a box and never let him see the light of day. It’s very clear he’s just a code monkey and can’t be trusted to deal with real people, if Verge wants to succeed they should recognize that. 
2	1522885852	46	He can't code. All of his code is copy pasted. Even the "fix" they attempted was copy pasted. Not even kidding. 
3	1522886485	11	I’d believe it, but my knowledge of coding is pretty limited. I don’t think I’ve ever encountered a dev who was so active in his community and simultaneously so incredibly bad at it though. He has no idea how to handle communicating online and comes off as a shady asshole who is in way over his head every time he types something out.He’s still God Emperor to the Verge community though. Mind blowing.
4	1522887300	62	https://github.com/peercoin/peercoin/commit/4281cb55b04600189bff4f0c8a92e042b34e75f8https://github.com/vergecurrency/VERGE/commit/7294e062a61f78ffb05689b562f90985463d1179This is the EXACT same fix sunerok uploaded this morning. He didn't even bother correcting the typo. It was uploaded **3 years ago** to peercoin's repo. That's how late verge is compared to other coins.
5	1522887556	37	There's also no guarantee that copy pasting that snippet actually fixes anything, the peercoin devs at the time when presented with this 'fix' remained adamant that it wouldn't do anything. edit - my take is that the dev has no idea how this exploit actually works, googled for help, saw this as a potential issue and hacked it in asap then claimed it was fixed without ever testing it or knowing what the original exploit actually did. Now he's saying there'll be a fix 'tomorrow' ... so probably still no idea at all what's happening. I'm a crypto newcomer ... it's *baffling* to me that this coin can have a billion dollar market valuation given the very little I've seen of it. Even more so that the sub for the coin is vigorously defending all this stupidity. 
6	1522897389	12	>I'm a crypto newcomer ... it's baffling to me that this coin can have a billion dollar market valuation given the very little I've seen of it. Even more so that the sub for the coin is vigorously defending all this stupidity.Combination of emotional investing, mislead kids that think they'll be millionaires if they put their pocket money in and crypto community at large having very short memory (partly because how new the whole thing is, granted) with new blood coming in doing the same mistakes people before them because of that.
6	1522897308	3	theyre paid to 
6	1522915199	2	Market cap is a joke. Sell 1 reddit comment for a dollar, marketcap of billions for reddit comments.
5	1522887706	18	Hahahahaha. What the fuck.I’m going to choose to believe that this entire project is a satire on the state of cryptocurrency today. And not just another shady ass Floridian who got in way too deep. 
6	1522905507	1	Ding ding ding you win the prize......More XVG
5	1522895107	4	My mind is blown. Good find. How can people still defend this guy?!
4	1522890738	11	I'm no code whiz myself, but something I wish people putting money into trendy alts would realise is:nearly everything in crypto is open source. so just because a project has a github repo or even a testnet up and running, is no guarantee that the devs actually know what they're doing. they might be able to spin up a cloned blockchain of I dunno, Ethereum or Litecoin or Monero, but that doesn't mean they're actually going to be able to deliver any of the new things to the space that they promise. in short, being able to spin up a blockchain is no longer a guarantee that a project isn't essentially a scam.
4	1522890373	1	!RemindMe 4 months 
5	1522890924	2	So what are we reminding you of, bud?
6	1522893620	5	The good times when verge was worth a nickel.
7	1522899836	5	alexp0pz could set a reminder to the 18th this month. Then it will be worth 0.
8	1522900970	3	No argument from me.
8	1522908353	1	😂
4	1522929833	1	As a seasoned developer who started when he was 5 years old and has worked his entire adult life as an Engineer/Developer i can tell you that these people do exist, i once worked wth someone who was able to fool all the required people to get into the job and had enough of the gift of the gab to get random people from other team's to vouch for him -- but he was absolutely fucking useless, there are no word's that could possibly describe how bad this guy was and he was brought in as a Lead Developer -- he often spent his time coming up with odd/weird requirements so as to put obstacles in the way of people who could actually do their job so he had time to implement his dog shit code.I Remember on a mobile sign up form (to which i was doing the react front end) which had (among other things) a question which was "How long have you lived at your current address" -- the logical representation of this is something along the lines of "yearsAtCurrentAddress" and "monthsAtCurrentAddress" (since it was drop down's), he argued for days to have me send it to him as "numberOfMonthsAtCurrentAddress" -- considering this was a sign up form for a credit card that people could save and come back to (and lot's of other edge cases) this also mean't that i had to implement code to covert "numberOfMonthsAtCurrentAddress" into the years and months for the drop downs, the irony of this is on the back end the very first thing he did with the "numberOfMonthsAtCurrentAddress" was covert it to years and month's and stored in his complex and shit java app, which is what the backend had to send to the bank for the credit application.... then obviously he had to write code to covert years and months into "numberOfMonthsAtCurrentAddress" to send as response to the api i called, to which i had to pull it apart into years and months... many people quit, almost all raged, yet he was kept on by management for 6 months (on $1500/day) until he had caused so much damage to the project that they had to throw it away, and since everybody who had an IQ of 1 or above had quit there was nobody left and they ended up going way over budget and time.This was a $160M project btw... his name was Steve, and the mere mention of "Steve" makes me want to punch cunt's in the head.
3	1522896731	4	Inspiring. When i grow up i want to be as good of a con artist as he is.
4	1522904506	3	he prefers coin artist 
3	1522888397	-21	You don't sound jealous at all.   When a dude made a product out of his garage..that crushed the largest computer companies in the THE WORLD..I bet they talked a lot of smack too.  It is only natural....90% of the average population does not care what tech cred you or your coin  you follow has.  They care about real world use, and what appeals to them.  If you don't have adoption, it does not matter.  Jealousy does not matter.  You want to win ?  Make something better and get mass adoption.  
4	1522888510	15	Sorry you cannot be helped. Go back to worshipping your "dev" and saviour. 
5	1522891493	-6	Sorry, more incorrect meme-level thinking.  I don't have a savior.  And I don't make assumptions.  I am actually a smart investor and don't partake in teenage level group-think on here.  From a bunch of people with ulterior motives...who collectively 95%...own 0 lambos.  While a guy out of his garage beat the entire computer world.  Not without a lot of insults along the way.History repeats itself.  
6	1522893656	7	The guy that made the computers actually knew what he was doing though. 
7	1522902363	3	And wasn't a habitual liar with 30-something misdemeanors....
6	1522904652	2	Dude, can you give me ONE thing that Verge does that can’t be done with another coin?
4	1522888940	12	Go back to your echo chamber where XVG is going to be $10 by the 17th, Amazon is your partner, and people actually agree with your asinine opinions. Your comparison doesn’t make any sense. I’ll admit, I got a good smirk out of comparing Verge with something like Apple or Microsoft. Y’all crazy. 
5	1522889131	-5	Go back to your lambo lol....none of what you said applies to me.  Its meme-level thinking.  Which...accomplishes nothing in life.You cannot believe..what you do not want to believe.
6	1522889462	6	Confucius say...your comments follow no logical progression. Strange ellipses...improper comparisons. Weird expressions...that make no sense. You cannot type..what you do not want to type.I’ll go hop in my reasonably priced 90s Civic though.
4	1522888685	2	where’s this xvg mass adoption? nobody’s using it except you moonbois
5	1522889062	3	Just wait for the yuuuuuge "partnership" that's going to "fall through" because of this exploit.  
6	1522889573	1	The crazy thing about what your saying is that its the perfect scenario for the dev team to run away with people's investment. You're on to something
7	1522902532	1	Well, Justin had interesting timing on asking for donations...  as well as the hack.
8	1522933250	1	Well one thing I learned investing in crypto, is that timing means everything. Nothing is coincidence here and there’s always an ulterior motive, fud, or inside trading going on 
6	1522902487	1	The announcement was already pushed back twice in the first week...
2	1522886337	12	> if Verge wants to succeedpretty sure they're just trying to get the most money out of this thing before it crumbles, in the end verge not being an ico gives them protection from any prosecution
3	1522886709	4	Oh, I’m still waiting for the exit scam/inevitable implosion. I just really can’t fathom how someone can be so bad at communication/dealing with the public. Even the delusional ones that think Verge is partnering with Amazon or is about to be a top 5 coin.  I can’t find a shred of legitimacy so far.
2	1522886528	5	Cousin of Francisco the Bomber. 
2	1522889027	0	Justin Erik Valo has doxxed people for less...
3	1522889265	1	Is Valo actually known for doxxing people? That’s a new one to me, I’ll just add it to the laundry list of questionable decisions. Others have said a lot worse, but equally true things. I’m not worth being doxxed.
4	1522890496	3	He's done it on Bitcointalk a few times in the past few years.  But, yes, there's much worse - like the thirty-some misdemeanors over ~10 years in Florida that I know of.
1	1522887050	13	And yet their community still believes that some large corporation, so big that it will change the way the world views crypto, is going to sign a partnership with Verge.
2	1522905134	-1	i doubt some corporations know anything about crypto, they might think it can help them out...
1	1522900632	4	This was OcMiner too. He runs all of the suprnova mining pools, incredibly smart guy, don’t know him personally just from social and forums.
1	1522899547	3	A few posts down is hilarious, shows the kind of people who invest in XVGhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3256693.msg33953998#msg33953998> While reading the tweed i noticed several messages offering a compensation for the attack by Verge.

2	1522929484	1	Please stop posting this, I am dying of laughter every single time I see it!my belly hurts
1	1522891552	7	I posted this on the Verge subreddit and was instantly banned. Apparently, it is North Korea over there with no free speech allowed. 
1	1522893863	2	This is his statement about the issue> yeah pools are still finding blocks, and this wont be an issue anymore shortly. we will be pushing an update and contacting all pool admins.>also, to clarify, this isn't a hack, it's an exploit/attack on mining, and will be resolved very soon. of course i'm calm, this happens in crypto all the time.>how much eth has been stolen this year? this is insignificant in contrast.
2	1522940560	1	> how much eth has been stolen this year? this is insignificant in contrast.Ah, yes, the good old [whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism).
1	1522910918	2	so, their forking again. Whats the big deal?
1	1522923833	2	I [crossposted on /r/ProgrammingHorror ](https://np.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/89t3j6/verge_cryptocurrency_got_exploited_today_as_a/) :-)
2	1522923939	2	Nice! Spreading the word 
1	1522915607	1	Are we sure the attacker didn't insert double spend transactions in his blocks?
2	1522916028	1	They were empty blocks so no tx were involved. But this basically means the attackers owns the network and can decide which txs go through and which don't. 
3	1522919425	1	But they could have inserted double spend transactions to other addresses they detain right? Technically it’s possible once you mine 100% of the blocks, am i wrong ?
1	1522892379	1	Oh my god, the guy mad at Verge because he fell for the "Send us verge to this address for compensation from the hack, and we'll send you back 8x!" scam is priceless. All you people saying "Who falls for this?", welp, there you go...
1	1522901483	1	when are these guys going to prison already
1	1522905381	1	Jokes aside, it sucks for bag holders and crypto in general.Clearly not the kind of news I like to see, especially in a bear market.As obvious as Bitconnect was a scam, it still did hurt crypto as a whole. 
1	1522902311	0	Omfg, and followers are still so ignorant! I love popcorn and drama! 
0	1522876892	122	They're banning anyone from telegram who mentions it. Full censorship, no discussion
1	1522876960	38	Welcome to the club. :D. I even messaged one of their admins and he straight out said "yeah I was expecting it to still happen". Then why the fuck are you telling everyone in your telegram chat that the issue is fixed asshole?!
2	1522877073	28	Because, they gotta sell off their bags while it's up. Wouldn't be surprised if the dev's are exploiting it themselves. 
3	1522877270	14	That was my initial thought. He doesn't seem to give a fuck about this issue. And he didn't even announce it until it was posted on Bitcointalk. He was approached before it was posted and he loled at the poster. 
1	1522878784	10	I cannot post anything about it on verge reddit. I had links and all to let all know
2	1522879848	3	Expect a ban if you post. C E N S O R S H I P^^fun ^^fact, ^^it ^^happened ^^to ^^me. ^^31 ^^points ^^thread, ^^deleted ^^and ^^guess ^^what ^^message ^^I ^^received ^^from ^^/r/vergecurrency? ^^yep
2	1522880520	5	You're welcome to discuss it at /r/verge 
3	1522882874	-21	That's not the official verge sub, that sub specifically FUD's verge all the time.
4	1522885939	19	Um, I think *not* being the official sub is the point.
5	1522886871	13	Remember, you're talking to a vergin. 
1	1522927605	1	Yep I got banned for asking when wraith will be released, lol
1	1522885817	1	i got banned from their sub literally after my first and only comment. all i said was... "RIP, sunny boy running with your money"
0	1522885198	23	Welp, I tried to get some info from xvg in telegram, seeing as I am a concerned holder.... banned.
1	1522908278	6	Sell maybe?
2	1522908453	-12	With an CircleK partnership imminent?  No way.
3	1522911864	7	did you miss the /s ???? I hope you did
3	1522911948	2	Lmfao
3	1522928796	2	Then you loose your money
0	1522904375	24	and this coin has billion in market cap, and is +40% in the last 7 days. good ol unregulated market. 
1	1522915013	7	It's really insane what happens when you let idiots do what they want, funny to watch though.
2	1522919443	0	I can't hardly focus on my work.
0	1522898236	19	BTW - this exploit is STILL out there:https://imgur.com/wUyTwcsBut it's no big deal according to the developer, because much more Etherium has been stolen https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3256693.msg33958949#msg33958949
1	1522898844	17	Someone better publish this script so I can steal some xvg before the morning
0	1522898444	38	Guys I bought 49 verge in December. 49. I can't sell them as of a week after I bought them because binance won't let me. I basically am stuck with these stupid fucking coins in my stupid fucking wallet as a daily reminder that I'm dumb and make dumb decisions. Every day I just look at these pathetic 49 coins and laugh. Why 49? Why such a shit coin? What was I thinking? I will die with these coins. Luckily my other decisions weren't as awful but man this was the dumbest purchase I've ever made😂
1	1522911291	8	Buy some more and then you can sell them all
1	1522922011	2	You could market sell them 
2	1522942940	1	Oh thank God, thank you!
3	1522946457	1	Haha, welcome!
1	1522938483	1	You can't place a limit sell order for such small amounts, but you can market sell them. 
0	1522878969	84	I'm pretty fucking sure this will end up as convinient way to exit scam these muppets. "Oh noo...our partner has decided to cancel partnership duo to evil hackers that exploited network protocol. So sorry guys...thanks for the $$$ though"
1	1522902551	16	Yep, it’s a hallmark of crypto. Blame a ‘bad actor’ and exit while you have other’s money. It sucks, I hope all you vergins are selling out before the “dev” just quits completely. 
2	1522915132	3	Shameful upvote for "Vergins"  "Tronsexuals"  "Homosatoshi"  "Monerokind"  Someone stop me.
3	1522931197	2	go on
3	1522936394	1	No, I like it. Haha 
0	1522903464	13	XVG ... when you're on the **verge** of financial ruin.People need to build a trust system than flushes out shit coins and that system should be amended to coinmarketcap so people that actually look on there will know not to put their money into it.
1	1522905787	7	I trust Binance. CTR is up 165% right now on that exchange. When you click to get info on CTR, Binance shows you the info page for the coin. There is a news story from April 2nd about one of the creators getting arrested...165%You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink!
2	1522907603	3	> You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink!with pump comes dump. News as of 40 minutes ago: CTR is being delisted 4/8/2018 5:00 UTC. It doesn't take a pro to realize what's happening here... get yer bags ready! lol
2	1522912178	-1	buy the dip?? :D
0	1522884031	36	1. you're just all around sketchy. Verge never was legit in the first place. 2. you, in desperate times, ask people to donate money, so they're able to finally reveal some important partnership. 3. shortly after the price surges some hack occurs. 4. fixes are applied. 5. fix doesn't work. 6. fork. 7. ????
1	1522884461	8	repeat 2-6
1	1522951418	1	Did you watch the xvg PR video? Oh man its a cringe fest
0	1522889298	43	This is what happens when you have a cryptocurrency project being led by an inexperienced kid (Sunerok). Dude is legitimately the most incompetent developer out there.Verge is nothing but a scam, Sunerok is a copy/paste developer who has probably never written a line of code himself. I wouldn't be surprised if Sunerok and his cronies are selling off their XVG as we speak. After the McAfee nonsense, I would expect nothing less from these con artists.If you want a good laugh, their subreddit is a great source of comedic material. You can tell that some people are deeply invested in XVG, and can't afford to see the price drop or they'll lose everything. The fact that this project had to beg for donations from its community to release details of a partnership or whatever it was, it really highlights how shady this project really is.
1	1522903381	8	Worst thing is that 80% of the donation target was met thanks to some sketchy company who're friends with the dev
1	1522949725	1	> This is what happens when you have a cryptocurrency project being led by an inexperienced kid (Sunerok). Dude is legitimately the most incompetent developer out there.Sunerok should have spent $80 on upwork and hired a competent dev team months ago, instead he continues to suck his own dick 
0	1522889305	50	The year is 2030. Cryptocurrencies have gained mass adoption. Blockchain rules the world. BTC is 100k. And in a dark alley, XVG moonbois are still HODLing, because they believe when Wraith 47.0 is released Verge is going to take over. 
1	1522889409	16	Literally loled because of how accurate your comment is. 
1	1522907131	10	TRX and XVG merge to create the greatest HODLer group ever
1	1522903259	3	HODL meme will ruin many people
2	1522951569	1	It didnt ruin me but I coulda cashed out with 6 figures instead I got a measly double up
0	1522877708	51	Sad thing is the deluded vergins won't realise how shady this is until verge hits 0. 
1	1522938657	1	The fact that the price has held up as well as it has during this shit storm confirms this. It's unreal. People are actually still buying XVG.
1	1522883759	-16	Why would you insult people who are losing their own money? The pun was a nice touch though.Why not try to explain to them that it's shady and doesn't deserve their money?Edit: Being downvoted cause I'm concerned about other people...
2	1522884460	19	I tried pointing that out. Got banned.
3	1522884569	8	Fighting their mods seems like fighting the goverment lol.
2	1522902746	7	Because bots. And also fucktards. Sry, but we have too many dumb. Ppl funding shit projects. Due diligence will win out. But damn, stupid people make me irrationally mad,. 
2	1522884780	12	I've tried, got banned and down voted to hell....they deserve what they're about to get.
3	1522907078	2	yup, if they had a shred of intelligence, they would at least try getting their information from different sources. *Especially* after something crazy like this happens. But they choose to live in a make believe world where they think this coin will hit bitcoins prices. Fuck em, they 100% deserve losing everything. Same with TRX idiots. 
3	1522885114	1	It's hard to change people's opinions, especially when censorship happens and bots in play.
4	1522897766	5	It's harder to change the opinions of idiots. Let people be stupid and lose all their money, if that's what they want.
2	1522886246	5	We have. We have all been banned a safety result. 
2	1522886962	4	We've tried explaining it to them. The problem is everyone who posts there gets instabanned.  It's just an echo chamber now. I genuinely feel bad for the poor noobies who invested in this.
3	1522887067	1	I like people like you that try to help out. We do still have other subreddits, I'm sure they read crypto-related ones like this one.
4	1522887311	3	True, hopefully they can be open minded about their investments. There are red flags all over this project, but I can totally understand how it can be difficult to pull your head out of your safe space (especially when money is involved). Hopefully reading these types of threads can dispel the "everything is FUD narrative". Perhaps we can minimize those seriously hurt by the inevitable and tragic ending to this all
5	1522890271	3	This is pretty much what I'm hoping for, really great answer!
5	1522888036	6	Yeah they're all in too deep now. It's hard to actually admit to yourself that you've been played. 
6	1522889597	4	Yup, seems like most have opted to sink with the ship. IMO this isn't a ship I could justify sinking on...
7	1522903200	2	They don't realise going down with the ship might mean never buying any crypto again for a long long time. They'd be devastated but oh well they'll learn their lesson and be more careful next time.
2	1522887546	2	[deleted]
3	1522890388	0	Dang, I wish people could think a bit more critically before making accusations like that. People like them will learn their lesson sooner or later I guess, the ones that are more open minded will hopefully be persuaded into a smarter choice.
0	1522879646	23	This is either what you get for writing shitty code or also a way to self sabotage the fake partnership. Likely both.
0	1522895726	27	I think I'm understanding this correctly, but the implications are melting my brain if they are. Verge is leaving this exploit running all night, meanwhile exchanges aren't halting the trading of Verge. If Verge hardforks, then the mined coins are useless. But since exchanges aren't halting trading, the hackers can dump the soon to be useless tokens to unsuspecting bagholders or people who are not savvy enough to understand that the tokens they're buying are about to be forked out of existence. Am I understanding this correctly. Is Verge really going to let this happen to the poor bagholders?Edit: Or is it that the hardfork won't include a rollback, and the hackers will just keep all the Verge that they mined through the exploit?
1	1522897035	29	Sunerok has said there will be no rollback. He’s also said the exploit was only being used for 3 hours (wrong), that only around 250k coins were affected (wrong), that they’ve fixed the problem (wrong), it’s no big deal (wrong), and the list goes on. But yes, he’s basically said he’s going to deal with it tomorrow with no real concern about what happens from now until then. I recommend you check out the bitcointalk thread linked here. His level of apathy and blatant disregard for what’s happening is both terrifying and very amusing. Meanwhile, the team is claiming the issue has been fixed and are insta-banning anyone who even mentions the exploit in their Telegram/Discord. 
2	1522897469	11	tomorrow? [meanwhile...](http://i.imgur.com/uQFVQQW.png)
3	1522897678	12	That’s so weird, because Justin was so sure of the fact that the exploit was only being used for a brief amount of time and that it couldn’t possibly profitable for anyone involved.. I can’t imagine a 24 hour cycle of massive exploitation will be a problem. Just sleep easy, Verge fam. 
2	1522938813	1	I don't think he knows how to address this issue. 
1	1522897754	-2	Man, putting it like that really reveals how fucked up this is.  This could be the event that tanks crypto for 1-2 years.
2	1522904608	19	this will only tank verge
2	1522912020	6	Verge is not that important
2	1522898491	-5	Tanks altcoins you mean. Which are already on their way on their own.
3	1522898853	7	Altcoins tanking are just people cashing out of crypto.  BTC is down almost 3/4 as well, I'd call that tanking.
4	1522899055	7	BTC IS JUST RESTING!! (cries)
4	1522903029	0	Who would let their money rest on such unreliable market? Btc first needs to find bottom before hype starts up again. I mean, all altcoins are worth next to nothing if btc goes to 2k
0	1522875913	32	Hey you think If I lie about fixing the problem the guy will just buy it and quit?
1	1522875948	8	This basically...
0	1522904677	8	can someone explain why the price *isn't* tanking atm?
1	1522907725	2	According to bitcointalk thread, at least Binance and Bittrex have XVG deposits closed for now.Can't dump if you can't move coins into an exchange.
2	1522919886	1	I checked on bittrex and deposits were open...
1	1522919955	1	I think some big traders aren't up to date yet and still buying 'dips'... I'm sure the price will tank soon. Meantime it's a great opportunity for everybody else to get out...
1	1522905380	-12	Strong HODLERs have been attacked with FUD 100x stronger than this exploit.

0	1522882465	17	Fun fact they are only gonna gonna fix this "bug" tomorrow so until then it's free exploit and cash in palooza ... I wouldn't be surprised if the exploit gets shared befor the fix (hardfork) and a bunch of script kiddies getting a lot of free crypto out of it ...Hell I would not even be surprised at this time if the worlds biggest deal in crypto history gets cancelled cause you know stuff being hacked, "investor" decides magically to withdraw from the project ...
1	1522882712	6	Yeah I can't believe they're just going to let it go for a day. I think they don't have a fix yet lol. 
2	1522903501	1	Don't worry, verge 2.0 hardfork tomorrow it's all geewwd

3	1522885745	2	wait you're a smart one. I've heard Carlos is still alive somewhere...AHA! https://twitter.com/CarlosMatos80.I would contact him, but my Twitter looks suspicious. Anyone here should do that, telling him it would be a nice method to make fun of scams and raise awareness about their existance, so the average ~~retard~~ Joe won't fall for them.Seriously, somebody contact him.

0	1522901978	5	Uodate: apparently bittrex and binance have stopped xvg deposits? Can anyone with xvg confirm?
1	1522905471	5	Just checked and Binance has XVG deposits suspended. Withdrawals are still open.
1	1522919141	1	Looks like deposits are still open on Bittrex...
0	1522903142	4	Hey hey heeeeey...
0	1522890667	12	Sell your XVG while the price is still decent!
1	1522892000	6	Hype will probably drive the price up further.  The fact that the price hasn't really taken much of a hit despite such a massive exploit taking place is proof enough of that.
2	1522893478	10	It's not possible to sell since the hardfork fucked up the wallets. Binance won't let you deposit any Verge
3	1522893829	5	There's plenty already on the exchanges that could've been panic sold, but it really hasn't happened.  Fear does seem to be slightly stronger than greed at the moment, but only just...  I'm still thinking the price either bounces around roughly where it's at or rises until the 16th.  I fully expect people to be selling the news though.  Who knows though :)
4	1522894506	3	I'll be honest, I'm a Verge holder but I agree. The price has dropped though and i think it will continue to do so at least until the new wallet is released tomorrow. As for selling the news, probably yes, the bar has been set so high disappointment is pretty inevitable. I don't really buy into all the conspiratorial stuff about exit scamming and stuff tho, I mean I won't argue to much here because I fear for my karma but the dude is pretty much a public figure and has been running the project for many years now. But yea, would have been nice to have sold out a couple of hours ago cause I believe price will keep falling
5	1522913511	3	I hope you at least believe that the network is under attack because that's not really a conspiracy anymore. 
6	1522921545	1	I think that's pretty obvious at this point
5	1522916081	1	There are 3 more verge hacks out there. Keep hodling though.
6	1522922652	1	? As far as I can tell there are only one exploit? Also if you read my comment you can clearly see that I'm not even able to sell even if I wanted to so pretty unnecessary passive aggressiveness here dude
7	1522928071	1	Don't take offense. Just bit annoyed of people putting their faith in joke projects.There are apparantly undisclosed hacks out there for verge.
8	1522928584	-1	Well I don't think it's a joke project. Not at all saying the attack today was a small attack or professionally handled but it was caused by the fact that the implementation of the five algorithms verge runs on wasn't perfect and most project only run on one anyway. Sure it was bad, and the hardfork was out right embarrassing but trust me, I'm not invested in verge based on blind Faith, I truly think it has a good chance based on a several reasons.But I'd really like to get a source on these other hacks you're talking about, can't find anything
5	1522894679	-1	> I mean I won't argue to much here because I fear for my karmaHaha, I hear you.  This subreddit can be really toxic.
6	1522913454	3	Toxic because they call out a dev on his unethical ways of making money which he essentially does by exploiting his followers? 
7	1522913691	-1	That wouldn't fall into the category of "toxic", so no.
8	1522914252	2	Well that's what we're doing. Stop being such a sheep. I know it's hard to admit you've been got but it's much better than just closing your eyes. 
9	1522914280	-1	Aaand there it is.
1	1522891395	1	Folks shouldve sold a while ago. 
0	1522898953	4	Someone publish the exploit
0	1522905600	4	Everyone on twitter with an $xvg in their handle are defending it blindly. Saying it still isn't happening. Top fucking kek.
0	1522873645	7	Can we get a quick rundown? 
1	1522873812	17	XVG was subject to a type of 51% attack where the timestamps of blocks was being altered to trick the multi algo mining method. Person who found the exploit made about 1 million USD. Dev claims to have fixed it. Still isn't fixed which can be seen by the weirdly timed blocks. 
2	1522878134	13	Smart dude/lady 
3	1522879092	5	Y'know, you're basically calling the dev of this coin smart xD. 
4	1522879396	20	No, smart person who attacked this. I’m torn between feeling worried that this could be a horrible look for crypto and being happy that verge is one step closer to not being a thing. Probably #2
5	1522882107	13	He's making a joke about how some believe It's Sunerok himself exploiting it :)
6	1522882190	4	Ah my apologies lol. Either way cool by me
6	1522919956	1	is it sad I wouldn't think this is too far off?
7	1522930673	1	I personally don't think it's him. There are easier and safer ways for him to make bank on his followers. 
8	1522930718	1	Implying he's smart. 😂
9	1522930822	1	He is smart when it comes to manipulation and PR (I guess. It shouldn't be succesful but it is.), not when it comes to programming.I mean the guy has a Trump-level following that are completely oblivious to facts.
2	1522878315	1	Ouch
0	1522884088	7	The timestamps of some blocks are earlier than some preceding blocks. Lol, the code really is fucked! Glad I never bought any!
0	1522901224	8	Bye bye verge. Just another reason the market will dip further . So many people who arent getting this news in time are gonna lose money.    Ouch.  BitConnect 3.0
1	1522904787	2	BitConnect was the most obvious scam in history. At least XVG tried to dress the scam up with a wig and some makeup, credit where it's due.
2	1522905239	5	That's why they are BitConnect 3.0. They upgraded.  I always wondered if most the scams were done by the same people, 
2	1522905175	2	This is true. Maybe we should give them a second chance to redeem themselves. If we all donate half of our ETH, that should make them happy to show them we care.   If they mess up again then never again.   
0	1522880893	6	I don't quite understand the importance of the changing hashing algorithm here, if one person has 51% of the hashing power then they control the network regardless?
1	1522881021	15	Verge has multiple algo mining to prevent 51% attacks lol. But it was so badly implemented that the exploiter used their implementation to perform a 51% attack. Quite ironic coming to think of it. 
0	1522882554	11	Stoked to hear more bad news for this scam coin. Bag holders needs to learn how brain dead they are compared to rest of society.
1	1522882745	8	Sadly they won't realise. It's like a defense mechanism. 
1	1522932033	1	ELI5 "Bag holder"?I keep thinking of Mal & Joe Budden saying they have secured the bag (got the pay). Is it the same here?
2	1522948066	1	Just people holding xvg for the purposes of anything but short term trading. I won’t disagree that you can’t make money on this shitcoin, it’s literally a pump n dump coin. But long term, it’s going to go to 0 eventually. Look at Centra for example.

1	1522877835	-1	Damn, so he was basically getting copies of any transaction, sent to his own account?
2	1522877913	17	No. He mines empty blocks and controls the whole network. So basically all other blocks are orphaned and he gets 1 second blocks with the 1560 block xvg reward per block.

0	1522914242	2	Going to hold this worthless 300 coins till I die, what’s the worst that can happen?Currently worth less than my lunch today 😂
0	1522927448	2	Don't trust XVG, I'll better buy CS and EOS coins.
1	1522932755	0	Agreed. Have you heard a great new from Credits that they gonna release a blockchain platform soon
0	1522882826	5	what happens when millions of xvg gets traded for btc, then btc gets dumped for fiat. this is bad for crypto. exchanges should disable xvg
1	1522882960	12	Hmmm considering the fact they're letting people exploit this for another day, I agree with the idea of exchanges stopping xvg trades. 
2	1522903579	3	It's no use, it would still drop like a ten ton rock once it's resumes.. xvg hodlers are so fked
0	1522912348	3	Damn, they really need to hit that merch release milestone on their roadmap soon to get the price back up
1	1522947627	1	Yeah, that's not happening.

1	1522882140	0	so, if you don't mind, I'm still trying to wrap my head around exactly wtf shorting is. I've read a bit about it, I've heard about it, but still for some reason when I read a comment like this...I don't fkn get it. Much appreciated! 
2	1522883465	6	As /u/s-h-d-p explained in a reply to this very comment, Shorting means "to bet against". Longing means "to bet in favor of". The mechanism is as follows: * If you want to short/bet against Bitcoin, what you will be doing, in essence, is taking a borrowed amount of Bitcoin, say, 1 Bitcoin at 7k/btc value. You will immediately sell this Bitcoin for 7k USD dollars. You still owe the lender one full Bitcoin. So if Bitcoin's price goes up to 8k/btc, you'll essentially be oweing the lender 8k dollars, paid in Bitcoin, so you will be down 1k dollars, plus lending fee. If Bitcoin's price goes down to 6k dollars, you'll essentially be oweing the lender 6k dollars, paid in Bitcoin, plus lending fee. The 1k difference is yours to take home. * If you want to long/bet in favor of Bitcoin, what you will be doing, in essence, is taking a borrowed amount of dollars, say, 7k dollars, and immediately buying Bitcoin (say it's now 14k) with that value, at a fixed price. This means you'll be "buying" 0.5 bitcoin, and you will owe the lender 7k dollars. If bitcoin doubles in price to 28k, your 0.5 Bitcoin will now be worth 14k. As you borrowed dollars, all you owe the lender is 7k plus lending fee, and the rest 7k is yours to take home.Now, usually you don't short "naked". Traders usually short/long with leverage. That means they leave a few bucks in the Exchange as guarantee, and the exchange allows them to take as much as 200x more money than that to open short/long positions. However, if trading at 200x, a simple slip of 0.5% in the other direction of your bet will wipe your account entirely. If at 100x, 1% in the other direction of your bet will wipe your account entirely. And 1% in your direction will give you 100% gains. Usually traders use "low" leverages (25x-50x is high, 100x-200x is ABSURD) so their positions are "immune" to volatility and they can set stop losses to avoid getting entirely burned. Any questions feel free to ask.
3	1522890367	1	Right on, all of that makes total sense. Thank you. I suppose the only remaining inquiry is that these sorts of trades can only be done with certain services/exchanges correct?  
4	1522890505	2	Yes. Binance, for instance, doesn't allow shorting/longing on margin. All you can do is buy the asset with your money, so all you can do is long it. Bitfinex has some margin trading pairs, you can short BTC and some alt coins, a few shitcoins too. Bitmex allows for absurd leverage (upwards to 200x) when longing/shorting BTC, and allows margin trading on a select few alts.There are other exchanges that allow margin trading but I wouldn't know. Ive used Bitfinex when I was learning (their platform is pretty good and beginner friendly), nowadays I use Bitmex for margin trading and one local fiat-crypto exchange in case I need to cash out fast.
2	1522885488	2	Its a short sale, meaning you are borrowing a share and selling it at current market value immediately with a promise to pay back the share in the future. Let's say a Coin is 100$ but you think its going down to 40$, So you short it @ 100$, it goes down to 40$, you would make the difference between the 100$ (Which was the current market value at the time of the shortsale) and the 40$ (The market value at which time you wanted to pay back the coin you borrowed) You would make 60$.
2	1522882723	2	https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.aspIn other words, betting the stock will be lower at a future date. It could be explained as a future buy order. If, at that future moment, the price is lower than at the current time, you basically buy lower, but sell at the current (higher) price. Therefore, you win the difference between the current (high) and future (low) price.My knowledge may be rusty, but this is pretty much shorting. Expecting something to be lower in value, thus profiting from a decrease in price.
0	1522918472	1	Bitgrail all over again?!? :|
0	1522919173	1	Hope binance delists xvg by the end of the week.
0	1522944608	1	Where is blocktime? p.s not a xvg holder.
0	1522951216	1	Lambo soon bitches!!! Porn hub here we come on April 16th!! 
0	1522877083	1	Why doesnt this have upvotes?
1	1522897413	2	Because its an exploitation of a shitcoin
0	1522876847	1	whats next? 
1	1522877021	21	Wait for the dev to make up another story. 
1	1522879736	10	Forbes to start supporting it like this. When I saw this article an hour ago I nearly started puking (I also have the flu) https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2018/04/04/mysterious-world-changing-deal-makes-verge-the-new-sexy-crypto/#129ae1627a27"*No one doubts Verge has a partner. But for how long and how much cachet they can bring to XVG is a mystery.*" clearly the author is a massive bag holder, because I certainly doubt verge has a partner. I've felt verge was shady since john tweeted about it in December and my friends all fomo'd into it. I literally kept telling them all 'this is more then likely a bad project or a scam, if you believe in Power token, sure, if you believe in XRP, sure- But if you're looking at Verge like you can trust it, your in for a not good surprise.'What I'm really getting at is if people want to just take whatever the media is hyping at this point in the crypto game, and the media is doing such a piss poor job of judgement in good and bad projects- I feel this market will collapse very badly and literally theyres only going to be a handful of legitimate tokens or cryptos look to. **How could anyone actually be dumb enough to support a token whos authors acted like this in the past, created video evidence of clearly illegal behaviour, demanded more funds to release the NAME of a partner to get more investors when any rational company would simply NAME DROP to gather more investors?**
2	1522882051	20	The article was written by a Forbes contributor. The requirement is very loose. It's no better than blog posts.
3	1522888571	3	Thank you for clearing that up but it still doesn't help breath good vibes into this market. Forbes look like it's turned into the ultimate clickbait anyways.
2	1522889872	5	It's not even an article...  Basically a blog post by a "contributor."
2	1522895934	3	Lol, I saw that. Hell of a time to decide to post an article about Verge.
3	1522916286	2	Now is the time to pump before they announce their big partnership with their local barbershop.
2	1522928945	2	If there's /sites after forbes, it's absolute garbage. Literally anyone can submit to them. 
0	1522900874	1	So does this mean that blockchain is hackable? or this is just a flaw in XVG's design/code? 
1	1522902527	7	its a flaw only in XVG. it has no bearing on the security of any other chain. 
2	1522905514	-4	Few other coins got hit with this attack over the past few days. Look it up on April 1
3	1522905805	3	Do you know which coins or what the attack is called? (hard to google without that info)
3	1522915334	1	Stop believing everything your "dev" and savior says. 
1	1522916451	2	> So does this mean that blockchain is hackable? or this is just a flaw in XVG's design/code?This _particular_ exploit?  Probably specific to Verge.  Majority consensus attacks in general?  Intrinsic threat to all crypto.
0	1522920847	-1	Feel like going out all fiat. If verge blows up all crypto will take a hit on the bad press. 
0	1522891755	-5	Can we please stop posting about XVG? everyday I see new thread about XVG. We already know the dev has half a brain and a scammer
1	1522892087	-16	Perhaps you are not aware of US libel laws?  Publication is a legal requirement of libel and publication on the internet satisfies that law.  Additionally, the term  "scammer" in the context you used it is a term that defames someone's reputation, causing them harm in their work or in their effort to have a livelihood.  If you can prove that, then you cannot be sued.  If you cannot, then truth is the defense.  Just saying.. be careful with what you post. 
2	1522892170	10	Lmfao, please arrest me now. He’s a scammer period. If you want proof, we have google and YouTube.
2	1522899606	3	Yeah, I'm pretty sure we're legally in the clear when we say that Verge is a shit sandwich.
3	1522905642	-2	Do as you wish.  As I said, I'm not in the pro-con game of Verge.  I'm here for periodic interruptions to increasing the balance of my trading account daily.  But, yes, I did teach this topic as part of journalism/PR courses and I have sued one person, successfully. Your risk. IDC. 
4	1522908679	2	I'm not even from America.  I can call him scammer all I want.  No one is going to extradite for that
4	1522939470	2	/r/iamverysmart
4	1522918077	0	Was it in the US? It's practically impossible to successfully sue for libel in the US. And *especially* when you're talking about crypto, because these aren't technically companies (with the exception of Ripple, which... honestly I don't know how Ripple classifies itself).
5	1522940586	2	the person you are responding to is a pathological liar. s/he needs help
2	1522939429	1	lmao. you are hilarious. verge is a total scam
2	1522912127	0	Write this down champion.You are a scammerSue me... lol your a flop
0	1522884361	-37	You guys are some sad sorry whiny bitches.  It is not anywhere the DOOMGASM you want it to be.  You know you aren't trying to "help" anyone.  You are trying to hurt something you feel you missed out on.  You don't want to see it succeed.  Its called  “schadenfreude” - German, like Nazis - like how you are acting.  Yeah I went there.  All conversations do - I just wanted a head start.  Blame Godwin.  He started it.
1	1522886019	13	Is it okay for you if verge's network is exploitable to the degree of a miner being able to mine 1 second empty blocks for 13 hours just so he can get the block rewards? 
2	1522887119	9	Dont bother with people that are having cognitive dissonance...
2	1522886744	-18	No, and that isn't what happened and the actual  issue is being addressed in a manner that will make it more secure than ever... so...
3	1522887079	11	Will you agree to shut up and believe me if your almighty dev says the same thing I'm saying? Because he is on Bitcointalk. 
3	1522899679	2	lol it's STILL happening
1	1522884716	7	Got rekt hard? 
1	1522885341	7	Oh, I see, so you are saying: "Bears eat beets. Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica."
2	1522900601	3	Michael!
1	1522884957	3	Remind me! 1 month
1	1522898333	2	Your are simple minded. Did you get a victim of many scams, or just Verge?
1	1522904045	2	Some heavy bags there buddy, it's going to zero
1	1522922401	2	> You are trying to hurt something you feel you missed out on. You don't want to see it succeed. Its called “schadenfreude”no that's not even close to what schadenfreude means.
1	1522911797	1	Missed out on what? Lol your shitcoin is going to rock bottom and still sane people wouldn't pick it up even if it was given to them for free. Have fun with your bags.
0	1522920401	-2	Scam or not, the gains feel pretty real.
1	1522921843	1	Only if you cashed out. 
2	1522922322	-5	Got in at 450-500 satoshi, monitoring price every minute of the day so feel confident price will go higher as we get closer to 16-17th april 
0	1522899559	-7	nobody cares about XVG here. Post that garbage in their sub.
0	1522888100	-25	All the butthurt in here is hilarious...All the hate just shows the pure success of the coin, love it
1	1522888176	13	Please explain to me what this "butthurt" you see is? Edit: forgot to ask about the "pure success"
2	1522888573	16	If I ever want to start a cult I know which sub to recruit from.
3	1522890444	10	Just call it VergcoinDark
1	1522890049	8	It's not "hate"...  Just people pointing out obvious flaws and lies by a known scammer/liar.
1	1522905682	5	Pure success? What did it achieve in real world? 
0	1522883261	-27	Looks like all the usually culprits from all the Dec/Jan FUD are back. 
1	1522883571	16	Please state what here is FUD. Did you check out the explorer?
2	1522889190	-6	You know what I'm going to take ownership of my comment and state that I thought I was posting on the /r/vergecurrency sub rather than /r/Cryptocurrency..  I own verge as well as other crypto and the amount of drama around this coin is rediculous...
3	1522889352	6	Sorry you've completely lost me. But I don't blame you. You've probably been pumped and dumped on a bunch of times. That has to leave some bruises. 
4	1522889685	-3	The day my mood changes when I look at my Crypto is the day I cash out :)
1	1522890271	5	People are stating facts, just like in Dec/Jan...  The only people holding are the newbie morons who don't know Justin's long history of lies and bad code.
2	1522903985	3	Sadly this is not true. There are early investor that rode it all the way to ath. Didn’t sell and are still holding now dreaming about lambo and shilling this coin. Got ban at verge for posting a concern about their “partnership” but I still go there. It’s some entertaining shit
