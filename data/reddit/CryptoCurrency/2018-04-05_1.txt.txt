0	1522885892	74	Thank you for getting rid of the sperm.
1	1522901359	8	I still see some, but it's blurry
1	1522894494	6	Lol u cracked me up for the 2nd time 😂
1	1522915348	1	The sperm looked nice.
0	1522900962	30	Where is dogecoin?
0	1522885627	55	No IOTA? This is clearly FUD. Just kidding, cool icons.
0	1522889896	25	The Req one really pops out.
1	1522902654	5	Fucking Req. It’s lost more value than everything else out there 
2	1522921556	5	I have some Bounty0x for you, if you like. 😆
2	1522932062	2	At least they’re still getting work done.  
0	1522883750	45	Liking the Nano one
1	1522893731	24	Nano has a nice logo. They done good on the rebrand.
2	1522898473	8	I wish they would’ve just made it a lightning bolt in the shape on a “N”.. I mean they were Raiblocks (Rai = Lightning in Japanese), rebranded to Nano currency built on instant transactions. 
3	1522942759	1	The dots show off block lattice structure 
4	1522942951	1	We don’t want your logic here! 🔱😈
0	1522886385	6	Imagine some poker chips with these ones. ^^Somebody ^^please
1	1522898992	3	Throw some funded private keys in each one,  and you've got a high stakes game.
0	1522893947	5	Thanks for your generous MIT License.
0	1522880886	9	Download them here https://lukaszadam.com/illustrations
1	1522881524	7	Funny you don’t offer a way to buy them whit crypto.
2	1522881582	5	Good point! I actually do I just didn’t implement the option to my website. 
3	1522890534	14	I'll pay with TRX
1	1522914510	1	Great work! But are only 3 icons available? I just downloaded that zip file. Or am I missing something?
2	1522914724	4	Yes, only the first three are free, I have added the rest to my Etsy shop, since it was so much work to create them all and some of them were made because people wanted their Coin in this set. 
1	1522926167	0	Downloaded them, sadly there are only 3 of all the icons you presented here! :(Could you upload the final package please and also include them as .ico and .icns please?Would be really awesome since this is a great freebie! Thanks so much!
2	1522929669	2	Hey there, this new set isn't free I only offer the first three coins for free download. I had to put the rest in my ETSY shop since I have made many of them particular for this sub.
3	1522952343	1	That's fair, it would be nice if you actually included this info on the download page. With an Etsy link of course.
0	1522897300	3	I really like the shade of blue you used on the OmiseGO.
0	1522906966	3	ethereum, bitcoin, litecoin, vechainneo, dogecoin, substratum, nanoeos, cardano, stellar lumens, monerodash, request network, walton chain, omisego👌
0	1522914073	3	very nice, but missing IOTA and Zcash
0	1522933786	3	I couldn't help but notice that you didn't make every single shit coin I'm invested in. 
0	1522885898	2	That looks much better.  The circuit lines were a good idea but didn't fit in and were too regular and irregular at the same time.  
0	1522893413	2	Love the purple on the Walton token. Also, nice choice of green for Request. These are really cool!
0	1522908179	2	Happy SUB is in there, great job!
0	1522911604	2	better
0	1522920829	2	These are the coins that op holds. 😀
0	1522941758	2	How come I dont see Railroadblocks the fastest coin of the future that sends crypto coins faster than you can say decentrilaztion
0	1522893431	2	Stellar looking 👍
0	1522908631	2	Why no IOTA? :<
0	1522886099	7	Why no XRP?
1	1522899029	4	Crypto icons.
2	1522903817	-3	3rd biggest crypto FYI... not sure if you are new though haha
3	1522925188	4	Are you? That joke went way over your head.
4	1522944635	2	Read the thread... this kid was not joking 
3	1522906055	1	If ripple is crypto, then so is PayPal and venmo and apple pay, and droid pay, oh and banks in general, etc.  Let's just add all of them to coin market cap eh?
4	1522923881	1	Youre right Ripple isnt crypto but XRP is and we were talking about XRP.
4	1522937634	1	Yawn.  XRP ledger is 100% independent of Ripple.  Not sure what you mean when you say "if Ripple is crypto" - no it's not crypto, it's a company.  XRP ledger will be more decentralised than BTC by the end of 2018.  
5	1522940714	0	Nearly every 2nd and 3rd gen chain is more decentralized than BTC already.  Bitmain has proven the dangers of mining.
4	1522906098	-2	Lol they use USD kiddo... try again
5	1522907151	-6	No they dont... they are paired with every fiat world wide, because they use  token, every single one of them.  And wtf do you think xcurrent is?
6	1522907252	-4	Did I bring up xCurrent LMAO. Nothing in this post has to do with xCurrent. Look up xRapid buddy. The one WU is integrating in their new app ;)
7	1522941167	0	Listen, its always the same with you fan boys, whenever you start losing an argument, you bring up the word tag, that is Ripple.  That company named it xRP because the damn RP stands for Ripple.  Its purposefully confusing to add layers of complexity, because that's what wallstreet and bankers do; when the layman begins to move the curtain and reveal the bullshit, they add more layers.
8	1522944719	2	I brought it up because it is important to note yes, RIPPLE and PayPal do much of the same thing but XRP is a digital asset and has nothing similar to PayPal. Wording is key ;) 
9	1522944915	0	Paypal uses a token to keep track of your fiat during storage and transfer.  How is that different from Ripples token?
7	1522907407	0	You claimed being paired to usd disqualified them...so you have no clue how their systems work, and xCurrent uses the same method, which puts ripple in the same bunch.  GG.
8	1522907928	-2	Did I say xCurrent was not like PayPal? No. Read before you respond it will help you out. XRP is what we were discussing... NOT Ripple labs and the services they offer. GG buddy.
1	1522899483	-9	XRP isnt real crypto. We like to call it "trash"
2	1522917259	0	Why u getting down voted?
1	1522900081	-12	Dare I say it... Because xrp is kind of evil?
0	1522880089	2	Some sweet looking icons ya made
1	1522880345	1	Thank you sir!
0	1522884243	2	The improvements on sub are really great. Good job op. 
0	1522898825	2	Love it! Thanks for adding NANO 
0	1522886452	1	Gotta make an Icon of Icon my man! 
1	1522891040	2	Yeah swap out the "s" for the icon logo
0	1522888065	1	Great work!
0	1522893944	1	Is it possible to buy individual icons or do we have to purchase the whole set?
1	1522911714	1	MIT license - no buying required 
0	1522894219	1	Way better than the other ones
0	1522894269	1	Reminds me of gym badges lol 
0	1522896008	1	Dig these. Nice work.  But gimme some FCT! 
0	1522896735	1	I like them but monero is hard to read. Maybe a bit bigger on the icon for it
0	1522897340	1	MUCH better. Love this!
0	1522897871	1	Looks like a bunch of different kinds of e-bomb
0	1522898222	1	They look pale like they’re halfway faded out
0	1522899671	1	What is the 7th one? And the 10th one?  Those are the only two I don’t recognize. The red “S” and the purple Star of David. 
1	1522904746	1	Stablecoin, an old scam. I know because I mined it for a while : / I can't for the life of me figure out why that one was chosen
0	1522899787	1	This is just so nice. Well done!
0	1522901201	1	Here's a great open-source repo of over 300 high quality crypto icons, if anyone needs:  http://cryptoicons.co/
0	1522902156	1	Please add Lisk!! Way cool btw
0	1522902391	1	Have an ethereum address? I'm happy to tip you some REQ. 
0	1522902790	1	Add Lamden
0	1522902867	1	Nice but maybe walton chain purple should be different or two colored like their original colors
0	1522903458	1	Live the req and nano 
0	1522904433	1	What's the second to left on bottom and the second to the right on the second row?
0	1522904909	1	Question is can we download them?
0	1522905254	1	Better!
0	1522907968	1	Substratum looking great
0	1522908010	1	Looks very cool!
0	1522911638	1	But I would like "clean background" ones ..  look like 1990 style
0	1522913235	1	I want to buy these stickers! 
1	1522913662	1	I just did a poster unfortunately no Stickers, but you can get the Icons https://lukaszadam.com/premium 
2	1522914072	1	But stickers...P.S: great job on these. Would you by any chance be able to make one of the Nebulas (NAS) logo? Don't worry if it's asking too much but I'd totally buy them 
0	1522914106	1	It looks like there has been a 90's kid playing with the design! We 90's are so  proud of you! 
1	1522914124	1	haha thank you!
0	1522914420	1	These would look terrific on the Delta app.
1	1522914728	2	thanks!
0	1522915353	1	Looks great.
0	1522915859	1	Coins to add to your list IOTA, ZCash, Ripple, Enigma
0	1522917362	1	No XRP???????? You're beginning to sound like Coinbase.
0	1522922472	1	NEO one looks way better now imo
0	1522923241	1	How come Req is so shilled here? Is everyone shilling it paid? It barely makes top100 yet one of the most mentioned coins here
0	1522923297	1	Vector please?
0	1522927379	1	Dogecoin colors should be more wow.
0	1522927607	1	I like the look. But why is Substratum included with other legitimate coins?
0	1522936914	1	Nano yass😍
0	1522937731	1	Way to go. I’d use these!
0	1522939719	1	Can we make these flair?!
0	1522939774	1	Crypto is back! In pog form!
0	1522943179	1	Nicely Done, but more to come right :)

0	1522946804	1	The sperm made it out of the egg?
0	1522948570	1	Where is WAN ?
0	1522952372	1	No dgb? :(
0	1522881355	1	Personally I dislike the dogecoin icon, but I understand it’s due to the theme your going for.
0	1522885867	0	These icons are a sign. Moon soon.
0	1522894333	0	Those are cool!You should do one of [ActumCrypto](https://actumcrypto.org)!
0	1522901992	0	Subliminal ETH > BTC ;)))
0	1522914077	0	I hate them
0	1522933002	0	Will there be CS and TRX logos?
