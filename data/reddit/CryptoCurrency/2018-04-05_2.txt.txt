0	1522921003	153	Why isnt Verge dropping more with so much bad news?
1	1522921346	214	Because verge holders are blind
2	1522922720	107	Went on their Telegram - can confirm
3	1522930012	97	Decided to join after seeing this.Some guy was saying anybody who talks negative about XVG is obviously being paid and he'll hold it to 0. I told him to stop getting so emotionally invested into particular coins and he said I was "fudding".Its crazy how misused the terms 'shill' and 'FUD' are in crypto.
4	1522930266	68	Being objective is FUD these days
5	1522934929	15	The fake news people are buying crypto now no longer the math nerds. 
6	1522935950	4	Fake news people?
7	1522936448	14	Low-information voters
8	1522936811	7	Story of my country.
9	1522942058	3	We must live in the same country.
7	1522936641	2	the people who share fake news stories that conform to their preexisting biases 
5	1522931927	20	If you aren't bending over backwards to praise the coin... FUD!Any form of criticism... FUD!Plugging my ears, lalalalala, can't hear you!
6	1522952024	1	"All this FUD is actually a good thing. It means they're scared of what (shitcoin) is going to accomplish! I'd be worried if people *weren't* hating us!" -Shitcoin Shills
4	1522934787	3	I mean, it's very likely that was a paid shill. There's a good chance the dude doesn't hold a single XVG.
4	1522939874	1	That's why I hate the term FUD.
4	1522940767	1	Shush you obvious shill.
4	1522946966	1	People/news that doesn’t go along with their narrative is FUD or shilling.
4	1522947452	1	I'm surprised you weren't banned like so many others...
4	1522949014	1	FUD is a fnord.
3	1522952252	1	Their reddit is interesting to say the least. Someone says, essentially, "sell now, sinking ship". The response is "we can't sell or we would tank the price". I really don't know what to think of it all. 
2	1522935455	10	Someone just put a bid in for 3 million XVG on binance.
3	1522944769	5	Poor dumbass... hopefully he rethinks
2	1522934853	9	Low IQ investors. 
3	1522942136	2	If the low information voters are buying verge, then verge is about to pass up bitcoin on the 17th.  Maybe we need to stop being so intelligent and buy shitcoins?
2	1522951873	1	Because ~~verge holders~~ crypto and stock market investors are blind
2	1522925150	1	Not exactlyThey’re one eyed jacks 
3	1522929351	1	Better Jack than Willy I guess.
2	1522935886	0	Great community, hard working devs
2	1522939118	-9	I don’t get the hate on Verge hodlers; they are no different from the rest of you hodlers. 
3	1522939269	9	They are different. They keep getting fucked over by the team but still praise XVG like it's god of crypto or some shit.
4	1522941104	2	Sounds like Republicans and their base. 
2	1522929912	-48	Sounds like jealousy. I'll take it. The truth is that it doesn't matter what happens to a coin or token because the people holding it is what gives it value.This sub is furious that the price is holding steady instead of crashing. You see it in every post and I just laugh.Next week the price will rise again over 1000 sats and your fud will go unnoticed. It will continue to rise and I will cash out my fat bag of "shitcoins" when I see the golden peak rather it be the partnership or before hand and you will miss out because you are trying to follow the cool trend of hating on Verge.Good luck with your monero.
3	1522930485	48	> The truth is that it doesn't matter what happens to a coin or token because the people holding it is what gives it value. Your average verge investor everybody
4	1522935479	5	This, ladies and gentlemen, is what I mean when you can treat cryptos as an investment or treat it like gambling. With that being said, I'm all in on CTR
3	1522934008	9	A fool and his money are soon parted
3	1522943152	0	I'm guessing you have a fair amount of this shit coin 😂
1	1522925403	68	I think what it comes down to is, if you're the sort of person who was holding Verge, you probably won't be receptive to news that there are problems with it. Otherwise, you probably wouldn't have invested in the first place.
2	1522927668	24	This seems like a fair analysis of the situation.It's anecdotal but a lot of Verge builders I've come across don't seem to have good technical understanding of the tech in general and are very new to the crypto space.Anyone who's been around long enough to remember when Verge was called DogeCoinDark has pretty much stayed away from it despite the rebranding. 
2	1522946085	1	You mean people who tweet #vergefamlambosonthemoon aren't tech savvy invididuals?
2	1522946950	1	I just read your comment, and I agree. 
1	1522925267	16	Because if they sell, they'd lose it all. It's classic game theory.
2	1522928527	3	I think this is it... not everyone holding xvg are dumb, there’s a ton of smart money riding it mostly profiting from dumb pump catchers. 
3	1522929369	3	Yea as with other coins, the majority of verge is probably owned by a few whales. And what reason do they have to sell at once, if they can hold and pump it further to milk in the stupidity of the fanboys? Even if they want to sell, they'd probably do it slowly over time so as not to crash the price.
4	1522932556	5	Funniest part is the TA guys drawing elliott waves and shit on verge's chart.  Basically just charting whale activity and pretending it's organic market movement, lmao!  I'm not shitting on TA either it has it's place especially in high liquidity mature markets, but on verge type cryptos just lol
5	1522933609	3	Absolutely agree. I'm a complete Elliott Wave cultist, but the theory *only makes sense with high liquidity assets*. You just can't, in any way, apply TA to assets that aren't held and actively traded by a vast number of people. 
1	1522930446	5	'Cause their blockchain ground to a halt. Can't sell shit if transactions can't be sent. 
2	1522940179	2	I thought exchange transactions were off the blockchain. They just credit your account with purchased coin.  Doesn't hit blockchain until you move it off, right?
3	1522941585	3	You're assuming that most people's XVG is on the exchanges
1	1522927789	17	So weird. Tiniest bit of bad news and people panic sell their good holdings, actual coin killing bad news for XVG and they hold? Can't they hold BTC instead?
2	1522931857	16	people holding verge simple dont understand what is going on. they instantly dismiss everything as FUD and go back to snapchatting while they wait for their upcoming partnerships with amazon, audi and rolex
3	1522935020	4	His going to make the announcement on his flight out of the United States. 
1	1522931901	4	Because we have Stockholm syndrome

2	1522928829	2	If a blockchain doesn't have funds for a logo, something is seriously wrong with them. 
1	1522934700	2	You can show whatever proof you want to Dogecoin Dark ALTgang but they will never stop buying that scam.
1	1522935743	2	Because they've all lost so much already, they're praying it'll go up so they don't have to sell at a loss. Heh...
2	1522937420	2	Exactly my reasoning for sticking with the Tron I was stupid enough to buy a while ago. I just pray that the Chinese are as stupid as the Verge-ins...
3	1522937593	2	I have absolutely no idea about your circumstances, but now is when you want to reshuffle your portfolio to the percentages you think are best seeing as most coins/tokens have dropped over 50%Sometimes selling at a loss can be a win down the road 👍🏽Good luck my dude
1	1522928563	5	conspiracy: bcash maximalists are dumping $ to keep XVG afloat so that people leave them alone! if xvg and tron disapears, they are back to the top of the list of cryptocurrency's talking monkeys.
1	1522939598	1	day traders
1	1522949163	1	Verge feels like reverse vechain at this point. Every day there's some new crazy story that makes me feel more sure that verge is terrible.
1	1522952158	1	Vergefam... It's nothing but a cult now.
0	1522929087	83	Let this be a lesson to anyone else thinking of ~~forking Dogecoin~~ using Dogecoin's branding - you don't mess with perfection. Meanwhile Dogecoin's operation is as smooth as a newborn puppy's bottom.Edit: OK, danvtec6942 is right, it's not a fork. They used Dogecoin's name in theirs originally. TIL. But I hope you can understand my irritation. The Dogecoin developers (not J.Palmer, but the actual core developers who took over in early 2014) are good guys and have produced solid and reliable tech. But the Verge core dev still has "Doge" in his username on bitcointalk even though he has never had anything to do with the Dogecoin project.
1	1522939744	8	>The Dogecoin developers (not J.Palmer, but the actual core developers who took over in early 2014) are good guys and have produced solid and reliable tech.LOL, they just forked bitcoin and moved a few decimal places. And it hasnt been maintained, updated , or received any of the upgrades or  security fixes that bitcoin has since 2014.  If dogecoin proves anything, its that bitcoin developers know their shit.
2	1522940773	59	And yet, bitcoin is crashing but 1 doge is always 1 doge
3	1522941015	21	But my 2 Doges had 8 PuppiesNow I am 10 Doges!
4	1522942890	13	That sort of rampant dogegflation could tank the economy!
5	1522943285	11	I'm sorry guys, will snip my Doge's
2	1522946255	6	Dogecoin isn't even forked from Bitcoin... It's forked from Luckycoin, which is a fork of Litecoin.
3	1522951580	1	Which is a fork of bitcoin?Forks all the way down.
2	1522951911	1	> they just forked ~~bitcoin~~ Luckycoin and moved a few decimal places. FTFY.LOL Luckycoin

2	1522932981	8	This guy is correct. This has been pointed out many times in comment replies, but it just became a popular opinion that Verge is a Dogecoin fork.**TL;DR:** 1 XVG =/= 1 XVG
3	1522933634	5	I didn't know this before, why was it called Dogecoin Dark then? Horseback attempt like bitcoin private?
4	1522934954	3	[This post on /r/vergecurrency was about that question](https://np.reddit.com/r/vergecurrency/comments/7mnevr/correcting_those_who_think_verge_is_a_fork_of/)

0	1522924183	27	I sense a very bad end for Verge...
0	1522924700	30	The price seems to be holding up incredibly well given the seriousness of this issue. 
1	1522925839	23	Most of us are not very well adept to understand what actually is happening
2	1522932962	51	Simplified version: people are printing free money instead of processing normal transactions. The "*fix*" was a hardfork and copy paste job, which doesn't actually fix anything.Some background, a significant amount of XVGs source code is also copy pasted from other projects. Here we've got a relevant bit of code from [peercoin](https://github.com/peercoin/peercoin/blob/v0.4.0ppc/src/main.h#L57):    static const int64 nMaxClockDrift = 2 * 60 * 60; // two hoursand then the copy pasted section along with comments correcting the mistake on the [Verge github](https://github.com/vergecurrency/VERGE/commit/7294e062a61f78ffb05689b562f90985463d1179#diff-25d902c24283ab8cfbac54dfa101ad31):    -static const int64 nMaxClockDrift = 2 * 60 * 60;        // two hours    +static const int64 nMaxClockDrift = 2 * 15;        // fifteen minutesI'm not going to go back and dig through all the code (again), but I'll say this isn't the only instance of stuff just being copy pasted together.  To be fair, if a section of code works for what you need, you understand how it works, and the license permits, I don't see anything wrong with code reuse.  The problem here is it doesn't seem like he understand how it works because what he uses often doesn't address the underlying issues.That is reinforced by the response to the 51% attack.  Someone is running software which is saying that regular transactions are invalid, and only their fraudulent transactions can be processed.  In doing so they are continually claiming block rewards for transactions that aren't actually valid.  Forking does not prevent that from happening.  At *best*, it would slow the attacker down until they're caught up with the fork.Now, with this information in mind, consider the missed deadlines.  The most likely explanation is that he attempted to get copy pasted code to work and ran into difficulties. The unprofessional responses are likely a result of either [dunning-kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) or an intentional effort to mitigate the negative repercussions of a half-baked hack job.  Considering it's been a constant problem throughout the coin's history (both the lack of professionalism in interactions and coding,  and an apparent lack of expertise) - I think it's highly unlikely the current exploit will be mitigated in a timely fashion. If the past is any indicator, Sunerok will likely continue to search through other code bases for a quick fix rather than go through his code to figure out where it went wrong.  Meanwhile, the bad actors will continue to print illegitimate Verge which devalues everyone else's.Lastly the timing is suspicious.  An attack right after massive donations... it'd be a very convenient excuse for a "partnership" to be withdrawn due to fundamental issues with the currency.With as long as this post is, that's the short list of what's going wrong here as simple as I could make it.
3	1522932969	9	**Dunning–Kruger effect**In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein people of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude; without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.Conversely, highly competent individuals may erroneously assume that tasks easy for them to perform are also easy for other people to perform, or that other people will have a similar understanding of subjects that they themselves are well-versed in.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
3	1522938724	3	Very interesting analysis, thank you.  Not being keen on coding, my common sense question is this: if so many fraudulent XVG are being dumped on the market, how is the price holding (and even creeping up)?  Makes no sense.FYI - I am a former XVG holder and wanted so much to believe in the project, but I am simply too skittish to touch it now...
4	1522940898	7	Honestly it could be a lot of things. I know a little bit about group dynamics and manipulation of groups... so it'll be more from that angle but here are a few:The spaces for "true believers" are actively censored, so that could play a factor.From the psychological angle, people hate being wrong. A lot of people are adverse to admitting they made a bad call - and don't like to own up to it.  That reinforces groupthink.Speaking of groupthink, studies have shown that frequently when groups state something incorrect as fact, individuals in that group will conform - even when they know it's wrong - and reiterate the group opinion/fact rather than their own.Then you've got the fact that people are reluctant to hear opposing viewpoints (that's part of the reason groupthink and social media platforms are an issue).  Combine this with the paranoia of shills and people now have a plausible excuse for dismissing any perspective not in alignment with their own.And of course there could also be intentional manipulation as well.  It's not in the interest of anyone holding large amounts (whether from investment or exploits) for the price to crash before they can sell off.Ultimately the market won't always react like you think it will... but that comes down to the fact that it's driven by *people*. People do not always act rationally.  They don't always act as expected when acting emotionally either.I do think it's going to drop, I just can't say for sure when that will happen.
5	1522942379	0	Thank you for the thoughtful response.  It does make a lot of sense.  I agree with you on the effect of groupthink.  I see it everywhere now, more pervasive than ever, especially in politics and the media. “Hillary’s going to win!” “The Russians want to destroy America!” “Guns are evil!” It seems no amount of facts and common sense can reach people these days.  Why should crypto markets be an exception?
6	1522943016	1	It was present before, it's just being noticed a bit more now thanks to the spotlight.Coincidentally, if you start paying attention to what drives group reactions, you do pretty well at things like poker... and making quick flips on crypto (including verge).  Speaking from personal experience.
7	1522944777	0	Yes, I have figured this out -- too late, unfortunately!  Watching it play out in real-time now with BTC, incidentally.  Massive group think going on.  So many still seem to see bullish "wicks'", "candles", "cups" and "handles" that will take it to $10K and higher soon.  It's group think that I might have bought into months ago, but I see the delusion now and am watching it more closely in order to make my buying and selling decisions.  I think that when BTC breaks $5000 panic will start to seep in.  When it hits $3000 there will be terror.  I will wait until then to buy. Everything else is simply whale-driven fake-outs to lure in the masses.
8	1522945811	1	>  It's group think that I might have bought into months agoEveryone does it at some point, it's what you do when you realize it that matters.  Cutting losses rather than holding and *hoping* for a rebound is essential in risk management - something everyone here should be practicing (even if they don't intend to day trade).  Maybe the price will rebound.  Maybe it'll drop to zero.  Even revolutionary technologies have failed - so adoption and progress is not a given.>  I will wait until then to buyNot saying you should follow my example, but I've been consistently trading since New Years... and I'm nearly back to precrash prices (before factoring in cashouts which would put me in the green).  The only time I stopped was when I saw a ton of obvious buy/sell wall manipulation across a ton of different currencies... I sat out for a bit then.Even if we're going further down there will be opportunities before we hit that new low - and if you can take advantage of them you'll have even more to work with when it hits that point. YMMV ofc.
9	1522949663	2	Yes, you are absolutely correct.  When I said I intended to wait until $3K to buy, I meant for a longer-term hold.  But you are 100% right, there will be opportunities along the way to buy on falls to support and sell on bounces to resistance.  If played patiently and correctly, it could lead to precisely what you say, i.e. adding some powder for purchases at the bottom.Congrats on being back to nearly pre-crash prices.  If I had figured this out long ago I would be in better shape now.  But it's all a learning process.  And yes, it's what you do with your learning that really matters.I think there is a fierce mentality in the crypto community against cutting losses.  The HODL mentality is strong here, like The Force.  It took me a whole to realize that HODLing a portfolio of coins and watching it sink further into the red makes no sense if I could sell, even at a "loss", and buy back that same portfolio (or more) months later for a lot less $$.  I bought ADA at $.40 then dumped it at $.30 for a loss.  It's $.14 now.  If I can buy it back at $.10 or less, I will consider that a win.  I think a lot of people will be surprised just how low these ALTS can go when BTC breaches $5K and all hell breaks loose.The HODL mentality works to the great advantage of whales.  When they know that they can count on a large chunk of people who won't sell, regardless of price, it makes it much easier for them to pump and dump.We are most definitely on the same page.
4	1522942407	1	I think exchanges have started to block new deposits, so the hacked coins have not moved *(that much)* yet. This alone does not explain it though, as people have weak hands and this is very serious news.
3	1522937642	2	Arent many coins copy/paste jobs from other coins
4	1522939070	9	How far down the rabbit hole do you want to go?  Technically, if you use a library written by someone else you're reusing someone else's code.  What matters though is the implementation.  Knowing how to use the code, and what you're doing with it matters.More to your point though> Arent many coins copy/paste jobs from other coinsYes, but most coins are just trying to ride the efforts of others to make the creator(s) money - and then they fizzle out.  That's a different case than if you were to selectively copy specific functions, or fork previous work and actually build on top of it with full knowledge of how everything works.  The former is trying to capitalize on someone else's work.  The latter is trying to improve upon it.
4	1522939068	4	Not like this. This is copy/pasting with a *lot* of marketing.
4	1522943011	2	Yes, but not in the same way.You have what most quality projects do and take known working code and implement it into their project. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Or in this case don't re-invent the wheel. But you have to know what the code does and how/why it works.Than you have what Verge is doing, and copying/pasting a Frakenstein type codebase. Where the devs copy code that they think works, but not exactly sure why/how it works.
1	1522941790	3	Well if you can't move the coins to the exchange because the chain ground to a halt you really can't sell...
0	1522927455	19	No, noooo our beautiful cult 
0	1522940475	17	Bought in at a penny, sold in the high 20s, and never looked back.  Verge may be a shitcoin, but it was probably one of my best investments percentage-wise.

1	1522926331	13	that would mean they would lose their verginity

1	1522927656	35	my verge dust on binance is now sub atomic particles
2	1522933197	3	You haven't turned it into BNB? I just converted all my dust into BNB yesterday!
3	1522934503	3	How?
4	1522937975	8	Just replied this to someone else, but:>You have to use the Market tab instead of the Limit tab that it defaults to (under Buy BNB on the Basic Exchange). That will allow you to convert all sorts of dust into BNB.
5	1522938477	5	Cool, thanks.  It never occurred to me to change it to market.  It didn't get rid of everything but definitely cleaned up a lot.
5	1522950699	1	Verge really has a BNB direct pair? 
6	1522952692	1	Just checked for BNB/XVG, nope. Sorry, I hadn't bought any Verge but all the other alts I tried yesterday did so I thought they had BNB paired up with everything on their exchange.
6	1522953073	1	I can't seem to find it :D
3	1522933858	2	Wait, wut? I can convert my $1 here and there without making multiple trades?
4	1522937941	5	You have to use the Market tab instead of the Limit tab that it defaults to (under Buy BNB on the Basic Exchange). That will allow you to convert all sorts of dust into BNB.
3	1522938399	1	How??
1	1522932337	2	Haha same. Exactly $19.02 now worth $5.48. Not sure if I should even bother selling. 
2	1522949348	1	Id say with that amount you can risk losing it all by hoping it moons. I on the other hand was 100% in xvg at one point so I got the f out. Luckily at a profit, but its peanuts compared to my portfolio in december

0	1522940145	8	I still don't understand how is it not under $0.01 already.This is nonsense, seriously.
0	1522941204	4	Literally the highest gainign coin out there this week.  why dis?
1	1522951767	1	someone is mentally torturing the crypto community.
0	1522941950	3	As someone who held this coin for 6 months before jumping off when the jumping was good: Why do people invest the way the people on the coin sub do? It makes zero sense. The coin is facing serious flaws and major issues with developer trust. Ditch it. Buy Dash, Zcash or Monero instead if you want a privacy coin.
0	1522923848	40	As a Monero holder all I can say is Verge is dead, it's over, totally inferior, was destined to fail, worst coin ever, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  p.s. buy Monero
1	1522924214	3	SEC will come after Monero soon. (seriously, just a wacko theory).
2	1522925960	27	Let them come after Monero. That will be hilarious to see them try. 
3	1522928040	8	> That will be hilarious to see them try.Well, its extremely easy to come after monero should they choose to. Just label XMR as illegal. Do you think the price could sustain if no exchanges allow you to trade? 
4	1522933361	9	> Just label XMR as illegal.What is true is that XMR price would drop, but not significantly, because you need a *global* consensus (a global law you could say) to make it a problem for Monero. You need all major countries to agree to pass the same law (which just won't happen any time soon)But even then, *how* will they enforce it is the main question? Decentralized exchanges are starting to develop where you don't need KYC.Plus, ban of piracy is sort of a *global* consensus which everyone understands is illegal, but people can still use piratebay and is still an issue.I've been in the crypto space for a few years and i remember when the US government tried to make Bitcoin *"illegal"*, by simply saying that all internet money can be checked by border control. Yea that wasn't very bright i know. They tried it and failed and same goes for Monero which is even harder to track.If they could make Monero illegal they would have already done that.
4	1522928133	11	Yes. It will always be alive no matter what governments do. Sure it might lose liquidity but that doesn’t means it will go away. People want privacy 
5	1522928641	16	>It will always be alive no matter what governments do.Yes, I agree. But he asked if you think it would hold its price.. 
6	1522944161	2	Short term or long?
5	1522934971	1	Bytecoin.
4	1522932427	4	Yes. That would completely legitimize it. There are already real use cases for Monero, that would prove it in my honest opinion and I'd buy more through Localmonero
5	1522945418	1	Oh man. Can you imagine if the US government actually came out and said "We are outlawing Monero. Not the rest of cryptocurrencies, just Monero. It is the only one we view as a threat. "    Which is exactly why they have been so hands off about it. The government isn't *that* dumb. Their best bet is to ignore it and hope apathy destroys it.
6	1522945529	1	The government has a lot of dummies midlevel and down. The tyrants at the top are on another level though. They know how to play games.
4	1522928657	1	hurr durr we just make it illegalthats not how this works... thats not how any of this works
5	1522928764	4	> thats not how this works... thats not how any of this worksWell then, do explain how it all works, genius. I only gave a hypothetical scenario. If serious regulations do come to cryptos in the coming years, then you need to strongly look at the possibilities. 
5	1522937718	1	It worked with drugs and prostitution... Edit: I didn't think this would be necessary, but /s.
6	1522942018	2	Yep, their value is now zero and drugs and prostitution dont exisit anymore, all because its illegal. Wait a minute...
4	1522929388	1	It would probably go up.
4	1522930125	-3	Exactly. These are the real blind people. The ones who think monero is untouchable. The coin may not be traced but what happens when sec doesn't allow it to be traded on exchanges? I mean it's not fast enough to be a currency so where do you think you'll spend it then?
5	1522931440	7	Why do you think the SEC can make rules for all exchanges in the world
6	1522940314	6	Let me tell you how strong the SEC is.  I am a U.S. citizen and had a bank account in Europe (Zurich) a few years ago, mostly savings for a rainy day. Everything was going fine for a while, until I got a call from my account rep one day telling me that the bank was closing my account.  Why? New SEC “regulations” that were virtually impossible to comply with.  The regs applies only to U.S. citizens, which meant that we all had to cash out and take our money back “home”.Sure, other citizens got to keep their accounts, but my point is that the SEC has a very long reach. And if the agency makes it impossible for U.S. citizens to use a currency (like Monero), that’s a huge hit to its adoption. And don’t think the SEC isn’t unscrupulous enough or sufficiently potent to put covert pressure on other governments to kill adoption for their citizens, too.Think about it: the U.S. government has coerced the entire world into the biggest scam of all: using the fiat disaster known as the dollar as the  word’s reserve currency.  It’s the definition of a shit currency backed by nothing.  It’s Verge on steroids.They’ve used bullets and blackmail to keep the dollar reserve currency system in place for decades.  Any threat to the system, whether it be Saddam’s Euro-backed oil trade or Qadaffi’s gold-backed dinar, was met with vicious force and, ultimately, murder.  This government will stop at NOTHING to protect dollar hegemony.And yet some believe that Monero will be allowed to conduct “private” transactions, away from be praying eyes of the U.S. government?  Free from tracking and monitoring?Ladies and gentlemen, it’s time we stop fooling ourselves.  This entire crypto space is simply one giant experiment that’s being “watched” by the Controllers.  They want to see how the technology progresses, what the kinks are, how adoption takes places, etc.  But don’t think for one minute that any of this will supplant the dollar or any fiat currency.When the time is right, they will crash the global economy (can you hear the death drums beating now in the Dow and other markets?) and usher in a new, global, “safe”, sovereign crypto, backed by the faith and trust of collective governments and free from the “fraud” of decentralized crypto.It doesn’t take a genius to see that the banking cartel has already highjacked the crypto market and effectively controls it with futures trading:https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@supercrypto1/4th-dimension-bitcoin-manipulation-cartel-price-suppression-is-the-goalThe crypto space has been thoroughly compromised, if it wasn’t compromised from it’s inception.We are pawns.  That doesn’t mean we can’t still make some money as pawns, but I do think that the window is closing, and the opportunities are fading.  Buy Monero, buy ADA, buy LTC, buy TRX — buy whatever the f**k you think has a chance to move big on this next (and probably last) bull run once BTC finally plunges to $3K (or less) and fleeces 80% of the new money that rolled in.Then take your profits and wait for the Financial Overlords to put their new system in place.  The future isn’t going to be the “exciting” one Common preaches about on that empty stage in that damn Microsoft AI commercial.  It’s going to be one in which we are all better and more obedient bitches to our banking salve owners.Sorry to be a Debbie Downer, but short of some sort of revolution in the near future, it’s really game over for humanity. Plan accordingly.[This PSA has been brought to you by someone grounded in reality and who actually gives a f**k]
6	1522931523	0	If the exchange wants to operate within the country it has to abide by the rules. Binance is a business and has to reside someplace. The biggest exchanges are not decentralized and will have to cohert to rules. Plain and simple.
7	1522931641	2	You can just VPN and make an unverified account tho
8	1522931707	2	You're missing the point. It could come down to exchanges delisting the coin to stay in business some day. Then where will you trade it?
9	1522931905	3	That's why decentralized exchanges are going to be immensly popular
9	1522932561	-3	We'd use it you vergin cuck. Stop trying so hard it's sad.
5	1522931487	6	America =/= the whole rest of the world
5	1522932517	1	What makes it not fast enough? Low priority txs are pretty instant. Not confirned or locked on chain, but a POS system has been developed and is nearly instant.
5	1522935037	1	Which would mean that exchanges in the US would no longer allow monero. But really, How many exchanges in the US currently allow monero?
3	1522926059	2	We need rebels in the word.
3	1522947106	1	All they have to do is ban it from legal exchanges and itll hurt monero significantly
4	1522953607	1	Right! So Russia and China will agree with the US?
2	1522926710	4	The beauty of decentralization will appear in that case
2	1522929719	3	Not true. Why would they care if they aren’t scamming anyone/a ponzi? They have much bigger fish to fry 
2	1522926058	2	They wouldn't be able to do anything about it. Like at all.
2	1522934999	1	SEC just like every other person and organization in the world wants to win, and to win, you don't set yourself up to lose. SEC goes after low hanging fruit and outright scams, no way SEC even dares go near something like Monero.

0	1522922742	7	Why would you link to /r/Buttcoin instead of just linking the Bitcointalk thread???
1	1522922988	-6	To save a click.
2	1522924945	4	Yeah but everyone here now has double clicks
3	1522927695	3	It's like reporting employment levels, "Number of jobs created or saved". He created or saved you one click. Same thing, right?
1	1522946444	0	Why wouldn't he, given the situation in question?
0	1522947098	3	They are banning left and right in the XVG subreddit.

0	1522949028	3	XVG was great if you bought it just before the mcafee pump, and then sold right after. It was never a good coin. Just a good way to make quick money.

0	1522933097	7	You know it's bad when /r/CryptoCurrency is reposting /r/Buttcoin threads.  Yikes.

0	1522926955	5	lol die
0	1522930586	2	I wonder if people will still be waiting for their "partnership announcement"?
1	1522938643	1	They spent 75m XVG just to hear what that partnership is, so I'm sure those idiots don't mind waiting for it even though their whole code is all fucked up.
0	1522941558	2	Praying that even if their partnership was legitimate, that the company will cancel it having seen what a bunch of moron the verge devs are. I just love drinking vergein tears  :u
0	1522942000	2	Sadly if the verge boat goes does, a big lack of confidence for any new coin will rise and dive all alts lower. 
1	1522944206	8	there should be no fucking confidence for new coins until they prove themselves. that's the entire problem with the crypto space and why so many fraudulent/shitty projects were >$1 bil market cap earlier this year
2	1522944645	3	I agree. You see total nutwacks with zero education in investing and no education overall hype bullshit like xvg and trashing coins with a usecase and solid teams and a real networking and business approach like xrp icx and ven lol.
2	1522945153	2	It’s difficult for a coin to prove itself with no use, it will always require a little trust before a coin can be certified as secure. The problem is that people get too attached. This coin is not secure and has been proven to be insecure and the fools still hodl on like it’s all FUD. That’s the problem with the crypto space.
0	1522942980	2	The accidental hardfork was immediately rolled back and the new wallets are for a planned fork to fix the issue that started all this. This wall all known yesterday
0	1522945642	2	Great whitepaper, great devs. I'm all in.
0	1522920074	2	So relieved I got out with a little profit when I did, and refrained when I considered buying back in a week ago.
1	1522925847	1	Same, except for the rebuy part
0	1522942667	1	I don't think it was accidental. It is a nice way to issue a rollback.
