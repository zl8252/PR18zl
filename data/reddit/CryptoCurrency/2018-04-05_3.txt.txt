0	1522923550	52	For the curious:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102>Executive Order 6102 required all persons to deliver on or before May 1, 1933, all but a small amount of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve, in exchange for $20.67 per troy ounce. >The main rationale behind the order was actually to remove the constraint on the Federal Reserve which prevented it from increasing the money supply during the depression; the Federal Reserve Act (1913) required 40% gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued.   By the late 1920s, the Federal Reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit (in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes) that could be backed by the gold in its possession (see Great Depression).

Roosevelt "forbidding the Hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States".***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

2	1522952137	3	DEW IT!
1	1522924997	10	> The main rationale behind the order was actually to remove the constraintThat's bs. Why would they need the gold to remove the gold standard. 
2	1522925188	62	As far as I can tell...1. They print money and buy your gold.2. Then they devalue the dollar.3. Now they have a larger reserve.4. Print more money.5. When they hit the reserve limit they drop the gold standard.6. Now they print more money **and** they have all the gold.If Nixon were alive today you'd see all the shitcoin endorsements on his twitter.
3	1522941443	5	No, they were still using the gold standard. This is completely wrong lmao. This is the 1930’s. 
4	1522943995	-21	Are you blind or illiterate? Cause that was step 1 in a 6 step process that happened over years.Do yourself a favour mate if you lack basic verbal reasoning get out of the game.

6	1522944335	-6	I can see you are a moron and struggling here.So by date.1. Buy all the gold 19332. Devalue the dollar (against gold). 1934.3. 1930s-1950s print money4. 1950s-1960s print more money.5. 1971 Nixon drops the gold standard6. 1971- Print money. Really go fucking nuts here.7. 2017 Elect a moron who couldn't spell `fiat`.
7	1522952502	1	Reddit doesn’t like facts unless they’re carefully packaged with trigger free words. People these days care more about their feelings than whether or not they’re wrong. Absolutely pathetic.
8	1522953551	1	People just don't like dicks. You can be correct and not be an ass about it.Well, maybe *you* can't, but the functional part of society can.
3	1522938042	-3	This is why tether is awful as a cryptocurrency.You believe in USD more  than rare Bitcoin? Did you actually listen to anyone before buying crypto?
4	1522947585	3	> You believe in USD more than rare Bitcoin?lol yes. yes i do. I do not believe in my one dollar usd having the same buying power today vs in 10 years - but yes I absolutely believe in USD more than bitcoin
5	1522948460	-1	I think these conflict.
6	1522948705	2	What is the price of Bitcoin in USD?
7	1522948882	0	Depends who you ask. USD is dying and I wont sell my BTC for less than 50k.Exchanges you can sell for 6k or higher.
8	1522952578	2	 It's hilarious you claim it's dying but you still use it to benchmark the value of a bitcoin. 
9	1522952884	1	Yes, its like talking about Apple despite not using apple products.Weirdddddd.Like, FAANG, I couldnt bring myself to even mention the accronym because who uses Apple? Poor people need critical thinking skills.
8	1522948970	1	People seem to always compare Bitcoin to USD.  I rarely see people compare the USD to Bitcoin.  That is very telling to me.
9	1522949701	0	Depends, if you were here in 2015, we barely cared about USD price.We were excited to have BTC. 
6	1522950550	2	Being an inflationary asset is not nessecaraly a bad thing. This provides a reason to invest, and thus makes it easier to get a loan which is conducive to overall productivity growth.
7	1522951349	1	Its an advantage that a currency is inflationary, so people have to use it, stimulating the economy ? I fail to see how government should control my spending to suit its needs. How about government mind its own business, and let us spend our own money when we want to, without taking 3 % every year if we don't get a move on ?
7	1522951519	1	>Being an inflationary asset is not nessecaraly a bad thing. This provides a reason to investThis is new thinking as of a few decades.This is not confirmed by evidence. Only generalized logic.
2	1522926913	10	They did this because they were on the gold standard and the country was running out of banknotes. They didn't remove the gold standard until the 1970s. 
2	1522944935	4	Simply put its state robbing ppl. Thats all that it really is.Or to make it even bit more correct, its rich and powerful people robbing everyone else (in US).Nothing new really.. nothing nice either.
2	1522947036	1	Because you clearly don’t understand how the federal reserve worked at the time
2	1522951025	1	The constraint being that they didn’t have enough gold in their stores to be able to maintain the 40% they’re required to have to print more money
0	1522921271	74	Interesting. I really do hope Bitcoin makes an impact on history. The symbolism and dedication of the crypto community speaks volumes.
1	1522939139	8	yes mate!
1	1522947468	3	It’s only 6 months until the white paper was released a decade ago. Early next year will be the 10 year anniversary of the genesis block. Its impact is here but the force is only just being felt. 
1	1522951084	2	It already has, and it's only getting started! The world is not anymore the way it used to be! mmm mmm no no no! Bitcoin is better than gold in 5 different ways, and gold is only better than bitcoin in 1, and that is worldwide adoption. So the distance between this and a 7 trillion market cap is the distance between now and worldwide adoption. 
0	1522925470	57	Yeah, that sounds like a free country alright
1	1522933221	18	There is no such thing as freedom in a country. The only way to achieve true freedom is to escape from civilization.
2	1522936353	36	but then you are subjugated by goddamned badgers. 
3	1522936941	8	Or worse. Badger men.
4	1522948589	4	I for one welcome our new honey badger overlords. 
3	1522942176	-1	Honey badger takes no shit. I'd follow that. 
2	1522944999	7	Canadian here, calling bullshit. You want to achieve true freedom you buy a house in the northern 80% of canada/alaska
3	1522945109	3	That’s what I said. Escape from civilization. It’s sad, but the one person that truly embraced this was the Unabomber.
4	1522946534	3	Hence why he became the Unabomber, Civilization came to him after he escaped it
1	1522936144	15	This was part of the first 100 days of FDR's presidency. It's helped pull the country out of the great depression. 
2	1522950344	6	Yeah, nah. fdr was a fucking twat who burned crops in a nation where people were starving and locked people in internment camps. press S to spit on his grave.http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/FDR-s-Policies-Prolonged-Depression-5409
2	1522937406	13	This is why context is important.
3	1522944576	10	Context is important, so it's important to note this was a mess created by the federal reserve in the first place. The Great Gold Robbery was essentially a bailout for the federal reserve. Safety deposit boxes were searched top to bottom and if you didn't hand over your gold, you were looking at a possibility of 10 years in prison.
3	1522940431	10	Still, I can't see how confiscating a private citizens property, other than with eminent domain is constitutional 
4	1522941202	7	They were also paying them a bit for the gold. Many were hoarding it and not spending at all, which was hurting the economy. 
5	1522945058	11	Hmm, that sounds familiar
6	1522946217	7	It does doesn't it?If we switch to a bitcoin-based economy and everyone hoards it (like they do now) the country will come to a standstill.
7	1522946530	10	One of the many reasons why bitcoin will never be used as a currency worldwide
7	1522946635	0	Except bitcoin is global and the US dollar tends to shit the bed because of the government
8	1522946966	7	Bitcoin isn't any better though, it shits the bed based on rumours and tweets
9	1522947174	-6	Thats cause Bitcoin is a useless coin. Ripple isnt and will solve this 
5	1522943828	2	I get that, but I still cant understand how it would be constitutional to force people into selling property. 
6	1522951596	1	Well, you might find out how this goes in your life time. Their are some people in this country that dont want you to own a rifle. So we couldnt potentially see the same thing happen for different reasons. 
5	1522949721	0	I think it's more like "Didn't give cocaine to the economy". 
4	1522952077	1	You didn’t notice the asterisk in the Bill of Rights? 
2	1522938570	7	That's funny, I heard his policies actually prolonged the depression.
3	1522938876	-1	Absolutely not. You might be thinking of Hoover, who didn't do anything about the depression, worsening it. By receiving gold the federal reserve was allowed to print more money to give to the people. 
4	1522949789	4	That money wasn't free. It came at the cost of our economic freedom. 
4	1522940574	2	No I was thinking of that scoundrel FDR. And How exactly did Hoover worsen it? By not implementing socialist policies that would further destabilize the market?http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/FDR-s-Policies-Prolonged-Depression-5409
5	1522940900	1	Whelp, I'm just going to end this right now. I called already tell that you are not to be reasoned with.
6	1522944626	4	NP. There's nothing more challenging than a different point of view, and I don't mind being called unreasonable but your the one essientially covering your ears here ;)
6	1522948088	2	It's not unreasonable to question the story you learned in school. 
7	1522949103	3	There isn't penis size by race
8	1522950213	0	Bahaha, don't go bringing that up.  IQ by race is also banned by the UN because if everyone knew the truth we would gas the Jews.
5	1522952548	1	No man. Don't you know you're supposed to increase prices during a depression when people are down on their luck?
3	1522950543	1	They did, but cue the people who didn't even take high school econ parroting talking points.
2	1522947999	1	Nothing he did made the depression better. The depression only started getting better when we started getting ready for world War 2.
2	1522952411	1	By confiscating wealth from the public, no it didn't.
2	1522949065	0	Trading many small crashes for one giant crash. How much debt can you monetize until even people in first world nations are priced out of existance?
1	1522943359	2	America gives you the freedom and right to be a pretentious asshole though so you’re in luck
2	1522945700	2	The irony
1	1522947637	1	better than getting arrested when you train your dog to lift it's paw like hitler
0	1522944381	18	America in 2033: Alright guys time to hand over your bitcoin 
1	1522946028	12	b..b..but i have lost my private key
2	1522952660	1	So how come you bought on Amazon after declaring losing your key?
1	1522945860	4	Good job I'm not American.
1	1522948409	1	Wouldn’t surprise me one bit tbh
0	1522928330	10	So where is the gold today?
1	1522932441	4	Fort Knox.
2	1522937034	9	Or is it? Audit the Fed! /s
2	1522946961	1	SEA, you believe that fairytale.  Gold-sprayed tungsten bars.
0	1522930765	24	I'm still shocked the US was able to get away with such a thing. A different level of respect and trust was given to the government back then. Can't imagine something like this flying at all today. Public would be like, "Thanks, no thanks."
1	1522936255	14	Mostly it was because the country was in the middle of a depression and FDR was passing a ton of laws to help pull the country out of it. 
2	1522953365	1	namely, they wanted to increase the money supply as part of the effort to pull the country out of depression and laws at the time required the fed to have gold backing 40% of federal reserve notes issued, a limit they had essentially reached by that point. in order to print more money, they needed more gold on hand. 
1	1522931192	6	People are marching as we speak to have their rights taken away 
2	1522931275	4	Care to elaborate?
3	1522931360	-1	People are begging for the government to take their right to bear arms 
4	1522942932	7	In the same way people march and protest to have their privacy and autonomy infringed by the government. Re: pro-life and gay marriage. Goes both ways. 
5	1522943252	2	Being against gay marriage doesnt make much sense to me. It seems like a religious thing which doesnt belong in the gov Abortion is a bit more confusing . People argue abortion is murder and murder is illegal. Idk where the distinction can be made that a fetus is a human being or not. It's a very hard dilemma
4	1522931539	11	Gotcha, guns. Way off topic, but I'm not convinced the government is trying to take away people's guns. If you are, there's nothing I can say that would change your mind, I'm sure.
5	1522945125	10	They can't ban them outright, they don't have the support from the majority of the population or legislators for that. Not to mention the people who are chosen to enforce it are typically as pro gun as it gets. I was in the military and have worked as a private contractor and LEO after that. I can't name a single person I ever worked with that didn't support people's right to bear arms. We are smart enough to know cops can't be everywhere at once. Cops are to investigate and prosecute crimes that have already been committed. Stopping a crime before it's been committed and before there's a victim is nearly impossible. Only the potential victim can do that, and a firearm is the only way when someone has the edge on you physically. This is why they try to take away rights slowly, one piece at a time. First they came for automatic weapons which have been almost totally banned since the 30s and have only been used in 3 crimes since then, one by an active duty LEO using a department issued weapon. Then in the 90s they tried to come for our semi automatic rifles by labeling them "assault rifles", a term coined in the late 30s and used for 60 years only to refer to fully automatic weapons, which had already been banned and are never used by criminals anyway. They came for our suppressors, despite the fact that 99.999% of their use is to prevent permanent hearing damage to the shooter. Now they're coming for anything over a 10 round magazine, which is nearly every semi automatic weapon in common use manufactured in the last 50 years. A bolt action rifle with a 5 round magazine makes an extremely shitty self defense weapon, but if the anti gunners have their way that will be the last thing we're allowed to own. 
6	1522946316	2	Pretty sure the focus right now is on background checks especially for unstable people. That seems like a good idea regardless
7	1522947927	3	no that's 1/5 of the the focus.Here's a tweet of one of the kids leading the protest: https://twitter.com/MattxRed/status/981134942775242754What does that 5th tick say?
7	1522946707	3	A bill was introduced that would ban all semi automatic firearms capable of holding 10 or more rounds. This would include nearly every double stack handgun currently on the market, which are by far the most popular guns for personal defense and concealed carry. Background checks only work if the whole system works. Look how many people called the local police department and even the FBI about that kid at Parkland. What was done about it? Nothing. He was able to pass a background check. There are times where crimes don't get entered into the database and people are able to pass a background check despite having a disqualifying crime on their record. 96% of criminals buy their guns from other people on the street where all the background check laws in the world aren't going to stop a gun changing hands. At most you might stop 4% of gun crimes. All of these mass shooters lately were able to acquire their weapons legally as well. The guy in Vegas had a security clearance. He had no problem picking up 25+ rifles legally. Background checks are a 15 minute inconvenience when I want to buy a firearm, they rarely stop anyone from getting their hands on a gun and doing bad things with it. 
8	1522946867	3	> What was done about it? Nothing. He was able to pass a background check. Well, that's a problem isn't it?
9	1522951209	2	It's a problem that requires enforcing our existing laws and policies, not creating new ones.
8	1522949140	1	With all this, one would think they'd have come for [lever-action rifles](https://youtu.be/89n-51foFqI?t=11) by now (a civil war era weapon kinda lost/forgotten in history)
9	1522953157	1	Those always get forgotten for some reason. 
6	1522946576	2	Just saying, we have no guns in the UK or across Europe and we have less crime than the US. More crime is caused by guns than is prevented by them. Anyway, I'm here for the crypto. At least you guys have a quicker way to end it all if we go to zero. 
7	1522948752	9	Meanwhile, [London's murder rate is surpassing New York's for the first time ever](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/london-murder-rate-higher-new-york-city-first-time-surging-knife-gun-crime/)...
8	1522949396	2	Wow, those stats are embarrassing for London I can't deny that, though this is down to our country being in dissaray with our resources heavily stretched by a Tory government focusing all their attention on the mess of leaving EU! 
9	1522950121	3	lol, not at all the mass-imigration and islamation of England.
7	1522949792	3	You don't have less crime because you have less guns. The Japanese have less crime than Europe and they don't have guns either. Countries with mandatory gun ownership tend to have low crime rates as well. It's more about tolerance for crime within different cultures than anything else.
6	1522952808	1	I'm with you for most of this, but there's a few corrections to make here:> First they came for automatic weapons which have been almost totally banned since the 30sThe near complete auto ban was in 1986 with the ironically named 'Firearm Owners Protection Act'; no further manufacture after 86 which artificially restricts supply causing the prices of the autos that remain to skyrocket.  If you have 5 figures in cash and the better part of a year to wait, you can still get them when available though (assuming your state doesn't ban them outright).That said, the first real wave in gun control did come in the 30s with the creation of the NFA that was primarily built around using cost to dissuade users from buying scary things like machine guns and short barreled rifles.  The $200 tax still exists today, thankfully not adjusted for inflation.  In the 30's, $200 was about half the price of a new car; much more affordable (though still outrageous) of a tax these days.> Then in the 90s they tried to come for our semi automatic rifles by labeling them "assault rifles", a term coined in the late 30s and used for 60 years only to refer to fully automatic weaponsThe term coined during this timeframe was actually 'assault weapons' and it was created in the late 80s by antigun folks looking to foster confusion between 'assault rifles' (a real firearm definition used by gun owners, the military, etc) and 'assault weapons' (a wholly political term with a varying definition depending on jurisdiction).  Those unfamiliar with firearms will often use the terms interchangeably, incorrectly, as was the intent.  Once they're seen as one in the same, they can be legislated against as one when presenting bills to the public, extending the reach of potential bans.Spot on with the rest though, and in some cases, those things that you hinted at that they're coming for have already passed in some states (namely the northeast and CA), generally under suspicious and poorly written bills.  My state, for example, forced *magazine registration*.  For those not in the know, magazines aren't serialized; there's no way to discern a registered mag from an 'illegal' one.It's a hot mess being led by the ignorant for the most part.
5	1522947792	6	> Way off topic, but I'm not convinced the government is trying to take away people's gunsthere are democratic law makers openly saying they want to take away all guns. It's not a ploy, they really want to
5	1522940520	2	Gun control is way too big of a talking point for them to actually do anything about it
5	1522931813	-8	You were talking about how people had a different level of respect back then and let the government take their gold. But today people are trusting the government to take away their right to bear arms. Is that not the same topic of how much respect for the government is too much?
6	1522934118	12	Without getting into, it's because you are stretching the reality of the situation. Right to bare arms already has limitations, I can not legally own a nuke even though it's just a weapon and the ultimate vehicle to defend against tyranny. The people marching are asking the government to reevaluate the current limitations, not just remove the 2nd amendment. Idk if they are right or wrong but what you are saying is not the reality.
7	1522939250	4	You can own a tank and you can own a battleship, and while fissile material is illegal to buy I believe you could legally build your own nuke from scratch but it would be prohibitively expensive.
8	1522953072	1	You can do those things if you pay obscene amounts of money for the registration. To own a tank, theirs still a process, an expensive one at that. Why a line exist to own a tank but not a gun is still the arbitrary line.
7	1522934299	6	Understood. I look it as give them an inch and they will continually try to take a foot.But yes at the moment they aren't calling for complete ban. Just something I see happening  down the line 
8	1522938796	6	Well that's a lot more realistic than saying "people are demanding gov take all the guns" when they aren't.  Part of the problem is people don't accurately describe things, then they wind up hating each other over nothing.
8	1522934879	5	I hate the slippery slope argument though. How do you feel about legalizing marijuana? Do you feel if we do that then we will also legalize meth? How do you feel about legalizing all weapons? Should your neighbor be allowed to build pipebombs or does that make you uncomfortable?We draw arbitrary fake lines in society all of the time. This is reevaluating an already subjective line. Alchohol at 21Cigarettes at 18Driving at 16Adult at 18Consent age at 16, depending where you areAutomatic weapons  banHandgun bans at 16 but rifles are okThese are all just subjective lines we draw.
9	1522935214	6	If someone said all drugs should we legal I'd listen.  But yeh a pipebomb would make me very uncomfortable because I have no idea who that guy is and that bomb isn't registered and there was no background check . There's a lot of laws on the books for guns , they aren't always enforced which is a major problem . And yeah humans have gotten as far as we have because we make rules and abide by them . It's just what some people consider and acceptable rule and others dont. I dont like guns , but I think we need them.  To keep our government and other governments in check. An armed population absolutely is a major deterrent to an invasion or our own government turning on us.  We are still fighting ISIS and they are armed with ak 47s and a Ford Ranger 
7	1522934355	-2	I don't understand why more people don't realize this.There isn't, probably ever, going to be some outright ban on guns in the U.S.
8	1522937233	6	Your use of the words " probably ever " show that even you aren't confident enough to make a definitive statement about it. 
4	1522949895	1	People are marching for their right to be safe.
5	1522953022	1	People don't have a right to safety. Supreme Court has ruled that the police/government has no duty to protect. You are responsible for your own security. 
5	1522950058	1	Many people have different opinions on what makes them safe
6	1522950495	3	True. It's a good thing we can make our decisions based on evidence rather than opinions.Either way, these people are marching for what they perceive as a bigger right.
4	1522948978	1	No they're not stop spreading right wing propaganda. Banning to remove military style war weapons and asking for mental health checks is different than right to bear arms. 
5	1522949039	0	Did you not read the rest of the conversation ?
6	1522950252	1	In what world is an ar-15 a mil-spec gun. The military sold the patent for it, and instead developed the m4 and m16.
3	1522944362	-2	If you have to ask for an elaboration then there’s no point in trying to help you see what’s already plain as day since you can’t see it already.
0	1522930907	11	I also would love to see a breakdown of how much gold came from each economic class. Wouldn't be surprised to see the equivalent of todays 1%-ers basically leaving it up to the 99% to handle this for them.

0	1522945208	2	Our government has been monetarily raping us since 1913
0	1522944884	2	There are some noble intentions behind BTC too. Or at least one.I see BTC and crypto as ticket to freedom. Freedom has good and bad parts, but its still freedom, which is better than opposite..

0	1522952380	1	Will Satoshi ever reveal himself? Is he even real?
1	1522952517	2	Satoshi is not a person. IMO BTC was created by DARPA. Much like the internet.

0	1522952465	1	Let's the retarded comments ensue. Different time period. Intervention was for the people, not against. All so a hundred years later a bunch of teenagers and people buying TRON on credit can try to spin it for their cause. This sub is a pathetic circlejerk. Downvote for thoughts and prayers.

0	1522936478	1	very cool. Gold standard at least had some logic. Fed is all kinds of messed up

0	1522934958	1	Wow this is really interesting.
0	1522939862	1	Confiscation rarely entails a compensation, AFAIK. It was more forcing them to sell/trade in all hold, was it not?So are you sharing knowledge or just propagandising? 
0	1522949930	1	Son of a bitch. Democracy my ass. Looks more like north korea.
0	1522949991	1	The federal reserve are still confiscating money from us citizens via usury. 
0	1522937871	0	Holy shit, had never heard of that.It gives credence to Bitcoin being the gold of the future rather than the currency :)I know, I know, purists are going to refer to the white paper and how it's supposed to be a currency.
1	1522938391	0	They would confiscate our Bitcoins :P
2	1522938766	-1	Sure... that's why people should get Monero :P
3	1522940366	1	Nice edit :P .. well if people buy privacy coins with cash, maybe. But if you buy BTC to convert to others, then game over: "hand us your transactions or go to jail".... Keep in mind that most countries have no statue of limitations on tax related stuff :(
0	1522939872	0	Didn’t get my grandfathers   Of course. Citizens had guns too. Pretty sure not everyone just gave up those gold 
1	1522944189	2	True, but it was effectively illegal to trade (thus worthless in the usa) at that point. It also became incredibly hard to move out of the country (where it still had value)
0	1522943450	0	If only the outrage of "they took our gold" would be as strong as "they took our guns"My condolences if you have a gold gun... That's a tragedy...
1	1522946576	0	It's class thing, the masses don't care about the rich mans gold.
0	1522934598	-2	Let's just clarify that there's almost certainly no connection between Satoshi's "birthday" and EO 6102.The "birthday" of someone who might not even be a single individual is an entirely random date entered into a required field. And it was selected before Bitcoin had any aspiration of being a world currency or even, like gold, a permanent store of value.FDR's order was a temporary measure to prevent hoarding that was rendered moot by legislation the following year. That law was itself rendered moot by the abrogation of the gold standard in 1971, i.e., around the time most redditors' parents were born.This was an interesting history lesson, brought to you by the conspiracy theorists who believe the Federal Reserve Board is really a Masonic plot to bring about a Zionist world government or maybe they're just man-eating lizards from outer space.
1	1522937187	5	People aren't trying to say Satoshi Nakamoto was given to us by the gods with the fate to take down the traditional financial system on that date because of fate and magic stuff. This is more so inferring that "he" chose a date with interesting signficance. Just like he chose a date with significance to release the bitcoin white paper. We know Satoshi Nakamoto purposely selected this date, who/whatever he is/was.You underestimate the thought process of reddit users jf you think people were conspiring like that, but I can't really find another way to interpret the first part of your comment.
2	1522950354	0	> Just like he chose a date with significance to release the bitcoin white paper. What is this significance?1938 – Great Depression: In an effort to restore investor confidence, the New York Stock Exchange unveils a fifteen-point program aimed to upgrade protection for the investing public. (related to the great depression, but the date is a very specific event of said depression)It's also the birthdate of Vanilla Ice.Oh and this too:2002 – A federal grand jury in Houston, Texas indicts former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow on 78 counts of wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy and obstruction of justice related to the collapse of his ex-employer.

0	1522952226	0	I feel like a lot of people in this sub don't understand the basic concept of the benefits of the dollar being inflationary. This isn't to say that the U.S. hasn't made bad decisions with our currency like switching to the petroleum standard, it's just that the slow and steady inflation of a currency doesn't really fall under the category of "corruption".
