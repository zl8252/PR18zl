0	1522891778	54	kucoin removed it straight away, not sure why binance leaves it up.
1	1522891877	12	Exactly! It got me pissed off to be honest. No reason at all why it should still be up!
2	1522904082	15	cZ wants to dump his own share.
2	1522901203	5	cz letting whales dump at a lesser lost. 
2	1522920386	7	I think it's fair to give a couple days notice, so any innocent parties with CTR have time to sell or move it off the exchange. Not everyone has instant access to crypto news at all times of the day
3	1522928470	5	...for an innocent party to sell requires another party to buy...
4	1522943391	1	If someone is buying CTR right now, that is their own stupid choice.
4	1522928756	0	Binance have advertised on twitter and their home page that CTR is being delisted. At this point, the majority of those buy orders are bots and daytraders, no sympathy for either.

2	1522905184	1	So many people who didn't see this coming and put in buy orders got burnt so hard once the news of the arrests spread.
2	1522921056	1	Looks like someone got dumped lmao nice job catching the pump 
2	1522946932	1	[Done](https://community.bitzamp.com/view.php?permlink=binance-delists-centra-ctr-token-from-its-trading-portal&id=464289)
1	1522931654	2	They're making money off the trading. 
1	1522915738	2	CTR has been delisted.
2	1522918727	3	It's still there
3	1522924138	2	They announced that it was delisted several hours ago. Yet it's still trading, is listed on the Binance homepage, and has the second highest volume. Greedy motherfuckers. EDIT: They snuck this cheeky shit into the announcement - "Token will be delisted on 2018/04/08 at 05:00 (UTC)."
4	1522937692	4	"Should we choose to delist the token, a notice period of no less than 72 hours will be provided."https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002360851-CTR-Risk-Announcement
4	1522944795	2	They didn't really sneak anything. It was always there, choosing not to read it, is on you.
1	1522932453	0	Well kucoin is better.. i guess
0	1522893330	29	All it has done on binance is moon because of it too. 
1	1522897379	13	There is no logical reason why it should be greater than 0 still on a major exchange and pumped 155%
2	1522925019	9	From what I've read, the vast majority of funds raised from the CTR ICO are still there, probably even more due to ETH increase since the ICO was run.  Assuming if CTR have to refund investors via tokens (like how confido did), then its a pretty good buy.  The average price paid was about  was about 70-80 cents.  If you bought CTR at the bottom at 6 cents a few days ago, you would have got at least 11.5 to 1 odds on your money.   Pretty damn good risk/reward ratio.  Although it probably would take 1-2 years to get your money back.  
3	1522942977	1	very interesting...so all in BitConnect?
4	1522944664	2	HEY HEY HEEEEEEEEYYY.
1	1522897340	8	I posted earlier on another post that because of it mooning this market is truly fucked and I have no faith in it anymore.
2	1522900548	14	i saw bitconnect jump from 8$ to 55$ so im not surprised at all.
2	1522905618	2	I still have faith in the market overall, but those people cannot leave fast enough.I dont care if BTC has to crash to 3k for over a year, drain the swamp!
0	1522903609	10	Wouldn't that just give the SEC the authority to decide which asset gets traded?
0	1522901670	6	Why is this coin mooning when it‚Äôs been proven to be a scam? I‚Äôm so confused why it‚Äôs been skyrocketing
1	1522902096	3	Exactly!
1	1522903150	5	>Why is this coin mooning when it‚Äôs been proven to be a scam? I‚Äôm so confused why it‚Äôs been skyrocketingIt's been targeted by a pump-and-dump group
2	1522904033	5	So there will a lot of suckers who would buy their pumps? Geez, this is hopeless. 
3	1522904248	1	It's also about getting the Bots to buy it too.  But yeah.
1	1522929604	1	They right refund based on ICO price. Worth the risk of buying then at this cheap price.
0	1522898207	6	Yeah this is a pretty huge slip-up on binances side... Especially as an exchange that seems to be somewhat discriminating when it comes to what they will and won't list.
1	1522898510	4	It‚Äôs fucking bullshit I don‚Äôt want to be associated with any scam coins on the exchange if I‚Äôm a customer. 
2	1522898810	2	Well I dislike it as well, we also need to acknowledge that there are always going to be scam coins on major exchanges. We can't help that. Regulate your anger a little bit. Binance will trade whatever people want to be traded. Was it fucking unbelievable of them to have bitconnect on their platform as well? I don't think it's inherently bad to have scamcoins on exchanges. Let people do their own research. But what I will say is that binance not listing a few actual big coins is frustrating when we're getting these random shitty scam ICO's that they will take.
3	1522901280	5	Sure if you want unaware new comers coming to Binance and buying scam coins then you and Binance are on your own with that one! Not in this part of the crypto space not having it point blank period! I thought you and Binance will have a little bit more class on the subject to be frank... if Binance once to continue to be the number #1 Exchange then it needs to go over and beyond. I will happily take on the task if this is to hard to do. Not rocket science here ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4	1522902335	1	Dude people already have used binance to buy Bitconnect and lost tons of money on it. People buy into lots of stuff I believe extremely strongly will fail and lose people money.The crypto space doesn't exist as a display case. Binance's job isn't to make everyone money. It's to show you the crypto marketplace. There are shitloads of scam coins and doomed projects in the crypto space. It's a market. There are shitty companies that trade on wall street, there are companies with people embezzling money or committing active fraud that we don't know about yet. There are companies that are doomed to fail that might be hiding it.Pretending like we don't have those same issues will probably lead to more people getting scammed in the crypto space than anything. Awareness is important. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.Especially in a difficult-to-understand space, understanding what your coins can actually do when you buy some, and why they're worth what they're worth, is important. Also I'm assuming random people getting into crypto aren't going to buy a random low volume shitcoin, they'd just buy bitcoin or eth. Or honestly lots of non crypto normal people I know have heard about ripple and they buy that...I have a ex army vet friend who literally went all in, put like, $10,000, his like life savings into ripple... I don't know how, math wise, he expects the market cap to really go beyond like $2-3 optimistically... Even when it was in it's boom like, these crazy ripple people are talking about how they think Ripple could be $10 by the end of the year... With only like 1/4th of the supply even in circulation... The company is literally trying to price control their own currency by holding billions of it in, only 39b is deployed, they're holding the other 62b. I actually think ripple has a ton of utility and huge potential as a crypto. But the problem is just that you have an inflationary coin, not a deflationary one. At least in the immediate future. Realistically, you know that in the long term just on volume, your coin is not worth as much. Those open releases of ripple / sales are specifically to allow strategic partners that would use ripple to be able to buy in at a stronger position than the public.But back to the example. For people that aren't doing their research. They're going to get destroyed, or at least get their expectations shattered. All you can do is urge people to research the space, you can't blame yourself, or anyone else when someone willingly chooses to do something stupid.
5	1522903362	2	Used Binance to buy bitconnect? I stopped reading right there. Bitconnect was never listed on Binance was it?
6	1522905169	1	I was almost positive it was? I could be wrong though.
7	1522905762	3	BCC was (and still is) listed on Binance, but on Binance BCC is Bitcoin Cash, not Bitconnect. I thought Bitconnect could only be bought on the now defunct Bitconnect exchange/platform. 
8	1522939474	1	Bitconnect could be traded on HitBTC and CoinExchange.io
5	1522903543	1	Yeah right. So, when some of your associates is involved in a severely fraudulent action, you, do NOT dismiss him/her from your company records, web site, whatever simply because he / she makes you money. This makes you either an associate to the fraud (really really simple logic) or stupid in the first place because you didn't have the wisdom to amend your sign of f contracts accordingly. I am positive that the contracts between coins and exchanges are toilet paper quality. Crypto is full with Crypto Nicks and Carlos Matos and ...millionaires with rapper teeth who are extremely amateur business wise.  Right now a freak show. I' ve lost my faith in binance months ago when the kept whistling indifferently when ...bitcoin diamond, a product without a site, a white paper or a team was mooning 2000% destroying all of our days. That was the day I went cold storage and never looked back on the ridiculous "trade" area. When an obvious scam is in front of you then the scam set is also kind of guilty in every law there is. There are connections, it's just a matter of will for any D.A to investigate them. Sadly, crypto right now is filled with scam, it will continue the downtrend till all the scammers' bots make no money, then if regulations hit timely it will grow up steadily and healthy. Remember. All the binances of the world are jack shit if we are to discover the next amazon or google. This is what it's all about. Ps. Oh I am still waititing for the binance dust. I gues it will eventually be settled before 2025. If they are having difficulties (lol) let me do it for them. 38 + years developer here.
5	1522904820	1	This is why we need regulations. Because ex vets, lumber jack joes and house wives of the world should be PROTECTED from scammers. Not everyone is a cryptographer or a developer or whatever. Watch as the scammers suck the market dry to 1000 USD BTC slowly, until they fill their bags and fly to el tropic paradise. Regulations is, right now, our only hope. At least for us, not scammers.
6	1522905455	2	They just de-listed it anyway :) 5 minutes ago.
7	1522907572	3	Finally. Still not really happy since some P & D groups had their feast. Which provides food for all haters. Imagine the headlines: Coins' creators in Jail, but product spikes 155% on worlds greatest exchange. Is crypto that rotten? I truly hope I am not the only one who DEMANDS swiftness and professionalism in a multi billion industry.
5	1522902723	-1	This is the present Bitconnect is the past and I guess we haven‚Äôt learned our lesson yet and the fact your trying to argue with me over this got me shocked! Kinda surprised you‚Äôre not more upset about this. In case you haven‚Äôt notice this space has lost $600 Billion dollars in marketcap because of these scammers and shit coins. So maybe you need to do more research not me!
6	1522902815	1	My point isn't that scams don't upset me it's that it's not binances job to police them.
4	1522910379	0	How should Binance filter out scam coins exactly?
5	1522923094	2	With the amount of overheads they have to justify their cost, maybe they could direct some effort to due diligence.  No one expects this of everyone nor every exchange, but when you're number 1 there tends to be an expectation of having a higher standard.
0	1522903259	2	Its up 155% on Binance right now
0	1522890855	3	/u/cpzhao
0	1522906746	2	I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on but I know enough about contract law to know there may be more going on here than we are aware.They may have a contract in place that prevents them from delisting overnight.I don‚Äôt want to speculate but arrested/charged doesn‚Äôt mean guilty in the US as much as some people wish it would. Delisting them may violate their contract and leave them vulnerable to lawsuits.Seriously. The company still exists. The SEC doesn‚Äôt have the power to shut them down. Only charge them. The court will decide from here.I don‚Äôt personally care. I have zero stake in CTR. I like Binance though and I‚Äôm wondering if there is more to the story than we know.CZ has been a hero to crypto for some time now. Let‚Äôs not rush to judgment just yet. 
0	1522905137	1	- They had a statement up yesterday. They are investigating and trade it with caution. If they delist it, they will give 3 days heads up according to their delisting procedure. If you still trade it after this announcement, it is your own fault. - https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002360851> Fellow Binancians,> This is a special announcement about the high risk associated with the CTR token in light of the information released earlier today relating to the controversial and fraudulent acts by members associated with the Centra Tech team.> We will continue to seek more information and monitor the situation closely, and may take further action including delisting. Should we choose to delist the token, a notice period of no less than 72 hours will be provided.> Thanks for your support!> Binance Team> 2018/04/03

1	1522929734	1	Just check and I was able to buy some. This post is FAKE NEWS.
2	1522940404	1	It is not fake news. Read the exchange news. Binance is going to delist it april 5th

0	1522924009	1	Go figure the only coin you made money off of in the past few weeks was a scam coin.
0	1522927044	1	Lol you can tell which coins are shitcoins and scams because they‚Äôll be down 15% one day, then up 50% the next, e.g. TRX 
0	1522927427	1	Who would still buy this shit ?
0	1522928712	1	Binance isn‚Äôt as great as you people think. 
0	1522931901	1	So Binance listed this shitcoin but refuses to list RvT???
0	1522937170	1	agree. but binance also needs to answer questions as to why their vetting process was such crap. fake advisors...cmon Binance
0	1522939256	1	Been away from reading news about crypto news for a while now, looks like there is more drama than ever before. I'm not surprised however, since these exchanges would list anything for money, while projects like mine might not even see the light of day, even if it's a DAICO.
0	1522940478	1	Binance is the best and largest Cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.Suck up with it guys 
0	1522941322	1	How come the price is going up after all the news? ü§î
0	1522942905	1	I think it's a rash decision to de-list.  I think anyone that holds XVG on any exchange should have a grace period to sell their coins and place their funds elsewhere.Unless the exchange has a standing policy where if a coin is scammed all coins are liquidated in btc or eth, but that would crash the coin even harder.  Which isn't fair to bagholders, regardless of what you think of them.
0	1522948377	1	Then BOOM! The bottom drops out. I almost lied to myself yesterday and was gonna jump all in for a short ride and now I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt. Although if I‚Äôd of had some early info I could‚Äôve jumped in and made a shit ton
0	1522899372	0	Say for example there are hundreds or thousands of accounts that have CTR on it, including large amounts that are worth X amount. If they were to just remove it, remove withdraws as well, they would essentially screw over the holders. What if someone bought CTR and hasn‚Äôt had the chance recently to exchange their coins for other coins? In my opinion, they should release a deadline for when you need to dump your coins by. OR compensate the people holding CTR by replacing it with BNB if they just instantly remove it from their exchange
1	1522900306	17	Coins don't magically transform into each other."Exchange their coins for other coins" means someone else will be left holding worthless CTR, what about them?
2	1522904398	-7	As I customer, I don't care. Did they ask how hard I worked to send my precious dollars to their exchange so that they get their fees and buld their mini empire? Nope, that was my problem. So this is Their problem. If a see a SCAM product on the shelves I ain't  bying their shit anymore. They've made BILLIONS out of our money they should have already developed procedures for situations like this. If they haven't well, they are probably another Carlos Matos but with a better tie. Try to understand that liking someone (CZ) and business should be entirely separated.  
3	1522905093	3	Unless they're doing an MtGox and trading non-existent tokens, everything in their database should correspond to someone depositing and withdrawing tokens. Someone is still left with CTR, even if it's Binance itself.Of course dead coins and scams should be unlisted, but you'll have a hard time arguing the cut off line after which it stops being the responsibility of those who bought CTR and becomes responsibility of Binance.On one hand, exchanges shouldn't be dragging their feet with questions like this, on the other hand, there were people buying fricking Bitconnect at bottom prices after it folded in hopes of cashing it in some way. I don't think the latter deserve "just make exchanges eat the losses" as one of those ways.
4	1522907813	-1	Well as they say...Caesar's wife should not only BE honest but also APPEAR so.Meaning that if they have internal procedures for things like that (i am in dread if they don't) now was the time to pull the trigger. Which apparently they did.
5	1522907997	2	Yeah, after it was pumped up 100%+Hopefully buyers were mostly the pumpers and it looks like they didn't have the time to fully dump it after that.
1	1522904424	1	correct. 
1	1522904937	1	They put up a statement saying the story of the cross and they are investigating. If they delist it, they will give 3 days to holders to move the funds. 
0	1522901532	1	Isn't the CEO of binance very active on twitter? Has anyone tweeted at him?
1	1522902063	6	Just did! 
2	1522902465	1	there is also this https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002360851-CTR-Risk-Announcement

0	1522905165	1	Delisted as I was reading this lmao
1	1522924002	4	Delisted from Binance? It is still there trading right now.
2	1522942045	0	I got the tweet from Binance but I didn't actually read their full announcement 
1	1522924248	2	It's still trading. 
2	1522941993	0	I got the tweet about it, I didn't check
0	1522927093	0	Innocent until proven guilty.
0	1522899216	-8	Yeah. Get it off there!!!Make room for Elastos.  Friggin thing is top 50 market cap.  Might as well. 
1	1522904507	-2	As an Elastos investor who sees a bit further than the average 1 week of every crypto "investor", I'd say no. Not until regulations. But that's me.
0	1522910726	-2	Why do you believe binance is trustworthy?
1	1522917822	2	Because they've consistently provided a good exchange, and quickly delisted this coin?
2	1522920802	1	Quickly?
1	1522927199	1	I don't know if Binance or in fact any Binance out there is trustworthy in an outlaw market but its CEO has displayed intimacy to the community, some fast reactions and seems to care about crypto in general. HOWEVERThere is still the dust issue, the CLEARLY SCAM coins being allowed listing and no policy of acceptance prerequisites on line. Which, by logic, means that if someone allows Centra, BitCoin Gold etc which do NOT need Nuclear Physics degree to classify as shady at least...well lets just say that he/she weighs his/hers profit compass way more than his/hers moral compass respectively.
