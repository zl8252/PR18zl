0	1522888167	34	It's interesting that dapps are almost never mentioned on Reddit and in crypto general talk, unlike ICO's. We should start looking toward dapps that have real-life usage since they might become big in the future. I actually look forward to dapps rather than ICO's recently...
1	1522922886	4	Request Network is currently working on numerous DApps with multiple uses. 
1	1522936170	2	&nbsp;> I actually look forward to dapps rather than ICO's recentlyYou get a bunch up up-votes then people reply with comments shilling a bunch of ICO projects.  LOLMost dApps don't need ICOs and a lot probably won't even make much money but they'll probably provide great value to us.- [Etherdelta](http://etherdelta.com) - shows that we can have decentralized exchanges.-  [Gitf](http://enclaves.io) - is one of my favorite which allows you to send timelocked Ether as gift to any Ethereum address.  They can only withdraw the ETH at a future date which you designate.  The hardest thing about dApps is going to be Oracles verifying data from multiple sources in a crypto platform to provide a source of truth of outside world data.  So far nobody really has a solution but when they do it'll be a game changer.  And no, you don't need an ICO for this.  &nbsp;
1	1522917497	1	Check out www.Scroll.network its a US ICO with a DApp!!
1	1522933138	0	* https://www.dnvgl.com/news/dnv-gl-launches-my-story-the-blockchain-based-solution-to-tell-the-product-s-full-story-113549* A multi-billion dollar partner of VeChain has developed a 3rd-party dApp on VeChain's platform, called MyStory. It has been launched last month and will be used by some top Italian wine producers in Fall 2018. 
1	1522913987	-2	I think every serious crypto investor should be able to code dApps. [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io) is a good starting point.
0	1522884085	22	Personally I think that decentralized applications are the thing that might push crypto forward. The current market state is scaring new tech investors (you might think they are stupid, but try investing $2million in something that might drop overnight), so I'm pretty bullish regarding decentralized applications and the one I'm using recently is MetaMask. Great article by the way.
1	1522887187	7	Yea you are right, everyone focused on crypto meanwhile DApps are slowly taking off and gaining grounds. Let's see what will 2018 bring us.
1	1522889820	3	Agree with you on this one. I remember reading a article about dapps few months ago and almost forgot about it. Great reminder to the community who is only focused on cryptocurrencies right now.
1	1522902127	2	sorry but in what way is metamask a decentralized application? you seem to be confused.
0	1522895714	7	For general public or mass adoption the general public doesn't need to know or give a shit about blockchain or crypto. When there are top apps in the store that the underlying tech is blockchain we are on a good path. Just like electricity noone cares exactly how the tech works they just want to plug into the wall and get power. 
0	1522884020	6	DApps are going to be huge and I reckon one of the main pushes for adoption.
0	1522887407	6	Most dapps are just shitty gaming collectathons 
1	1522887551	3	That's why I mentioned on a comment above "Let's just hope that DApps don't become something like ICO's xD", since people hungry for money not for the tech might storm the industry.
1	1522888046	2	I agree with you, but also at the same time it is showing the power of the technology without bringing a massive real world risk to businesses.If businesses see these DApps perform without issue, it gives more confidence in future for actual businesses to trust the platform for DApps.Think of the internet when it was born, rather primitive but PROOF OF CONCEPT.
0	1522910446	3	It can take Cryptos to become a household name. I have been a HODLers of Lisk since it was a few cents. It hit ATH of $38, that was also my exit luckily, but the coin still has huge potential to grow. At the same time, I was also curious to find out the next Dapp biggie, TAU or DRGN would the one on the throne soon. Astonishing Tx speed, strong teams, enterprise blockchain solutions. TAU is more coveted because of its price (just below the ICO price) at 8 cents. DRGN on the other hand is North of 68 cents. DAPP is the future and you need to HODL the coin with a future.
0	1522898584	2	Lisk will bring the DAPPS. 
1	1522902468	-4	Why!!!???! So it can do what eth did?? Create even more scams and worthless shitcoins??
0	1522886258	1	Dapps are very important to crypto in general and most people don't know this. By utilizing dapps we help integration in a way of the blockchain in general in daily basis stuff. It's like big companies using crypto for transaction, same as random people can use dapps in real life.
0	1522893484	1	take a look at QSP. dapp for ETH built to secure smart contracts. secure infrastructure. 
1	1522902391	3	Honestly explain to me why qsp even needs a coin or a blockchain?? Why can't they perform there services and be paid in any other legit currency be it fiat or eth or btc?? Cuz all im seeing out of the coin itself is an excuse to exist as a fake utility that is in reality an illegal security that gives share holders zero say in the company. 
0	1522895336	1	Check out Mobius!
0	1522922828	1	Dapps are for sure the thing that will drive crypto forward. Dapps are essentially the use case for most of crypto - you can even consider storing and transferring value as a specific 'Dapp'. So what we're really talking about when we say 'dapp' is the actual real world uses for block chain. The issue that we currently have, is that blockchains are slow and expensive. Try and build a poker app. Can't really be done currently because there's not really an implementation of blockchain yet that can operate quickly and cheaply enough to deal cards fast enough, or cheaply enough to make for a satisfying user experience. Thankfully, the bulk of the development going in in crypto right now seems to be addressing the scaling issue. I think the first time we see a really good scaling solution implemented (there are a few that look promising, but I'll refrain from picking a horse at this stage), then we will see a literal explosion in Dapp development, and therefore use of crypto / blockchains in general. And that will be a fun and exciting time to be involved!  
0	1522931657	1	Check out ZapOracles, also developing a Dapp platform, has a very good team with Nick Spanos as the front figure. They have spoken at multiple events including the World Government Summit in Dubai.
0	1522935188	1	Qlink is a prime example.
0	1522939447	1	we need a killer dapp to get people attention problem is the best dapp we got is a fucking collectable game dapp >.>
0	1522941349	1	I made another Dapp, had this idea a couple days ago and well.. here it is, it's called [colors](http://www.colors.gg/) (www.colors.gg), really not sure what this one is this time. I kind of just had this idea in my head, one thing lead to another, and now I got this weird color-chat thing. Maybe someone can help me figure out the point of it.Here's the etherscan source code:https://etherscan.io/address/0xdcfbe1f893640f018065fdb820eb68b501f8ec2d#codeI've been developing Dapps and websites for them for about 2 months now, so I'm admittedly not very skilled, nor experienced. Hopefully will be one day, but for now, this is the level I'm producing. I appreciate any criticism, every time I post I learn something new from the comments and never miss an opportunity to learn and improve.Here's a screenshot from the inside of the Dapp after you make it past the initial "pick-a-color" screen, in case anyone was wondering what it looked like and how it works: [https://i.imgur.com/78sBhm0.png](https://i.imgur.com/78sBhm0.png)
0	1522890330	1	I don't really believe in these applications. I don't think that any decentralized application will take over in the future, everything needs a bit of human control in my opinion.
0	1522902111	0	Lmao get real guys you know what dapps have brought us?? F*cking nothing!! Penny stocks 2.0 thats it!! That is all eth gave us a never ending wave of shitcoin pump and dumps and f*cking cats. I don't understand what people expect from these smart contract dapp platforms? Their only use case is a fast cheap way to mass produce scams 
0	1522895886	1	I'm not impressed so far with what I've read and seen in terms of dapps. I tried to use Ethlance. Hated it. Hated that I had to deposit ETH just to get started. Had to pay ETH to set up a profile. Had to pay ETH if I wanted to change or add anything to my profile. Just about anything you do in the app requires you to pay first. I'd rather use centralized sites and have them take a cut out of the backend when I'm paid for a job.I've read descriptions for some other dapps, and they didn't sound promising. We're going to be just like Facebook/Twitter/Play Store App, except you'll have to pay to use it rather than it being free!
1	1522931237	1	Nothing is free, you always pay somehow.
2	1522936258	1	I'd 100% rather have something be ad-supported and free to me rather than have to pay money every time I send a message or make a post.
0	1522900587	1	REQUEST NETWORK!
0	1522912022	1	Elastos are launching Dapps on their own decentralised OS that works on IOS and Android 
0	1522913489	1	DApps > ICOs
0	1522883395	0	Is Brave Browser a DApp like the ones mentioned? Couldn't I find anything on Google?
1	1522884257	2	no brave browser is not a dapp, its a web 3.0 browser (metamask integration) which allows you to interact with DApps from your browser
2	1522884411	1	Oh, okay thanks for clearing it out, I thought it might be a DApp since it allows that interaction you mentioned.
3	1522888227	1	Nope, but it is going to be a critical link I believe.Installed two weeks ago on a new PC, brave rocks. Looking forward to chrome extension integration(next release!?) as I still have to use Chrome sometimes due to thatCan't argue with these statshttps://i.imgur.com/I0f2Zg0.png
4	1522888627	1	Nice, getting to know a bit more about Brave browser. I heard you can pay your favorite websites/youtubers/streamers with BAT, which is literally a crypto. I see the connection here. Thanks for the clarification.
1	1522884751	1	If you have a Twitter.. Follow me @moonbloxdotcom im going over dApps now 
2	1522885056	1	Check some of your posts. The ones saying that many "crypto pros" are unaware of how many DApps are out there it's true. There are many that have great potential and real-life usage but yet unknown. Let's just hope that DApps don't become something like ICO's xD
2	1522885102	1	Can you give us a rundown here? I'm sure a lot of users would like a little info. Not sure how I feel about self promotion
3	1522885331	1	I was wondering the same, maybe write a ELI5 text over each DApp you (Endro22) mention on your Twitter posts would be useful to new users, like me for example.
0	1522898990	0	Dapps are what keep me up at night and help me sleep. Elastos has crazy good dapps lined up but at the same time are the dapps going to gain traction.   They claim it will be huge.  But it’s the gamble of waiting in dapps that kills me. 
1	1522902544	0	im not big on dapps but i know Elastos OS is a serious game changer that solves real world issues.
2	1522912109	3	Why the fuck is it tanking so hard then lol
3	1522930963	1	Cuz BTC. I really am starting to hate btc 
0	1522886559	-5	Gatcoin is one of the few that could take crypto adoption mainstream. The premise here is people using it doesnt need to know about blockchain at all. You get airdropped cryptos based on geolocation and redeem it instantly in partnerstores. It seems just like another app but the network effect could be interesting on this one...
1	1522888884	1	thanks for your valuable input ~~friend~~ shill
2	1522898190	3	Guy has 6 posts in the last 6 months. 200 karma. Shill is correct!
