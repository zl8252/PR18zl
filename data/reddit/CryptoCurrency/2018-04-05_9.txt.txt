0	1522939597	23	why isn't REQ bigger?? this just makes too much sense.
1	1522940907	29	market doesnt make any sense, verge is a top 30 crypto and is a complete shitshow and REQ is way down at the bottom.
2	1522941080	10	EOS is a top 6 crypto. REQ should be at minimum top 40
3	1522947341	1	If you say EOS is a top 6 then by logic any non-scam crypto should be top 5. It's not how the market works though.
4	1522951169	2	I think he’s making the point that it’s ridiculous the EOS is *literally* number 6 by MC and REQ is currently so low. Not that EOS deserves top the position just that the market is so dumb that something like EOS which has no working product(correct me if wrong) is placed so high. That said it seems like a good “marketing” strategy to create a coin with a huge circulating supply to give a better chance at being in the top by MC. Cuz even if ur coin drops a great deal in price(provided u start with a decent ICO price) you’ll still likely have an inflated MC in the top 100. I’ve also heard the a large circ supply can help scaling in some instances but I’ve yet to research it enough to confirm that. 
2	1522944947	0	It never will because none of it is based on actual business profits. Of which zero crypto companies have any aside from funds raised from ICO's, which gives them their place on the market cap ladder. 
1	1522943729	3	Besides what u/sacklings123 says, which is most ofcourse most important since (false) hype is what drives most liquidity and speculation at the moment. Req doesn't have such marketing these vaporware projects have. But besides this, as much as Reddit is in love with Req it isn't actually as popular elsewhere. Many stand by "crypto doesn't need another payment platform with it's own token".  The value proposition is clear though and if they succeed in this adoption than value might skyrocket, but until then many don't believe in it even if Reddit tells you otherwise.
2	1522944546	3	I like it tho! hopefully it gets the credit it deserves soon
1	1522942501	0	Bigger in terms of what? Marketshare? They just launched their product ~~today~~ last week..I think they've got plenty of hype for how much they've delivered. Not hating on them, but I want to see some real world usage before I think they deserve to be "bigger."
2	1522942849	1	I thought they launched it on march 30th
3	1522943119	1	I'm sure you're right, and I updated my post. The point stands.
2	1522953660	1	Plenty of hipe for how much they delivered? Shall we talk cardano? Or Eos? Or Trx? Xvg?Hmm 
0	1522937750	18	If there's anyone that can bring adoption to crypto payments it is REQ (and OPEN platfrom after their launch)
0	1522933725	11	Woooo, just in time for that fresh new Request Network Flair lol
1	1522938797	1	Is there REQ flair?  I don't see it.
0	1522941983	7	Now we need a "REQ Fan" flair on this sub, mods should have added it a long time ago tbh.
0	1522947603	1	And now the price will go from 0.14 to 0.22 and then keep dropping like it has for the last months.
