0	1523014282	93	Wow. Long read. First twist a joint and grab a beer. Greetings. 
1	1523015774	30	Dutchman spotted
2	1523017977	7	Greetings fellow Hollander ;-)
3	1523027391	7	I guess you mean ''Greetings fellow HODLlander?''
4	1523038242	2	Cringe
3	1523020298	3	Don't forget to put your kaas on the damn pizza!
4	1523020334	4	Hmm. Vierkazen pizza. Lekker hoor.
5	1523026069	2	Met Goudse en Edammer
6	1523032329	1	Kivbkklbn gguinvf hj
2	1523021998	2	Don't forget the bitterballen. As a Belgian I think this could be a huge plus. True big if. Dapp , Duvel.
2	1523027448	2	Many Americans are discovering the beauty of the Dutch lifestyle as well. Myself included. 
2	1523025830	3	If ya ain't dutch ya ain't much
3	1523029567	2	And a NEO fan :), are you also going to the neo conference april 14th in amsterdam?
4	1523031925	2	I am not, I live in the US otherwise I would!
5	1523036265	1	i cant wait for a USA NEO meet up.  How do you get the "NEO fan" next to your name?
1	1523020367	5	Honestly this should be the prerequisite for everything. 
1	1523022818	5	This is how the typical crypto investor does their research
1	1523032877	1	I keep my beer and weed separated 
1	1523033669	1	This guy put a lot of effort into this.
2	1523033739	1	Yes. It's a very good read. 
0	1523020611	57	I can tell you put a lot of work in to this. But a lot of these descriptions are a joke
1	1523020813	14	Which ones? It's hard to be 100% accurate on all 100 coins, so definitely open to improving descriptions.
2	1523029114	10	Great list, I figured I would try and help with the descriptions a little bit:DGD isn't a stablecoin, DGX is the stablecoin backed by gold. DGD is the security token (like neo, with dividends votes etc.) for Digix.REQ isnt a crypto exchange coin but a remittance/payment system aiming to be the PayPal of crypto. I think they're incorporating a crypto exchange through a partnership with Kyber. It's similar to OMGNAS is a platform coin (like ETH) but the nebulas team is also making the Nebulas Rank - which will be platform agnostic - to help with the Proof of Devotion algorithmDash is labelled as 'good privacy coin'. More research may be needed on thatPIVX is labelled 'inferior tech' but nothing is specified.
2	1523028896	9	I know a lot of people hate Ripple and I get it, but that description is pretty awful. You didn't mention what they do (cross-border payments). They also have a specific plan laid out to become much more decentralized: https://ripple.com/insights/continued-decentralization-xrp-ledger-consensus-protocol/
3	1523030352	4	If you Dnt find any innovation in LTC and yet wrote better description for bch..I have nothing to say about ur research
3	1523031768	0	Cross border payments like bitcoin?
4	1523032564	1	No, cross-border payments for financial institutions; banks and companies like Western Union and Moneygram (who they are currently working with) are their customers, not you and I.XRP is a bridge currency. The idea is that for those FI's that have to send money all over the world, they can use XRP to facilitate the transaction in a fraction of the time it currently takes. (a few seconds instead of a few days) In addition to the speed of transaction, it can save FI's from having to keep 29 different currencies on hand.
5	1523035537	0	Why can't they use Bitcoin to send money all over the world? They only need one currency and they should choose the one that is most secured and the one most are using. Remittances have been working for Bitcoin. Checkout Bitcoin in Uganda on YouTube. I just don't see the appeal ripple has over Bitcoin when Bitcoin can be used.
6	1523035627	4	Is this a joke..
7	1523037561	1	No what's weird about banks using Bitcoin to send to each other? Banks can be peer to peer with digital gold.
6	1523035961	1	Because Ripple transactions settle in 3 seconds. Plus, they are a company with offices all over the globe, that allow them to get business partnerships, run trials, etc.FWIW, I’m a bitcoin fan as well. But with this particular use-case, XRP beats BTC in pretty much every way.
7	1523036537	1	What about lightning network with zero counterparty risks and insant settlements? Plus 3 second settlements for ripple is due to it's centralized nature. And banks don't need ripple the token to use it's network that from my understanding they can also use Bitcoin on the ripple network.I'm still curious how ripple beats Bitcoin in this way.
8	1523037352	1	Again, BTC can’t settle in 3 seconds. Not right now anyway.You are correct that banks don’t need to use XRP to use the Ledger. But it can save them an additional 30%, which of course can be a ton of money.Also, if a bank was using BTC to settle cross-border payments, and they had a question or an issue, who would they call? I don’t think Satoshi’s number is in the book.
2	1523030917	4	Ripple does not own the XRP ledger and cannot shut anything down
3	1523037030	0	They could print massive amounts of Ripple and thus crash the currency?
4	1523037170	3	Still wrong. XRP was created before the Ripple company existed. It's baked into the code there will only be 100 billion XRP ever created 
5	1523037420	0	So they could print 20 billion now or 90 billion are in circulation to manipulate /crash the market?
6	1523037794	2	All XRP have already been created. Most are locked up cryptographically in escrow. 
6	1523037804	2	Nope all 100 billion already exist. 55 billionish (as of December) are locked in 55 escrow accounts, each account holding 1 billion XRP. Every month 1 billion XRP is released for institutional sales (banks, remittance company's, other financial institutions) and every XRP that is not sold goes back into a new escrow account that is locked and added onto the back of the 55 (now 51) accounts. Since it hasn't sold out a month yet there are still 55 accounts with XRP locked in escrow. 51 of those 55 have 1 billion XRP. The other 4 accounts have the left over of the 1 billion that didn't sell the month they were released. This ensures No one can dump and crash the price. 
7	1523038122	1	Ok, I'll make a seperate post about Lisk and Ripple to go sure.
2	1523031183	3	Just adding that the Ripple description is wildly inaccurate. That description is more opinion than fact. Just focus on what Ripple is and how XRP is part of their offerings as a product called xRapid, providing cross-border payments and the ability to further decentralize.Taken from their website:> Ripple connects banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges and corporates via RippleNet to provide one frictionless experience to send money globally.
2	1523027147	0	Well this one for starters: Litecoin : Bitcoin fork with different mining algorithm but nothing else. Copies everything that Bitcoin does pretty much. Lack of innovationBasic research would show you that this isn't true.
3	1523027828	9	Name it's best innovation then?
4	1523031882	1	So far none of the alt coins have a major innovation than Bitcoin's blockchain solving the double spend problem. Just minor tweaks.
4	1523028930	-3	I have seen more progression from Litecoin at times but I definitely wouldn't agree they lack innovation. 
5	1523029570	6	Just name their best innovation.  What differentiates them?In comparison to gen 2 &3 cryptocurrencies they are falling behind tech wise.  This is a much bigger issue when you don't carry the Bitcoin name.  In my opinion a long term bullish stance on Litecoin is a foolish one.  Unless there is actual innovation in the works to make them competitive with up and coming coins from a speed and cost standpoint, they will be over taken.
3	1523030872	1	Sensing some bias in that description lol
3	1523036500	1	bitcoin clone, not a fork
3	1523028133	1	Though I dont like his description, litecoin is a Bitcoin clone that uses script and quicker block time.
2	1523035856	1	Ark a smallar version of Lisk lol? Ark is a fork of Lisk? Lisk is also a fork of crypti which is made by Ark. Ark is better in so much things i'ts not a little version of lisk do your research
2	1523037688	1	Eh, this misinformation is actually detrimental to the community, especially newer entrants.  I don't have time to point out every single piece of misinformation, but suffice it to say, take out your subjective comments, ie, "very promising...", "technology is inferior" -- especially without backing any of that that up by explaining why it's promising or why it's inferior.
3	1523038226	1	I don't think an overview of this scope exists. Yes 2% of the information is wrong, but the rest is right. With the community we currently reduce the 2% and hopefully get close to approaching the 100%.
0	1523013567	14	Quick look through. Achain shouldn't be considered an Exchange tool.Loopring and ZRX I would imagine as under that classification though. I thought WTC would be more of an ecosystem but hard to say.Would IOTA and Stellar just be considered a currency? I know Stellar already has dapps. Just minor complaints to a great writeup.
1	1523013929	4	Yes sometimes currencies also have some ecosystem aspect. Though, Stellar and IOTA also definitely focus on being a currency or THE currency, so I put them as currency. IOTA also doesn't offer smart contracts, that's why I think it's better for them to be labeled as a currency.Stellar however does, so I might put it as a platform if I get more comments on it. :)
2	1523014111	3	Yeah they are definitely a currency first so they could probably stay. Thanks for the reply, I'll read through the rest today. Thanks
1	1523025855	0	+1. Nebulas should also be listed under platforms, it's not a dapp. 
0	1523021600	8	Correct me if I’m wrong but I believe FUN is a gambling coin that licenses their tech to online casinos
0	1523015813	8	Hey you seem to want to do an earnest job at profiling creating validating for all of these currencies but some of the descriptions are incorrect. For example, bancor is not like ethereum at all. Their token is an erc20 but they have no smart contract platform of their own. I can write a better explanation in the morning. It’s 4 am right now for me and I really need to sleep/too tired to post more. I’ll Add explanations for the other ones I saw as well tomorrow.But great job trying to aggregate this info.By the way check out onchainfx.com and coincheckup.com - these are my fav go to resources for digging deeper into coin profiles
1	1523016097	1	Ok, looking forward.
0	1523017067	23	Outside the top 100 my favorite is PRL
1	1523018415	15	Mine too. Looking forward to the upcoming airdrop.
0	1523020402	8	Good post, though you clearly neglected your research into NEO. It's nothing like ETH. It has more in common with EOS, and even that's a bit of a stretch.
1	1523020748	1	What does NEO offer that Ethereum doesn't offer, because both have Smart contracts, dapps. Is it the BaaS part?
2	1523021963	7	Smart Contracts & dApps are the main services that platforms offer, it speaks nothing of the differences between them. Here's a few off the top of my head between NEO vs ETH:* Consensus is totally different and far more efficient/scalable with a huge native transaction throughput (dBFT vs PoW/S). It's more comparable to dPoS, but with a few key differences that I personally prefer.* Two-token model for seperated governance and utility, a model that is being mimicked by a lot of newer projects now* True finality (no orphan blocks, forking, or waiting for confirmations) - very few blockchains have this but it is *absolutely* essential to enterprise level adoption, particularly in financial sectors. This is the big one for me.* Multiple language support vs Solidity* Digital Identity support, allowing it to be compatible with existing legal frameworks (this is going to be really cool. It essentially means you can tie your IRL identity to your digital one, so any digital assets you own are intrinsically linked to your IRL identity. Someone steals those digital assets? You can prove they are yours and take legal action as a result)After that we get into DNA (Decentralized Network Architecture) with Ontology, Elastos etc, which are massive gamechangers in their own right. I can walk you through any of these points if you'd like more details, hit me up with any questions you have, I'd love to help answer them.
3	1523022136	2	That's a great reply, thanks!However, are these differences really major except the true finality? It seems like they use some varying consensus models, which still have to prove themselves and it's hard to tell which ones are better.
4	1523022755	1	You are absolutely right about consensus models needing to prove themselves. I believe dBFT is the best on paper given how well it balances decentralization, consistency and scalability, but as you say, time will tell. A well done dPoS is definitely a contender, though I haven't seen a way for them to incorporate finality.Two-token model is a big difference since it ties into the way the consensus process works and how decentralization is achieved, but that's consensus stuff again so will need to prove itself. The dividend system that arises from the two-token model is really cool though, which is another major difference between the two. Who doesn't love profit sharing?Multiple language support allows for easy adoption and will give a way for existing programmers to get their foot in the door, but not a massive difference I agree.Digital Identity is a huge difference. Blockchain exists in a grey area right now, and this could be a catalyst to bring it into the white. As long as you can have your property stolen without repercussion, the general public is not likely to get involved. It will allow for NEO to be compliant and regulated like every other industry on the planet.True finality is the major difference as you point out. Imagine if you picked up the entire stock market and plopped it onto a blockchain; this is a world we can all envisage I'm sure. Now imagine that orphan blocks or forks occur. It would be utter catastrophe. The whole selling point of blockchain tech is that it is immutable, but forking allows it to be made mutable again. ETH is trying to incentivize against it rather than preventing it outright, and that's a huge mistake. We need real finality, and dBFT is the only consensus process that allows it (that I've seen so far anyway, looking at PoW, PoS, dPoS, PoA and DAG.)
3	1523038261	1	And as Da continues to say, the fact NEO is designed to be regulatory compliant is huge for adoption.
0	1523013179	33	Wow, a lot of work you did there! I personally believe that 2018 will be the year of the platform. We will see a number of platform emerge as the de facto standard for a range of dApps such as Stellar for finance dApps etc. I think the platforms will see the strongest and enduring growth. Of course you will have the occasional token that moons but these will probably be outliers rather than the norm.
1	1523019790	9	Agreed. 2018 will be the year blockchain will establish it's ecosystem and the first step towards that is stable, reliable platforms. Tokens and startups building on those platforms need a year of development time anyways, so 2019+ will be their year.That's why 80% of my portfolio is in platforms. IOTA, ETH, NEO, ARK (no order). Other 20% are LINK, REQ, OMG
2	1523026062	4	Needs Vechain
2	1523031146	1	My opinion is the same as you, platform coins will be huge!Serious question, why don't you have any ICON ICX? 
1	1523027122	2	As a developer myself (having worked on not blockchain but certainly large scale, enterprise-grade projects), I've always found dApp platforms most interesting and readily relatable to me. However, I am not a maximalist of a particular one because I don't believe one platform can only succeed at the expense of the others, and often find the palpable animosity amongst them rather off-putting, to say the least (eg. Ethereum vs. EOS, Lisk vs. Ark etc.)Accordingly, various platform cryptos account for the vast majority of my coin selections at the moment. I feel comfortable doing so because I believe that, as well as one or two dominating platforms, quite a few smaller ones will also successfully carve out a niche on their own accord in the ever-expanding dApp development industry.So, yeah, I do hope 2018 will be the year of dApp and its platforms - so bring it on!
1	1523019642	1	I agree wholeheartedly. I believe the world is waking up to the potential of Blockchain but not every single thing is going to need or want it’s own chain. By creating dApps on whichever platform/s succeed, you get the power of Blockchain without requiring to build from the ground up. 
0	1523020907	7	The "google for blockchain" tag given to Nebulas isn't really accurate. It should fall under market 2 category as it's a platform, the search function being one feature. Similar to how google indexes webpages Nebulas will index blockchain projects, smart contracts & data using the Nebulas rank algorithm that sifts & sorts the data. Developers rewarded NAS to develop & deploy on NAS chain. Nebulas calls this developer incentive protocol – basically rewards are issued based on how often dapp/contract etc. is used, the more the better the rewards. Also has other distinctive features like Nebulas Force meaning no (less?) need for hard forks. A flexible base means that updates are easily applied, buggy contracts will be repairable without need for token migration, and Proof of devotion. Works like DPoS except the best, most economically incentivised developers (Bookkeeppers) get the forging spots. Ensuring brains stay with the project (Cross between PoI & PoS). 2,400 TPS+, DAG used to solve the inter-transaction dependencies in the PEE (Parallel Execution Environment) feature, first crypto Wallet that supports the Lightening Network.  First dapp announced few days ago and gifto will be using the protocol. I know this will read as a shill and it kind of is, but the google comparison leads to misunderstanding.
1	1523021601	4	It was a really vague description of Nebulas by OP.
0	1523016756	19	REQ is actually a Platform / ecosystem also. 
1	1523025435	6	Lots of people don't get this, and I think it's a major reason why a ton of people are sleeping on it. 2018 is the year of REQ getting its roadmap complete, fiat pairs, accounting/audit system developed, and being THE gateway for people to start paying and using crypto in the real world without it being cumbersome. 
2	1523033448	1	You are forgetting that they want to develop privacy features into Request also, so we can do all that (except for FIAT) in a private way.
0	1523014933	11	Good work.Though I fail to understand how ark is inferior to lisk and how come there is no mention of GAME and Enjin as gaming coins. They drop from the top 100 from time to time due to shitcoin pumps but they are solid projects 
1	1523015806	5	I'm an Enjin lover, but they are not currently in the Top100. I might make an update with them though. Made the description of Ark more neutral, since it's hard to tell which is better. 
2	1523035995	1	Dude if you had done any research you would know Ark is superior in everything that lisk has. And don't forget lisk is a scam run by cartel delegates. More than 50% is in the hand of a few corrupt people wo earn thousands per day. DO YOUR HOMEWORK
3	1523036316	1	I know. Added.
4	1523036547	1	Your description of Ark is still false and isn't edited, and i can't understand why Lisk is above them and a lot of coins under are described similar like lisk, so they are all cartel scams? Lisk needs to go down that lisk and al those coins similar to lisk is just a joke.
2	1523021244	0	I suspect your a Lisk bag holder. So many platforms you just put "similar to Lisk". Come on, that's all you could come up with?
3	1523021417	0	I don't have any Lisk. It looks like Ark is better, though it's really hard to tell which is better between all of the 10 platform coins that are really similar.EOS, Cardano, NEO, LISK, ARDR, ARK, BYTOM, NXT, STRAT, Status.Happy to put in an informative description on each of these if you have a good one though. 
3	1523027575	0	cmon man, just because someone isn't a huge fan of something doesn't mean they're an ATH-buying bagholder.
0	1523020066	4	You've mixed up DGD and DGX. DGD is the organisation token for the Digix ecosystem, similar to how MKR is for the MakerDao ecosystem. DGX is the stable token backed by gold. I think they've only just launched the DGX stable-token very recently. 
1	1523027315	2	Pretty sure a lot of the buyers of DGD make this mistake and are gonna have a bad time if they think they've bought gold backed crypto.
0	1523029565	5	PIVX: Fork of dash and inferior to Monero. Insufficient Privacy. Inferior to Monero.Zcoin: Fork of and worse than Zcash, technology is inferior.Both incorrect. Zerocash is actually based on Zerocoin, not the other way around. Zerocash is an evolved version but in my opinion it is worse. The tradeoffs of Zerocash (ZCash) makes it worse than Zerocoin (ZCoin). I could go in to detail if you want but lets save that for another time.Also PIVX started as a fork of Dash but is now actually much more like ZCoin and uses the same protocol for privacy. Dash is inferior to both. After Monero I would say that PIVX is the best, followed by ZCoin and after that, ZCash.
1	1523034781	1	wonder what your take on zencash is
2	1523035082	1	Honestly so far it is just a fork of ZCash more or less, with masternodes, so that is either a pro or a con, depending on how you see it. I personally do not like the concept of masternodes. It is also totally dependant on ZCash research and development. The pros of ZenCash over ZCash would be that it is not owned by a company and is not part of the blockchain alliance. It also has a smaller dev-tax or premine, can't remember which it is.It still shares the other cons such as the trusted setup and the Zerocash protocols ties to government and big data.
3	1523035145	2	cool thanks man, appreciate you dropping this here. 
4	1523035389	1	NP :) I love the privacy coins and do alot of research around them, glad to help!
1	1523031868	1	Hmm, why is Monero better than PIVX still? Are there any features in PIVX that are better than in Monero?Why is Zcash worse than Zcoin? I'll put it in my list.
2	1523034741	1	Monero is private by default and also much more usable, Zerocoin is a pain to use. So that is why I would put Monero as number one. PIVX however does have a bigger anonset for private transactions. My problem with ZCash are as follows:Answered this a while back, this is a copy of my own post:The privacy is optional which creates problems (http://jeffq.com/blog/on-the-linkability-of-zcash-transactions/).It is owned by a USA-based company which in my opinion is a dealbreaker for a privacy coin. The CEO has talked about tracing criminals before (https://twitter.com/zooko/status/863202798883577856). He has also talked about manipulating/invalidating peoples keys but I can't find the link.It has a built in possible backdoor because of the trusted setup needed when the project was created. This does not compromise privacy but does compromise coin-minting (https://www.coindesk.com/defending-zcash-blockchain-art-security-theater/).Besides being a for profit company that taxes its users 10 - 20% of all mining, this also means that governments and other actors could strong-arm the company to include backdoors in the code and it doesn't exactly help my confidence that ZCash is a part of the blockchain alliance (http://blockchainalliance.org/). This is an organization meant to track users and combat criminal activity among blockchains. The whole ZK project also has many ties to government and big data (http://www.globalresearch.ca/zerocash-a-cryptocurrencys-deep-state-ties/5553661).
3	1523034946	1	Thanks for all the info.I've seen it often that privacy not being default is a huge flaw. However, does Monero also allow transactions without privacy and can all of these coins not simply make privacy by default, but also allow public transactions as an option/non-default?
4	1523035237	1	Monero does not allow transparent transactions (as seen from looking at the blockchain from the outside) but you have a viewkey that you can share with anyone you like if you want to be transparent about a transaction.
5	1523035455	1	Ok and can all of these coins not simply make privacy by default, but also allow public transactions as an option/non-default?What's the advantage of having privacy optional and transparent by default vs. privacy by default and transparent optional. This is just a little design parameter that can be changed without much effort.
6	1523035908	1	Problem with Zerocash is that it requries alot of computational power to perform a private transaction, it would render the whole coin unusable more or less with current hardware. It would hinder adoption alot. Also the biggest problem with ZCash is not the optional privacy in my opinion but all of the other points that I wrote. PIVX is working on making Zerocoin transactions more or less default to make the privacy better, if they do this and also fix the usability issues with the Zerocoin protocol, I would say that Monero has a legit contender for best privacy-coin. TLDR: it makes scaling hard.There are some other issues with Zerocoin as well, it still has a trusted setup but a much "better" one than the one found in Zerocash coins. This setup has been intact for about 30 years (RSA factoring challenge from 1991 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Factoring_Challenge) so it is easier to trust. The one in ZCash is actually made by the devs of the coin. As far as I know they (PIVX) are working on replacing this system with a trustless one.
7	1523036117	1	Ok what about Dash and Nav then. They get critized for only having optional privacy. Would it be wise for them to simply change that?
8	1523036548	1	Honestly I don't consider either of them as privacy-coins. Dash has privacy in the form of mixing, not on the protocol level. Dash also are not very interested in privacy anymore and it is more or less just a gimmic at this point. They mostly care about scaling, advertising and going mainstream.To give some perspective about Dash:The "privacy-coin" that hires KYC/AML specialists to track their own users.https://steemit.com/dash/@supernimity/dash-and-corruption-to-the-core"It should also be noted, within dash Mr Więcko's job title is "Project Manager" yet his background is in banking and, in particular, compliance."https://www.coinfirm.io/aboutThe company mentioned in the article that is in collaboration with Dash"Coinfirm serves as a foundation for the safe adoption and use of blockchain. Our Blockchain Compliance & Analytics Platform uses proprietary algorithms and big data analysis to deliver actionable data that increases efficiency, reduces costs and streamlines compliance to near automation.""Customized AML Risk data for governments, financial institutions and business intelligence companies""Coinfirm’s platform uses proprietary algorithms and big data analysis to provide actionable data on blockchain transactions and parties.""Search and check blockchain addresses to get initial AML and financial risk assessment results for free""Generate comprehensive reports on AML and financial risk assessment of blockchain addresses and users."Dash is compliant crypto and looks to become as mainstream as possible. I would never rely on them for privacy.When it comes to NAV, it's a jack of all trade coin. It tries to do everything, be fast, PoS, dapps, privacy etc. It could turn out to be a cool coin but when it comes to privacy it is inferior. It uses trusted servers for coin-mixing so the privacy feature is not trustless and can not be compared to the privacy kings.And yes, privacy is optional in both as well.

1	1523015842	1	Which are the advantages of Ark over Lisk in your opinion?
2	1523022221	17	Someone wrote this on my post a couple weeks ago explaining ark: Customizable stand-alone block chains easily designed by non-developers that can link to any existing block chain and pays out a generous delegated staking reward.It also has the best wallet UI in all of crypto (my opinion).
3	1523027844	5	> pays out a generous delegated staking rewardThis is a very big part of why ARK is one of the few coins I actually bother to accumulate, all its other perks aside.  It's so easy to 'buy the dip' on ARK; even if the floor falls through and it goes down further, I can set aside these coins to make roughly 10% annually.  10% isn't going to excite those familiar with last fall's gains, but any traditional investor can truly appreciate those kinds of returns.  I still trade a lot of ARK back and forth, but ARK is one of the coins that I take my profits in 'free coins' rather than BTC, and a coin that I don't mind running away from me here in Q1; I'm confident it'll return to previous levels and I'll take my dividends while I wait.

2	1523019363	7	There are posts on /r/arkecosystem that go more in depth but here is a short non-descript list1. ARK V2s is in testing and right around the corner and seemingly stronger than Lisk in most ways.  Basically it runs better.  This will completely separate it from the Lisk fork.  It already runs incredibly well in V1. 2. Lisk’s DPOS layout is HEAVILY flawed and allows for cartels to run the blockchain delegates.  It’s nearly centralized at this point.  Controlled completely by groups because the voting system allows for single wallets to vote for multiple delegates.  Ark’s delegate system highly incentivizes competition between delegates and its one wallet one vote. 3. Push Button Blockchain and ArkVM are basically going to function towards blockchain deployment in the manner Wordpress does for websites.  These are both coming right after V2.   Developer Accessibility is the advantage here. 4.  This one is more an opinion but Lisk is running on hype and marketing and Ark is running on quality and results.  Ark just got to hiring the marketing team as V2 nears deployment in the short future. If I had more time and wasn’t on my phone I’d be more in depth, but please if anyone is interested check out /r/arkecosystem.   I can not overstress how much confidence I have in Ark.  
3	1523019825	2	Interesting points, what do you say about the smaller feature richness of Ark vs. Lisk?
4	1523020522	5	I’d have to hit ya back later but I would check out ark.ioJust now the roadmap was updated as V2 is being deployed for testing! 🙃And for the record I don’t “hate” lisk and I think this space has plenty of room for many platforms.  I do however think the Ark product will be superior in the end. 
4	1523020819	2	The opppsite. Lisk focuses on sidechains, ark does that too plus above mentioned interoperability between BCs. Additionally ark features a lot of programming languages while Lisk does "only" Java. Imo, ARK is Lisk on crack.
5	1523022225	3	LSK does Java**Script**
2	1523022235	2	Someone wrote this on my post a couple weeks ago explaining ark: Customizable stand-alone block chains easily designed by non-developers that can link to any existing block chain and pays out a generous delegated staking reward.It also has the best wallet UI in all of crypto (my opinion).
2	1523028970	2	The big one?Lisk's DPoS system is fundamentally broken. The Elite cartel (https://liskelite.com/member) owns 54/101 of the delegate nodes because Lisk wallets can vote for multiple delegates at once. This means cartel members all vote for each other to secure their spots and it becomes near impossible to ever vote them out as they get richer and richer. That is centralization.Ark wallets can only vote for one delegate at a time which forces delegates to compete against each other and makes cartel formations incredibly hard, if not impossible.Competition levels the playing field so much. For example, the Elite cartel pays out 25% of forged coins to voters. The average Ark delegate pays out 90-95%.
3	1523030660	1	Very good point, thanks will add and possibly ask in their subreddit.So, Lisk is actually under 52% attack so to speak?
0	1523016669	5	No spot for QLink?
1	1523018387	2	Not top 100! :)
2	1523018459	3	Not yet! ;)
3	1523018790	2	;)
0	1523021344	4	Can anyone knowledgeable on TRON explain the concept to me? I've read a couple descriptions, but they all seem like a word jumble of trendy marketing terms. I've yet to find something that explains how a crypto based on entertainment content creation/consumption works.
1	1523022430	6	You're right it is a word jumble and if you read up on some things like the 'stolen' whitepaper you'll be a lot wiser. I've sold all my TRX and I was very into it up until recent times.
0	1523015856	5	I feel you have some biases coming through in some of your summaries, however, that my represent my own biased preferences.  Just as an example, you completely dismiss Litecoin's advantages \(2.5min block times, relatively high adoption, presence on Coinbase\).At long as people take this with a pinch of salt \(as they should for everything in the crytpo\-verse\), this should be really helpful, especially for beginners. Well done!
1	1523019459	3	I agree. I appreciate the work put into this, but a write up like this (given that some people will take this at face value) should be more of an aggregate project with a wider knowledge base to counteract confirmation bias.
1	1523016495	0	Yes, but these differences are really minor and shorter block times are also not always better, same as bigger blocks.These kinds of biases need to be called out, because Litecoin has a lot of adoption, but only due to first mover advantage, not because they are doing something special. Maybe it encourages them to do more. What other summaries do you deem to require improvement?
2	1523020203	2	Thanks for reply. I agree that first mover advantage has a large part to do with the success of LTC, although I feel that they have done impressively well in turning that into real world adoption relative to other coins by forming the LTC foundation and making productive partnerships without excessive hype \(Although the recent Litepay fiasco definitely goes against my point!\).Only other suggestion was regarding Nano's 7000tps, which is not yet tested. But this was already stated in another comment and acknowledged by yourself.Well done keeping things constructive in your replies when people reactive aggressively to the negative points regarding their favourite coins!
3	1523020397	2	You have a point, maybe it's good for the ecosystem to have a little brother that keeps the big one in check.Yes, crypto is very emotional, but so far comments have still been insightful.:)
0	1523016064	9	nano - 7k tps is possible speed, it wasnt tested just calculated
1	1523018207	4	Fixed.
2	1523021671	0	300 tps were also tested on the testnet which means nothing in reality 
3	1523026453	2	300 tps was tested at public mainet not testnet ,testnet gave 7000tps and is only limited by hardware it could go even higher then 7000 with better hardware,get your facts right buddy. 
3	1523026582	2	It was on the mainnet 
0	1523021426	3	Nice read but you went easy on some of the scam coins like Dogecoin Dark aka Verge, also there is Vertcoin, you can call it bronze to Bitcoin as Litecoin is silver.
1	1523021852	1	Yes some say I went to easy, some I went to hard on the Trons, EOS, Verges.Though do you have some solid evidence against Verge, since as of now it's all just accusations of the founder wanting to pay his taxes, but no evidence yet and the tech problems due to a bug are annoying and negligent, but doesn't make them a scam.
0	1523024186	3	Kin is not the token for Kik. Kin is developing their own ecosystem  that will include hundreds of apps, Kik is only one of those apps. This is a common misconception. For example they just announced a partnership with Unity, the largest game developer in the world. 
0	1523024306	3	Just wanted to let you know NAV coin isn't just privacy, it's essentially a platform if you look at their roadmap.Thanks for the info!
0	1523020123	6	>PIVX: Fork of dash and inferior to Monero. Insufficient Privacy. Inferior to Monero.I'm not sure why you rate Dash as a good privacy coin and Pivx as having insufficient privacy. Dash's privacy is just with a bolted on mixer and not default whereas Pivx is anonymous by default.
0	1523018004	9	Well the Ark description was absolutely terrible lol. Hard to trust many of these considering how bad that was. 
1	1523018733	2	What Ark description would you like to see?
2	1523019364	8	I’d mention push button deployable blockchains (bridgechains/sidechains) and **Blockchain interoperability for cross chain transactions and (pretty soon here) cross chain smart contracts.** ~12 supported development languages you can utilize for Blockchain or web app api based dev ops. ~9-10% annual return when staking (aka when voted for a delegate). Also, while it’s a fork of lisk, the team has developed a more fair dpos system, and is working on V2 from scratch. Edit: I’m no expert; I’m sure someone could give a much better concise explanation than me. Just felt your original notes on Ark were kinda lazy - no offense here by any means, your entire post was definitely well thought out. 
0	1523018979	4	Ethereum classic is not a forked clone of Ethereum. Actually it's the other way around 
1	1523019144	2	Subtle difference, but you're right.
2	1523029816	2	Check Elektroneum, they are no gaming coin of any sort. It is a payment system for third world citizens without bank accounts.
3	1523030908	1	Electroneum is a brand new British cryptocurrency developed to be used in the mobile gaming and online gambling markets. The Electroneum team hopes to replace in-game currencies, such as World of Warcraft gold, with ETN. Imagine all of the completed quests and sold items paying out in a currency that can easily be converted to other cryptocurrencies or fiat. This would not only encourage players to play more, but the gaming company could charge fees on depositing and withdrawing ETN from their ecosystem. Creating a game that advertises ETN as an in-game currency could also prove to be an effective marketing tool. One mobile game currently in beta testing involves trying to fly a rocketship to the moon while collecting ETN. When the player dies, they have to watch a video advertisement to help fund the ETN rewarded to the users?
4	1523031279	1	> ElectroneumELECTRONEUM. THE MOBILE CRYPTOCURRENCY. https://electroneum.com/    Secure and private    Designed for mass adoption    App based mobile mining    Signed agreements with global mobile networks    Provide a digital payment solution to the developing worldPlease send me a link to the website you got your info. Is there two cryptos called Electroneum?
5	1523031433	1	From here https://coincentral.com/electroneum-beginners-guide/
6	1523031702	1	You done a great job but I would not call them a gaming coin. It is not discussed in their subreddit. There it is all about helping the third world with their banking problems.
0	1523016111	2	Markets 6, 8, 10 and 11 are "not real" in my opinion, but I have to admit, that I didn't research all projects, because they all seemed like a more or less nice idea, but the coin wasn't really needed or even hindering for the user. (coins are only used as a currency for the specific project, there is no technical benefit to use the coin and it's unrelated and would be exchangeable for other coins.)
1	1523017303	2	Why not? Gaming is a very strong market, Steem is maybe the new reddit that allows its content creators to make money and it already works and has an alexa rank of 1,000. Data storage and Cloud computing also seems plausible.If you look at the top 200, there are even more of these 4 markets. :)
2	1523017633	1	Like I said the ideas/platforms may be really nice and of course it's nice to use a cryptocurrency for payments/tips. But what is the benefit of every idea/platform having their own cryptocurrency to do its payments? (other than fundraising)
3	1523018382	2	I mean a social network based on blockchain technology seems interesting and opens up lots of avenues including them completely decentralizing their platform on the blockchain. It needs to be seen how cloud computing and data storage turn out, but definitely interesting and worth watching.
4	1523020342	1	Now that's the thing I am missing, that the blockchain itself is actually used for the project, not just as form of payment and the project alone would work completely without blockchain tech.
5	1523020633	1	Yes but that's the case for all utility tokens. Hmm, does that mean that all utility tokens are useless though?I think it removes a barrier of friction and takes banks out of the equation, since payment can be all done in crypto no?
6	1523020916	1	Haha I don't know, that's what I am asking myself. At least Steem doesn't use its blockchain for payments only... but for me these projects + coins are too hard to grasp from an investing point of view.. so i just ignore them.
7	1523021182	1	Yes, while I think it makes sense to put a few % into one of these markets as part of diversification.
6	1523021565	1	Hm.. did you edit the second part? Well they could all just accept payments with some common cryptocurrencies to remove friction. Atm I need a bank +at least(!) 1 exchange + x different coins to use/buy x different things.
1	1523017009	1	I agree there is no market for cloud computing coins where you have to buy the currency at unknown future values, to get compute done by unknown parties, to an unknown quality, in an unknown amount of time, is largely unrealistic.  Especially where BOINC and Gridcoin or Stanford and Curecoin will do it for you free of charge (oh and they actually work).Im not so sure on the social media market though, steem works pretty well.
2	1523017652	1	Like I said the ideas/platforms may be really nice and of course it's nice to use a cryptocurrency for payments/tips. But what is the benefit of every idea/platform having their own cryptocurrency to do its payments? (other than fundraising)
3	1523017938	1	Does it matter really, everyone is frothing at the mouth over scalability, but there are still plenty of chains with spare capacity.  Having many chains with different attributes provides resiliency too.
4	1523020020	1	Honestly I don't know... It just feels shady and wrong to me. I don't want to invest in coins which are only used for payments for one specific project just because I like the project behind it. It would feel similar to buying lots of Amazon gift cards, because I think Amazon is great. That wouldn't make any sense... also Amazon doesn't force everyone to pay with Amazon gift cards only.Does this make any sense to you? Imagine you could use XRP/Nano or any other coin directly on Steem. Would anouncements and stuff for the Steem platform make a difference to the price of XRP/Nano? I don't think so... but why does it for the Steem coin?I understand that the price of a limited coin has to rise if the demand gets higher and higher and positive anouncements can rise demand or at least speculation. It's just the constellation of project + unneeded extra created coin just for this project that disturbs me.
5	1523022116	1	Who is asking you to invest in steem?  Just write a blog and you can earn steem, there arent many coins where its easy to earn crypto like that, so I think it definitely has a reason to exist.You can spend steem anywhere, its a currency, you arent obliged to spend steem with steemit.com.  Tokens are often closed ecosystems, that does not ake so much sense to me, but steem isnt one of them.The real question is why would I invest in XRP/Nano and place my funds at risk?  Answer; I wont, I will blog on steem and make money, at zero risk.

0	1523018946	2	I see a lot of you personal bias between similar coins, so, not an objective base for any strategy.
0	1523019020	2	QASH is more similar to BNB. It will be used to fuel their liquid platform which will be an exchange that will distribute their liquidity pool.
0	1523020411	2	First, thank you for doing this! Great writeup. Question though, how is AE a currency, while ETH is a platform? Both focus on smart contracts right? Shouldn't everything focusing on smart contracts be a platform (or vice versa)? I know there is a grey area in between, just curious why you made this choice for personal education. 
1	1523020760	1	True, good find.
0	1523024993	2	This may be controversial, but there's really no need for coins in Market 1 if coins in Market 2 (Platform coins) can carry out its function pretty flawlessly. 
1	1523027189	2	Yes, but platform coins don't have as many resources to focus on scalability, energy usage and instant transactions.Furthermore, there is always a trade off between feature richness and lightness of the network.It is still possible that a platform coin can achieve this despite all of these reasons. It might happen.
0	1523025670	2	Favorites: REQ, KNC, OMG, XLM, ETHI strongly believe that the next big gainers are projects that help the crypto ecosystem get more widely adopted. Payment gateways, DEXs, and Liquidity. 
0	1523025675	2	good post especially about EOS. EOS trolls are all over the boards hyping it this week like the baggies they are. Vapor ware and shady deal, 1 year long ICO in which they have been dumping btc and eth at the lows screwing many of us and their own investors!!!! They are no fucking eth killer. ETH is also adaptable, good luck beating them when EEA is made up of 300 of the most leading edge companies in the world with resources to CRUSH any competition
1	1523026302	0	You sound quite mad right now, with EOS, is it because they sold their ETH to actually fund a **operational product that is killing ethereum**?
2	1523028726	1	they're not killing anything. Talk to me in 3 years. EOS has no track record, no stress testing, no value added. Its literally like a dot bomb ico . How much u down on it???
2	1523031988	1	I'm not sure that they used the $500 million (!) that they've dumped on product development, i.e. developers & servers. It's pretty impossible actually.
0	1523026164	2	I think it might be worth further distinguishing store of value projects from currency projects. Of all the catagories, I think store of value coins are the most promising.
0	1523029063	2	The way you've described and categorized these coins is laughable. QASH = REQ...what?
0	1523030432	2	Great write up but your descriptions are fairly bias IMO
1	1523030817	1	Can you point out which ones? Always happy to make tweaks.
0	1523031261	2	Outside of the top 100, I’m extremely bullish on TRAC.

0	1523021757	3	Spot on! Wow do I feel better about my portfolio. Investigating enigma and skycoin. Thanks!
1	1523021985	3	Yes I like them too. Skycoin seems like the only coin that was accused of scam, but then wasn't one. :D Enigma is the only privacy coin, I'll put in my portfolio, because Monero is already so high in Market cap.
2	1523023272	2	I personally bought into navcoin a long time ago as my privacy coin option... Many of my nerd friends are a buzz over Enigma though... I struggle with privacy coins. It’s important, but at the beginning I don’t see much adoption. Govt/businesses like to be open books... generally.
3	1523026559	1	Yes, it's either optional privacy coins or full privacy coins that will make it. Depends on how strong regulations will be and if adoption is so strong that regulations can't hold them back.
0	1523013658	3	Please explain how the market is rather small for OMG?
1	1523013979	2	Sry leftover.Would you say Populous is on a small market though?
0	1523021278	5	As ususal, your take on XRP was completely wrong. Do some research. Ripple does not control the xrp ledger, they can not shut it down. Ripple as a company is centralised by definition, since all companies are centralised. XRP is not centralised, the xrp ledger is decentralized and Ripple does not control it. Ripple did not create XRP even though they hold a large share of xrp (put in escrow) like many many other projects out there. 
1	1523022454	6	XRP (coin) IS centralized. XRP ledger isn't. XRP coin isn't required for XRP leger. XRP coin value is questionable at best, and this is what you are buying when you buy XRP. You aren't buying the ledger, you are buying the coin. I have no idea why anyone in their right mind would invest money in the XRP token. It has every single red flag you can imagine. Questionable value, completely centralized and controlled by someone who could liquidate and destroy the value of your coin (his as well). This thing implodes at the first sign of trouble, and it will happen faster than you can react to it.It's a terrifying prospect to invest in.
2	1523023350	4	NO, no, no. The coin is not centralised, there's so much misinformation about xrp from bitcoin maximalists it's funny. It has every single red flag? Ripple can not shut down xrp. They did not create it but they hold a large share (that is put in escrow by the way, so if you say they could just dump it, no they can not even if they liked)I don't think there's any idea to argue with you, I don't see the point. xrp is being trialed by Western Union, Moneygram and other very large payment providers and used by 2 FIs in real world use. Cuallix in Mexico and Zipremit, more than any other coin whether people like it or not. And that is fact. If you aren't able to see what value xrp can add then there's no point discussing anything further.
3	1523024825	0	Whats the point of owing XRP if its not part of Ripple?Also, if Western Union is not bankrupt in 5 years than cryptos have failed. 
4	1523029848	2	Your expectation of the impact of innovation is limited.  Please know that, many times, paradigm shifts happen WITHIN the existing infrastructure.   Sure, the technology is a cheaper, faster, and more secure way to transfer money, but that doesn't mean WU screwed, or going to go bankrupt, because WU can itself incorporate this technology.  In fact, they've already publicly said they are testing xRapid.  Don't underestimate the desire and ability of the existing power players to stay relevant.   They know the industry better than anyone and they have considerable resources at their disposal. 
5	1523031172	0	You missed my point, if western union is still needed than cryptos have failed because cryptos by their nature don't need a middleman. Please explain WU value add in this case?
6	1523033155	2	WU isn't needed today yet it is still used for it's convenience. And just because we now have a "middle man" free option at this point, doesn't mean the world will homogeneously shift away from it's reliance on the middle man.  Most people don't care about this "down with the man" revolution, they just wanna send some money.  And actually, what we have to remember is that, as a consumer, there are some benefits to having a middle man, benefits that are a high priority.  I have someone who takes care of it for me.  I have someone who I can go to if there is an issue.  I have someone who can expertly lead me through the process. 
7	1523038525	1	If crypto has not made it so that anyone can send any money at any time in 5 years then it has failed. I dont think it will fail. WU is not needed.  It has nothing to do with "down with the man" its just that technology has made WU obsolete.  
4	1523025299	1	Institutions will adopt crypto and blockchain. It will not be an either or. Companies like Ripple and Vechain work with a ton of companies and FIs. There will be a place for both. But yeah I agree that if WU does not adopt crypto they will probably fail but I think they will adopt xrp. 
5	1523030952	0	If they use crypto which is peer to peer why do we need them?
6	1523031696	2	Different use cases. It is definitely not only peer to peer. xrp is primarily meant as a bridge currency. Vechain is meant to monitor goods that's transported, anti-counterfeiting and other use cases as well. Then you have privacy coins. Ethereum, NEO and other platforms with smart contracts.
7	1523038396	1	Forget the other use cases, why do we need western union to send money?
2	1523023550	-1	That you do not know about the escrow is pretty terrifying to me, that means you can not know much about xrp at all, so there is no point discussing with you. I guess you do not want to talk about the 3 mining farms in China controlling the hashrate of bitcoin? Lightning is just another word for centralisation. 
3	1523024595	0	I don't know why you think I don't know about escrow, and that most of xrp is escrowed. That doesn't mean it's not terrifying that they still own all those coins. Sure they are "locked up" and will slowly be released. How slow? Not that fucking slow. He can't sell them all without crashing the price to zero anyways. The last 80% of the coins they liquidate will bring in 10% the revenue that the first 20% will. So escrow doesn't matter. And why do you think I don't know about how centralized BTC mining is? Lightning is just making a new VISA. Yeah, I get all that. Doesn't mean I'd touch ripple with a 10 foot pole.
4	1523025131	1	they hold 55 billion. They can only sell one billion per month. The amount they do not sell goes back into escrow for another 5 years. Lately they have sold around 100 million I think so 900 million has went back into escrow. Even if they sold maximum it would take 5 years, at this rate it will be more like 50 years but it will most likely increase.
5	1523026096	-1	The thing you aren't getting is that they will never sell 55B and don't need to. The first billion the my sell will make just as much money as the last 54B. The point is that at any time they can decide to seal in profits and you or nobody else can stop them. And it WILL crash your investment. Your investment that isn't even required to run the network. You aren't even invested in the tool that is needed for the tech that you think you are invested in.Anyways, you invest how you want.

0	1523017078	1	It just seemed like it went straight to the old "plagiarized whitepaper" ordeal whereas other descriptions gave a bit more about what the coin/token is...this could have at least added something like "looking to capitalize on ownership of internet data to content creators" or something a little more descriptive versus going right to ripping them...if objective then at least give the fact that they've addressed this, apologized for it and have been trying to make it better...it was a mistake, sure and not a little thing, but left them out to dry without at least advising that they've not ignored or either...and had a decent explanation

0	1523017691	1	That’s a really great post, thank you for that! TIL about several platforms I didn’t know existed.Might I suggest, for cat7, to add Pangea, the Bitnation (bitnation.co) platform for creating virtual nations and government services like public notaries. They’re in an ICO right now. 
1	1523018586	1	Thanks. :) That's only a list of the top 100 though!
0	1523018151	1	Is there a reason that there are only maybe 20 coins that are ever mentioned on this sub? Like I see REQ, ENG and PRL mentioned all the time but never PPT or BTM that have much larger market caps.Although just to be clear I know nothing about the latter two 
1	1523018943	2	Many are older coins with older technology with already much better competitors at a smaller market cap, e.g. Litecoin, Digibyte, Eth classic, Zcash, Pivx, Pop, Revain, Hshare, Bytecoin, Veritaseum.
0	1523019126	1	Yeah I'm not saying they didn't, just seemed like they gave that side but did not offer anything related to Trons response to the accusations is all.

0	1523022117	1	Great write up bro! Thx for this 
0	1523022310	1	Nice summaries, albeit there are holes/flaws. The one I care about most (because I am obviously vested) is Stellar's exclusion from the platform category.  There have been several ICOs on the stellar network, it's not just a "currency coin"
1	1523022355	1	Yes, another user also mentioned that.What else irks you? 
2	1523023911	1	Actually for the purposes of the post I think it's a pretty good starting point.  It's shallow, and hopefully people don't make snap judgments off it, but I like the breakouts overall.
3	1523026892	1	I think it's the sweet spot of giving some detail, allowing people to see where their interests are, getting an overview of the market, to then build their own portfolio with further research.I also haven't seen a summary of all top 100 coins with this detail, so it isn't 100% perfect, but with the comments, already many quirks have been ironed out.

0	1523022513	1	DGD isn't the stablecoin.. DGX is the stablecoin. DGD is the platform used for DGX transactions.. If I understand correctly.

0	1523022901	1	Why can't platform coins be labeled as currency?
1	1523026410	1	They are also currencies, while currencies aren't platforms and currencies will most probably be used more as currencies than platform. That's the distinction.If a platform become more used as a currencies than actual currencies, then that is a big deal. Maybe this will happen.
0	1523023131	1	I might be the only one here who mention Dero and Ellaism... Remind me 1 year!

0	1523023272	1	This isn't in order but: LINK, REQ, RCN, QSP, ETH
1	1523026462	1	And out of the top100 only?What about Ark instead of Lisk, seems to get more appreciation here.
2	1523028797	1	Ohh I forgot QSP and RCN are not top 100.I would replace them with NEO and ZRX then. 
0	1523023326	1	why not add fintech, so you can move some away from currency and misc into one basket?
0	1523023868	1	Hi thanks for the list been very educational.might have been said already, but DGD is the governance token that lets community decide on grants to projects to benefit the digix ecosystem (similar to Dash), and voters are rewarded with the gold token "DGX" (which launches on 8th April i believe) (DGX is the stablecoin)MKR is also governance token I believe but they act as collateral if Eth value depreciates heavily (to sustain the price of the DAI). 
0	1523024522	1	 You'll want to look into the differences between DAG tech and blockchain tech. IOTA (and Nano, and ITC) are all directed acyclic graphs, not blockchains, because they have no blocks. Instead, each transaction validates others as it happens, creating a kind of swarm or waterfall effect. I had to read the IOTA whitepaper three times to understand it, but its worth it. The trouble with DAG is how to secure the network, its sort of like a top, you have to get it spinning fast enough in order for it to stay spinning.  
1	1523027049	1	Yes, Tangle and block lattice are called 3rd generation blockchains though. Maybe, it's a bit of a confusing description.
0	1523024701	1	Maidsafecoin is not just a storage coin, thats actually the least interesting aspect of the safe network. You need a separate section for the safe network, its a decentralized internet. 
0	1523027166	1	One thing that I noticed is in error is DGD. 1 DGD != 1 gram of gold. 1 DGX = 1 gram of gold. DGX is the stable coin for the platform. DGD is the DAO that votes on what implementations should be made to the DGX marketplace then users get a share of the pot for voting.
0	1523028531	1	OP you have way too much time on your hands. 
1	1523030590	1	Involuntarily.
0	1523028778	1	I would classify Stellar as a platform, since it supposed smart contracts and already has tokens issued.I also think USDT should be considered a currency
0	1523029419	1	Excellent post.  Need more of your kind.For exchange coins, look into Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange, a subsidiary of Gibraltar Stock Exchange.  Their exchange token is Rock Token (RKT).  Eventually RKT will be preferred currency for GBX and GSX; offer early access to their platformed ICOs.  Trading fees, listing fees, settlement, etc.  One thing that stands out is the fact that most of their investors in their token sale were industry.  Some big partners and adopters including Kyber Network, Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Digix DAO, QUOINE.  They have full regulatory compliance in Gibraltar, best practices, etc.  Eventually they will offer tokenized securities on GSX, and RKT can be used to pay for such items.  GBX focuses on utility, while GSX will focus on security (as in SEC).  We can expect to see order book markets for mainstay cryptos like BTC, ETH, etc.Check it out.https://gbx.gi/https://gbx.gi/token-sales/GBX-Whitepaper.pdf
0	1523030120	1	Very nice post and write up. Could be a sticky for new investors.
0	1523031367	1	I don't understand how people rate BCH over XRP and LTC which are miles ahead in operating as a payment currency.This looks like some tailored review with respect to someone's portfolio
1	1523036862	1	simple. LTC is following the exact roadmap as BTC, which means in order for LTC to become a global currency, it needs the same tech (LN) bitcoin needs. But if that tech ever does come to fruition and BTC is able to scale globaly, what is the need for litecoin ? And if the tech is never figured out how will LTC scale? Where as BCH offers a completely different scaling solution. Xrp is not truly decentralised and the founders of ripple lab undoubtedly have alot of control over the network.
0	1523032854	1	Is there a reason why stellar isn’t also on the platform list? It can do both.
0	1523033146	1	How is Bancor exactly like Ethereum? Did I read that wrong? 
0	1523033421	1	Enjoyed reading this post. Two thing that concerned me is the Ethereum comparison and EOS. First, you were too harsh on Ether, let's hope they resolve their energy consumption problems. Second EOS is quite a promising platform, they will be launching in two months so let's hope they will follow the white paper as they are following it right now, dawn 3.0 was released yesterday and it was welcomed quite good from the investors. I have this post bookmarked for some future reference since I learned something for coins/tokens I'm not in.
0	1523033632	1	ZIL is a platform very much like ETH or ADA
0	1523033951	1	nice list ! i think you mixed up DigixDAO (DGD) with their gold-backed token (DGX). DGD is not intended to be a stablecoin - the tokens that come from it are asset-backed tokens - gold being the first of many planned rollouts (Silver likely next)./ think of DGD like the goose that lays golden eggs (DGX, with silver, other precious metals next, then other commodities that the DAO decides and votes upon). 
0	1523034050	1	NLC2, COSS, RDD, Scorum top 4 don’t have a 5th rn
0	1523034325	1	Does anyone else thing these categories are misleading? Eth for example could easily be a currency as well, better than many on the currency list...

1	1523034831	2	Fixed.
0	1523035128	1	Iota, Neo, Enigma, Omg and XLM.
1	1523035354	1	Good picks. What's so good about XLM though in comparison to all the other platforms?
2	1523038196	1	Honestly im not sure other than XLM is backed up by legit companies and seem to develop new shit frequently.There might be better options, not sure.
0	1523035994	1	This is a nice read. In my opinion, the Bitcoin as the first crypto has a lot to take from its "successors" so to say. I think technologies like ripple, ethereum, eos, neo, especially those allowing DApps and smart contracts, are the true future of crypto. Platforms like eos, with its new update, allowing for fast transactions, security, sustainability, are the ones who are carving the path for new platforms and old.

0	1523023511	1	I was initially impressed with the effort but the content doesn't hold up.  The descriptions don't reflect the value proposition of various coins.  I understand it'd be great to put everything in neat boxes and label them good or bad, but it's a very complex market and that becomes reductionist very quickly> Privacy coins aim to prevent exactly that through address fungabilityThat's not what fungibility means >Dash: Good privacy coinlol>Zcash: A decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency that hide the sender, recipient, and value of transactions. Offers users the option to make transactions public later for auditing. Good privacy coin, though no default privacyWeird how you skim over all the questionable parts of certain coins>PIVX: Fork of dash and inferior to Monero. Insufficient Privacy. Inferior to MoneroIt is a fork of Dash, but the rest is incorrect>Zcoin: Fork of and worse than Zcash, technology is inferior.Not a fork of ZCash, Different privacy profile but not outright inferior.  Your chart's TPS also has some very weird and unsourced data.  If bitcoin is 7, PIVX should be 140.  Where are you getting 1700 for monero from?
1	1523032113	1	> Weird how you skim over all the questionable parts of certain coins.Which ones? Always good to get more input.> Your chart's TPS also has some very weird and unsourced data.

With LMDB estimates from developers Smooth and NoodleDoodle are that Monero can handle 1700 TPS (up from 1600 TPS pre LMDB).
0	1523027364	1	RLC > Golem
1	1523030564	2	Why?
0	1523027552	1	please don’t talk about Privacy coins, u obviously don’t know a thing about them.U call Zcash a good privacy coin when many of their shielded txes can be traced...u call zcoin a fork of zcash which is false...U say PIVX has inferior privacy when it has the best privacy on the market currently next to monero(they both have their pros and cons)Atleast attempt to do some research if you’re going to make an ‘indepth’ postand how can u say zerocoin is inferior to zerocash? they both have pros and cons...and somehow navcoin is good for privacy??? navtech is fully centralized, u have no clue what you are talking about.Also Dash has 0 privacy, not sure why it’s listed there.
1	1523030559	1	Yes, need to fix a few things in the privacy section. Dash has privacy, e.g. PrivateSend.
2	1523031465	1	There are numerous papers showing that PrivateSend provides no meaningfull privacy.Also sorry for being so rude... no need for that. Just get abit annoyed when statements are made about coins which are obviously false.
1	1523032047	1	What are the differences between PIVX and Monero then if they are even?
2	1523032759	1	They use completelt different protocols for Privacy, Monero uses a combination of Stealth adresses, ring signatures and ringCT. This makes the present day Monero a very good choice for privacy. Tradeoff being scalability/tx fees/speed. They will have Bulletproofs soon which will greatly help with scalability. My main issue with Monero is that their privacy is all on chain, so if their protocol is ever cracked, all prior transactions will be deanonymized.PIVX uses an advanced implementation of the Zerocoin protocol to provide it’s Privacy. This is a form of zeroknowledge proofs, which allow users to spend ‘Zerocoins’ that have no link back to them. Unlike Zcash u have denominations in PIVX, so u can’t track users by their payment amount being equal to the amount of ‘minted’ coins, because everyone uses the same denominations.PIVX is also implementing Bulletproofs, just like Monero, and this will take care of arguably the biggest weakness of zeroknowledge protocols: the trusted setup. besides that the main difference is that PIVX allows for public sends aswell as private sends. This could potentially cause a ‘non-tech savvy’ person to screw himself over. But at the same time it allows for use cases that require public spends. So that could be seen as an advantage for Monero. Another difference is that PIVX is Proof of Stake, which makes it more environmenrally friendly aswell as more decentralized if u care about those things. 
3	1523034150	1	PIVX's technology sounds really superior and more private to Monero's then, no? Moreover, this is really a no go as a privacy coin like Monero so be so vulnerable to all transactions being anonymized??
4	1523034397	1	Thats hard to say, I think it’s alot about personal prefference at this point. In my own opinion i prefer PIVX though, but i love Monero too. I just quit using it when I found out past transactions can be deanonymized if it ever gets cracked. No matter how small the odds I’d rather they fix that before I use it again.But for privacy they are the only 2 options currently imo. 
5	1523035007	1	How can anyone use Monero then still when their entire privacy can be disabled with 1 hack? Shouldn't solid privacy not be a single point of failure technology? And why isn't PIVX more popular then when it is arguably much more secure than monero.
6	1523035275	1	The hack would require some advanced quantum computing, so it’s more just my paranoia that they won’t find a way to fix it before/if that happens.Not sure why PIVX isn’t more popular, maybe because it’s newer? It also has very fast transactions and very low fees, think once people catch on it will be up there with Monero.

0	1523022761	0	Anytime you do something like this, you will get bombarded by people nitpicking things you say. You have made a great effort into tweaking descriptions based on comments, and I absolutely commend you for that. Overall, this is a pretty damn good quality post, and is exactly what this sub needs. Less "us vs them", less "Vitalik just burned someone", less "We're going to zero!!! OMG!!", less inside jokes and cringey content. More of this. More of quality posts that attract new people, quickly explain many coins at once, and do it in a pretty damn good way.Ignore hate you get from people because you called ripple centralized (which it is), called Tron and Cardano and EOS etc.. out for their weaknesses, etc. You did a great job, well done.
1	1523026342	2	Hey thanks a lot, really appreciate your positive feedback. I have a few follow up posts planned in a similar fashion. :)However, is there a reason to call Ripple not centralized since they have no control over the open leder, is that correct?
0	1523014831	-5	Someone is bitter about Tron...not sure you were completely objective on that one.
1	1523016057	7	What's a better description in your opinion? I saw they just launched their game yesterday?
1	1523018200	6	Tron did plagiarise their white paper. And their code. Facts, not biase. And the market cap is ridiculous considering the stage of development. Lots of potential though if they can distract their CEO away from self-felating for long enough. Edit: great write-up OP, big thanks for the overview.

0	1523018000	0	One correctiom I'd wager. NEM is more similar to FCT. While NEM is similar to NEO, it's much further in development and versatility. NEM also has a different kind of smart contract tech than NEO. 
1	1523019097	2	Isn't it still in testing phase, while NEO is already public and live?
2	1523032025	1	Nope it's live and has been for quite some time. Catapult is the next big update expected this year which is the testing part you may be confusing. Though catapult is already live on the private chain.

2	1523023676	2	that's wrong info.currently NEO blocksize is limited at 500 tx.with blocktime around 20s, so its current TPS is 500/20 = 25 TPS.you can find the chart of average blocktime here.https://neoeconomy.io/and this is the example of block that hit the size limit of 500 tx.https://neotracker.io/block/hash/4301d857413ff8879e5ec96698718472fdc9fd932af3d3bcdcb31d92cd2b9a8b
