0	1523024543	8	Please no more good news. We've had enough dips as it is.
0	1523008956	12	good that they acknowledge that not all ICOs are scam and that they are willing to remove the bad actors in the space which is much needed if we want to get in institutional investors who will pour in billions of dollars
1	1523027885	1	Agreed. I only hope other countries that are currently looking into tightening regulations (or even imposing an outright ban) will follow suit.
2	1523037323	1	Enough Countries will open for ICOs (France, UK, Germany, Switzerland, South Korea opening ICOs again etc.). 
0	1523003148	24	super bullish

0	1523013459	1	Wait it's bullish? I was already super bullish on this bear market 
0	1523015021	1	Porgish 
0	1523017041	1	And Eos is one of them, Like some people think.
0	1523017792	1	True if big
0	1523018306	1	Hopefully more ICOs doing KYC allow the US to participate. 
0	1523020630	1	Great news, imo ICO's are like the dot com bubble at the moment, just pick gems and hodl
0	1523021179	1	Thank you. Sad when you see a ton of reddit and media people saying all ico projects are scams, but even the SEC won't claim this.
0	1523025546	1	too late, damage has been done. 
0	1523025810	1	I think ICOs have to bee studied. You can't just invest without doing some background checking. If you've done your homework, then you can actually invest.
0	1523026644	1	Why is the "absolutely not" between ```"```We know not all are, EOS for example is not, yet still is not allowed in the US.
0	1523026809	1	Wow thanks for the insight Chief.
0	1523026991	1	Big even if untrue
0	1523027706	1	I'm glad they're actually taking the time to become very familiar with the space. At first, it truly does look like they're all scams. 
0	1523029644	1	Yea right, "are not".
0	1523031758	1	Guarantee you hes seen some pretty nice returns on his ICO investements.
0	1523033638	1	I've been saying this for the longest time. Some ICOs are legit. They follow regulation while making a badass project. 
1	1523037138	1	That's what separates the good ICO from the shit ones IMO. 
0	1523035644	1	right now even if the pope said crypto are blessed it wouldn't affect the market much. We need institutional money. Ask your self one question. If you had 10M play money would you, right now, invest in the market wherea) Mt Gox or whatever whale can crash it?b) XVG like coins get hacked 5 times / day and still nothing is wrong?c) Centra goes to jail and...155% up.d) BT Diamond does not have a team or a site or a paper and somehow manages to survive ? a FACELESS PRODUCT... e) Top ten coin is related, even remotely with pedofiles...f) Top 5 Coin gets shilled with probably the worst rap song of all time?g) Some click bait title states Vitalik is allergic to tuna and causes massive sell offs ? (crypto @investors@ are probably the worst pussies EVER)Would you invest ? We absolutely need a serious PURGE before we move on. We got too much attention for our own good now and most investors are not dumb. There is no room for institutional money as the market operates right now.
1	1523035944	1	https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/06/soros-fund-reportedly-preparing-to-trade-cryptocurrencies.htmlhere is your institutional money :)and yes I can assure you that all the pessimistic but true reasons you stated did not deter me from being all-in since Aug
0	1523011565	1	I mean I guess technically true, but most of them are
