0	1522965301	1140	So no one here knows and I will tell you what it was:Coinbase Venture Funds is launching. Essentially they are going to start seeding worthy crypto companies. I'm not sure if that's something that we can all invest in or not.
1	1522965883	376	Thanks for being the one useful comment in a thread full of shit.  
2	1522967120	66	I searched for it, couldn't find it. Felt compelled to EDUCATE
2	1522968467	48	Breaking news.....Penis. Conbase out. 
3	1522969300	7	I will use this message to shill my shitcoin on Reddit!
3	1522980219	2	Thank you for this level of clarity. Without a doubt the most useful summary.
3	1522969356	1	Really! Can't wait.
3	1522969530	1	Haha shit I woudnt even be mad. 
3	1522980511	1	Lol
3	1522981784	1	Pretty much
2	1522986172	1	Welcome to the sub, you must be new here.
2	1522969677	1	story of every thread in this entire forum!
3	1522978607	2	You have to really act like you're hiding it though, like the Ark of the covenant. ... ü§£
1	1522967114	10	We all appreciate you 
1	1522968711	27	Congratulations, coinbase has just privatized the ICO. For those who were looking for crypto to be a currency - have you heard of anyone venture funding a currency? Seems like this tech is leaning towards asset/security investments in America.        EDIT:      Sorry I was hangry but now that I ate, let me see if I can be more clear..... What does this mean? I speculate:           1. Companies that start ICOs now have an investor that is specifically looking for cryptocurrency tech. That means if CB can be a trustworthy venture capitalist, other companies will follow suit. CB will attempt to be a measure of quality where quality cannot be measured  Example: you trust your friend makes good decisions and decides to jump off a cliff. Based on his experience of making rational decisions, you jump too.          2. There is no free lunch. I suspect that since CB is an exchange they will want exclusive rights to list said coin on their site for xx amount of time. They will also be first in line to buy the coin and sell it for a premium. Thereafter, the coin will make it to other exchanges.          3. Because everyone expects crypto to be a currency, it will destabilize the market for some time. People will pull out because it's not the same and new money will move in. It's not often that you can trade a stock or property for another stock or property without liquidating it. Venture capitalism doesn't happen to currencies HOWEVER there is no historic proof that venture funding currencies can work. I believe, however, that adoption as a currency will lb more difficult with this move in America. 
2	1522968894	3	they explicitly stated that they would not be seeding actual currencies, but the companies themselves. Whatever that means.
3	1522969011	2	I speculate it means you will hear more icos say they will be selling their first offer on coinbase, who will promptly take a cut. Good or bad, I'm not sure what this will do. 
3	1522984405	1	Mabye in the case when OmiseGo was starting out, it would mean that coinbase funds the parent company Omise rather than buying OMG from the ICO or presale.
4	1523007898	1	Vinny Lingham has talked about how this creates conflicts of interest between investors and coin holders. Who do you prioritize?
4	1523029284	1	Or funding Ripple directly instead of XRP. Yes.
1	1522984724	6	https://futurism.com/everything-coinbases-index-fund/‚ÄúAn individual must have a liquid net worth of at least $1 million (not counting the value of the home in which they live) or an earned income of at least $200,000 per year for the last two years ($300,000 together with their spouse). They also have to expect that their income won‚Äôt drop below that threshold in the next year.‚Äù
2	1522994337	8	More gating to keep this sort of investment locked up and exclusive to the already wealthy and kept away from the middle and especially lower class.This is the sort of horseshit I hope crypto would bring and end to honestly. This is basically accredited investor bullshit.
3	1522997280	3	Coinbase is up for the swing. Will they go for the home-run? The ball is flying towards coinbase. BUT WAIT, Coinbase turns around, grabs a bag of money and leaves the stadium!
3	1523008074	2	There's a movement to try and pool together funds to create one larger money stash investors can turn to.
1	1522968787	2	How do you apply, though?
2	1522968862	1	bruh i dont even know
1	1522972211	2	https://blog.coinbase.com/introducing-coinbase-ventures-c67865a1d2feIt sounds like they'll be investing in crypto oriented startups. I'd say they'll probably be picking companies from well-known accelerators.
1	1522973169	2	Doesn‚Äôt this present a conflict of interest?
1	1522970019	2	heh, I do not think this is the direction, based on a lunch I had with one of their first investors.It's one we've taken though.
1	1522970560	2	That was the big announcement? haha. Why on earth do they think we care?
1	1522968641	2	Sounds like more typical bullshit for whales to manipulate the market with. Yawn
1	1522970671	1	Time to buy Aeternity.
1	1522973129	1	Newbie here, what do you mean by seeding? Sorry if it‚Äôs a super dumb question!
2	1522974541	3	no worries buddy. you'll hear it all the time in regards to tech and tech company start-ups. Basically means giving the founders of an idea or product initial funding to hire the core team and get the company launched. so they get a shit ton of stock of course
3	1523010587	1	Thank you, much appreciated! :)
1	1522974639	1	Smart move.  They invest in the companies they like, then put them on CB app to pump up their value via exposure to the masses.  
1	1522993485	1	I know some of those words 
1	1522995515	1	Thank you so much. 
1	1523019304	1	Thanks for making it easier. 
1	1522967246	1	There are big ol' legal problems with investing if you're not an "accredited investor" (i.e. rich). There are some regulation crowdfunding investment sites like Wefunder that take bitcoin though.
2	1522967688	12	What is that retarded shit in the US dude? Is that some kind of "investing license"? What problem is that trying to solve, exactly? Poor people investing?
3	1522968360	18	The US thinks poor people are stupid so they don't deserve the investment opportunities rich people have
4	1522969263	7	I feel like the other commenter that pointed out the lotto was pretty spot on with the irony. The level that shit is marketed to the poor and how much money the state rakes in is ridiculous...
5	1522975833	2	Yeah isn't it funny how a poor person can blow 500 bucks on lotto tickets but not on an ICO? 
3	1522968154	5	You can't invest in private companies unless you make over $200k/year or have $2M in assets. So pretty much yeah.The idea was that they're 99% likely to lose all your money so it's not exactly a good idea, but lots of other bad ideas are legal.
4	1522969025	14	A poor person can buy a hundred lottery tickets a week and that‚Äôs fine. >:(
5	1522969119	1	This was improved in the US with the 2012 JOBS Act, and it's legal any countries ICOs are legal in (‚Ä¶ not the US), but I can tell you I've lost 100% on private investments so far. Might get some back in five years, we'll see.
4	1522972934	4	It's still $1 million in assets but you can't count your primary residence so you need $1 million on top of your house.  In a lot of ways it's good since idiots investing in shit like Bitconnect clearly exist, but it's also prettt obvious it keeps the rich richer.
4	1522974871	2	Is this a law?  Like, legal precedents?  
5	1522975534	2	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accredited_investor#United_States
4	1522973240	1	You must make $200k, or $300k if married, for the last 2 years
2	1522967430	3	yea. sad.at least big money moving in will hopefully up start the market again..
1	1522967456	1	This sounds bad.
2	1522967625	5	Not sure what the effect on us will be. Somewhat brings 'legitimacy' to crypto but its just a tool for the rich to get richer which wasn't the original purpose of crypto
0	1522956747	501	Please no more good news. The price has dropped enough already.
1	1522966441	75	‚ÄúCoinbase will now be offering Verge a fiat gateway!‚Äù
2	1522967702	12	AAAAAAAAAGH
2	1522976343	7	The donations made it possible! 
2	1522972219	3	I'd fucking cry. Don't do me like that Coinbase!
2	1522977278	1	Maybe that's finally enough to bring verge down for real.
1	1522959430	61	This is bad for Bitcoin.
2	1522985112	1	BTFD?
2	1522967427	1	This is good for Bitcoin
3	1522969775	7	i have no strong feelings one way or the other.
4	1522977455	2	It could be one of three things for bitcoin good,bad or it could mean nothing at all
1	1522967127	8	Price moves on rumor not news. 
2	1522968602	7	Buy the rumors, sell on the news
3	1522974920	1	God I wish I had heard this advice when Tron was at $.30
3	1522978269	1	Jesus if I hear that again on here..goddamn 
3	1523020798	1	When does rumor become news?
4	1523031183	1	The rumor becomes news when an official announcement or filing is submitted... or isnt.
1	1522962031	15	No we want it to drop more 
2	1522967846	10	`da bears`
1	1522964206	1	I wonder how happy the BCH hodlers are with their good news coinbase listing 
1	1522957900	0	Hahah this!! ^
0	1522958184	379	I hope he'll announce that Coinbase will finally respond to my emails.
1	1522960723	188	"We're pleased to announce that we've replied to some of ubudragon33's e-mails."
2	1522961600	39	And our answer is: ‚Äûyes, maybe not.‚Äú
3	1522966878	4	Yes. No. Maybe. Could you repeat the question?
4	1522966936	6	I would but...you're not the boss of me now

0	1522953480	81	The cynic in me: Won't it just be the formal roll out of the index fund?
1	1522956647	22	Or merchant integration that us crypto ppl know already :)
1	1522960941	10	Most likely something like this. It's definitely not a coin/token addition like everyone wants to think. 
1	1522971762	1	Wait, coinbase has an index fund? 
0	1522957721	67	Our customer service reply times will be going down from 3 months to 2 months due to us hiring a third customer service rep.

0	1522967754	17	Would be funny if he announces: *"Coinbase will be giving away 5000 ETH! Just send 0.5 to 4 ETH to [address] and you will receive 5 to 40 ETH!"*
0	1522955553	54	Maybe he's going to announce that they are not adding any new currencies at this time.
1	1522958423	17	He's going to make an announcement about a press conference to be held later in the week. In that press conference he will announce that.
2	1522960997	12	This isn't Tron ok

1	1522966951	2	I guess I don't understand what gives a coin regulatory uncertainty because he stated that all coins not on Coinbase right now have regulatory uncertainty and there are plenty of copies of coins that are on Coinbase already.
2	1522976201	1	Regulatory uncertainty implying that there is no definitive conclusion about whether many coins are labeled "Securities" or not. This is what troubled Bittrex and Bitfinix. Coinbase only carries LTC, BTC, ETH, and BCH which are all top coins with definitive non-security characteristics.

0	1522962947	3	They gonna do that thing again where they split a 5 minute interview into 3 parts and claim the news will "break the internet", where the actual content is just some general dribble we who follow this stuff have known for months?  
1	1522963538	1	Hey, they gotta sell those ads to us somehow!
0	1522963155	4	They are adding support for btc forks on coinbase. No new assets will be added at this time I know the future kthx check the time stamp

1	1522963942	3	jesus another non-announcement.
0	1522963889	3	Venture fund :(
0	1522956323	18	OMG added to coinbase?
1	1522959180	3	Looking at movement today, that and REP and ZRX.
0	1522960321	8	Is this the Verge partnership? Knew the team would deliver! OMG THANK YOU WALTON TEAMüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
1	1522971204	2	üí™üí™üí™üöÄüöÄüöÄ /s
2	1522971346	1	No way, not after yesterdays debacle and developer debauchery. 
0	1522957608	27	Delisting Bcash 
1	1522962231	-12	Sorry the entire industry is adding it.  Not removing it.  Might wanna figure out why before you keep saying stupid shit. 
2	1522987746	1	Beetcoin cash!!!
2	1522966262	1	K    https://www.worldcoinindex.com/news/bitcoin-cash-trading-pairs-disappearing-‚Äì-delisted-on-okex-and-kucoin
0	1522954787	14	In some of the more private groups I'm in people claim that they hear that OMG and BAT will get added as the first coins of Coinbase's erc20 expansion.
1	1522957843	6	Isn't it too early? The said in the coming months like a week ago.
2	1522961528	2	Yes, seems like that to me, too. Mind you this is just chatter. No idea how reliable or who the source is exactly.
1	1522957760	5	Armstrong has made comments about how he likes those and ZRX a lot. These are the most likely coins to be added in the near future. On the other hand, I would expect Armstrong to announce something like that himself. Hard to say what this announcement will be... maybe its nothing and CNBC just want to push their show.
0	1522957776	3	Anyone have a stream?
1	1522960480	1	Would like to know too
2	1522962082	1	http://www.freeintertv.com/view/id-2566Someone posted elsewhere. Not sure if there's something else specific to FastMoney 
1	1522962051	0	http://www.freeintertv.com/view/id-2566
0	1522958124	3	The announcement is going to be for a product that I can‚Äôt even use to begin with. 
0	1522958271	3	I betted on ZRX right when I saw this tweet..woo hooo
0	1522959754	3	Last time CNBC had a *HUGE* announcement they came out with index fund. Yawnnn
0	1522961071	3	Taking a page from Charlie Lee and saying they sold all their stock and how much they like Kraken.
0	1522962140	3	Here we go boys!
0	1522963197	3	So what was it?
1	1522967598	1	https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CBIDX
0	1522963686	3	where can i watch this live?
0	1522971046	3	Nano
0	1522953896	9	Request Network. 
1	1522957707	1	*crosses fingers*
0	1522955339	5	Again?  These Fast Money announcements are so full of shit that its not even funny anymore.
0	1522963832	4	See what I mean about this "community"?  All the roaches came out of the woodwork to hiss their shillcoin and/or put down "the enemy shillcoin" in the replies (because theirs is the shillcoin, not mine).  Here and on Twitter.
1	1522965362	3	Yup. Because everyone in this sub is a six month old baby in crypto. And rarely above age 22 in real life either.
0	1522964140	3	Hes going to announce their hiring one more customer service rep. You heard it hear first. 
0	1522953193	11	Pretty sure it‚Äôs an announcement that they will list Verge. Then they have an excuse for customer service.. ‚Äúit‚Äôs not on our side, it‚Äôs XVG and its shitcoin self‚Äù
1	1522953869	-2	yeah add a fkn coin that has major issues right now.
2	1522954088	5	You‚Äôre great with sarcasm. I bet you‚Äôre a real hit at parties. 
3	1522954461	10	the only thing hit at parties I attend is a pinata 
0	1522958208	2	they're going to launch stock trading to compete with robinhood.
0	1522961817	2	could be more than one as well
0	1522962562	2	still waiting on that
0	1522962925	2	Weakkk
0	1522962999	2	So Where's the news
0	1522967007	2	If this is anything good, you'll be able to tell because an altcoin will surge from the insider trading.
0	1522974839	2	So he didn‚Äôt announce anything. It was an ounce meant of an announcement 
0	1522982687	2	so, coinbase is pulling a Justin Sun ...
0	1522989761	2	And prices will continue to fall. 
0	1523028728	2	Anytime someone goes on a major news outlet for positive coverage, we should all be happy for crypto.
0	1522954283	7	Hop on the BAT train boys, choo choo
1	1522955289	4	That's what I was hoping for! Definitely too good to be true though.
2	1522955733	2	TBH i don't see them doing an ERC20 announcement right now. It's probably related to the index fund or something. But BAT WILL be one of the first.
3	1522956782	6	I am curious ...why BAT? I've got nothing against it... But no reason I think why it's one of the first 
4	1522958208	1	It's an ERC20 like they stated they intended to add, it fits the criteria; ie working product and utility and produced to comply with SEC securities regulations. Also the CEO of coinbase has publicly stated (on twitter) BAT is a coin he'd like to see added.
4	1522956910	0	Plenty of reasons. Check out their GDAX framework, and you'll see BAT fits better than any other ERC20.
5	1522958107	3	Are publishers actually utilizing BAT? its nice to speculate on the coin and all but I thought the whole point of BAT token was for advertisers to rewards users/publishers for their time? Where can I start earning BAT tokens? Im assuming advertisers first have to agree to be apart of this 
6	1522958428	1	Half the ecosystem is functioning. You can fund your Brave wallet yourself, or wait for anouther UGP promotion to distribute to publishers, but yes its already working, the last few pieces are mobile payments and ad trials, which are both coming in the next few months. Publishers are already seeing payouts from BAT contributions.
6	1522958547	1	Yep! Publishers have been receiving payments for a few months through BAT now! I have a BAT info website, [whatisbat.com](https://whatisbat.com) that has received funds through people reading and passively donating.In terms of advertisers paying users for their attention, that part isn't out yet. It's the 2nd half of the ecosystem slated to come online later this year. Woo~
7	1522958628	0	Ahhhhhhhh this helps explain a lot. I get it now. Thank you for the updates. I just opened the browser now and I see the payments tab. Very very interesting 
8	1522958820	1	No problem! Come join us in the BATProject sub if you have any questions. I run the dailies there :)
0	1522963325	2	How is bitcoin fork support a major announcement? I really hope there‚Äôs more.
1	1522963360	1	Typical coinbase failing to deliver
1	1522963423	0	Still can be more
1	1522963466	-9	More validation that bitcoin cash is a thing, and this industry supports because they support on chain scaling. Period.
2	1522963739	2	> Period.What on earth possessed you to spell out period? Its super cringe
0	1522952271	9	neo will be added to Coinbase 
1	1522959975	7	Dude, if that happened, I might probably drag my fat ass out in the yard and do a cartwheel. 
1	1522960904	8	Unrikery 
2	1522962184	4	Upvoted for casual racism
1	1522962759	1	It's too centralized to meet the CB requirements right now, but I think this is very likely in the future.
0	1522956788	4	OMG, BAT and RIPPLE 
1	1522961326	1	> RIPPLECoinbase is smart.  They'll go XLM!
1	1522959318	-5	> RIPPLEoh boy that would be awesome. Literally just bought some ripple this morning.
2	1522960773	-1	OMG BAT would be awesome. Literally just BAT some Ripple this morning.
2	1522962162	-2	Ripple is shot 
0	1522956877	2	ZRX is pumping! Insiders buying before Coinbase announcement?
1	1522958464	1	Could be true, ZRX roumor is here for a long time, got 200BTC volume in 20minutes
2	1522958687	1	yea this is crazy look at go..easy another 50% gain up until the announcement..
3	1522959180	0	Easy.

1	1522953043	11	DOGE
1	1522955108	15	Please stop. (And I'm an xrp holder)
1	1522955586	-1	unlikely
1	1522965986	1	Nah they tried to bribe their way, failed.
1	1522968316	0	you dumb 
0	1522966188	2	That random string of characters can't be a name

0	1522973330	1	HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHA this guy just decided he wants to sell a buncha tokens and make a fortune doing it so he's like oohhh yeahhh announcement!
0	1522979127	1	Minor service outage
0	1522986293	1	They are also allowing users to reap the benefits when btc forks. Coin announcements won't happen on Special Announcement broadcasts like this.  They will just do it like they did for BCH and LTC. I say by June-MidSummer we'll see a new coin. Not sure why people care so much, there are 6 other exchanges that allow fiat to crypto these days, plus Gemini is adding more coins. Abra and Coinmetro are two that are the best so far. 
1	1523007723	1	The addition of litecoin on Coinbase caused a huge price spike. That‚Äòs what people are hoping for - fast money. Nothing about accessibility
0	1522989637	1	This is a major announcement? The bar must be pretty low. Many companies in the space have been making strategic investments for years.
0	1522991655	1	Define "major"

0	1522953547	-1	xrp lets goooo
0	1522953006	-2	It has to be XRP being added to Coinbase.I‚Äôve never owned XRP and never liked the Ripple-XRP debate but that‚Äôs what it will probably be.
1	1522955418	4	But this is on CNBC, I dont think they would make announcements like that on Mainstream TV, it would have to be something the average person would understand like a partnership with a retailer or financial institution, or maybe some type of public listing.
1	1522953969	4	Support for ERC20 tokens is coming. I lean more towards adding popular ERC20 tokens to the books before a different platform. Ripple rumors have been alive forever.
1	1523019468	1	You're usually wrong about a lot of stuff, aren't you?
2	1523022393	1	You‚Äôre not thinking straight these days.You still having trouble sleeping?
3	1523023464	1	Poor reading comprehension, also. I help people with insomnia, I don't have insomnia myself. You were very obviously wrong about Coinbase's announcement. 
4	1523023695	1	Don‚Äôt have the time to go full stalker on you. Did I at anytime claim to 100% know what the announcement would be ?You must be one of those -85% guys
5	1523024746	1	You bought in the middle of 2017. You're a total noob. Stop trying to act like you're something you're not. You're apart of the mainstream third wave and 100% missed the boat. Pretentious twat. 
6	1523025737	1	Oooof triggered guy.Bought in mid 2017 and still doing better than you.You need some investment advice?I‚Äôd consider helping you out for free.
7	1523026061	1	Pretty big assumption there given I know your position and you have no idea what mine is. Typically, those who have been in the game for a long time (also people who are wealthy) don't go around bragging about it. There's free social advice for you. 
8	1523026326	1	Who bragged guy?Go back to checking Delta every 30 seconds. 
9	1523027117	1	You‚Äôre projecting, now. I‚Äôm way past the days of refreshing BLOCKFOLIO every 30 seconds because I made my money and don‚Äôt have anything to worry about. Best of luck for a 4th wave bull run. 
0	1522958482	1	Screw CNBC- just trying to grab some ratings. Screw Conbase-Won't give the people the tokens they want...push c r a p like Bitcon cash!  I want to see A D A, X r p and others. Keep your big wall street index fund and shove it where the sun Don't shine!  AZZZZHOLES!

2	1522980897	1	Ok genius, you clearly looked into this right? Thanks for the downvotes folks >During preliminary talks with Coinbase last fall, Ripple said it would be willing to lend the exchange more than $100 million worth of XRP to start letting users trade the asset, according to a person privy to that discussion. Ripple, without putting the proposal in writing, told Coinbase it could pay back the loan in XRP or dollars, the person said. If the exchange had chosen the latter, it could have profited had the tokens become more valuable upon being listed, the person said.Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-04/ripple-is-said-to-struggle-to-buy-u-s-listing-for-popular-coin
