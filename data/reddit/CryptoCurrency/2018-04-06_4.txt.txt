0	1522974749	611	First off, let me say that I'm a software engineer and I've been in crypto since 2013. I first discovered Bitcoin and after some research, realized that it had huge potential to change the word. Not too long after that, I discovered Ethereum and formed the same opinion when it was only a few dollars each. Not everybody buying EOS is clueless, new or chasing a pump. Your posts mentions nothing about the technology, the economics, the use cases or the governance of the project. Rather, it's a personal attack on somebody who is not even involved with the project anymore, so your entire post is irreverent. Nearly everything you wrote is incorrect. This shows that you know very little about the project, yet you still have formed an opinion based on your emotions. Rather than boycott a potential competitor to your investment, learn about it. Research it. If you still think that your investments are better choices than the competitor, great. If not, reconsider your current investments. No reason to boycott anything, just ignore it if you don't like it.&nbsp;>  But even if EOS was legit, who in their right mind wants to support a person like Brock Pierce?Nobody is supporting this guy. He's hasn't been involved with the project for a while now. He was gone even before the hit piece on Last Week Tonight. &nbsp;> an exit scam seems so much like the logical next step.The EOS 1.0 code was finished today, its open source on Github. There is no way for them to exit scam, because they don't have anybody's money. The EOS code is there. The dev team is not launching the chain, an independent community member is. EOS would still get launched and the tokens would be swapped to the chain automatically. There is no way for them to exit scam. They can walk away right now and nothing would change. It's a decentralized project. The dev team wrote the code and published it. That's it.&nbsp;> the last week show bit of James Oliver.It's Last Week Tonight by John Oliver, not James. &nbsp;> If a coin, that was created by a KNOWN scammer AND child molester The project was not created by Brock Pierce, not even close. It was create by Dan Larimer, the creator of Bitshares and Steemit. Also, the guy is not a "known child molester". He was never found guilty. Hell, he was never even charged. He was only accused. And even if you choose to stay away from EOS because some *accused* of this crime is involved, you should be aware that he was also the chairman of the Bitcoin foundation. &nbsp;> It's time to dump that shit, let it burn away so we don't ever have to speak about it againIf you are going to write up a post demanding action from people. You need to at least know what you are talking about. I mean you couldn't even be bothered to spell people's names correctly. &nbsp;^(Edit: Formating)
1	1522976635	59	For some reason I have to scroll all the way down here for the most level headed comment.Edit: My comment makes no sense now, looks like most people don't care for OP's shit.
2	1522979066	13	"For some reason"? Did you forget where you are? Lol 
3	1523010078	2	lol. I also smelled idiocy from the first sentence.
3	1522979939	3	Earth?
4	1522985867	5	reddit. 
2	1522990955	1	You know that new comments don't magically go to the top just because they are written well. They need time and upvotes. 
1	1522997596	3	Lovely reply. What’s your thoughts on flat earth theory and, separately, Verge XVG?
1	1522995340	6	Im french but you meant irrelevant? 
2	1523004015	1	> irreverentirreverent (adj) : showing a lack of respect for people or things that are generally taken seriously.
3	1523006227	3	ah OK ; but in the context I thought Irrelevant would make more sense :)We are talking about attack on the project - not the person ? 
4	1523009565	1	Yeah I agree in terms of project but the OP was attacking the person more than the project. In any case, you got a valid point :)
4	1523023117	1	Don't doubt your English – you are 100% correct. Irrelevant is what makes sense in the context (i.e. the whole post is based on invalid assumption). Irreverent would relate to the attitude of the person... in this context it doesn't make a lot of sense.
1	1522988071	6	Dude god damn **preach**. I just find it really ironic how they call supporters of the project sheep without having done the slightest research themselves to see that it is a legitimate project. Sure at the start of the ico it wouldve been right to be skeptical of it because who would ask investors to wait a year? But at this point when the code is out there, trying to call it vaporware is downright idiotic in it's own mind.
1	1522978709	17	Damn man how do you have the patience to talk rationally to these pathological retards? Respect. I’m almost all in on Cardano and I’ve seen a lot of good criticism of EOS, spent a fair amount of time bashing EOS myself. But this post has to be the single most retarded thing I’ve read on this sub. 
2	1523008645	2	Cardano isn't as scalable as EOS, and won't have dApps in time to beat EOS. If you have a problem with DPOS I'm all ears. I've spent a fair amount of time researching and would like my research challenged.
3	1523013820	2	My main concern with EOS is not DPoS per se. My second biggest hold is Ark, which is also DPoS. I think it is possible to do DPoS right.  What I don't like about EOS is how instead of transaction fees there is inflation, which delegates aren't distributing back to voters. This essentially devalues your stake in the system while making the delegates richer over time. The delegates have an incentive to collude and form a cartel (as it happened in Lisk, another DPoS system where it is essentially impossible to vote a bunch of delegates out). Cardano is very early in its development, so I don't know how you can say it isn't as scalable as EOS with so many parts of the final product missing. They are also not completely in the same market segment. Cardano will have high assurance smart contracts with run-time verification (IELE), permissioned blockchain, sidechains etc. it targets enterprise more than independent DApps developers. You will be able to earn staking rewards over time when joining a staking pool. There is also a hard cap on the supply. 
4	1523015097	1	> The delegates have an incentive to collude and form a cartel (as it happened in Lisk, another DPoS system where it is essentially impossible to vote a bunch of delegates out).Could you, please, elaborate on this Lisk point? 
5	1523016824	2	https://monivea.com/lisk-delegate-charts/Lisk has 101 delegates, but really if you look at the top, most of them are controlled by Elite and GDT. A quick search for elite on /r/liskdelegates and /r/lisk will show you they are not well loved by the community. https://np.reddit.com/r/LiskDelegates/comments/7e3cdy/liskelite_fighting_a_losing_war/ as they control such a large portion of the delegates and get a majority of the staking rewards, it is virtually impossible to get rid of them, even if the community has been trying for months to vote them out.
6	1523023433	1	Thanks, for the response.I had no idea. Seems like this is only going to end badly for Lisk. 
4	1523035260	1	EOS is definitely targeting enterprise as well. They do a lot of work with dApp developers but block.one strategy is to gain developer favor regardless of their status in enterprise or small business to gain traction and community adoption first.In fact, while this is not common knowledge EOS, there's a screenshot that circulated around recently that actually clarified what EOS stands for: Enterprise Operating System.
2	1522995859	-1	So hows that platform coming along?? Many Dapps on it yet?
1	1522984506	15	That was just a complete systematic dismantling. Bravo.
1	1522979628	8	I'm also a software engineer myself, and couldn't agree more :)I may be in the minority but I never paid any attention to Brock Pierce before I invested in EOS last October. Well, I suspect I didn't know of him at all at that time because I only read the whitepaper, watched extended interviews with Dan Larimer, and further researched relevant articles and tech analysis from various sites.So it was always the tech vision of EOS (or Dan, to be more precise) that solely attracted me to the project in the first place. And more recently, the announcement of $1B funds for dapps to be developed in the ecosystem further cemented my confidence in the project. So, as far as I am concerned, nothing has really changed and I still feel totally comfortable holding onto my entire EOS stack. (And if anything, EOS seems to have severed all association with Brock Pierce a while back, so why the commotion now?)
1	1523007496	4	OP's post sounds more like a hit piece from an ETH holder.
1	1522998371	2	+1lol @people investing based on feelings and JOHN OLIVERs comedy report - ROFL.I get the feeling OP is balls deep in Ethereum - probably bought around ATH and now people are saying EOS is new ETH (I think theyll co-exist) and his balls are getting sweaty.
1	1523016346	2	> Also, the guy is not a "known child molester". He was never found guilty. Hell, he was never even charged. He was only accused. And even if you choose to stay away from EOS because some accused of this crime is involved, you should be aware that he was also the chairman of the Bitcoin foundation.And there was a shitstorm about that Bitcoin foundation chairman thing too. From wikipedia"Pierce was elected Director of the Bitcoin Foundation in May 2014. Several members of the Bitcoin Foundation resigned after his election due to the previous allegations of sex abuse against Pierce. The organisation announced its insolvency in July 2015"Here is a documentary about his, non crypto related, pasthttps://vimeo.com/142444429I dont know how this guy keeps getting involved with shit. My personal theory is that he is just the face for a pedophile venture capital and he approaches shit and who can say no to money.Here is a popular reddit thread on /r/documentaries about this documentary https://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/6cbi7c/an_open_secret_2014_an_investigation_into_rampant/
2	1523027415	1	This is what I don't understand, how a project can even consider someone like this as their spokesperson. 
1	1523026603	2	As a developer, have you looked at EOS source code? I am curious to get a technical perspective on the project.
1	1522982207	7	Thank you. I couldn't care less about Brock Pierce. I'm betting on EOS, not Piercecoins.Don't give in to all the FUD.
2	1522991979	1	And other people are betting on the wall, not Trump.  Whatever.  EOS is associated with evil.  Did you really find the other 1300 coins to be bad investments?
3	1523008815	1	The wall is not decentralized open source tech. Brock has nothing to do with the project. How is it associated with evil? Is Bitcoin associated with evil too?99% of those coins are bad investments, yes. There's no other tech like EOS, I've looked. It's the only platform I'd use to host my dApp.
3	1523016836	1	Associated with evil? Blockone is evil now?That's... Special.Also, I'm not sure how you can associate investing in eos with electing Donald Trump for president, but okay. It's pretty much like saying you're a bad person for buying mcdonalds because some cashiers ended up being murderers and pedos.
1	1522982195	3	> Nobody is supporting this guy. He's hasn't been involved with the project for a while now. He was gone even before the hit piece on Last Week Tonight. I think it's more that they showed the lack of judgement to hire him in the first place.
2	1522996455	0	Exactly, but he wasnt hired, he FOUNDED EOS, he created EOS, together with his partners. He was the one who did the hiring. And he wasnt gone before the hit piece, he was ousted because of the hit piece. Likely, it wasnt even a month ago that he still had his role in EOS and people act as if im talking about ancient history.Anyways, the fact that Dan wanted to work with a scumbag like Brock and even let Brock do all the PR for EOS (and Brock only using buzz words for that matter, or showing his unicorn wedding), just says enough about Dan (lack of) judgement right there. 
3	1523009076	-1	Why should we hang someone who hasn't even been charged with a crime?
1	1522989478	1	You're not talking about the tech either tho. Why should we invest in it? 
2	1522991265	8	> Why should we invest in it?Well that's up to you whether you invest in something or not. There's plenty of information out there. He was just calling OP out for being a retard he wasn't promoting EOS.
2	1522991752	2	His comment is not about why should invest in it. 
3	1522993350	1	That's why I'm asking
4	1522994187	3	You said that he is not talking about the tech 'either tho'. As if he should be. 
5	1522994872	0	I just feel like to reinforce their argument he/she should bring up at least one thing about the tech to prove OP wrong if he/she feels that the tech outperforms the FUD about eos and the connection to Brock OP claims should be the driving factor for you NOT to invest in eos.Edit: a word
6	1522996836	3	But the basis of his comment was not to shill EOS. He was simply pointing out his errors. An issue here is that people feel that others need to define what 'side' they are on. Sure, he's probably a supporter of EOS given his reply but he clearly isn't here to try and get people to buy it.Also, along the lines of people needing to define which group they belong to, I bet people assume I'm an EOS supporter. I'm not. Just simply stating what I'm seeing, just like the guy above is. Just in case someone feels a need to ask me why they should invest in EOS too. 
6	1523008971	1	There's an EOS subreddit, EOS Telegram channel, and you can look at the code yourself on Github to see if you think it's a good investment.
1	1522997872	1	I think EOS is pretty cool although personally I don't believe Dpos is perfectly decentralized. Sidenote, this Brock Pierce is class A scam in the venture community, although I can't say that everyone agrees.
2	1523009210	1	It's more decentralized than 5 mining pools owning 70%+ of the hash power. There's 21 block producers who need the support of EOS holders or they will get voted out.
3	1523028897	1	Don't compare with PoW, compare with other PoS
1	1523008642	1	> Your posts mentions nothing about the technology, the economics, the use cases or the governance of the project.best possible TL;DR for what the OP posted
1	1523017750	1	>There is no way for them to exit scam, because they don't have anybody's money. Wut
2	1523020664	1	Do your research. 
1	1523026816	1	Love the response, it's really straight on point and not shilling a little bit, straight cold truth there.
1	1522980921	1	Thank you for taking the time to lay out some actual sense for the innocent readers who might think OP actually knows what he's talking about.
1	1522990948	1	man, logical responses that burn OP at the same time are very fun to read.
1	1523003228	1	> The EOS 1.0 code was finished today, its open source on Github. There is no way for them to exit scam, because they don't have anybody's money. How false is this statement - how can they NOT have anybody money???!!!! people are sending ETH daily in huge portions!!!!!Also, your comment about firing BROCK PIERCE is non-sense. If you are fucked up scammer you don't hire such people in first place. It does not have anything to do with the decision to hire him. But yea - invest more - everybody investing in eos will lose money hard. That is a simple fact. 
2	1523015284	1	!RemindMe 6 months
1	1522978402	-2	Ya there’s a big difference between being charged with a crime, and being accused online. I would think if that many of his coworkers were charged, he would of got charged too if it was true. Plus if he actually did do anything to the boys, they would of said who, and he would of been charged.  Actually, the fact he wasn’t charged kind of helps. Why you so mad OP? Did he finger your bum and get away with it?
2	1522984443	2	I'm sorry for being a grammar naxi, but the phrase is "could have" and not "could of". 
2	1522995145	0	First off, he settled with one case for 21k. Second, what he has been accused of his drugging children then convincing them to have sex with older men. He ran DEN, the children who got abused where actors for DEN. He couldve said something like 'a new pilot is going to be aired and we want YOU to be the new lead, there is just one thing you have to do...'. Sickening to be honest.Here you go: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-foundation-resignations/bitcoin-foundation-hit-by-resignations-over-new-director-idUSBREA4F02B20140516> Some of the members cited Pierce’s troubled past. That includes allegations in lawsuits from three employees of Pierce’s first company, bankrupt web video business Digital Entertainment Network, that he provided drugs and pressured them for sex when they were minors. > “The allegations against me are not true, and I have never had intimate or sexual contact with any of the people who made those allegations,” Pierce told Reuters via email. Court records show 33-year-old Pierce, who played the title role in Disney’s “First Kid,” paid more than $21,000 to settle one employee suit, and he said others dropped their claims without money changing hands. If you arent guilty, why would you settle for 21k?Go watch this: https://vimeo.com/142444429This is the document that exposed the child abuse in Hollywood. Im 99% sure after watching this your opinion will be changed about that scumbag. Like i said in my post, a child actor even took his own life eventually because what happened.
3	1523001721	1	So a guy that used to be part of a coin was fired and has nothing to do with the coin anymore, and did not invent the coin (which I think he did for some weird reason), AND you want all 14 people reading this to not buy eos?This ain’t gunna do shit to eos. You can’t stop nothing. Your wasted effort is pitiful. 
4	1523004886	0	He owns the company that owns EOS. He even owns the venture that owns that company. He is still heavily involved with EOS, he just isn't a public figure anymore. Snap out of your dream world dude. 
5	1523018308	1	Brendan Blumer is the founder and CEO of Block.One. Dan Larimer is the creator of Eos. Stop spreading fud because one person formally was associated with a company was accused of something that he was never charged with much less convicted of. I personally think Brock Pierce is a moronic weirdo but I also think that eos will be one of the best things that ever hit the crypto space being a developer who is intimately knowledgeable of Larimer's previous projects and having followed the development of Eos from the beginning. 
5	1523007942	1	Me snap out of my dream world? You are the pathetic individual that thinks posting your personal hate will ruin a multi billion dollar market cap from 4 pissed of redditors. 
2	1522992061	-1	Go watch An open secret. That's how I knew about DEN and Brock Pierce. It wasn't Brock Pierce who did the main molesting but he did brought little boys to pool parties (since he himself was 17 - 18 years old). He may or may not have molested them himself, he was the one who organised it. And you can all say whatever you like, it doesn't change the fact that Brock pierce is a known scammer from the dot.com era and he founded EOS, and even while this was public knowledge, people still bought the ico, and this guy collected - once again - millions of dollars. The only reason Brock pierce got booted was because of the last week tonight show. And you may go all pedantic on small details of my post, that still doesn't say shit. If you supported EOS you have supported BrockPpierce and you all are just greedy fucks, throwing away your moral just because you think it will make you rich. 
3	1522994266	0	Right because you were so bothered about Brock pierce you bring this up now, close to EOS launch, but chose to say shit 20 years ago or at the start of EOS IO, or when you watched this documentary.Ever considered at 17 Brock may have been the victim?He's just an initial investor who has also given millions to charity.
4	1522996207	2	EOS wasnt even on my radar up until the last week tonight show, then i saw that scumbag again from an open secret. Like many others, i didnt research in to it before. Also to be honest, i still dont follow EOS and besides the claims of 'blockchain 3.0' and what not, i havent investigated in to it before and im definitely not going to start now. After seeing the piece by John Oliver all that was left with me were the emotions i felt watching An open secret, how disgusted i was with Brock Pierce and his partners and how it baffled me that this guy just could go on, has infiltrated the cryptospace and had his own ICO, which was successful and even a top 10 coin by now. I then noticed people didnt knew who he was, what his past was, and i felt i should tell the people.Also stop downgrading his involvement, he was a co-founder of Block.one and EOS, he was the main marketeer of EOS, he did a lot of promotion for EOS, he wasnt 'just an initial investor'. If it wasnt for John Oliver, he still wouldve been 'chief strategic officer' (or w/e) of EOS. EOS was forced to publicly denounce Brock but im 99% Brock still is heavily involved with EOS. It is his baby and the way things go in corporate is that you get fired from one position and hired in another. He even can be both independent AND working for EOS (as an advisor), still maintaining his influence. And at this point, i dont give a flying fuck about the tech anymore. Like another user said here, people wanted a wall and less immigrants, now they got Trump as president. Does the cause really justify the tools? In my opinion NOT. And it was purely coincidence that i brought this up so close to the EOS launch, but secretly i am glad - people deserve to know who was behind EOS. The same as people should know that Maduro is behind the Petro coin, people should know that Brock Pierce was behind the creation of EOS. Even if Maduro says he is no more affiliated with the petro coin, will it dismay the stain he has caused on that token?
5	1522997760	0	So you haven't investigated it before, nor do you intend to yet you write a post on r/cryptocurrency asking people to boycot it - insanity!I have also watched the documentary which is very disturbing. No one can be 100% sure what happened, my interpretation is that Brock was used and abused by the others and is a victim in this. He was 17, imagine yourself at that age.This was 20 years ago and has nothing to do with EOS!I don't believe you are dong this out of 'duty' you are doing it to 'FUD' and for your own financial gain. Get of your moral high horse.
6	1522998255	2	Your interpretation is bullshit, based on nothing. The fact that he was accused and even settled says a lot more then your interpretation. If he was a victim himself, he would've sued too. Fleeing the country is not an act of someone who was a victim in all of that.And why would i investigate further on, after realizing a scumbag like Brock Pierce is involved? Thats like further investigating in Saddam Hussein to see if his policies actually were as bad or not, while knowing that he used chemical weapons and he was a brutal dictator. Why would i want to do that?>This was 20 years ago and has nothing to do with EOS!HE CO FOUNDED EOS. How can that have nothing to do with EOS when he was at the very start of the project, endorsing it all the way up until feb/march 2018. And even if it was 50 years ago, that doesnt change the fact that it happened. Hell some old nazi commanders still get trialed for their acts, 30-50 years after the act purely because how evil their acts were. They dont just fade away in time, definitely not now the internet is here.Also:>I don't believe you are dong this out of 'duty' you are doing it to 'FUD' and for your own financial gain. Get of your moral high horse.What? So first for my own financial gains, afterwards its because of my moral high horse? How would i actually benefit from this? Shorting EOS? I dont even think my post will have that much influence on EOS pricing to be honest, BUT i do not want to endorse a coin that was brought to the world by such a scumbag of a person and i think people have the right to know the truth behind EOS. So many delusional people right here and when confronted with the truth, they just make up their own to justify their own believes. 
7	1522999470	1	Saying he co-founded EOS is semantics, Brock had no developmental input in to the project at all.Your Saddam Hussein and Nazi comparisons just further totally invalidate your claims. Its is actually disgraceful you can say this, yet you claim moral superiority.
1	1522997403	0	> Your posts mentions nothing about the technology, the economics, the use cases or the governance of the project. Rather, it's a personal attack on somebody who is not even involved with the project anymore, so your entire post is irreverent.First off, he founded EOS. He was one of the masterminds behind the project, how that isnt irrelevant is beyond me. Also its irrelevant so .Secondly, they announced his retirement from his role at EOS, he still is in 'transitioning' and they even says he is going to be an independent 'community builder' and focusing on 'investment activities'. To me this reads that he is far from being done with EOS, he might not become a public figure anymore, but an independent advisor role most likely still is a possibility (though i have zero proof of this).Also, EOS themselves lied about Brock Pierce involvement right here:> Brock Pierce was an early advisor to Block.one for several months and made significant contributions to the awareness of the EOSIO project. He wasnt an early advisor, he CO FOUNDED Block.one AND EOS. Now about this:> The project was not created by Brock Pierce, not even close. It was create by Dan Larimer, the creator of Bitshares and Steemit. The project itself might have been created by Dan, it was Brock Pierce that actualized it - without that scumbag EOS wouldnt have existed OR they would have to find another source of capital injections. Here you go:https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/17/blockchain-capital-raising-150-million-for-two-funds.html> Blockchain Capital was founded in 2013 by brothers Bart and Bradford Stephens along with Brock Pierce, chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation. And then:https://disruptive.asia/block-one-eos-cryptocurrency/>Block.one calls the sale of EOS a “token distribution.” The company wants EOS to be used by large businesses, enabling corporations to automate processes, monitor assets, and create multiple applications.> Brock Pierce, co-founder of block.one, told Reuters that EOS aims to be the foundation for business applications in the blockchain world.> The token sale will take place over a one-year period on Ethereum, another blockchain-based currency, and some 1 billion tokens would be sold over 341 days starting on June 26, Pierce said.Now about this part> Also, the guy is not a "known child molester". He was never found guilty. Hell, he was never even charged. He was only accused. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-foundation-resignations/bitcoin-foundation-hit-by-resignations-over-new-director-idUSBREA4F02B20140516> “The allegations against me are not true, and I have never had intimate or sexual contact with any of the people who made those allegations,” Pierce told Reuters via email. Court records show 33-year-old Pierce, who played the title role in Disney’s “First Kid,” paid more than $21,000 to settle one employee suit, and he said others dropped their claims without money changing hands. He settles for one, the other charges got dropped. His buddies at DEN though, they did get charged. Go watch this documentary and tell me again how it only was 'accused':https://vimeo.com/142444429About the rest, i can give you credit. I never invested further on in to EOS tech, but then again why in the world would i? The moment i knew about Brock Pierce involvement, the fact that your glorious Dan knew about him yet still wanted to work with him, says enough to me. If you condone it, you are a part of it, just with murder - if you dont report it you are an accessory to it. Lets also not forget that DEN was a huge scam, that Brock Pierce and his buddies were spending other people money on drugs and pool parties with little boys and not in the venture itself. Even if EOS is fully open sourced, hell even if its truly an ethereum killer, i will never endorse it and if you have ANY morale, you shouldn't either. But i know, greed is a powerful thing, and some are just lost in it.
2	1522998818	8	Absolute bullshit - mastermind behind EOS, actualized it! You are literally guessing. Mastermind behind EOS = Dan Larimer.Of course EOS would have existed without Brock! Dan Larimer created two of the three most used blockchains in existence today. You think he couldn't afford to launch without Brock!You are just using an event 20 years ago, of which the individual was found not guilty, to fit your narrative.Just because someone 'settles' it doesn't mean you are guilty any more than 'not guilty' proves you are innocent.
3	1522999390	1	He NEVER was not found guilty, the accusations never went to court, they got dropped AND he settled with one. His partners werent so lucky though. Also why did he fled to Spain again then? Because he wasnt guilty?> Of course EOS would have existed without Brock! Dan Larimer created two of the three most used blockchains in existence today. You think he couldn't afford to launch without Brock!Doesnt matter, Brock Pierce still co founded both block.one AND EOS. That is a fact. Why did he need Brock then? Why in godsname would Dan work with Brock then? Simply, he needed him but dear god i wish it wasnt so, because EOS IS stained, Dan wouldve done good to just fork EOS, create a new company and continue working, this time fully distancing himself from Brock Pierce. SO while you say Dan Larimer is the mastermind behind EOS, Brock Pierce still is the co founder of it and Dan Larimer most likely has been working beneath Brock Pierce and his partners of Blockchain Capital. They never shouldve endorsed him, thats the biggest problem. Now the internet is full with videos of Brock Pierce spewing bullshit while trying to endorse EOS, like this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNg9Jfcru7c
4	1523010151	2	"He NEVER was not found guilty" special kind of retard.
4	1522999897	3	Last response to you - you are have clearly beyond reason.Brock Pierce has done a lots for Blockchain and is an expert, which is obviously why he was involved.Your last paragraph is just insane - Dan working for Brock haha right. I actually agree they should never have risked using Brock for endorsement and this was always going to happen.Still I imagine they know Brock as a person who has changed a lot since 20 years ago when he was manipulated by powerful people in the entertainment industry.
2	1523011478	1	> Also its irrelevant so "You need to at least know what you are talking about. I mean you couldn't even be bothered to spell correctly". See how easy it is to do that? Did i now make your whole post 'irreverent' too? No i didnt.irreverentɪˈrɛv(ə)r(ə)nt/adjectiveadjective: irreverent    showing a lack of respect for people or things that are generally taken seriously.    "she is irreverent about the whole business of politics"maybe calm down just a bit and actually read something?
1	1522996105	0	I agree, there's quite a number of nice, polite, intelligent and well informed people in the EOS crowd, and perhaps they even believe that their underlying assumptions are correct.Then there is also a very large segment of douches there, and unabashed shills and various assorted scum.What bothers me about EOS is not how much the product is or may be solid or better. I know that it is far from vaporware. What I find disturbing there are precisely said underlying assumptions. You can't just strap DPOS like that. All things considered, Bitcoiners to me are beginning to look like good guys when I put them next to EOS, to be quite honest.
1	1522991538	-1	Dude.Awesome reply.
1	1522992171	-1	this is why i always read the top comments on reddit posts
1	1522988217	-2	Frankly nobody seems to be involved in EOS anymore. No updates, no new features for a while.
2	1522989630	2	You're trolling right?  Dawn 3.0 was just released.  
3	1522991711	0	lol, ok, missed that. That happened less than 24 hours ago right? Had been looking at EOS and Block.one pages just last week and thought 'wow, not a lot going on with EOS these past weeks/months'. Guess there's some news now :)
0	1522974722	38	So do you have any good technical arguments against EOS to explain why the technology is bad? Go ahead and call me a shill, but that's not a valid argument.
1	1523027392	2	Heres one: DPoS relies on coin holder voting. There are only 21 block producers and they are voted into their positions by the coin holders. If a block producer tries to cheat in some way, they will be voted out and lose their position. These 21 block producers run the network and provide the computation and resources needed. In exchange for providing this service, they are payed by newly created coins, much like miners are in PoW. Since all of the newly created coins are going to block producers, their stake becomes larger and so does their voting power. After being a block producer for quite a while, they may accumulate enough coins to vote for themselves and win. This would allow them to solidify their position as block producer indefinitally. If each of the block producers teamed up, accumulated coins from the block rewards and voted for eachother, they could take over the network. This is why its importsnt to keep inflation and the block reward as low as possible. 
1	1523032612	1	Pretty much what I've been thinking, this is just a personal attack.
0	1522969104	140	>I'm of course talking about Brock Pierce.but... they fired him.
1	1522973042	51	"Sadly a lot of people who invest in crypto are sheep who hardly do any research at all. " He must have stopped doing research a few weeks ago. 
1	1522982431	19	> but... they fired him.I don't feel strongly about EOS either way but this is a weak argument.   A basic google search would have turned up information about his sketchy background, yet they still hired him.  That reflects poorly on them in my opinion
2	1522984053	10	What was his role with the company?? Who in their right mind would let this walking pr disaster anywhere near their company??
2	1522983194	3	I agree wholeheartedly.
3	1522987297	1	Ah, I seem to have misinterpreted your comment
4	1522987471	4	No, you were spot on and I agree with you.I don't support EOS in any capacity and agree that the company firing him was a seriously weak move.They should have done their homework before partnering with him and terminating their relationship with him immediately following John Oliver was weak and showed no conviction or loyalty in any capacity.My whole point above was simply that this entire post is relatively useless. They've already moved past Brock.You make a much stronger point than OP and that should be the context of the main post in entirety, simply referencing Brock as an example of why these guys are incompetent.
1	1522971202	70	exactly why this post is useless
2	1522972138	6	I'm all for witch hunts, but citing Wikipedia then quoting it in the original post seems like* a.) a really shitty source* b.) better quote this text before someone changes it.  It's Wikipedia, after all.The guy sounds like a scumbag.  Surely there are better sources to present to convince people.
3	1523002168	1	Wikipedia isn't the same as 10 years ago as if you correct it other people have approve it and you provide source material too. Saying citing Wikipedia is wrong, is dumb. Go look at the sources which are used in the  Wikipedia page (which is fortune and Reuters) not just the name of Wikipedia itself. 
4	1523022409	2	Thank you for updating me on Wikipedia, but why don't you just cite those sources yourself?
2	1522974330	4	Idk EOS dumping a bunch of the ETH they got for fiat isn't the greatest
3	1522981437	4	but why would they hold the ETH? (serious question)
3	1522974548	1	Gotta hedge against volatility somehow. Or is your issue the fact that they didn't slowly get rid of it? Because their token sale is also still ongoing.
4	1522974673	6	Slowly getting rid of it would have been alot nicer, but they would want to make it seem like ETH is dying leading up to the EOS "release" anyways. I wonder if there will actually be a project continuing after Dan leaves this one.
5	1522994635	1	Well actually if you research transactions from the eos crowdsale address, they have been selling at regular intervals since the start.Guessing you have fallen for this buying their own coin and crashing ETH fud.You have to buy EOS with ETH in the first place therefore its zero sum trading. Any ETH sold by eos has to have been purchased in the first place so has no effect on price.
6	1523031555	1	Well, you're not *totally* wrong...
3	1522976694	-1	They need fiat to pay for development...they have a fuck ton of Eth...I would dump a good portion as well to guarantee continued operations.
4	1522984110	0	They could have done that overtime, not near at once
5	1522984209	1	It's their choice to spend their funds when they want. 
6	1522984457	-1	Plus I assume they want to get as much out as possible before regulation starts coming around.
2	1522978208	4	> exactly why this post is uselessFound the EOS bagholder.  Boom!See how I did that?  
3	1523029196	1	relax, I only invest *other people's* money. which bank are you at? it might be yours ;)
2	1522971869	-2	No its not he likely still owns it and pumps it
3	1522972316	1	does it matter? the banksters pump and dump the mainstream market, you gonna stop using the dollar? gold? silver?it's more important that we're building a censorship resistant chain software that other services can operate on most effectively. the market will determine the price of the token as the demand increases or decreases based on the software's viability. competition is important for innovation, "boycotting" is only effective if there is a majority unified through a unique moral cause.Crucifying one guy who has nothing to do with the technical capability of this software is pointless and frivolous. Do your own research and find out if these words mean anything to you. Continue to post, expression of thought is useful. 
4	1522973403	1	ermagerds the banksters!Banksters and Globalists and anarchy, oh my!
4	1522985501	-1	Why invest my time into eos when eth clearly has traction way beyond eosEos is centralized and had baggage man. It also dumped btc and eth at lows slapping its own investors in the faceEos is massively overvalued and has years of catch up to do 
5	1522994828	2	Absolute rubbish. Check eos crowdsale address transactions. Eos has been selling eth for months, no one was moaning in Jan. 
6	1523024766	-1	EOS is vapor ware..Hoping to create interest with non stop posts this weekETH like BTC and LTC are executing in real life and delivering value already for years and have TRACTION, their networks have also been stress tested in real life unlike EOS who is a virgin overvalued ico still
7	1523027187	1	Non stop posts where?You are right about all three, doesn't mean eos is vapor.It may well be overvalued but it launches in 57 days. Not long to find out.
8	1523028545	0	big deal it launches!!! it needs to actually work and be stress tested for years let alone actually add value to anyonethat is HARD HARD WORK. Meanwhile my ETH is a screaming buy here and not reliant on any 1 thing to make it successful, It also like btc has a track record of success and antifragileness
9	1523029424	1	Cant tell me where the non-stop posts are?In the real world stuff is made, later on different versions are made, you dont have a point.There is the answer to your rage 'my ETH' you have a weird personal attachement to it obviously. I also hold ETH and think its a brilliant proven tech and Vitalik is the boss. However ALL (i can use captials too) of your anti EOS points are just incorrect or made up.
1	1522982212	9	But they would have already known about all this stuff. It's nearly impossible for them not to have known. Firing him was just to save face. That makes it worse, IMO.
2	1522982311	2	I agree 100%.
1	1522971797	9	Okay.  But why hire a guy like that in the first place?  It doesn't look like they're vetting people they hire very well.

4	1523029387	1	I never said your agenda was bad. I simply said it disagreed with the facts as stated. Regardless. Stop trying to be a white knight. Save yourself first. Release the anger. 
5	1523030315	1	Well there is a lot to be angry at in the world today, things much worse than you trying to recoup your losses from EOS by tricking ignorant redditors into pouring their hard earned money into a project that is very unproven at this point. That being said...I don't have to be angry to try and stop you.A white knight is someone who tries to side with feminists in a pathetic attempt to get pussy. I strongly dislike feminists, and I'm married so.... You will have to try harder to insult me.

7	1522980185	1	As long as CMD is a governance token and MEMES are the gas that fuels the smart contracts, I don't think we should airdrop, we should ICO at $420.69.

Yeah...That should put our companies value at a modest 3 billion.

1	1522982487	3	Because he was still hired in the first place.  Don't have a strong opinion on EOS either way but that's not a good look
1	1523002995	3	'some time ago', first off, two weeks ago he still was in transition, we don't know if he already was fired. Second, he wasn't fired at all, he and his partners choose to let him let go of his current role in the company, he now is 'independent' but still working as a community builder and investor. He most likely still is deeply connected to EOS though, since he co founded it (which is the reason he can't be really fired too). Another thing is, he co founded EOS and did the main promotion. You don't find much videos about Dan talking about EOS but YouTube is filled with videos about Brock pierce and his involvement. My point is, the EOS team endorsed this prick and used him for marketing knowing fully well he had a history of scamming and even allegations of child molestation. If ether co founded by Assad, and after videoes arising talking about Assad past (and even present), Vitalik then announce that Assad now goes as an independent community builder, what would you think about Ether? Seriously because this is the exact scenario that's has played out with EOS. 
0	1522973647	24	>Lately I've been on a crusade against EOSIt's a rare thing when someone comes out and admits that they have a political agenda in the very first sentence of their giant wall of FUD. Thank you for your consideration.
1	1522991343	2	Chuckled, thanks
1	1523002670	0	I don't have anything to hide. Go look through my history of you like. I'm being honest at least. Also political agenda? You flatter me more then I deserve, I made this post because Brock Pierce is a piece of shit and he (co) founded EOS, thus EOS is co founded by a piece of shit and is a product of a piece of shit and I think people should be made aware of it. I don't hold EOS, I never had, nor will I ever. I don't hold ADA either (which is the prime competition id say) but I would edorse ADA purely because I like Charles and his way of thinking. EOS though, the team of EOS never should let Brock Pierce anywhere near their project, let alone use him to promote EOS, giving all kinds of weird interviews and presentations. 
2	1523033723	0	> I made this post because Brock Pierce is a piece of shit There are plenty of pieces of shit in this world, many of whom have actually been convicted of the crimes that they've been accused of.

If you're suggesting that the entire project, all of its team members, and all of its potential should be thrown into the trash bin because of a past connection with a guy who has a shady history, you're not a reasonable or rational thinking person. tl;dr fuck off with your childish witch hunt. 
0	1523030584	11	You, my friend, are delusional if you think EOS is a scam. I understand your frustration with Brock Pierce(A person that hasn't been involved on EOS for a while), but that doesn't mean you can hide the real potential this project has to offer. You my friend are a major FUD
1	1523030998	0	To be honest, I don't care if the project is legit or not. I have a strong resentment towards Brock Pierce. DYOR they say, well do some research on Brock Pierce. Things go far deeper then I original posted here. Brock Pierce OWNS EOS, it's his company that owns EOS, and he even owns the company that owns the company that owns EOS (blockchain capital > block.one > EOS). So by helping and funding EOS you are directly also helping him. If EOS becomes a multi billion to trillion succes, you will be making Brock Pierce (and his associates) extremely rich. That is what concerns me. People go mad about the Petro coin because of Maduro, yet people don't care about a slimebag like Brock Pierce? 
2	1523031732	0	If you don't care about the project then this is all a personal issue that you have. I don't care if Brock Pierce did what people conspire that he did, the charges were dropped because of lack of evidence. Still, I wouldn't give two shits about the guy, the technology is revolutionary. If you seriously think EOS is going to tank because of this guy you are wrong and delusional. Read more about the technology and less of conspiracy theories.
0	1522972288	44	The fuck are you even talking about.  Brock Pierce is not the founder of EOS, hes actually been removed from the project entirely -  he was an early investor.  Dan Larimer is running the EOS show.  I'm not even invested in EOS but you are a fool.
1	1523003237	0	He Co founded EOS, and he co founded block.one. these are well known facts. He even co founded blockchain capital, the company behind block.one and EOS and he still is part of that venture. That's why saying he left the EOS team is the biggest red haring there is. He owns part of the company that owns the company that is behind EOS.
1	1522975636	-1	That's not how fudding works. Find a talking point no matter how dated or miss-informed it is, and hammer that point like OP just did. 
0	1522969313	41	First of all, why bring up Brock pierce at all? If you actually researched about EOS and Brock pierce you would know he was never an essential part of the EOS team. It was a publicity stunt, and I have to admit the biggest mistake by block.one. EOS can not be declared a scam for such pity and stupid reasons. If you knew anything about the development team or Dan Larimer (who is literally one of the most accomplished and reputable people in the crypto space) or did research that goes beyond what is seen on mainstream media you would know better. I know I will probably get downvoted, because where better to attack someone with an opposing view, but this is exactly what these threads have become. You guys can go ahead and continue shilling your coins and talking shit about others. But at least DYOR and don't listen to John Oliver alone.Edit: Btw John Oliver's team was contacted by block.one directly after that was aired because it was obviously going to be bad rep. They admitted that the show intended to be for comedy purposes only, and that they were'nt experts on the matter. It wasn't meant to actually describe EOS. It was just an easy target to hit on during all this hype in the world.I'm also a fan of John Oliver and his segment. He did a good job explaining for newbies, but if you don't even understand behind what is happening on & off screen, how can you truly be woke when it comes to the future of our world.Edit 2: You can also bet that all these 'celebs' your looking at are all just pawns in a bigger game. Used by the government, higher power, companies, etc.. They want money and probably participate in these market crashes. They don't care about you and I or how we invest our money.Edit 3: HA I just laughed re-reading your post. (Last few sentences you typed) EOS was not created by Brock pierce! Wtf lol
1	1522973918	9	Just as an fyi, when we did DD on them during the private sale of their token, they couldn't stop crooning about Brock was the only reason this was happening, he was the company, and he was going to change the world with EOS.Ultimately, we passed.
2	1522976862	4	Were you under the impression Brock is abandoning EOS? Because he's not.
3	1522987034	5	Oh hell no, he's still balls deep in it and making it squeal like it should have swiped right.They're just saying he's not anymore.
2	1522982686	1	Can you back this claim up with any evidence
3	1522986903	1	Sure.
4	1523002700	1	i definitely want to see please
1	1523003531	0	Brock owns (partly) blockchain capital, that venture created block.one (Brock co founded block.one) and EOS is the product of block.one. Dan is nothing more then a worker of block.one, he is NOT a co founder of either blockchain capital OR block.one. He may be the Mastermind behind EOS and the head of it's team, just like WhatsApp has its own development team, it's part of Facebook, EOS is part of block.one which is owned by blockchain capital. Brock Pierce has been involved with EOS since the concept, hes been there during the ico and afterwards. Please do what you say yourself and research it. Dan made a terrible mistake going in sea with a scumbag like Brock. 
0	1522973040	33	This has gotta be the most useless post and you wasted my time in reading it. Was looking for your arguments as to why Eos is bad and instead found out more reasons to buy. Brock leaving is GREAT for Eos. Now we can focus on fundamental newsflow without having to contend to his bs
1	1522977948	2	I scrolled down just to say exactly this. I don't usually call things like this fud, but...

0	1522973114	3	Hey, you're right about the price spikes when you post stuff like this. I just checked. Nice job!
0	1522978571	4	Somewhat related, it took me awhile to find a free link to watch "An Open Secret." I [found this Vimeo link](https://vimeo.com/142444429), it works, what a bunch of extremely sick fucks those people he mentioned are.
1	1523004007	2	I've edited the post to include the link. People should watch this documentary, maybe they will understand where I'm coming from. Brock Pierce should be rotting in jail minimum, at worse he should be tortured like reek in GoT.
0	1522979878	3	I agree with you...Hiring this clown shows bad judgement and intent. Not putting buying this overhyped shitcoin.
0	1523000605	5	I agree that EOS is absolutely pointless and am shocked at its position but we shouldn't reduce ourselves to uncivilized personal attacks on somebody whom is no longer a part of the project.
1	1523005250	3	He owns block.one, who owns EOS. He also owns blockchain capital, which owns block.one. he might not directly be part of the project (though I do think he is, even if it's not public) he still is ultimately one of the co founded and current 'boss' of EOS. He is at the top of the chain of EOS. 
2	1523019175	1	Despite this, I still believe we should attack on a technological rather than personal level.
3	1523021338	1	On one hand, I do agree with you. On the other hand...how about the Petro coin then? A coin that is pegged with a real value (oil) sounds something towards the correct way of true adoption. But then...it's from Maduro. You see what I mean? It's hypocritical to say Petro coin is bad because it's from that evil president but when it comes to other coins 'who cares, as long as the tech is good'. Perception, really. Maduro is a more bigger evil because his deeds are well known to the public. Brock Pierce some might have founded out today and don't know much about him cept this post. I would implore you to watch 'an open secret' though. If you hear the stories of the victims of DEN, the venture of Brock Pierce, you prob will think differently. That documentary is hard to watch, but it's important that these things goes public. 
0	1522968073	34	As harsh as it may sound, I doubt much people in Crypto care about a founder's background.If a coin has high returns and is widely known, it will have investors. I'm not saying this applies to me, but this applies to the majority. This is prevalent among the biggest companies in the world with disgusting CEO's aswell. If the product is good, why should others care about the background of people within the company?
1	1522981653	-2	He's not a founder. But he's also chair of the bitcoin foundation. He's also involved in tether. Ever sold to USDT? You're a supporter of child molestation. Or maybe people are human beings and someone never even CHARGED with a crime, just accused in the court of public opinion, shouldn't be viewed as 100% toxic and dead to all civilized humans. Just maybe. Like a bit. 
2	1523003807	1	Or maybe DEN was a big scam, he blew away millions of other people invested money and he was accused of  child molestation but it never went to court as it was settled outside of the court. Why did he fled to Spain if he is innocent? Seriously, I can't believe you are defending a proven scumbag like him. Even if the child abuse was only accusations, his DEN venture obviously wasn't. He has a history of scamming.  Also his partners were founded GUILTY for sexual child abuse. Go watch an open secret, then be ashamed you ever defended that scumbag. 
3	1523018897	1	Everyone already had these debates. He was chairman of the bitcoin community for years.

0	1522973558	8	Even ignoring that Brock is no longer associated with EOS, wasn't he only hired at a PR/marketing person? Basically a front man.He didn't have anything to do with development.
1	1523002431	4	He is the Co founder of block.one and EOS. He has been steering EOS since it's inception. His official role was strategic officer or something like that. Now he is an independent advisor and 'community builder'. Thinking about being a part of a community which is headed by such a scumbag like Brock makes me sick to my stomach tbh.
2	1523008885	-1	Just absolute lies now. 'He has been steering EOS since its inception'. Why not take this crazy theory to the EOS community subreddit or telegram if you honestly believe this shit.The world is one fucked up place and this makes you sick to your stomach? Get a grip. The community building you refer to means the whole crypto world in Costa Rica thing he is doing, not EOS.
3	1523028319	1	What a fucking stupid argument, "the world is full of heinous and morally depraved acts, therefore it is naive to find any given example of it perturbing" 
4	1523030169	1	Right because that's the argument I made - no, just what you chose to infer.Its naive to think that OP has just today decided to get offended by this.
5	1523031847	1	> The world is one fucked up place and this makes you sick to your stomach? Get a grip. What in the world else could this imply dude? > Its naive to think that OP has just today decided to get offended by this.huh?
6	1523032812	1	Are you for real? It implies that getting so offended by an event 20 years ago of which no one knows what happened is not the same as real injustice.I mean this is FUD - john Oliver episode was months ago.
0	1522983862	11	I want someone to explain to me why the people at EOS thought it was ok or a good idea to have this guy involved with the project at all?? Like idc if he's innocent if i was running this company i wouldn't want to associated with him at!

0	1522969938	29	Dan Larimer just released Dawn 3.0 EOS version :)While you guys talk shit about EOS those guys are working hard and changing the crypto world.But keep talking shit about them... just proves who you are. At least author of this post proved he is an idiot.

2	1522970990	3	For sure, there's still no actual product, lolol.
3	1522971363	6	right, so then what are the EOS devs writing code on then...?and if you're talking about the erc20 token, you're misinformed
3	1522971726	1	It's in development if you've done your research and going to be released in summer.
4	1522973820	4	3.0 denotes this is the third released version.How well is 2.0 working right now, live?
4	1522972208	1	I don't want to come off as naive, I honestly just want to know, can you please give me a small rundown of what product/service the company is going to be offering by summer?
5	1522972586	6	Small rundown: Ethereum competitor using dPOS and can theoretically parallel scale to even 1Mil tps. Loads of functionalities.Whitepaper: https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md
2	1522971668	1	For you maybe. For me it's the code release that matters.

0	1522978644	6	What concerns me most is the fact that they freshly sell 2mm tokens every single day, continuing to raise what has turned into a ridiculous sum of money. Why do they need that much money? What are they doing with it? Many other projects accomplish great things with far less capital, why does EOS need so much money and why do people continue to give it to them?
1	1522983056	0	The EOS project is actually funded by angel investors, the company behind it was founded before the ICO began and is not run from ICO funds.What they ARE doing with the money is funding venture capitalist firms to fund and educate developers to launch apps on the EOS platform. So while Ethereum is a capable dapp platform, most developing talent is kind of grassroots and has taken a while to get that far. The EOS funds will see some larger scale projects written and launched for the EOS blockchain very quickly after the main net launch in June. The three major players that have been announced so far are Mike Novogratz, Eric Schmidt's Tomorrow BC, and Finlab AG. This accounts for ~500 million of the fund so far.
0	1522965388	26	I don't plan on owning any of this coin, and don't have any desire to own the coin after seeing the bit by **John** Oliver.  And while Mr. Pierce is no longer part of the EOS team, it is a red flag for me.  On the other hand, the only thing that really matters is the technology and the people currently working for the coin.  I am not actively boycotting, but I will not be transacting with this coin at any point in the near future.  The whole point of having that much ethereum would be to be able to move to fiat, so that is not a big deal to me, btw.
1	1522966671	2	Hmm they say he works independent as a community builder and for investment activities. To me that says they just removed the spotlights on him but he still is deeply connected to EOS, probably now just shifted to 'independent advisor' or something, so him name isn't shown on the team list. That's how things go. The point is, he has scammed before and blew away millions with his sickening pool parties (people really gotta see an open secret). Then he Co founded EOS, and people act as if this time it's legit. We should learn from history for once. 
2	1522971930	3	No doubt 
1	1522966580	-1	Exactly!
1	1523006553	-1	John Oliver is just a TV show, it's dumb to let the mainstream media affect your investment decisions.
2	1523021763	1	I disagree, you should take everything into account that you can. My decision was for me to stay away, not to buy or short this coin.  I’m fine with missing out on 20x gains if that happens with this coin.
0	1522972424	7	I hate to see hit pieces like this. They are so unfair, biased and just plain old shitty. And why? Because someone wants to see their coin go up and another's go down? Shameful! Brock was a child himself when the allegations were made and he was not charged with any wrong doing. Did he do anything wrong? I don't know, but either does anyone else. So, if he wasn't charged, then give the guy the benefit of the doubt. It's called decency. For the rest of his life he has to deal with shit people like the poster using the worst thing that has probably happened to him smearing his name. Brock is married, seems kind (though maybe a little strange to some) and has done a lot to advance the crypto space, benefiting us all. Show the guy a little respect, or least don't be a dick!
1	1523004421	1	Dude, he was accused but settled outside of court. He was a partner of DEN, a venture that scammed million of dollars of investors, only producing a single pilot. The child actors of that show got sexual abused by the partners of DEN and they have been found guilty for the act. Brock Pierce might not have done the act but he is accused of drugging the children and pressuring them to have sex with the partners. He was 17-18 years old, that isn't a child anymore. After DEN collapsed he tried fleeing the country, got caught in Spain. So, a little respect? He should be fucking stoned each time he puts a step on public ground. The fact that he has infiltrated the crypto sphere is just a very scary thought. Please watch an open secret, and see how the victims of these child abuses are, what their experiences are and what the role was of Brock Pierce. Know that one of the child actors eventually died, he drank himself to death after what happened to him. 
2	1523037025	1	1. You know he settled out of court? Proof?2. He owned 1%. I've owned much more than that of several companies and was not involved in the daily business decisions.3. He was never charged with a crime. period.4. A film only represents the opinions of its creator. Think Fox news- conservative, MSNBC- liberal. They'll cover the same story and have absolutely different takes on the outcome. They are both biased.5. I don't know why I am even wasting my time arguing with someone with such a small mind.6. take up meditation or yoga or something. You need some Zen.
0	1522973178	7	> If a coin, that was created by a KNOWN scammer AND child molester reaches the top 10 of a certain market, what does that say about the market?Your post just lost all credibility.
0	1522973011	4	I fully agree. When I found out about that I also advised people to stay away from EOS and also Bitcoin because Brock Pierce is the chairman of the bitcoin foundation. Plus Ethereum because he promoted it in its early stages & was an early investor.You'd better stay away from everything that this man is associated with. If you hold Bitcoin, Ethereum or EOS you could as well just buy the Neverland Ranchcoin instead.
0	1522966725	17	Brock Pierce is a damn clown. I wouldn't touch EOS   
1	1522966939	0	If clowns organises pool parties for child actors on a digital shows they created where these children would be sexual abused and if the said show was a multi-million dollar scam, then sure, he definitely is a clown. 
0	1522964802	9	They cut ties with Brock, didn't they?
1	1522967073	14	'Cutting ties' publicly is more often than not just damage control. The people one surrounds themselves with say a lot about what person one is.Imagine a gang of criminals would remove one of their bosses and then proclaim "Well, we are honest people now.".Would you believe them?
2	1523004497	1	Exactly, the fact is he owns the company that owns EOS. He even owns the venture that owns the company that owns EOS. He is far from having cut ties with EOS, he is literally the boss of Dan. 
1	1522965300	16	 He is a cofounder. I doubt he fully did cut tieshttps://medium.com/eosio/dear-john-oliver-6aa5ac5fff26> we recently came to a mutual agreement that Brock would end his role at Block.one as he transitions to independent community building and investment activities. Whatever this is suppose to mean. All it means is that Brock Pierce isn't going to be the public face of EOS anymore. He still is director of the Bitcoin foundation though. Which plainly scares me. Edit: he still could be working with EOS by the way, just not as a public figure. Like being an 'independent' advisor and even community manager. That seems far more likely to be the case, though I have zero proof of it. 
2	1522995530	3	Ha, zero proof, just like everything else you say. Don't stop there start a new post....Brock pierce is still involved in EOS and its all a massive conspiracy.Independent community building refers to his Costa Rica projects.
3	1523004552	1	The proof is there. He owns blockchain venture and block.one. even if he leaves the EOS team, he still is the boss of the EOS team. 
2	1522971234	5	boycott bitcoin then...
3	1522994648	2	Bitcoin foundation has zero control over bitcoin unlike block.one which definitely controls EOS 
0	1522968962	17	The FUD campaign against EOS is out of control. This is Dan Larimer's third crypto (steemit and bitshares) but somehow people think it's a scam? It's high in value because people believe in his ability to deliver. Ex Google CEO Eric Schmidt is an investor in EOS as well, he must be a real dummy huh? And why would Bitfinex be opening EOSfinex if it were a scam? Truth is it's a better version of Ethereum capable of having complex apps built on top of it with its main net going live in less than 2 months.
1	1522971150	9	Bitshares and it's mining "bug."  But muh steemit!  So far Dan has jumped ship on every project he's been on.
2	1522976682	-1	He jumped ship because the ship was broken and he couldn’t achieve his goal of creating world changing dapps on a broken ship. Dan is one of the good guys. Vitalik might be wise to jump ship on ethereum and build a new ship. 
3	1523016094	1	If he has to keep jumping ship, then he’s a shitty shipbuilder. They’re his creations, right?
4	1523016776	1	In vitaliks case I don’t think when he built ETH he had any idea what it would become. I think if he could do it over today he would have built it differently. 
1	1522970008	12	Funny how blatant OP is about spreading this FUD. He/she even states that Brock Pierce is intimately connected with the Bitcoin Foundation and yet nothing is said about boycotting BTC. Oh yeah, I forgot that all your bags are tied to the price of BTC, cant risk that lol.Bottom line is that OP probably missed the EOS train and holds alot of increasingly worthless ETH. OP is starting to realize that EOS is in fact an existential threat to ethereum. People, do your own research. Yes, Brock Pierce is a scumbag and yes he did make a large initial investment in EOS and so he used to be one of the frontmen. How does that change the foundational technology of EOS? How does that change Dan Larimer's proven track record on delivering the most active/successful blockchains in the space? How does it change the fact that EOS is backed by hundreds of millions of institutional dollars? How does it change the fact that it can actually deploy mainstream dapps? (something Ethereum has failed to achieve)
2	1523004823	1	A lot of assumptions, based on nothing. I've sold most of my stack a few weeks ago, I only own a few coins which I don't mind holding to see if they can make true on their promises. Btw Bitcoin foundation has nothing to do with Bitcoin directly. And Brock Pierce owns the company that owns block.one - of which he also is a founder of and block.one owns EOS. He is Dan boss, no matter how you want to pull it. And I don't care if EOS will become a technical revolution anymore, I can't endorse something that comes from that sick scumbag hands. Dan made a huge mistake shaking hands with Brock, that is all on him.
2	1522972152	-2	Eth is crushing eosEos is vapor hyped by early investors
3	1522972568	3	You know you're in pretty deep denial when your opinion is directly contradicted by price charts. You couldn't handle cryptokitties and your scaling solutions are too late. Wake the fuck up.
4	1522975154	0	Yea because Ethereum scaling solutions are much more complex. Masternodes are the easy way out.
5	1522975809	1	Seems like you need to do a little more research. EOS will not have masternodes. If you're referring to the 21 block producers, they'll be voted in by the community of EOS holders. I agree that Ethereum's scaling solutions are more complex but a DPoS system whereby the coin grants network access/storage is a much more simple & elegant scaling solution. It actually gives real utility/value to the coin
6	1522976200	0	I don’t need to do more research to participate in this discussion. Those “block producers” are effectively masternodes. They cannot be ran on consumer grade hardware. They are ran on commercial grade server systems.
7	1522977327	1	You can call them masternodes if you think it helps your argument but that's not what they are.The truth of the matter is that Vitalik's/Ethereum's goal is to prioritize decentralization over scalability. The problem is that you cannot FORCE decentralization and that's why you have 2 massive pools who mine >50% of the ethereum. The computing power will continue to aggregate into the hands of big corporations and the vast majority of ethereum holders won't be able to do anything to counteract that. That "decentralization" is what ethereum has been sacrificing scalability for. EOS has learned from this mistake which is that the free market does not allow for true decentralization. Mining power will inevitably centralize in the hands of the wealthy/powerful. Instead, what you CAN do is to have 21 block producers with a simple voting system. Therefore even if certain entities accumulate mining power, they can be voted out of their position if the community sniffs out any censorship or other issues. By essentially setting the default decentralization of the platform to 21 block producers and allowing the community to serve as a system of checks and balances, the scalability has a much higher ceiling and the team can focus on improving it as its main priority  
8	1522989401	1	Ok. I agree with your POW points, but that is why the EF has been spending the past two years researching and developing Casper the POS protocol. POW was implemented at first because it has a proven track record of security. And Casper is designed with game thoeric principles from the inside out and has extensive research to back it up. He is not forcing decentralization with Casper, he is creating an environment that will foster it. Ethereum will be the most decentralized blockchain by a long shot ~ 2 years from now. I am very confident of that looking at the current landscape.
9	1522990855	1	I believe that Ethereum has a bright future. In comparison to EOS,  Ethereum will be more decentralization and likely a bit more secure. Also their perceived censorship-resistance might be better as well. This is of course after all the updates are integrated. However, ethereum will probably never have the throughput that EOS will have. Indeed, you do have to sacrifice some decentralization and security for speed. The reality is that we need both Ethereum and EOS in the crypto space. It gives businesses the option of deciding which factor is more important to them: more decentralization & censorship resistance with less TPS or less decentralization/censorship resistance and more TPS A hypothetical situation would be where something like Wikileaks would absolutely need Ethereum whereas something like Uber would want EOS.I'm invested in both, but I think more money will flow into EOS in the next 2-3 years, not to mention the fact that it has more room to grow.
8	1522988583	0	I agreed. But without decentralisation, there is no point of having public open blockchain. Pointless. Permissioned chain or distributed ledger of course are still useful to solve certain problems, but EOS is suppose to be public. 
4	1522985300	0	Your eos is a dead token dude
5	1522986342	1	lollll oooooooooooook buddy
1	1522970064	8	Don't waste your time on these losers.
1	1522970375	7	Lol its so crazy right? Literally theres a direct correlation between price and the number of EOS fud posts. Its so dumb. Honestly, if anyone falls for a garbage post like this, they really shouldn't be investing in crypto. There's far too many actual scams out there for them to be this gullible. What a joke.
1	1522970175	6	Now I don't know much about Bitshares, but Steemit is rated very scammy, if you ask many experts in the field. In case anyone is curious, just google how STEEM are distributed and how much the developers hold. Also, go on Steemit and see for yourself. The concept made me interested of course aswell, but when you go there, you find a shitty version of tumblr, where it's often bots/shills/somepaki. You'd want a news feed, to contain news, not ... garbage. When Verge hack was already twice on frontpage here, it wasn't even listed/discussed on Steem *at all*. Instead, a post about some OTC-Trading got huge amounts of attention, it really didn't deserve at all. Which goes back to the problem that, it may seem like you get paid, but essentially those *with* majority coins pick posts in a very centralized manner. Just don't see it working at all.Again, and also, it's really not just me. Many *domain experts* have voiced concerns regarding Steemit. 
2	1522971307	2	Steemit's shitty because *the users made it that way.* Dan Larimer ditched the chain and let it run a loooong time ago.
2	1522973230	0	I actually use Steemit a lot, it depends on what you follow. Just don't follow trash if you don't want trash. Just go on YouTube without an account on a browser with all cookies and cache reset and it looks like a fucking shithole as well. I'm also interested in these "experts in the field" that rate "Steemit" scammy (They rate the website and not the currency? They could just use busy.org). 
1	1522970348	1	Wish you hadn't brought finex into it because they are dodge as hell, but otherwise I think you are spot on.People are running scared and fudding because they don't want to wake up after the bubble and find out that the top 10 might change.Digging into Pierces background to try and 'boycot' this project is ridiculous. Obviously he is an undesirable character, and I wish they had cut ties sooner, but it doesn't speak volumes about the project. Facebook had some bloody shocking advisors early doors, and grew into one of the world's giants. Maybe not the best example right now... but point is still relevant.

1	1522964395	-5	You can't possibly have read the post, but then again, you do hit the nail right. 
0	1522987016	4	You only need to check this site https://blocktivity.info/  that tracks which are the projects with biggest activity on the blockchain  by number of  transactions and network capacity. On the top 3 are the other two of Larimer's projects and both using less than 0.2% capacity. The third one is Etherium, but using over 50% of capacity. This simple fact shows how wrong you are about EOS and how screwed the Ethereum project is.
0	1522967275	9	Since Brock Pierce is heavily tied to Bitcoin and the b Bitcoin Foundation, you should go on a crusade against Bitcoin
0	1522967327	8	So your entire opinion come from a background from one guy. Well that is just not fair.
1	1522969792	3	Never convicted of anything as far as I can tell. Don't give a shit about EOS really but apparently we can't make money unless or morals align with OP.

0	1522997323	3	Man, if that really is the best reason you can come up with to not buy EOS, well I guess I should be all in on this shit
1	1522997748	0	Really? I have no words for this. Might as well go buy the petro coin and join ISIS, caus 'why not'.
0	1522974613	3	How the fuck is this post even getting upvoted? Brock was fired a few weeks ago...
0	1522981325	4	Fuck EOS. It’s been a scam coin run by scammers since the beginning. Don’t believe their lies.
0	1522970793	3	Strong development, strong team, good financial backing, clear vision... But they were once associated with someone of questionable character, so the whole thing is a scam.If you don't know much about EOS, then reading about it from someone who opens their posts by admitting they're actively on a FUD mission against the coin is not a smart place to start.It's always better to do your own research. A good place to start is Daniel Larimer and his history developing blockchains.
1	1522970962	2	Or read the WSJ who points out that there's no product and it's a scam?
2	1522973448	5	This is why you will always be poor
2	1522971445	4	Or read into the github where there are development milestones hit regularly and a team of people putting in the work. Or read the whitepaper. Or community forums, not just EOS, but reddit and bitcointalk. Or read into the partnerships that Block.One has secured with Mike Novogratz and Tomorrow BC. Or read into the exchange that Vitalik and Dan Larimer had last week.Reading a post by someone who is quite obviously prejudiced against the project does not constitute DYOR.The WSJ article isn't objective at all, the only quote they have in the entire article is from someone who's developing a competing product.
2	1522972488	4	LOL the WSJ. What do they know? Do real research. You and the rest of the fudsters are not going to be able to use the argument "There's no real product" in 2 months when it actually launches.

0	1522969442	5	Yup, I agree with OP. EOS is going to be another scarlet letter on crypto community. Although I have no reason to believe it will be intentional. 
0	1522968665	2	I just hope scams like EOS, Verge and TRX get a faster exit, so we can continue the revolution.

1	1523034218	1	They have a feature complete public test net and will be releasing the main net in two months. There are numerous big projects already planned for the platform by the likes of bitfinex, everpedia and others. I don't really get comments like this...are you legitimately too stupid to do 5 seconds of research, or are you deliberately spreading misinformation out of fear? I can't think of any alternate explanation.
1	1523026517	0	Well we know who, Brock Pierce does. He owns blockchain capital, who owns block.one who owns EOS. He has between 700m and 1b dollars in cryptocurrencies. Dropping 130k eth might have been pocket change for him. 
0	1522979836	3	Yeah guys!! DYOR! on Wikipedia. Oh and CNBC while we are at it. Your calling people sheep and yet your following news from a comedy anchor and your "research" from Wikipedia. You seem to be wearing the wool here buddy. He was 17-18 and in a very screwed up place as far as the really weird shit that happens to child actors. Brock Peirce is an early investor in block one but hardly has an impact on the development. FURTHERMORE going into the REAL REASON TO BOYCOT would be the dpos aglo giving 21 people the block creation power (your "miners") creating "cartel" of sorts. However you have to take into account Eos holders elect and remove these 21 block producers as pleased. So long as the community is not allowing these block producers to misbehave and constantly switches then dpos will have the fastest tps as well as an amazingly secure platform fro dapps. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DYOR don't read dumb post like this. Learn you alittle bit of computer coding like python or java and go explore these projects githubs. The fact that most of these projects have an almost empty GitHub with completely rubbish code inside have support and stuff like Eos can be called a scam over top of projects like trx completely leaves me dumbfounded
0	1522983812	0	These are serious. All it takes is a CNBC or whatever coordinated attack and EOS is in trouble. Till then people might scream "but we are here for the tech" or whatever. If someone feels ok having invested in a vehicle that took off with a criminal pilot than your vision is blurry. I truly hope for your investments that Eos has gone truly legit but usually wherever there is smoke there is fire. Which reminds me : Prior to Centra launch, "scam" and "crime" posts were all over. Same with WTC. But no one listened neither cared. If a project IS or WAS backed by a clown connected with pedofiles then I won't approach within 10 miles of it. Skeletons in the closet usually are revealed when they hurt the most.PS. Also software engineer for 30+ years but lately a businessman..
0	1522989900	1	> for some reason it's actually gaining valueIt seems natural it should gain a bit in value, after the beating it took from John Oliver. People always over-react to that kind of thing. (I have no interest in EOS, nor own any EOS, for that matter.)> they just dumped 130k ethereum a few days ago, so we KNOW they liquidated their cash, an exit scam seems so much like the logical next stepSelling because we may be in a long-term bear market might also be a logical step.> who in their right mind wants to support a person like Brock Pierce?He got caught up with some sleazy people as a teenager 17 years ago, and he was never charged, despite being investigated. What's he like now?
0	1522990158	2	...are you at all familiar with the crypto world?  You do realize how many ex-cons, criminals, shady shills and people with a blackened past have been involved in cryptos, right?  C'mon...Roger Ver, John McAfee, now Sam Sharma and Robert Farkas, hell, the inventor of Bitcoin remains *UNKNOWN*, and for all you know he could be the devil incarnate.  Crypto is a very new place with lots of shady space, and it's not for the faint of heart.

0	1522981298	2	As much as I like the promise of eos, I can see the writing on the wall. Ethereum will get their PoS + plasma +sharding, or Iota will get functional timestamps+ coordinator removal. Either of those is GAME OVER for eos.  Its not a matter of eos winning a time race. Its when either of those two powerhouses reach their final form.

3	1522972780	1	answer this then: does he have anything to do with *the technical aspects* of EOS software?
4	1522985271	2	I do not need the baggage why do u
0	1522988783	1	If Brock is no longer involved, on your bike then.
0	1522999765	1	Awww shit...i remember that doco! Hollywood tried to get it banned! Pedo cunt!
0	1523000238	1	So your critique is that 1. Pierce was a minor partner in a  company when he was 18 that didnt turn a profit and is now not with EOS anymore.2. They dumped 135k ethereum a couple of days ago to pay their devs, infrastructure,  artificially increase the size of their ICO or it in their own pockets, who knows. These are all possible.I was hoping for more evidence in such a lengthy post and provocative title. This is all very weak and none of it is substantiative evidence.
1	1523005009	2	It's based on morale, not technical. People won't endorse Maduro Petro coin, because of Maduro. People shouldn't endorse EOS because of Brock Pierce.Brock Pierce owns block.one who owns EOS. Brock pierce owns blockchain capital, who owns block.one. he is still heavily involved, don't be dumb.
2	1523005351	1	Yeah, but the only thing you have against him is that the show he made when was 18 and where he was a MINOR partner didn't turn a profit. The "living lavishly" part in wikipedia is also sensationalized and doesn't make him a bad person. He was a minor partner from a company that just raised money to make a TV show. He had a $250,000 salary and maybe throw a few party as an 18 year old, that's it. Pretty much every 18y old would do that. I don't know what horrible moral values you draw from that. Look, I don't really like EOS either, but if you make such an outrageous post have more evidence than that. Your post is heavily sensationalized without any good evidence. 
0	1523011053	1	It's gaining value because it's one of the best crypto here.In 2 month, real blockchain is release and this will be fabulous.You don't know what you are talking about, probably invested in something else (ETH ) will be rekt by EOS
0	1523012034	1	I haven't looked into EOS, but I do hope the project isn't just another pump and dump. Crypto space needs healthy competition, and if EOS lives to the hype, and becomes a hit, it'll help the cryptocurrency scene tremendously.Invest safely people, and stay vigilant.#\#CRAEFULGANG
0	1523013187	1	This is what you need to know, not everything is one-faced, actually, almost nothing is one-faced but death.You are saying it personally, you have a personal hate towards EOS, no matter what they will do, you will just attack it, so this comment will be for those reading, you shouldn't even reply, it'll be a waste of both yours and my time.If someone has personal hate towards a project, they won't make unbiased arguments or statements on anything, but hear what they want, or like, just like a mad-man.After you say you hate the project, you directly attack Brock Pierce, who, as we all know, ***is not part of the project*** yet you still want it to be since that way in your war fantasy you can attack him straight, you actually wish he still was so your points were valid, but I repeat once again, **he is not, thus your statement is incorrect**.You are also saying a really important thing which you would like to only happen to this project, yet it doesn't, shilling coins, if you take a look at the sub, everyone is **shilling** if you were to look at it, nobody cares about their project, but as to how far the price can go so they can profit, it's **not EOS that is doing it** but their users and the users of any other coin in existence, look at XVG and tell me that your point still stands that EOS is the only one having this happen.In the real world, people hate each other for things as simple as Apple & Samsung.Now you're saying that they dumped 130k ETH, of course they did, you're creating a coin that requires fiat and you are not a ETH supporter, you just have it, **this point is what explains most of your frustration**, losing so much cash on ETH must be hard, I feel you.Let's go back to Brock Pierce, you said it yourself, he didn't get any charge, you just straight attack him, against,  you said it, **for a personal vendetta  you have against him, no valid points**.I love it how you post a documentary video, that explains a lot why you've got the ideas you've got.What I also love is how you sincerely attack the project exactly on their day of Dawn 3.0 release, instead of attacking a person, take a look at what it has to offer: https://medium.com/eosio/eosio-dawn-3-0-now-available-49a3b99242d7

People say trade without emotions but that what caused banks to invest in (nuclear) weapons and what not, and I can't agree to that, nor can I agree to help the brainchild of this sick perverted fuck. Funny, today found out a lot more about this guy (Brock Pierce) and things just go from worst to straight up evil. Crypto community should've boycotted him from the very start, now he has become a major player with almost a net worth of a billion dollars in crypto.

0	1523000979	1	Zero technical arguments and an entire post dedicated to accusations of a guy that is not even involved with the project.An entire post complaining about people buying something they don't understand by a guy who has no idea what he is talking about. Somehow I doubt the irony was intentional. 
1	1523004095	3	Co founded all the companies that eventually led to EOS, which he co founded too, being the strategic office manager of EOS, the main promoter of EOS but...that guy is not even involved in the project. Sure. 
0	1522964600	-3	Well, sorry mate but I can't agree with you here.Edit: Please read my comment down here explaining my point about it. No shilling, just giving out what I do think about it.
1	1522964697	-3	Read the post, for crying out loud, READ. Don't reply without reading first. There is nothing to not agree about unless you endorse child molesting and scamming. Then I won't be agreeing with you. 
2	1522964955	10	People don't like to read in the cryptosphere. Maybe try hand signals? 
3	1522967220	1	It's because they're all here to educate _us_ clueless simpletons.
2	1522965018	3	Alright dude, Brock Pierce isn't the best person but is he the only one? What about the other part of the block.one team?Don't you know who Dan Larimer is? A lot of people judge him because he always end up leaving their projects when they are certainly finished but for what I know, none of his projects is n1 but they are doing pretty good on market.You have a point saying you shouldn't invest in a bad team but is it really a bad team overall just because Brock Pierce has been doing shit his whole life? Sadly I can't tell you if he will steal money from EOS but for now, block.one has been active on telegram and social media and they are working great on GitHub.
3	1522965381	8	Amazing how he didn't mention Dan Larimer once in that entire post. Guy is probably paid FUD. 
4	1522965455	1	Sure! If he wants to stablish a point, he should mention everything on it. If he wanted to talk bad about Brock, he should've made a post on him, not on EOS.
3	1522965431	-7	Isn't the best person? It's public knowledge that he scammed during the dot.com bubble ffs. Even a donkey doesn't hit his head on the same rock, yet we humans never seem to learn. This guy co-founded EOS. That should be enough for you. Stay away from it. It has been tainted. IF they wanted to use Brock Pierce for his money, I can get it. But he was the posterboy of the coin, doing all sort of promotion for EOS (with his unicorn wedding, what was that about). Go watch an open secret. Please. 
4	1522965565	-2	Alright, he's an asshole or idk how bad you want to call them. What about not taking the whole community and team behind EOS down just because ONE certainly irrelenvant person (like, he's not even developing, he might steal money but EOS is still a good project.).
5	1522966169	-1	Irrelevant? He Co founded EOS and block.one. how is he exactly irrelevant?

0	1522986917	1	This post is a direct example of the "Straw Man" logical fallacy.  You spoke nothing of the project and only attacked a person's character.  That being said, I have some invested in EOS but not all. I bought in at .50 and have followed the project eagerly since then.
0	1522995615	1	I totally agree and it's not just that.EOS is pretty much a system of competitive corruption.I can to a degree understand the rationale of somebody seeing it reasonable to propel acceleration in that direction, but really - this is a horrible and maybe even catastrophic idea.Secondly, it's an ERC-20 token while being a "direct competitor to Ethereum" (even an "Ethereum killer"). Projects like IOTA and Cardano have their tokens on their own platforms for a reason (which is called ethical integrity). EOS has been selling off copious amounts of Ether lately and while it can neither be proven nor disproven that they are buying their own tokens back, it is very bothersome that such window of opportunity even exists.Lastly, even if EOS is rock solid, it's not all about code. Code is just a way of expressing concepts and ideas. And the concept behind EOS is to me highly disturbing. 
1	1523000900	1	>Lastly, even if EOS is rock solid, it's not all about code. Code is just a way of expressing concepts and ideas. And the concept behind EOS is to me highly disturbingVery interesting. Can you explain what you find disturbing. Some links/ pointers for more info would be very helpful. Thanks in advance.
2	1523004862	1	unless I'm misunderstanding something - and I've downloaded the white paper, meant to read it today but am still to swamped with work to get to it (will do), Delegated Proof of Stake kind of amounts to what Steemit is at the moment. more or less rule of those who have created the network and know how to manipulate it (for the "greater good"), and their cronies and subordinate ass licking minions. to add to that, we're actually talking outrageous concentration of wealth here in the hands of a few.
2	1523005268	1	for a (loose, but relevant) real-life analogy we may take Saudi Arabia here i think. it's a system kept together by means of corruption. and that may be great so long as everybody's rich, happy and blissfully ignorant, but i'm not sure how it is sustainable in the long-term, on a global scale (i.e., not Saudi Arabia). these dimensions must be accounted for when talking technology+society and when things begin to overspill into politics and so on. both ethics and aesthetics are important.
0	1522998650	1	Pierce is not part of eos anymore. You should've read the news before posting this.
1	1522998841	1	>And yes I know, Mr Pierce isn't the posterboy of EOS anymore, he brought too much negative publicity after the last week show bit of James Oliver. This is what i said, you shouldve read the post more craefully. Also it doesnt matter if EOS ousted him, they ousted him mainly because of John Oliver bit (well, thats my opinion about it, since we wont really know) and he has been the posterboy for EOS since its creation. Its not that he isnt a part of the team right now, its the fact that he CO FOUNDED EOS and was EOS main promoter, its the fact that Dan choose to work with such a filthy scumbag, who has a reputation of scamming during the dot.com bubble AND allegations of drugging children and child molestation.
0	1522966655	-2	EOS deviates so far away the orginal vision of Bitcoin and Ethereum. 21 masternodes and they all run on commercial grade hardware. It will definitely be missing the censorship resistant attribute that is for sure.

Just to clearify, I am no “new to crypto” and I didn’t make that opinion based on reading “FUD” I made my own conclusion. Regardless, I have a question for you. Why do Vitalik and Andreas Antonopoulos hate masternodes so much from your perspective?

2	1522989612	2	Pools are made up of many moving parts and every actor within the big whole has a ton of financial incentives to keep the pool operator in check. I agree with you though POW in many ways is flawed. That is why the EF has been researching and developing the Casper POS protocol over the last two years.

1	1522977081	0	Lacked credibility? Boy, I don't even know what to say to that. You made a hard pass on a project backed with billions of dollars and some of the brightest minds in crypto and investing. One that's up tenfold before the main-net has even launched. Please share the name of your fund so I can be sure NOT to invest in it. Obviously, you guys don't have a clue.
2	1522987004	0	> One that's up tenfold before the main-net has even launched. So, Theranos you say? Yeah, fuck that. lol.
3	1523037561	1	Theranos? Yeah, same thing. Not! EOS has open source code on Github so it's not anything like Theranos. The working product is easily verifiable. But, hey, the price is still reasonable so you have the opportunity to correct your "hard pass" mistake. Good investors often reevaluate opportunities they passed on prior. Hopefully, for your investors sake, you take another look at EOS.

Keep your emotions out of investing or stay on the sidelines.  Regardless of how you feel about it, EOS/ETH is the real flippening and will be the trade of the year.

I hate to break it to you but Brock played no role in creating the EOS platform and isn’t the founder either.. EOS Dawn 3.0 being released, dApps about to airdrop to EOS holders, and mainnet going live in a few weeks is news... That's NOT shilling... You worked so hard and almost looked like you knew something..  Sorry that didn’t work out for ya.
0	1522990964	1	EOS is the shit. Don’t worry you can FOMO in later when it’s $30
1	1523004260	1	$30. LOL. This man said $30
2	1523004448	2	Don’t worry. I’ll remind you
0	1522991253	0	Lol what a retard
0	1522991431	-1	OP is retard, first comment proved it.
0	1522991561	1	Worst post I've  ever read on here.
0	1522969052	-2	I sold my eos weeks ago.  Couldn't stand not having a working product in this bear market
1	1522969329	5	You sold a bottom, well done. It's been going up the past few weeks.
1	1522972220	0	Still doesnt have a product or app that anyone cares about
0	1522966298	-7	Oh god, the SJW’s are here too. 
1	1522967482	11	OP is a SJW for pointing out child abuse?
2	1522974026	0	bro there are no gurls here, who are you virtue signaling to??? ??^^^/s
0	1522978246	0	We need more people like Brock.  The man thinks for himself and probably comes to many conclusions you and I wouldn't agree with.  This is a strongly desirable aspect among entrepreneurs; sometimes you need to look at a problem completely differently to solve it.
0	1522979496	0	This thread and the amount of people that upvoted it are exactly why most people dont take this sub seriously anymore. Yall are retarded. At least OP is getting ass blasted in the comments
1	1522994201	1	Also his gang of ignorant fanstics are on a downvoting spree on the comment section
0	1522982010	0	Sounds like you don't like Brock.  Or have some experience with.....you know......
0	1522972959	0	I have some issues with EOS' model, namely the use of an ICO + DPoS to gain distribution for a world computation platform. It seems like they're trying to implement solutions to scaling before Ethereum can by cutting straight to PoS and I'm skeptical that they'll be able to maintain distribution that way. But thats okay, there's nothing wrong with moving fast and taking risks.However, this post is kinda weak tbh. Yeah, Pierce is a shit bag, and he worked at Block.One, but that doesn't magically make EOS a bad product or a bad investment. There are plenty of shit bags working on great products and instruments, and EOS involves a number of cryptocurrency veterans.
0	1522978181	0	TL;DR:- very strong buy recommendation LOL everytime someone shitfucks a crypto in any way, even if it IS legitimate, that crypto seems to somehow jump 100% in price in no time at all. Chuck a lazy $10k onto EOS, turn it into an easy $20k...profit :)
0	1522978209	0	Liquidating ETH is in no way liquidating cash. How do you draw that conclusion?  Your post is like the fud shill which is just as bad. 
0	1522992505	0	Thats like saying dont buy Sprite cuz kendall jenner was on one of their ads 😂😂😂😂😂 pathetic. 
0	1522998769	0	Burn EOS.. Burn...
0	1522978056	-1	Why so angry? Were you one of the little boys he molested?
0	1522982954	-1	I got into Antshares (NEO) during ICO, and ETH at a very low price. Along with EOS at around 50 cents, and I can tell you, it's a great cryptocurrency. I remember seeing threads like this for NEO, and ETH very early on, where people were ignorant and decided to hate something because they missed out, or lost money. Long term, I have no doubt this will be worth $20+. Like I said, I was a huge supporter of ETH, although I truly believe EOS will take it's spot in the coming years as people realize it's potential, and capacity for growth. It's also not controlled by an autistic.
1	1523016857	1	Everything made sense until that last sentence.  
0	1522982983	-1	This being at the top of r/cryptocurrency without even a mention of Dawn3.0 proves this sub is absolute shit. 
0	1522986413	-1	This is some ignorant bullshit not even worthy of a rebuttal. Can't believe how many idiots upvoted this.
0	1522965647	-16	Its going to make me a millionaire. Take this FUD and shove it
1	1522965751	16	Name somehow checks out. 
1	1522966962	17	Bitconnect and Verge were going to make people millionaires too. 
2	1522973630	2	they all were, they all are
2	1522994393	-1	Comparing EOS to BITCONNECT... nice!Ppl wont think youre a retard 😋 (sike)
0	1522986673	-2	Man, crypto has turned into a bunch of whiny bitches. 
0	1522973208	-1	Thanks for posting this. I hope it gains traction and lowers the price of EOS so that I can get more at a better price.
0	1522975117	-1	So you disregard all the accomplishments EOS has made and stuff it is working to solve? 
0	1522973818	0	i didn't like him the first time i saw him. it turned me off EOSi'm not surprised at this info now. what a dirty, dirty manyet, the tech may end up being cool..
0	1522971774	-3	As a coin still in ICO, as an American it’s very easy to boycott because it’s illegal for me to own it! I’m worried many Americans do... if you receive any tokens via the token swap, that can be tracked. Consider yourself warned.
1	1522973206	2	it's not illegal for you to own it, you just cannot participate in the ICO and purchase directly from Block.one. Buy all you want off the exchanges. People really should educate themselves before investing. 
2	1522983974	2	What a dill. You can't participate in the ICO, but you can participate in it. No. Legally you can not. Reading the EOS legal terms is quite clear. YOU should educate yourself before you go to jail. 
3	1523037766	1	The disclaimers are for their protection, not my prosecution. Learn a little bit about Business law before you give inaccurate lectures. 
2	1522979565	1	Thanks for your 0 source education. But happy to be wrong, where is your source?
0	1522973952	-2	For a brief second I thought hmmm...I wonder if this guy knows something I don't about my top investment. The one  with the brightest future that's ready to hand me 8 airdropped coins on their blockchain in 2 months. What could he know, then I read "Brock Pierce."      FUDJust FUD, carry on. There are many great projects out there and EOS is one of them.
1	1522976521	0	Yea I'm always open to reading criticisms and almost feel a little bit disappointing when they have no substance. I'm used to it by now. Same thing happened with eth, xmr, xrp, and now eos. At this point its almost better to do the exact opposite of the community. 
0	1522980153	-3	The president has done way more rapey things and he's running the country, so...
0	1522993596	-3	Lmao biggest waste of 20s of my life reading some baseless shit fud
1	1522994132	5	How is this FUD? Its his wikipedia page for crying out loud, its a warning more then anything. Sure EOS said he now is going independent (and i qoute):> he transitions to independent community building and investment activities.https://medium.com/eosio/dear-john-oliver-6aa5ac5fff26But lets be honest here, all that means is that he isnt a public figure anymore, he definitely still is close to the EOS project as he CO FOUNDED it.There isnt anything baseless here, it was all public knowledge even before EOS ever started. How the hell people still bought EOS ICO is beyond me, greed blinds people. But i do hold a morale and im not going to endorse a company who was lead by a person who not only scammed millions of dollars of people in the past but also ruined child actors life, some even have taken their own life. Go watch An open Secret, then maybe you understand why Brock Pierce is a filthy scumbag and why EOS IS stained because of the association with that piece of shit.
0	1522978888	-4	EOS is the future. 
0	1522997261	-2	The reasons I have for not trusting EOS, or to not support them are:- dPoS misses the economic incentives for fairness and transparency;- Not decentralised, requires super nodes ran by employees;- Not censorship resistant, actually suppression of blocks, contracts and transactions are discussed as a "feature";- Not a blockchain because of all of the above, more like a SaaS version of Oracle APEX but with less testing.I can see why developers might want to use it for all the neat features but essentially the market they are addressing is not the same that would look at using a real Blockchain.
