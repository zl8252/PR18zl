1	1522993468	29	Lmao
1	1523012412	5	F
1	1523006399	10	Savage
1	1522997876	4	Lol yup. 
1	1523022928	2	This was good!
1	1523006041	4	Hair transplant companies also no dice.
1	1523014262	3	you've never heard of that 80's greasy pizza delivery ex-rapist haircut?  My step dad had it his whole life.
1	1523032913	1	Wrekt
0	1522985142	20	I’m confused. Hasn’t Anton been doing this with bitcoin for years?
1	1523012284	8	I believe he lives like 80 or 90% of off Bitcoin.
1	1523032234	1	The point of this video isn't so much that Joel lives of crypto, it is that a town in the USA has so many merchants that accept it.
0	1522981961	39	A great piece by Joel in getting digital currency into mainstream media. Cant wait for all the current media projects in the pipeline to come out. 
1	1523000801	6	Out of interest, what current media projects are you referring to?
2	1523031849	-2	>Cant wait for *all* the current media projects in the pipeline to come out.Clearly he was referring to all of them. Fucking retard.^/s 
0	1523005726	34	Fucking tax nightmare
0	1522985772	14	I hate to break the news, but Morgan Spurlock (the guy behind "Supersize Me") already did this years ago on his show:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27VZ6gYYNOA
0	1523007308	9	I have to say it there is some fun in paying with "digital cash"
1	1523031983	2	i mean, we've already been doing debit and paypass for years... shouldn't feel much different. 
0	1523010198	9	Crypto adoption news being aired on mainstream media is awesome news no matter what coin it was.Congratz Dash Team. 
0	1523016222	3	I've been doing this for almost a year.
0	1523021060	3	With things like the Shift and Bitpay card,this is actually not that difficult.I’ve been living off crypto since last year.It DOES technically go to fiat @ POS,but I’ve been able to use it in the US and in Europe easily.So pure Crypto, that could be difficult;Using cards like I’ve mentioned, cake.
0	1523014053	5	Love the stab and rotate into Bitcoin at the end of the clip. This seems like a fucking advertorial. 
0	1522984385	7	Here's what Joel Valenzuela thinks about crypto users like you and me:>Cryptocurrency is rife with cypherpunk culture. It’s home to technical people, many of whom were likely yelled at by their parents or authority figures for their basement-dwelling lifestyle, unprofessional attire, and lack of participation in the traditional realm of what is considered “adult responsibility.”https://www.dashforcenews.com/dash-community-get-ready-heavy-trolling/
1	1522985708	13	Absolutely agree with Joel on that blog article. Sorry if you possibly self identify with whom he was referring to. But I too am looking for an asset that can be used by my business and my clients easily, privately and securely.  Many here have made this ecosystem to unwelcoming to every day individuals. Read the whole thing... 
2	1522987145	6	There's plenty of opportunities. And good communities in crypto. 
2	1523025948	0	It's not something I identify with, but it's still not a nice thing to say about people.  Let alone the people who built all of this and are often their target market.  I did read the whole thing and it was totally unnecessary to include in the article 
1	1523032060	2	that guy sounds like a knob. my fucking grandma has crypto currency. 
0	1522975534	19	[removed]
1	1523007163	-2	I don't think it was deliberately pre-mined, I believe that there was a bug that meant a lot more was mined than should have been in the first day. I understand why many don't believe that but I don't think it is fair to call it a scamcoin when it is clearly very legitimate now. I own zero Dash.
1	1522979097	-9	I see no issue here, brilliant creators deserve coins and nodes. Satoshi maybe holds a few BTC ?
2	1522981664	5	> Satoshi maybe holds a few BTC ?Yeay, a "few"...his original completely untouched wallet(s) make him a billionaire. 
3	1522984978	5	He would fucking nuke the market if even a single Satoshi was moved.I think the other poster below you is right. If I had a billion dollars I could not touch I'd probably kill myself too.
4	1523015228	2	He'd manage to sell quite a bit as the news spread though... not billions but if done right he could keep selling all the way to the bottom. 
2	1522979118	-4	Satoshi is dead
1	1522978274	-12	Lies.
2	1522979246	8	Have you not seen this?https://youtu.be/xBxbiH_Mg44
3	1522979466	8	Of course I have. And I have seen better than that too. However it's not as simple as what that video makes it out to be. 
3	1522979622	12	The only "scam" are cryptocurrencies used for nothing, fly by night ICOs that take the money and run, white papers that amount to nothing.Show me another crypto "currency" that is being used for instant transactions at brick and mortar businesses. Dash stands alone. 
4	1522979816	17	You're right but that doesn't mean it wasn't a premined scamcoin meant to get the creator rich.Both can be true.People are stupid. It got popular because no one realized.
5	1522995535	3	Thank you for doing what I no longer have the energy to do. At least some smart people will come by and see this, and look into its shady beginnings. Maybe they've seen the shill army in action already and smell something fishy, but hopefully this puts them over the edge. Would be nice to have a copypasta with a bunch of links to all the records of the scammy beginnings and explaining why masternodes are worse than useless.
5	1522980468	3	Meh. The way I see it, even if the founder did keep coins and nodes for self, that's just one person but it has become so much bigger than that. Initiatives all over the world especially in Africa and Venezuela, quality investigative journalism in the US, and instant transactions which no other crypto "currency" has somehow managed to achieve. From my vantage point, Dash is transformative on many levels and I see great benefit to many everywhere I look.
6	1522981417	17	Okay?Doesn't mean it wasn't a premined scam.Sidenote: DASH is nothing special. It's just a fast coin. Any fast coin could have blown up in place of DASH. It's just unfortunate we made a scammer rich. 
7	1522981932	-8	But it wasn't premined. Look into this with more depth.BTW if he was a scammer then he probably sold it all during the first Dash bubble in 2014. Also the man was offering cash to buy Dash on forums. 
8	1522995593	14	Instamine the day before Evan told everyone it was going to launch is as good as a premine.
9	1523013841	0	It was not a day. 
8	1523001927	4	It was though? Quit being disingenuous. You’re not even providing proof to the contrary when you’ve been given proof.
9	1523013812	-1	There ws no premine. You prove it. You have given no proof.
4	1522995967	1	well this guy is limiting himself to the few places that accept his coins, still very far from being useful in everyday life.
0	1523012528	3	go joel 👏
0	1522982042	9	What a fucking revolution. Look how their society has transformed. Just a few months ago, people were swiping cards and using chip readers. Now they are paying with phone apps. The future is here.
1	1522989803	32	Paying thru phone apps via qr code has already been around for Years. Nothing revolutionary here.
2	1522992199	17	This guys right. Denmark has had MobilePay for years and it works seamlessly. But of course you fedora tippers have to give angry downboats because it goes against your narrative. 
3	1523028766	2	and even chinese street vendors and beggars use qr codes to receive payments and donations for at least 3 years already.
4	1523032354	1	am awaiting the day where street hookers will have chip readers implanted in their ass, so to pay you swipe your phone thru their cheeks.. 
5	1523033016	2	Some of them have qr tattoos in Las vegas
6	1523033816	2	> qr tattoostemporary tattoos
2	1523007210	3	Yeah, and as someone who lives in the UK where we have contactless terminals everywhere, I would *not* start paying with QR codes that require me to unlock my phone every time. I love crypto adoption, but it needs to be done right.
3	1523011914	3	Mobile wallet linked to mobilepay app which requires finger print scan to unlock, transfer, lock cycle upon placing phone on/near the contactless reader.    That is as simple and safe as i could think on the spot. Just like Apple pay? I think you need to place your finger on the button for it to accept the payment correct? I can already use Samsung pay for things which is linked to my bank card/account so why not a wallet which i can pre-load with funds?
4	1523013132	2	I use Google Pay which has some strange heuristic way of when to ask you for your fingerprint to pay, along with anytime you try anything above £30, but most of the time you'll just have to turn the screen on, authentication isn't necessary. And yeah, a crypto wallet that could do NFC payments would be amazing.
5	1523020078	1	> a crypto wallet that could do NFC payments would be amazing.I can't imagine something like that being too hard to code. I'm surprised it's not a thing yet. I mean i could send crypto to friends/family by loading the Crypto app and choosing to send 0.002ETH to them using nothing but NFC. Maybe a little pop up like the Nano ledger which asks you to confirm how much you're about to send etc...    If this was a thing i could see way more shops opening up to using crypto for payments.
4	1523032266	1	yuck. as someone who lives a life of debauchery, i don't want to have to scan my finger print to pay everywhere i go. eliminates possible deniability. 
3	1523018823	1	Yeah payments have to be done with NFC or it's not going to get mainstream adoption. The first crypto to achieve that will be a huge milestone.
4	1523028920	1	you have to add as many options as possible. NFC, QR, SMS, 1 Click pay, etc. Adoption comes when something is useful and easy to use.
2	1523020526	1	No shit. How could my comment be construed as anything other than sarcasm? Of course paying with a phone isn't anything life changing.
3	1523032515	1	fuck you man, crypto will free the masses from corporate and institutional oppression. ;p
2	1523029817	1	We have had it 100% adopted in China for some time now
2	1522992487	-12	Oh my god, have you ever, ever even tried to research what exactly a BLOCKCHAIN does? God I hate reddit
3	1523000167	1	Hi sorry what a blockchain is? So sorry i have invested 80% of my savings without knowing what a chainblock or internet money whatever they call it. Again sorry for not saying something that is Bullish to your precious moon dream.There is NOTHING revolutionary with what the news is trying to bullish on. Of course the blockchain tech behind the whole cashless ecosystem is game changing, but what makes it revolutionary that an average users want to hop on it? The method of payment with mobile has been around for years and i have been using it for years, almost 0 second for a transcation to confirm and yes Z-E-R-0 Fees.There is no point for anyone to switch from a payment that is already there and even better faster than what crypto is trying to offer. Not even considering the learning curve for a new user to go through with all the understanding of blockchain and crypto is all about. Get my point? There are tons of people out there literally outright assuming crypto is a mlm or scam.Sorry for long text and broken english. 
4	1523002549	4	Ever tried running a business with paypal and getting your funds frozen for 6 months without a reason? Going bankrupt because of thaz? Happened to dozens. Yeah, totally no reason to use a decentralized currency here where this is impossible to happen. Yeah.
4	1523002428	2	Ever tried sending money to greece during the austerity period in 2013? Yeah, theres zero reason to use a currency that isnt centrally controlled and cant just be frozen because some Bank decides it. 
5	1523002883	2	That will be a whole new topic you are trying to discuss...my friend.
6	1523004050	-1	NO ITS NOT. 
5	1523032709	1	he was talking about the dude scanning a QR code to buy coffee, like in the video... you're taking this out of context. 
6	1523038246	1	this is not all that is to it. god damn. its a big difference if you pay for something with a qr code via a centralized shitsystem or via the blockchain. so hard to get?
4	1523001511	1	Yeah, I haven’t used cash in several years, just contactless payment and mobilepay with no fees. Crypto as a currency will change nothing for me, blockchain tech has a future though
5	1523010077	2	Reduction in fees on the sellers side as they pay a little each time you use card or mobile pay could lead to cheaper prices for you, though not sure that such small savings is ever really likely to convert people to using crypto for everyday purchases. More likely we'll see the banks eventually convert to using blockchain tech, and maybe reduce fees a little.
6	1523010551	1	IMO consumers will never really start to use crypto as currency, but banks and Visa/mastercard could start using blockchain to reduce transaction fees but still charge retailers and banks smaller fees. Visa makes a lot of money on fees, that’s not going to change 
5	1523032938	1	i'd totally use crypto if i had to pay someone over seas.. otherwise i wouldn't bother.. unless i'm getting payed in crypto, i will use USD for local purchases... 
4	1523002269	-3	Oh god fuck off. Im done with reddit idiots
5	1523032776	1	go take a nap.
0	1522999145	2	Man . . . could we find a better rep?
0	1522995147	0	Flare isn't comedy, huh? surprising
0	1522983022	-11	Wow, what a great coin.  Low fees, instant transactions, research partnerships with Arizona State, invented the treasury and incentivized Masternode system, 50-plus full time employees, thousands of people showing up for their world wide conferences in places like Venzuela, another game changing platform on the horizon with Evolution this year, defensive patents filed. Wow.
1	1522988793	29	Hey look we found the Dash employee
1	1522987360	40	Wow, what a great coin, centralized, government backdoors, fake privacy, nepotistic masternode allocation, shameless adoring shill posts. Wow.
2	1522987935	8	don't forget the low fees. as if paywave and banks have high fees. or any fees at all lmao? 
2	1522988002	8	I would encourage you to stop lying....not going to waste time debunking all of your claims as it's been done elsewhere. It's been interesting to see crypto communities go after each other like this... Our fight is with the old fiat banking system and not each other. 
3	1522988572	6	Does anyone here have an explanation as to why DASH isn't a standard coin on DNMs?
4	1522993090	8	because monero
4	1523000556	0	Someone might be able to go into more detail but from what I understand it’s privacy features aren’t sufficient for DNMs. For the time being I believe Monero is considered to be the most secure privacy coin.
5	1523008142	4	Monero privacy has been broken before.  If you fork monero and use both coins, you destroy its privacy because it makes transactions traceable. If future technology can break Monero privacy than every transaction will be broken. We will see people being arrested for purchases they made 20 years in the past. Dash uses stenography and essentially hides your transaction like a grain of sand on a beach. Every single Dash mix would have to be independently broken amounting to billions in government expenditures.  Dash private send has never been broken. There is a sizable reward for doing so.
6	1523014960	3	Monero isn’t perfect and the issue with using forked chains needs to be addressed but it is fairly secure otherwise due to ring signatures. Some of the potential problems I see with Dash is its reliance on trusted Masternodes to mix coins and private send sucks to use. Since the transactions themselves aren’t necessarily private you have trust that the masternodes aren’t keeping records or being surveilled. Private send also can take a solid amount of time and isn’t supported on all wallets. You are are right that private send on Dash has not been broken though and currently works as intended.Edit: a word
4	1522995323	-2	Its privacy mechanism is usable on BTC, and it's not great. Dash is a fucking scam. Slightly better than verge, imo. At least it's not being actively destroyed.
2	1523007391	2	Government backdoors?
2	1522996070	1	Don't forget it was premined, burned coins but didn't change values ratio-wise at all, and it was called Darkcoin (right?) probably for the sole purpose of being used for shady stuff specifically on the dark web
2	1522996964	-3	Not to mention that the entire masternode concept is just questionable. Why would someone deserve to get a buttload of all the mined money just for paying for a node and keeping it running? The miners do the real work, they should get the rewards.  But of course, that would prevent the creator of Dash from (probably) owning half the masternodes and pocketing hundreds of grand in masternode money on a regular basis for really doing nothing.
3	1523018362	1	Because these stakeholders perform services in a decentralized way that can't be shutdown, and they make decisions for the direction of the project. The stakeholders have the most to lose if the project fails.  Simple logic.  Surprised you can't grasp it. 
1	1522983683	8	Actually they're up to 70 full time employees but other than that an accurate and succinct post! 
1	1522996028	-2	The shillist of shills
0	1523019365	1	Amazing to see how far we have come, and being able to use it on regularly
0	1523028883	1	Damn, at least use Ethereum or Litecoin.
0	1523030697	1	I'm in crypto because of ideals, not for making a quick buck.  And DASH goes against everything that Satoshi stands for.  I don't want a coin that's controlled by a select few (Masternode holders) to dictate monetary policy.  DASH is just a coin where the rich get richer and control everyone else, no different from what many people here are against.DASH does one thing very well: make it's early adopters and creator money with the huge instamine and Masternodes.  Masternode holders are paid 45% of all the mined coins.  Miners are taxed another 10% to pay for things such as the Troll Patrol, and only the Masternode owners get to vote how those coins are spent.Top posts about DASH in this sub (https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=dash):[DASH Was a Planned Instamine - Brief History of Dash.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7iuzcg/dash_was_a_planned_instamine_brief_history_of_dash/)[More than 70% of Dash coins are currently held by masternodes (each requiring at least 1000 Dash.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7wai58/more_than_70_of_dash_coins_are_currently_held_by/)[Evidence of Dash heavy wash-trading.

1	1523038631	1	Tell me how the non-masternode systems are less centralized? In Bitcoin you have core making decisions. In Dash their core team don't have that power.
1	1523033019	1	damn... fuck dash, why wouldn't i just use USD?
0	1522980861	-3	Smh, Dash....
0	1523012042	0	Did he purchase cryptocurrency with cryptocurrency too?
1	1523013419	5	he gets paid in crypto
0	1523009326	-2	thats very foolish in the bear market llike that.
1	1523013139	6	If everyone holds, no one makes money.
1	1523024172	1	Well, seeing how he gets paid and DASH and, like most humans, he requires food and water to survive, I would assume that he has no other choice right now.
1	1523032377	1	What is the point of crypto? Speculation? It's foolish in a bull market too.
0	1523002842	0	DDDDDDDDDash.
0	1523031930	0	So where this guy lives there are gas stations that accept Dash, garages that accept Dash, super markets that accept Dash. Basically everything he needs in his life he buys with dash. Is that true? 
0	1523023950	-2	As Chris Rock once said: “You can drive your car with your feet if you want to. That don’t make it a good fuckin idea.”
0	1523014475	-5	Dash. Lol that shady piece of shit crypto.
1	1523017407	2	Why?
2	1523020477	2	Because he doesn't hold it
2	1523024128	1	Dash was just a random premined scam coin that happened to get popular.Here's a good video summary https://youtu.be/xBxbiH_Mg44
3	1523026258	0	This has all been discussed in great detail and is just more of the same ol same ol butthurt. No one cares about the lies and FUD by paid trolls to discredit the amazing work being done by dash core. So please stop your FUD. Thanks. 
4	1523028921	2	Help me understandHow is [history](https://dashpay.atlassian.net/wiki/plugins/servlet/mobile?contentId=19759164#content/view/19759164) FUD?Please and thank you.
4	1523037278	1	Are you part of the Troll Patrol? You fucking piece of shit
3	1523024235	-1	They have active dev and PR teams and a big network. They have original development of new technology. If it looks like a duck...
4	1523024465	1	 That has nothing to do with how and why it was started.DASH was started as a scamcoin to get the creator rich. He just ended up getting so incredibly rich. He made it a "legit" coin. Edit: Just to be clear. DASH isn't an exit scam potential coin anymore. Now it's a safe investment, but it absolutely didn't start this way.
