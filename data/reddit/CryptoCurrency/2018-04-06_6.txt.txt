1	1523023278	5	I don't get it.
0	1522967334	205	Mega shills. CNBC puts all other shills to fucking shame. CNBC are like final boss skill level
1	1522985696	16	Shillo Khoin
1	1522984961	7	probably the same social media guy from emc2 that shilled mindblowing announcement
2	1522994917	11	OMG ðŸ˜­Haha, my minds still blown from that huge annoucement from Einsteinium.  ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
3	1522995542	2	Still picking up the pieces from my blown mind Stings just thinking about it :-)
1	1522983112	-3	Not CNN
2	1522999239	5	it's all the same
3	1523028955	2	As opposed to what, Sinclair?
0	1522985329	37	I don't get it
1	1522990829	26	Me neither, someone halp.
2	1522992218	53	They were assuming the big announcement was going to be a coin added to the exchange... it was something a lot less exciting because I read what it was and already forgot.  
3	1522992260	4	Lol, ok, I was wondering why I didn't hear about it, I assumed it was 5pm ET tomorrow. Thanks.
4	1522992342	1	Np! :) 
3	1522994984	4	Withdraw of BTC shitfork coins.
3	1522997054	2	venture fund 
3	1523023136	1	What? It's something a lot more exciting than another stupid coin being added. Coinbase is getting more serious than just being another exchange with lots of unregulated coins.
3	1523023750	1	Adding all the forks isn't a bad thing, and the venture fund is actually pretty big news.  But since people's guesses didn't get added, nobody regards it.
3	1523031958	1	hahahah shill of the shentury 
1	1522997976	5	people expected them to announce a new coin listing, however they announced that their users are going to be able to keep forked coins on their coinbase accounts. (like, if there's a new bitcoin cash, you don't have to put it on your private wallet to get the coins) 
0	1522968521	54	Bitcoin super platinum gold diamond etc etc etc 
1	1522978598	16	Bitcoin pewter.  Crypto has temporarily lost some of its lustre.
2	1522997339	4	Bitcoin talc. Because nobody realized that talc was a precious gemstone
1	1522981405	5	Bitcoin STEAMHalf-Life 3 ...confirmed?
1	1522983012	5	Bitcoin McBitface
2	1522992928	3	Bitcooooooooonect!
1	1522999317	2	LiteBitcoinConnectCash Premium
1	1523008699	2	Bitcoin Oak.
0	1522984509	35	This venture fund announcement will have a bigger impact than people realize. Coinbase, Binance and the like are swimming in capital. This will give projects with strong fundamentals a huge advantage over the pump and dumps that we have been seeing over the past 12-24 months. Get ready for the consolidation ladies and gentlemen. The tide is clearly going out and we will soon learn who the skinny dippers are
1	1522986707	8	100% agree.Great analysis
1	1523004006	2	That. And it will make crypto-investing more accessible to more people. Which is good for influx of new fiat. Which we need to get the bear out.
1	1523029016	1	Does the fund still include bitcoin cash?
1	1523011998	-3	EOs is already ahead of all of them with their VC funds.
0	1522981304	59	Doge or garlicoin would be awesome on Coinbase, everyone would lose their collective shit and the market would turn into proper madness
1	1522992951	8	Doge is pretty likely
2	1522998500	10	Much certainty
1	1522999351	3	best april fools joke
1	1522989626	3	Xvg would be astounding in the worse way possible....  ~ my head would explode and i would stop crypto'ing all together in that event...   the world just would not be right.
2	1523023701	1	XVG and TRX would make the "experts" of this sub explode lol
2	1522994599	0	Yes I would support XVG being added! Fuck coinbase, tbh. 
3	1522994968	2	Fuck em both tbh.
4	1522996988	1	With all my heart
0	1522965452	15	Thank god it wasn't just a stupid next coin announcement. People need to stop worrying about when that will be. Actual announcement is much better
1	1522982320	-30	Every Coinbase announcement has been wack. Just put XRP on it.
2	1523029067	1	Nobody wants your fucking bank coin.  Go petition Wells Fargo to sell XRP.
0	1522992483	6	I don't know who the next coin is but I'm confident that NANO and BAT will end up on CB one day.  Probably 2-3 years from now.
1	1523029402	2	I hold Nano, so it hurts me to say this, but I doubt they would add Nano, because coinbase is used mostly as a passthrough to get funds to other exchanges.  NANO's feeless, instant, structure, would pull all the volume from their other coins as everyone defaults to Nano as a pass through.
0	1522978082	54	NANO
1	1522986418	4	I wish it would be.
2	1522986967	3	looking at top 30 coins, there aren't many contenders beyond Stellar & Dash. 
3	1522987521	11	Monero 
4	1522987661	8	They'll never do a privacy coin like monero. Not when USD is involved. 
4	1522988252	4	Monero is currently associated with quite a lot of risks. So I am a bit hesitant (on the coinbase part)
3	1522991641	5	ZRX, BAT, OMG, XMR are very likely
4	1523002744	3	Agree OMG. But mainly because I hold OMG. 
5	1523007187	-4	Coinbase is going to add OMG mainly because you hold it? I was listing the most likely tokens/coins, not the ones I hope are going to be added. 
6	1523008282	3	I was kidding. But I do see OMG or Steller being some possible listed coins if coins are being listed. I donâ€™t think this is a route that will be taken. My thoughts are that the announcement wonâ€™t state any coins but will state that they will now be open to listing ERC20 coins and not just coins with their own blockchain. This would be a fundamental shift. It could be possible a dedicated ERC20 or NEP-5 etc exchange could be announced. This to me would get around their constraint of what coins they would list in Coinbase but still allow them a foothold. Theyâ€™ve missed out for too long. As a final thought having just a list of coins like CMC seems obsolete now. We need some division like we do with stocks on FTSE100 etc. Try to ween out the penny stocks in some way. This would help institutional buyers looking at creating indexes etc. Coinbase could take the lead on this.Just some ramblings but can see how this may unfold. 
7	1523033125	1	A NEP-5 exchange would completely go against Brians long term vision for Coinbase and Toshi so I guess that is also based on some shittoken you own on NEO.  It really is a shame that you can never have an objective discussion on this subreddit, everyone is just trying their hardest to hype the shit they hold at the moment no matter the subject of the discussion. 
3	1522989264	0	Honestly i can't see it being anything else but Ripple. I don't want it to be Ripple. Stellar Dash or Nano would be awesome thoEdit: i meant to say 'I don't want it to be Ripple'
4	1523023414	2	Why on earth would they add ripple though?
4	1523029176	2	The last time they were on, they were asked if they would ever add xRP, their response was they won't be adding coins that are majority owned by its authors. 
4	1522993743	1	Do you hold Ripple?
5	1522994266	2	No, i'm kind of against it.
1	1522981027	7	Actually Maybe 
2	1522990504	8	I'm not the only one that remembers the other month when the Nano team met up with some people from coinbase, showed their app to whoever they did (i forget), went out partying after in celebration of something they couldn't tell us, then when asked in the discord about Coinbase they replied with the zipper face emoji, right?
3	1522990577	7	yes
3	1522991786	6	Nano strong?
3	1523000377	-9	It's not like the nano team has done something shady to pump their shitcoin in the past...
4	1523031654	1	no, they haven't, you're right. 
5	1523032008	1	except for paying shills to mass shill XRB back in December
6	1523032072	1	Wow, imagine if that happened, that'd be an issue. good thing it didn't happen.
4	1523011844	1	Jesus fucking christ how do tards like yourself justify Nano as being a shitcoin? I mean ffs, do some fucking research and use your brain.
5	1523012871	1	Uuuuh let me see. The whole rise of nano was because shills were paid to shill it on this subreddit. It's a shitcoin that's been delisted from bittrex and cryptopia because it's been bug-ridden from the start. The devs hold more than 51% of the voting power so its centralized. The devs told people that bitgrail is fine to use days before they exit scammed. The whole point of it is to be used as a currency but nobody uses it as a currency so its useless. 
6	1523029294	1	I cant even begin to respond to this post.  Take the tin hat off and try again.  Holy fucking shit yo.
7	1523029359	1	These are all claims coming from actual sources. But let me see you try and disprove one. 
8	1523029646	1	The sources are not your issue, the twisting of each source, is your issue.  Let's start with one.  Prove to me, with a viable sources that Nano Devs, performed an exit scan before the Bomber news leaked.  Before you start bullshitting, I want you to know, I lived through this, day by day, consuming it all, so prepare for dates and times proving your bullshit wrong.
9	1523031548	1	Zack Shapiro literally told some person in a tweet, days before the bitgrail exit scam, that bomber is a trustworthy guy and everything over at bitgrail is fine. I never said the devs did the exit scam, im just saying it's very suspect how Zack Shapiro told a stranger on twitter to trust bomber with his money days before the exit scam. 
0	1522968360	4	You heard it here first BUY $...
0	1522973020	4	Someone holding all this stuff back.  Need more coins 
1	1522977741	4	I think it's going to be a LOT of them, not just one. Basically, launch a trading set like Binance. That way it's less likely to be accused of insider knowledge and trading. Granted, yes, the staff could hold all coins or something, but after BCash I doubt they'll list a single coin again.
0	1522990908	5	This oughta be considered market manipulation
1	1523012615	3	except it doesnt effect the market in any way
0	1522980257	23	Stellar Lumens. Coinbase is San Francisco, they're in San Francisco, both want Silicon Valley to adopt and love them.  This can't be more obvious.
1	1522984528	7	Wouldn't complain 
1	1522988052	5	Seems like a bit of a stretch 
1	1523028248	1	Nebulas is in San Fran as well
1	1522985378	1	Another clue: Research the trioCoinbase + Barclays + Stellar
2	1522986205	-5	WRONG! It's going to be Tronx. Coinbase is on flat-earth, tronx is on flat-earth. Both want to be big and loved. This is obvious.
3	1522986234	3	Another clue: Research the dualCoinbase + Tronx
1	1522988528	-7	 r/HadronCoin They have an actual service already, although it's in alpha. It's based in the same area with people who have been working in silicon valley. It's a service that will have valid use in a high demand industry. Cloud based ai computations. Right now their alpha is just classifying images, but they have advisors on the team with a wide range of experience. From financial backgrounds to medical backgrounds.  It's still way too early for them to be listed on any markets, but if the announcement comes in a couple months it could be a very slim, but exciting, possiblity. 
2	1523000043	1	I could have bowled a strike with how hard my eyes rolled at their "ai-driven browser minable" promise
3	1523024453	1	Why? There is a working alpha right now. It's not "traditional" mining. It's like a browser based folding @ home that you receive coins for instead of feel good points.I'm confused why all the hate. It's not out of alpha, it's not on any exchanges and there have been no ico announcements. There is nothing to shill, I just like the project. I'm not overly concerned with the downvotes but I would like to know why, if any one is willing to explain their downvote. I understand if it's because it sounded like a shill post, but like I stated above, there isn't even anything to shill yet.
0	1522980427	10	Step 1: Be CNBCStep 2: Buy BAT, OMG, ZRX, XRPStep 3: Create announcements implying a new coin will be listed on CoinbaseStep 4: Sell the pumpsStep 5: Repeat in 2-3 weeks
1	1522981352	5	Exactly. Unregulated market you'd be stupid not to if you had a role like that. "we've heard rumours that ENG, NANO, XMR, AION, and/or VEN will be added to coinbase." - walk off set, open binance app, walk off smiling. 
0	1522978905	31	VERGE for sure. 100%. No doubt. 
1	1522979939	4	don't forget DGB! citibank challenge!! 
2	1523000083	1	Tfw 90% wonâ€™t get this reference smh 
3	1523023249	1	TLDR?
0	1522965062	5	Come on give it to us already 
0	1522966530	3	Cue the memes...
0	1522989416	5	Why does Coinbase still matter so much?
1	1522992227	5	God I hope Binance gets fiat to crypto figured out and just puts them out of business. The barriers to entry for crypto have crippled crypto acceptance and coinbase has gone along with the status quo. Fuck them.
2	1523001274	10	Except in reality Coinbase is extraordinarily simple to use for the general public, and if it wasn't for Coinbase we likely wouldn't have seen such a crazy rally this year because it would be harder to acquire crypto.And instead of hating Coinbase constantly when the only legitimate concern is their customer support, you could actually open your eyes and realize all they've done to the space. But no let's be an angry man on the internet complaining.
3	1523022578	1	You call them a savior, I call them a roadblock. You call me an angry man. I call you an idiot. We're not going to find common ground. 
1	1523000857	2	Because they're simple? How is that hard to understand.The reality is this market needs people who want to put their bucks in, but can't be bothered to understand blockchain or anything really.Coinbase is like a bank account, you pay, they take their share, you get your stuff. It's as easy as nicehash is for mining. One action and you're done.You CAN'T expect regular folk to be comfortable with actual listings and stock exchange, 90% of them have never done this in their lives. Coinbase is the approachable front gate. And people entering don't care they get charged few bucks. They prefer that rather than climbing the fence and going through sewers which is free.
0	1522967353	2	Wasn't that after the coinbase president spoke? Then they just speculated on the next coin? I could be wrong, I can't remember the order of events. 
1	1522968084	2	No, they put the headline up while he was speaking about shit no one cares about 
2	1522970134	5	[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9E9VlWkbjI)    It was after he made the announcement, they realized it wasn't what the viewers wanted to see so they had to spice it up a little bit. Around the 8:40 mark.
3	1522970242	0	Right. He was still babbling on though while it popped up, right?
4	1522970632	2	They asked him what coin would be next, but obviously he can't answer that. 
5	1522972084	1	Oh so it did air?What exactly did he talk about?
0	1523013447	2	It's unlikely but I'm hoping they add REQ, just released mainnet and both REQ and coinbase went through Y-combinator so maybe there is a good relationship already between the team's...all speculation of course.
0	1522964967	13	...XRP.
1	1522965338	21	Not my favorite coin and I don't hold any, but at this point I'm waiting for the American market to do something - anything - bullish.
1	1522983302	3	I wouldn't be surprised, might as well at this point. if you're going to put bitcoin forks up.
1	1522986469	2	It probably will be, i want it to be nano, but my bet is XRP
1	1522965174	1	I wish
0	1522974750	2	Eth classic...

0	1522976100	2	They're trollinh ripple God you guys
0	1522977289	1	They did this last time too
0	1522982524	1	Where can I buy ... ?
0	1522987535	1	5 or 6 give or take
0	1522987548	1	Wait, crypto is on TV?
1	1522993826	1	Yes.
0	1522992889	1	At least they are finally listing Garlicoin
0	1523008623	1	Coinbase should have never hyped their announcement. 
0	1523011215	1	They put this headline up well after the announcement, and they put it up right when they asked him what the next coin added to coinbase in the future would be. I don't think there is anything wrong with that headline, it's what they currently were discussing. 
0	1523023380	1	Coinbase should list NEO.
0	1523023670	1	NXT to moon
0	1523025849	1	CNBC always with have some shit going on.
0	1523030603	1	CNBC shilling their coin before listing.
0	1523032924	1	Very good change it was to get viewers 
0	1522981752	1	etherium classic for sure!!!
1	1522982674	1	I bet they stay away from forks because of all the mother fuckers that will bitch about the coins that are owed to them. OMG is the only for sure coin i can guess. Ill be stocking up all year till it happens. 
0	1522983127	1	So I don't get it what's the announcement?
0	1522995793	1	Lol at CNBC for putting up Bcash like it belongs with the others
0	1523020864	1	CNBC shouldnt be allowed to talk about crypto
