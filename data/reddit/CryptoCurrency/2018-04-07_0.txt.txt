0	1523068613	339	Their blockchain was hacked at least 2 days ago but the price keeps going up and up this week?Nothing fishy there...
1	1523071100	328	over 100 million coins fraudulently mined in the past 48 hours. Verge up 15%it seriously makes zero sense
2	1523087414	51	I don't want to be right but, I think there are people that don't understand what a hard-fork is but they know the term from Bitcoin.  When Bitcoin does a hard-fork it usually gains value (because people want the free coins), so they think "hard-fork = positive news = price pump".
3	1523114139	1	Honestly, as a Day Trader Verge has been great over the last week. Two reasons: "Buy the rumor, sell the news". And just because it's been crazy volatile and easy to trade. Loving this shitcoin right now.That could explain the unlogical price movement. There are many traders out there.
2	1523085787	39	Nahh it make sense.1 - Hackers buy the order book up a high price.2 - They set a sell wall at that higher price.3 - Then they start slowly buying into their own sell wall at the higher price.4 - Eventually other people see the Verge pump and start buying into the hacker's sell wall at the higher price.
3	1523096839	23	Yup that's pretty much what we call "painting the tape". It'd make sense.
4	1523103494	5	What color are you painting the tape?
5	1523103751	24	With blood from bad investors.
5	1523107984	1	Green or red, duh...
5	1523115747	1	with Verge diareah
3	1523112504	2	They'd have to buy dumpers' sales as well in order for their wall to be effective.   
2	1523072396	32	Can you show where it was 100 million??  Just curious.  I have already read a dozen half truths here.  I have no issue with the criticism but things need to be right either way.
3	1523087084	76	Its a blockchain, you can verify it on your own. Attacker mining a few blocks every second for days now,  block time is meant to be 30 seconds. No one can send tx's because he doesn't bother to include them. This is a known bug from 2015 that the retarded dev didn't fix in the code he copy pasted from other coins. Attacker is still minting coins, Dev says they won't rollback the chain so now there's a lot more coins in circulation then there should be. Honestly wouldn't be surprised if its an inside job. https://verge-blockchain.info
3	1523100477	12	i dont know the exact numbers but i know the hack went on for about 48 hours on and off.  lets be conservative and say it was only active for 24 of those hours.1560 (xvg) * 60 (seconds) * 60 (minutes) * 24 (hours) = 134,784,000 XVG.Even if it's *half* that, that's still 60 million XVG. ($3,850,000 USD)I'm sure there are more precise analyses available.
4	1523103414	1	Well, but these coins should be nullified when the hardfork is pushed through? My concern is more so, what happens to the coins that come to existence *right now*. They hardfork, to roll back in time right? Doesn't that mean, that anything that is traded right now is pretty much zero value? Do they have a plan for that? Are they just *somehow* rolling back the  hacked coins? Also, is the forked version secure or is that *another* fix that accomplishes nothing? Questions over questions.
5	1523104285	3	again i must qualify that I'm not overly informed on the ins and outs of the situation, but as far as I'm aware they will not be reverting to an earlier block.in layman's terms, a hard fork just means you're changing something about the code that isn't backwards compatible, it doesnt mean rolling back. (as opposed to a soft fork, which *is* backwards compatible meaning you dont have to upgrade your wallet etc).So no, as far as im aware, the coins that were fraudulently mined will not be disregarded. if they *did* roll back, it wouldnt just cancel out all the coins that were mined, it would also cancel out all the transactions that happened on the chain after the point you rolled back to. think of what a disruption this would be to exchanges etc who have bought/sold verge for real money since that time.there are a lot of very informed people who have and are saying not very favourable things about verge. the fact that an attack of this nature can happen is a bit of an indictment of the dev team. we must remember that this wasnt just some wallet or exchange hack that you read about where some incompetent boob had their private keys stolen, its the *xvg blockchain itself*.this is like the difference between robbing a bank (which was always going to still be possible in crypto), and counterfeiting money (which for a correctly made cryptocurrency should be impossible). without the blockchain's integrity you literally have nothing.

Pretty much nullify everything up to a certain point. > again i must qualify that I'm not overly informed on the ins and outs of the situation, but as far as I'm aware they will not be reverting to an earlier block.So that means, that the hacker still is hacking more coins for himself, which are will be sold on the market? I mean the last info I received is that the fix didn't do anything and people are currently waiting for the fork and that's it? > without the blockchain's integrity you literally have nothingWell best case scenario in my head is trying to find a fix and pretty much hoping that it doesn't happen again - for XVG investors. I'd be selling while it's green personally if I was invested. Never saw a reason to inves in Verge, because I see Monero not having these problems. A privacy coin is a good thing and competition among privacy coins in my honest opinion is also not a bad thing per se.  I really hope they can somehow control the situation. One more question by the way. Is the lead developer a known person or does he just run by nickname Dogecoindark on forums and not more? Is there someone who's accountable for damage caused? Since we're talking about a privacy coin, I feel like it would be even more easy to just run away with all the money and exit scam people. Comments on Verge surging 15%, *despite* the blockchain being unsafe as is? Is that really dumb money for the annoucement coming in, or do you speculate some "safety for investors pumping"? https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/verge/ I mean this is just scary right? A hack of this magnitued, caused by a shitt coded chain, and no reaction to the price whatsoever? We did have a drop to .053 yesterday, but now it's back up to .063? What in the fuck is going on? This doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Feel bad for all the Verge people. 
7	1523108193	3	Don't feel bad for them. They're pretty happy in their bubble/island. If you head over to r/vergecurrency, you'll mostly see the opposite of what's on here; people telling each other it's alright etc. I mean the thing is, I don't expect the verge sub to be all "we're gonna die" but I didn't expect them to be all "oh death is a beautiful thing" either, its the two extremes, the lack of balance is worrying. That being said, yes, there will be no roll backs as per Sunerok aka Dogecoindark, "we roll forward" he said. I can't confirm that the attack is over. There has been SS of the telegram with admin claiming the attack is over, but no announcements on reddit/twitter.About the dev, you can find him on twitter, he's known. In my view this whole episode should be on the developers.
7	1523111595	1	not sure whether the fixes that have been put in place have solved the current problem, but if not then yep the hacker can just get more coins and sell them. i know *some* attempts were made, but by all reports that was more of a mad scramble by a dev who didnt know what he was doing.if by "known person" you mean not completely anonymous, then yes. but as its a cryptocurrency, im not sure that there are any regulations which hold him or anyone else accountable to people who have or will lost money.as for the price movements... that one baffles me. my sense is that people who have verge tokens won't listen to any bad news, since there were some pretty big red flags before all this - so a savvy investor wouldn't have invested in the first place. so its a market made of entirely uniformed/willfully ignorant people. but yes, its troubling. i read somewhere that this is a *heavy* indicator that crypto, or at the very *very* least verge, is deep in bubble territory.
3	1523097681	6	Erm math. So with the hack since its still happening 1560xvg is being farmed every second so how many days or hours has it been going for so far? 
3	1523090085	-23	Yeah I'm pretty sure that's straight up fud. I've seen this number spouted several times but no one can give a link to the address that proves that. In telegram they are saying the amount of coins mined was closer to  200k
4	1523091768	7	Do you believe what some cavern telegram moderator is saying? Those mods weren't even aware of what was happening until yesterday
5	1523093127	-2	I'm not saying I trust verge at all. Seems scammy as fuck that they would need 2 mil just to release the name of a partner. It's bizarre and I don't think that happens in normal business dealings let alone with a Fortune 500.But with that said, it should be extremely easy for a redditor to post a link to the explorer proving that 50 million fraudulent coins were mined. As sketchy as verge is, the burden of proof is still on the person claiming that 50 million coins were mined.
6	1523093944	4	Easy maths. They mine one block a second. They have been mining since block X with breaks. Each mined block = 1,560 XVG. You may look at the bitcointalk thread to find out more about the number of blocks (or at least the intervals) mined this way.I believe we are closer to 50m than 100m, however, I do not see the devs doing anything. We could see 100m until something is done about it
2	1523072277	12	The cult mentality is strong with this one.
2	1523072276	9	only thing I can think of is that while they were doing their best to sweep it under the rug (deleting posts on reddit relating to it, even asking honest questions resulted in bans) there was a conveniently timed forbes article/post about Verge so a bunch of clueless victims have been drawn in again due to hype.The timing of the attack was probably deliberate, in typical verge style they announced a few days prior that there was going to be a forbes article coming out.
3	1523081627	7	> forbes article/postWas it actually Forbes or was it one of those Forbes blog sites? 
4	1523084717	6	It was just a sponsored article (verge said they didn’t pay for it). 
4	1523082922	3	I saw this on Crypto news app (April 3) https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/04/theres-just-no-stopping-verge/
2	1523103450	1	That's a lot of coins.
2	1523073955	0	Does korea know about the hack?
3	1523077108	2	It’s been posted on crypto news channels, but dunno how many people actually read the damned things.
2	1523094010	0	It may be that actual miners were usually selling off their verge creating sell pressure but for some reason the hacker isn't. A strange theory but it would explain why Verge has less sellers.
1	1523081848	36	its 1 am and im stoned.. reading 'fishy' made me want fish tacos. damn it.
2	1523082173	-14	[removed]
3	1523082469	4	Depends, how does your wife's cunt look and taste?I like my fish fresh. Just the flesh. 
4	1523103788	1	pause nigga
1	1523086673	5	this is totally not what you call a whale pump and dump, nope not at all, and nope, xvg has never been used for this in the past, nope nope nope.
1	1523092890	2	You haven’t seen CTR. Arrested for fraud and yet it still pump. 
1	1523104603	2	Kind explains everything about Verge.
1	1523100194	1	How did à blockchain get hacked, I thought one of the key tenants of blockchain was it's cryptographically secure. 
2	1523103662	8	It depends on the coding. There can be bugs/exploits but usually big decentralized chains like BTC’s the code is thoroughly reviewed by devs and the community then launched on testnet before being released. I don’t think Verge falls into that category
3	1523104606	1	Ah I see 
2	1523112826	1	>key tenantsTenants are individuals who rent property.  *Tenets* are principles or beliefs that form part of a system of thought.
2	1523103299	-7	No transactions got hacked.  No coin holders lost money.  It was an exploit in some old code relating only to the mining of coins.  and it was some pro-group of Iranian hackers apparently called (IDC-Team) who may have hacked HBO for an attempted 6 million a few years ago (not like it was some kid in a basement or something.)  Anyway..with the price going up on the announcement I guess they figured now would be a good time to use whatever exploit they were sitting on.  It allowed them to pretty much just keep pumping out the mining bonus on new coins every 30 seconds..instead of legit miners getting it.  and it only was about 1% of total supply.   99% of supply not effected.    So no user transactions were hacked.   Everyone's coins are safe, and HBO is clearly out of business...(don't listen to all the FUD)  and the coin is going up..because what some of these people cannot comprehend on here...it has a broad appeal to many common users who might not be sitting on this thread (and new users cannot even post on here, as under 100 karma can't post..and they downvote most people who like Verge..so..how many will even have over 100 karma...not a lot...its a feedback loop of stupid in here ...as 90% of the rest of the world does not care what fancy tech or great "team" some coin has that they back...the world does not care.)This is what IBM must have felt like..when they figured out a dude in a garage had beaten them...it is desperation ..they even come into our Verge thread and down vote innocuous posts from Verge fans...and if they were smart they would realize they could just siphon some of those Verge fans in a year or so if they think their coins will be so much better..once those people adopt crypto.  Instead they bash newbies and don't even let them post on here for the most part...and wonder why there is almost no adoption in crypto and prices are down lol....Verge's price is up....The jealousy is rampant and comes out as nonstop desperate FUD...this is in no way good for crypto...let people join a coin and if it has problems..then they have ADOPTED crypto..and then they MIGHT USE YOUR COIN LATER ON. WOW SO GENIUS.  INSTEAD OF BASHING NEWBIES AND THEN YOU HAVE 0 ADOPTION.  Some of you people on here are beyond stupid....Pettiness...makes you lose and then people are even LESS likely to use your coin when your community made fun of them before etc.   Do you people realize any of this ?  You call Verge dumb....(the people in this thread who will probably now downvote this post...)
3	1523105686	3	A code hack is an extremely serious problem. Actually it's even more of a problem than your alternative scenarios. It means the rudimentary fabric of a project is flawed.And the identity of a hacker is meaningless - it's the identity of the code that's under scrutiny.And the argument of - criticizing verge means soiling all of crypto - well, then good. Anyone accepting crypto as inherently good and risk-free is a danger to themselves. Let the projects with real value prove themselves against all odds.  Rather than "writing verge off the list", people should have a completely empty list and only ever add to it through extreme testing and personal research (and time).
4	1523109649	0	Well you haven't learned anything yet...you are not the arbiter of what is a "good" coin or not...many of you even believe in decentralization...and then want to essentially centralize only a select few coins that you think people should use.  That defeats the entire purpose  of crypto.  You have learned nothing....
1	1523103087	1	Nothing to see here, move along. Move along
1	1523109381	1	I am a crytpo newbie and I wonder why. Have stop trading for a week, too many nonsense happening
1	1523081581	1	Buys in anticipation of announcement, me thinks.
1	1523103646	-1	It's almost like alt coins are a bubble.  
0	1523068893	333	Here's what I think is going on with Verge.* Dev needs to pay taxes as he stated publically* His Crypto locked up in Coinbase* Creates Partnership to drive hype and create buy orders as he sells off his stack* He will then be caught out so he needs a way to get his coins back.* He is the person hacking verge. He allows the hack to go on for some time, he's not against stopping it and basically forces the community to take the hit.* Due to Verge having Wraith protocol (you can send anonymously) he then sends the hacked coins back into his wallet.* Next he hard forks, his wallet is full, his bank account is full, his taxes are paid and no one is the wiser. * Partnership falls through due to the hack, he can literally name any company and no one will be able to confirm or deny it.> What is Wraith Protocol?> Wraith Protocol is a technology that allows the user to seamlessly switch between public and private ledgers on the Verge Blockchain. For the first time, users are now free to choose which ledger they want to utilize.> > To break it down, when Wraith Protocol is turned ON — t**he transaction data is hidden and not visible via the blockchain explorer**.That last paragraph is what allows all this to happen but it also more that the 'hacker' will likely never be found.> In addition, Verge provides total obfuscation of IP addresses in both cases, thanks to the most advanced version of TOR integrated in the Core Wallet. In combination with Wraith Protocol, it makes Verge the only truly untraceable cryptocurrency.Quotes are from this post https://medium.com/verge-currency-xvg/what-is-the-wraith-protocol-bd1dfb289cda
1	1523071910	127	He probably Shapeshifted it to Monero tbh
2	1523088895	46	I highly doubt Verge can hide transactional data, he should have just forked Monero instead of Dogecoin lol.
3	1523090474	53	For a moment I forgot Verge used to be 'Dogecoindark'.
4	1523094073	26	Hard to take them seriously, considering that origin story.
5	1523094487	41	> origin story.Love the idea of it being a supervillains origin story DogeDark   Much hack       Much Bad.       Much origin
5	1523111755	1	It's even harder to take it seriously considering every other aspect of its history and existence. Dogecoin is a beacon of respectability in comparison.
3	1523090714	11	It never forked dogecoin, legit said this a million times, it shared name with dogecoin but never forked off it.
4	1523090999	33	That doesn't make Verge any less of a meme.
5	1523091111	10	Well there is a bunch of half truths on this subreddit that people take at face value. Not saying criticism is not deserved for verge, it absolutely is. However this is a perfect example of a blatant lie that refuses to die
6	1523104332	3	Yea like there is still lots of code even very recently from other coins.  See "opalcoin" in the commit here.  https://github.com/vergecurrency/VERGE/commit/e3612923a51016fc78e470d9e15a744d6ad64cb5Maybe lie is not that blatant?
4	1523104131	2	It's not a lot of original work.  Why do you think they are pulling patches from *old* Dodge based gits?
4	1523092355	-2	Yeah i know, it forked from ppc, but its a good meme
1	1523084624	60	Wraith doesn **NOT** make tx anonymous.
1	1523069295	42	A reckoning needs to come down on this twat so hard.
2	1523071367	35	vergefam trying to keep up the vergescam. I am proud to be banned from /r/vergecurrency.Mindless bans == you have something to hide. Everyone you ban is a potential anti-marketer for the coin, they are really idiots. I would never have said any of these things about verge, but the ban really opened my eyes.
1	1523082597	37	you give  Wraith too much credit.
1	1523078833	30	Umm Wraith doesn't make anything anonymous lol. Can still track the money through the blockchain. 
1	1523074294	6	Actually, apparent [the "partnership" is fine, oddly enough.](https://i.imgur.com/jDFbSfh.jpg)
2	1523110081	1	Thanks for the great news, guy in nyancat avatar!
2	1523116464	1	Yeah they need the money to pile in until the day of.  Then it will suddenly not be fine!
2	1523097158	2	We're still 10 days away from the 'release', I can guarantee it will not be fine in 8 or 9 days time.
1	1523072974	9	Wait. On the megathread there was a wallet address posted showing transactions that are still going on now. So how the fuck is this hidden? 
1	1523085246	9	> To break it down, when Wraith Protocol is turned ON — the transaction data is hidden and not visible via the blockchain explorer.'Stealth transactions' **ARE** visible on the blockchain explorer.  Try it and see.  Or post one here.
2	1523099303	6	Fucking right? This guy has so much faith in Verge's privacy capabilities I don't see why he's not yet all in on it.*Transactions invisible on the blockchain* — that some next-level shit!Like, nobody but the sender and the receiver know even about the fact that a transaction took place at all. Like, a node processing a block is just churning some bytes without any way to even know what accounts are there and still can somehow verify it all. I'm not even sure if I'm describing some future cryptography yet to be proposed or a complete mathematical impossibility, and this guy's all like: "yeah, fucking **Verge** sure does that". Some people on this sub, man.
1	1523099357	8	All seems plausible, except the fact that "Wraith protocol" is a made up gimmic, it doesn't really do anything. But hey if you really want to, you can get away with it without ledger privacy, especially with a completely braindead "fake news" community like the one Verge has. You could litterally just steal their money and say, no you will get it back, just wait a year and 90% of the knucklehead vergins would say "mmm ok seems legit".
1	1523097507	4	> * Due to Verge having Wraith protocol (you can send anonymously)Ha-ha-ha! Wrong. Funny how you hate Verge with a passion like it has become fashionable to do, but don't really have a clue about the shittiness of this software and give it too much credit.If he sends to a stealth address (which there is absolutely zero reason to do if it is in fact his own address), the funds will remain perfectly traceable to the exchange account he deposits them to.Yes, he probably will use one of the free, non-KYC exchanges and get away, but it won't have anything to do with the almighty "Wraith protocol", lol.
1	1523081379	2	Today I was contemplating why he would continue to engage the community and prop the xvg brand if it was all a scam? Your comment answers my question: for increased buy orders by driving the hype for the “partnership” and being able to sell off the hacked xvg. Not only that, but he basically has an unlimited bank account now. Why ruin a good thing when he can keep doing it? He’ll wait a few months. Announce something else. Hack the coin. And sell off.
1	1523070117	2	How does this solve his tax problem? At what point does he take out fiat to pay his taxes if his coinbase acct is frozen? He can't pay his taxes with the extra Verge coins he stole. So what's the underlying motive and ultimate plan for all of this?
2	1523070547	10	Why can't he? Just change the stolen Verge to ETH/BTC and use a different crypto-fiat exchange to cash out, coinbase isn't your only option...
2	1523070619	9	At any point? Coinbase isn't the only offramp. There are hundreds now.  I think you've misread what I wrote though.1) He sells his existing stack to the buy orders he created via hype of 'partnership' so a large number of xvg being sold isn't odd.2) He then converts to another crypto and converts to fiat.3) He then has a problem that his wallets are now empty so he 'hacks' his blockchain and allows it to go on for hours to replace his previous coins.I believe step 3 is possible because XVG has wraith protocol which allows for anonymous transactions.> What is Wraith Protocol?> Wraith Protocol is a technology that allows the user to seamlessly switch between public and private ledgers on the Verge Blockchain.

3	1523099634	7	All seems likely but come on lol Wraith protocol? **It does not exist**. It was a made up scam from the start to get people to invest. He is most likely washing his money via Monero to get rid of the trace, then just convert back to BTC and cash out.
3	1523084790	2	Is there not an address that people had to send money to? Can you not just look at that address to see if there's any movement out?
3	1523081510	3	This is the most probable theory. Makes complete sense. 
1	1523107785	1	This guy better go to jail
1	1523080720	0	Maybe he 'let" the hack happen to prove how anonymous the coin is. ..like an advertisement.
2	1523090635	2	A coin that can be hacked without consequences? Where can I buy!?
1	1523073809	-86	You are a plague that we need to get rid of. You and the person who posted this thread are disgusting.We are in CRYPTO together. If we would all support each other guess what would happen? We would all be winners. But no. You guys have to constantly SPEW out all this negativity on a coin you are not even invested in.Just stop and think about this for a minute. Cause there are too many of you disgusting people who only come on here to make the nastiest and most absurd statements when you could be giving constructive criticism about what has happened and in the end not be calling verge a shit coin.You guys suck.
2	1523081804	20	Are you kidding? We should all pretend there are no scams in the crypto world and then magically “we will all be winners”? Are you serious with this? Verge is trash. There is more trash in the top 100, and I hope people keep pointing it out. 
2	1523091120	5	If you turn financial matters into a cult where critical questions are not allowed, you are setting yourself up to be scammed.The followers of bitconnect  said the same things about critics, and see where they are now. If I owned any XVG, I'd sell then NOW.It's competent beyond me why the price is rising still.
3	1523107182	1	> If you turn financial matters into a cult where critical questions are not allowedI have yet to find a crypto sub or chat that wasn't this way.  I've gotten attacked when voicing and concern or giving any negative feedback of any kind for coins I'm heavily invested in.  People treat crytpo like their local sports team but worse because they have money in it.
4	1523109991	1	I know, I know. The two bitcoin subs are like that. That doesn't bode well for the future of crypto
2	1523074112	24	I thought this post was actually a good example of constructive criticism.Your response is childish

0	1523069745	30	Also, this looks like the hackers wallet on the privacy blockchain explorer..https://verge-blockchain.info/address/DBfVheAAcBd5X6tA2YpZMyNBvcn434oGqRSeems to still be getting deposits of 1560 per blockEdit: although this one seems to be the most active nowhttps://verge-blockchain.info/address/DGSGttq6piVxNtHjx5vsUDRHEePxvAc4mT
1	1523107118	5	Have you taken a look at this one:https://verge-blockchain.info/address/D8LG7EP3gMXvNNbyFczBffiMF4oNgYMKqAMight be a pool, but has received over 500 blockrewards in the past 15 hours. Which is over 780 000 Verge or at the current price around 390k$. I doubt the attackers would be stupid enough to let everything be deposited on a single adress, since transactions can easily be followed through the blockchain explorer. So this is probably only a small chunk of what's going on.I took a look at the richlist, and saw that the largest owner holds over 20% of all Verge, in comparison to the second place who only holds around 5%. This might be an exchange, but no idea why a single exchange would hold so much Verge in that case.Anyway, I've been thinking, not sure if everything's correct, but according to what I've read they aren't validating others their TX's right, but if they modified their miners, they could chose to only validate theirs (perhaps even doublespend). My point being, they could still validate their TX's outgoing to exchanges and manipulate the price on said exchanges, keeping it high so people don't lose trust. And slowly try to sell small amounts. They must realize that Verge still is very likely to tank, once people are able put their Verge on exchanges again.So either they're simply trying to kill Verge without being able to take the profits, or this is a longterm operation in which case they would have been better of keeping it slightly lower profile. Or they already have made their profits and are now killing it as a statement.What if sunerok is simply behind it, and his request for community funding was simply so he could buy even more Scrypt ASICs. He is now simply stalling everything, acting like a fool, while secretly he's exitscammingEdit: damn, my comment looks like pure uncut FUD. Oh well, I'm purely theorycrafting over here, bring me a tinfoil hat if you wish <3
1	1523110236	2	aha nothing to see here just minting some verge for almost nothing that I'm going to sell to some crypto shill, play the market make a couple million, no biggie xD.   ohhh shitcoins <3 
1	1523071351	2	i think that's a mining pool address. 1560 is the reward for mining a block and they've been receiving 1560 blocks for months.Don't take my word for that thoughedit: the second address. not sure about the first - first definitely seems suspicious
2	1523073081	14	Look at the timestamps though. Whomever that is eating blocks of verge like I eat fucking M&Ms. 
3	1523103330	5	You should probably slow down on those M&Ms, son.
3	1523105181	1	Give a signal when we have to send help, eating such large amounts of M&Ms can't be healthy!
0	1523075747	20	>Dev made a post asking about paying taxes related to cryptos/coinbase. A few hours after said post, he started a "Give Verge to our pool so we can reveal big news on day XX/YY!!!1">Didn't reveal it. Postponned to April 16th.16th is the day before tax day too lol
1	1523077886	25	Now I got it, verge’s new partnership is with the IRS! ;)
1	1523085841	3	It got postponed to the 17th a few days go!

1	1523103386	8	Hey hey heeeeeey
1	1523113443	6	MY WIFE STILL DOESNT BELIEVE IN ME! 
0	1523071587	121	 Their developer isn't a genius, he's a kid playing bop-a-mole with two hands, except there are thousands of holes and hundreds of moles. For every one person they ban from /r/vergecurrency, the number of moles increases by 1 and the number of holes increases by 10. Good luck /u/sunerok. This is a shitshow, and I just made some popcorn.
1	1523076665	76	He is a genius:  he found a way to sucker countless people into buying into his lies over and over again ~  the guy is a genius manipulator, liar and scammer....  there is definately a certain genius in being able to con so many people for so long even in the face of incontrovertible facts proving the lies are real..   its just like certain genius orange man in 'merica! 
2	1523077165	57	I wouldn't be so quick to hand out the genius manipulator title. It's easy to pull off manipulation, you just have to bury your sense of morality real hard. Luckily most people prefer that part of themselves intact. 
3	1523078116	14	Yeh ~ your probably right.  These people are actually damaged in a sense that they were probably born with a malfunction in their wiring/chemical make up that produced the effect of amorality resulting in their ability to so easily dupe the correctly wired people...   so not genius ~ their defect results in an ability to gain much wealth from the majority of morally sound individuals in society.   A defect that has tremendous financial benefit to the individual affected by it.
4	1523078577	19	I'd argue their upbringing plays a bigger part, though their nature does matter. I currently work as a probation officer and almost all of my clients come from broken or at least difficult families. That said I don't believe we should accuse sunerok of anything until we have verifiable proof he's defrauded his community. Time will tell. 
5	1523078916	5	Good points ~ thanks for the response.
4	1523088768	1	Øåm n
3	1523084792	3	This isn't entirely true, I think. Manipulation isn't easy to pull off and most people don't keep their sense of morality intact. Most people will just find justification for doing immoral stuff (e.g. laws that punish traffic participants that don't help out the distressed - there would be no need for this if people were moral). We could argue if justifying our own bad actions voids us of tainting our sense of morality. I do wish it wasn't that way.
3	1523110441	1	like or hate trump, hes a master manipulator and obviously intelligent enough to grab the most powerful position in the world like its a pussy.

2	1523077076	4	This is true, at least until he goes to prison. Regarding the orange man: If Trump goes to prison, orange will be the new black.

3	1523107990	2	Vitalik isnt an orange president or a vergin... oh wait.
2	1523108924	1	He would need to find a good hideout when the shits the fan. In such a case many blind people could be very upset with such blind rage as they had blind obedience.In the end such a case might turn out bad for any scammer... Don't know for sure but such fraud could lead to jail time in a parallel universe.

2	1523081268	9	I was banned for belittling a post about a new Verge donation address, which was clearly just verge begging for money from sheepfam. My comment was: "/r/notinteresting". Donation for what? It's pointless request for more investor money without any reason. Respectable rich folks don't just ask for personal donations from their investors, they literally do the opposite. It's a vergescam made just for vergefam.

0	1523075504	43	This is exactly why another bull run will happen eventually. Datadash is a big fan of verge and I honestly lost so much respect for him once he supported it.
1	1523076333	37	I can't believe that a guy like that would support Verge but perhaps he knows something we don't. I basically stopped watching Datadash after that fiasco with being paid off to promote Substratum.
2	1523104311	2	As you should. Some people will stay with him and hopefully he can retain his integrity to the community. People really shouldn't make it too easy for these people to just do these things. What he did was highly unethical and to what extend he did it is also very questionable. I do value his content and what he does for the sphere, but he has to show over time that he really deserves any trust whatsoever. Also, Suppoman is not dead yet, despite being a known scammer. The sphere really is full of shitters and my advice to *anyone* is trust *noone* but *yourself*. Datadash has an agenda, Verge has an agenda, everyone has an agenda. If you're unsure about an Altcoin, don't invest - smarten up *yourself* first. Not hating here, he *does* say that people should do their own due dilligence, but I think deep in his heart he knows, nobody or most of his viewers are not doing that. They watch his videos and take his word. That's the sad truth. _____ To give props where props are due. Datadash leaked himself. It wasn't discovered or anything, he came clear out of his own will, which is good. And also, you can't give him shit for talking about Verge. He talks about *many* Altcoins on his channel, infact I'd argue that's what the entire channel is about, more so than overall Cryptonews, it's Altcoin information channel. At one point eventually you will get a scammy coin in there aswell. You may have done a shitty analysis that day. Either way in my books he *is* safe. He does say it every single time. Do your own research. If people ignore that advice, then they're the only ones to blame if they lose their money. Also the guy is just really nice to listen to. He's not overly technical, he's a previous trader and that's it. Crypto *is* the wild wild west. You have your own gun, don't ask for other people's gun is my advice to anyone really. Never once has I even considered taking Reddit shill posts serious for that matter. I frequent the sub and I'm still not invested in IOTA, VEN, REQ, PRLS or any of that bullshit. These may be good coins and I *may* invest in the future once I took a deep look at these coins for myself. I know most people here honestly are relatively new/young and have little clue about anything at all. 
1	1523105636	1	Gross. Instant credibility loss (not that I ever thought his “analysis” was any better or worse than any other YouTube shill. By and large almost all the YouTube crypto “peronalities” I’ve come across seem like complete shills). Anyway:  He took money from Substratum to shill. Verge paid McAfee to shill. Verge probably paid Datadouche for his fandom. 
0	1523085712	15	The wraith protocol had set dates BEFORE the new year's date and still didn't release. They literally had a wraith protocol countdown timer website up and when it struck 0 nothing happened. A week later they rolled out a residigned, crooked ass (literally not a single icon was aligned), bullshit wallet with no new features besides atomic swap capability...Sunerok claimed this "part of the wraith protocol and the rest will roll out soon". They then delayed wraith a month or two until the new years fiasco. 
0	1523096170	13	So their last fork didnt work, XVG blockchain still gets clusterfucked, brilliant.Hacker has more thtan 100 Mil. XVG by now (conservative estimations),  and if their protocol works, will not be traceable, but if he is traceable, than it is real life proof that their protocol doesnt work. This is great!!!
0	1523090973	13	I have literally only heard about verge when it's news of a massive fuckup.
0	1523078230	21	But if you point all these things out you get told "you don't know what you're talking about", "it wasn't a hack", "do some research".  Its infuriates me that I'm trying to help people not lose money and I'm the asshole.  Even if the dev isn't up to something shady, you have to at least admit he's really dropped the ball with Verge, and for some reason people still have confidence.  Apple stock dropped significantly when their facial recognition software didn't work, and they have a long track record of great products, yet this shitcoin refuses to die.  
1	1523104393	1	I know a couple of people who have invested in Verge. I've let them know it's looking sketchy, but if they don't want to look into it or think I'm being ridiculous, they're welcome to continue doing their thing. You can only help people so much. 
2	1523107662	1	No one wants to look like an idiot for believing in a scam.  I bought the hype of the Wraith protocol and when they didn't deliver I bailed on it, and it's just been blunder after blunder since then. 
1	1523109755	1	Took bitconnect a long time to die, but eventually it did
0	1523075537	20	How is verge still pumping after the hack? See no further than the recent CTR pump. Centra founders are arrested, its been proven to be fraud publicly and binance delists the coin - what happens next is instead of CTR tanking, it pumps more than 200%.

2	1523109681	3	Because the fix is fucked.
0	1523078696	32	This is a major problem for all of crypto. If bad eggs are rewarded, it encourages more bad eggs, it also destroys trust that crypto can regulate itself and sets the impression that most people are on it for a quick buck. 
1	1523094616	8	Shit like that will inevitably lead to regulation. The crypto scene has time and again shown we are incapable of self-regulation, so big daddy will do it.
2	1523104839	0	It's not really self-regulation that's the problem. Many of these coins aspire to be decentralized, but currently *can't be*, because they're under development and all that. They're also very young and a very young currency cannot possibly be distributed properly. Some players will always have more. Time is the problem. I'd argue between 1600 currencies we have right now, roughly two are *somewhat* decentralized and that is Bitcoin and Litecoin. The rest is not even looking to be decentralized ie. Ripple and shits alike, or simply has not reached that point yet ie. IOTA, EOS, ADA, projects which are still being developed. Time and more money will distribute future coins better. Ethereum is getting there, but I'd argue that Vitalik still has the final say if he wanted to.  Crypto is still in its infancy, even 9 years after the first coin release. Take the top20 for example, you still find outrageous coins that deserve really not the value they currently hold. To name a few. Bitcoin Cash is a scam, EOS is pure hype, TRON is pure hype, Verge is highly weird, Steem is probably a scam. That's top30 for you. Beyond top30 you will find even more scams and worthless projects. Blockchain is applicable, but not for *everything*. I've read shit about "inheritance coins". Waht.

Happening right now after the supposed fix: https://verge-blockchain.infoEdit: okay so apparently each tx is showing separately on their block explorer. This is a change that was introduced in their latest "maintenance". Anyone know why they would chose this form of representation over the standard representation?
0	1523087330	7	Update: they tried to fork at 2040000, messed up their block explorer and it went under maintenance. Now they've  decided they're going to fork at 204200. Too funny 
0	1523106772	8	I'm still stuck on the part where a coin with a public blockchain calls itself private and lasts longer than six months
0	1523067169	42	No point warning the idiots anymore, if they don't want to listen then let them lose their investment.
1	1523081701	-23	Tbf, if you can afford it, can’t hurt to hold $100 xvg just in case. At least try to profit from this clusterfuck
2	1523084610	25	Isn't it exactly this mentality which keeps the price going up?
3	1523088221	3	Let us hope.
3	1523095457	1	Sure. And not just this, but all of crypto.  Everyone backs their own horse and looks at tho others with disbelief.  All the time the curious spectators view you all like this whether BTC or XVG or whatever.
2	1523089352	6	If i had a $100 to throw at crypto it for sure wouldn't be a shitcoin with so many red flags

2	1523094729	2	Haha, I would love to short XVG for $100 if that was possible.
2	1523096817	2	Why would someone hold 100$ of something that is a worthless scam, no difference between Dogecoin Dark and Beetconneeect.
3	1523097731	0	Well, it remains to be seen. 
4	1523106265	2	It doesn’t remain to be seen if it’s a shitcoin (it is). What remains to be seen is if one can still profit off of it regardless of this fact.  
4	1523100463	0	No, it has been proven many times.
5	1523100620	1	Sorry, could you please provide the proof? I’m genuinely interested.
6	1523101372	3	That Verge is a scam? Well where do we start? The fact that the "groundbreaking Wraith protocol" that was supposed to make Verge "100% untraceable" and "the only totally anonymous cryptocurrency", as we all know turned out to be totally fake, not a protocol at all and also did not make the currency untraceable or anonymous. It was just stealth adresses from 2014 that already exist for any bitcoin clone = more or less any currency you can find. Then we have the Mcafee fiasko, not the first time Verge has paid for a pump but the most recognized one.The fact that they copied features from other currencies in an incorrect manner, leading to plagiarism.The fact that they changed icons and colors in the wallet on github while claiming it to be "privacy updates"The fact that they claim that Verge has two different ledgers when in fact anyone can see that there is only one ledger.And this is all just old stuff before the whole, pay us money and we will disclose a partnership that will be the biggest ever in crypto, only to postpone it to the day after tax day. And also the recent hack that they are denying and banning anyone that mentions it.off the top of my head, there is more. How much does one need to see to know that Verge is a scam?
0	1523078365	6	I love your post. 
0	1523092160	7	It's shit like this that undermines crypto and makes it all look like a scam to the folks on the outside. Why would people invest when this sort of thing happens so often? 
0	1523099714	6	You forgot to add that their subreddit literally bans anyone who isn't blindly dick riding the shit out of it, I got banned for asking how wraith was fully released when their black paper said we'd be given an optional public/private ledger when in reality all we were given was stealth addresses through tor. I must of asked that about 30 times without getting an actual answer before they banned me for asking it.

It really does baffle me. I mean, consider that after all that has happened with XVG, people still think they'd be the cryptocurrency to land the biggest partnership that will change the cryptocurrency space as a whole?Yes. A major company is going to bank on XVG being the most reliable, best fit, cryptocurrency to partner with. I mean, after all, with their stunning, high quality, ever reliable team and track record, what could go wrong? Jesus, people suck.  
0	1523116251	5	In crypto, pretty much any news is good news.It would literally take the devs to say “this is a scam, we’re stealing your money” for it to crash, and some people would STILL believe it isn’t a scam.  Short term, yes, scam coins can make you money.  Long term it’ll all get cleared out.  Do you want to be holding the bags when it’s finally exposed as a scam to the masses?

3	1523114936	1	The sun shines on a dog's ass once in it's life.
0	1523115770	4	Sorting by controversial is... interesting. I honestly don’t see how people can defend XVG right now. “Your just salty cause verge can’t be stopped.” “Enjoy your shitcoins, verge is the truth.” Etc. Etc.What has verge done to deserve this level of trust and loyalty?I’m on record as saying I only own IOTA, another coin with a lot of controversy around it. If asked why I still own it even though a group of cryptographers question its safety, I can at least provide a list of reasons I hold, such as big companies like Bosch invested, a growing team of highly qualified people, a legal non-profit foundation set up in Germany meaning that if they scam, people will go to jail etc. Even with those things, I take criticism of IOTA seriously and don’t blindly defend. What can XVG holders point to as a reason to still have faith in verge? 
1	1523117028	3	People who support XVG are some of the stupidest people on planet Earth.
2	1523118225	1	On the one hand, I can’t wait for 4/17 to witness the meltdown after the ‘partnership announcement.’ On the other hand, I hate to see people lose money in obviously terrible/scammy projects.Lots of people are going to lose money in crypto because most projects won’t make it. But at least if you’re invested in a real project with a good team you had a chance at making money. 
3	1523118946	1	Meltdown?  They’ll just say “due to the hack, we have to delay the partnership two months”.  Verge followers will be upset for about 30 seconds, then go back to drinking the koolaid.
4	1523120200	1	Sadly, you’re probably right. 
0	1523119361	4	Verge is a disgrace to the crypto space.
0	1523082709	7	>dumb moneyVerge holds majority of it after bitconnect died
0	1523083993	8	Yes.  And xvg went up 178%.     Crypto world is 90% retards. 
1	1523088183	3	there are a lot of people buying it knowing other people who don't know better are buying it. they will look to sell at the top and leave the inexperienced hanging.
2	1523102401	3	A big player will dump on them first. I hope they have stop losses in place. Actually, no I don’t hope that. 
1	1523109429	1	I'd suspect it's not much retail people. It's just bots turned into bull mode like usual when these hype news happen and generate positive buy sign for the whale bots.
0	1523072496	20	I think you guys are way over thinking this lol.You make it sound like it's some sort of Italian Job style master heist. At the end of the day it's really probably just a series of unfortunate events. 
0	1523085630	3	Research- substance over hype
0	1523113304	3	fishy coin indeed. 
0	1523114814	3	BITCONEEEEEECT
0	1523117513	3	Spot on assessment in my opinion. Verge is shady AF...no two ways to split it. 
0	1523070681	12	I think what everyone should do is log onto their sub and give them warm words of encouragement , I know I have ...Anything I can do to help them lose all their money faster just gets me more hard. 
1	1523071402	11	doesnt matter, that place is censored more than north koreahttps://www.ceddit.com/r/vergecurrency/new/
2	1523071812	6	They haven't censored me and of course I only tell them what they want to hear , MOONRIDES FOR EVERYONE!!!!
2	1523081875	2	No posts?
3	1523113606	1	Wait 10 secs for the red 
0	1523081075	5	If it smells like shitcoin, it is shitcoin. 
0	1523069550	2	Bitconnect is a pretty shitty comparison. But uh, yea, the devs are making me nervous enough to not even day trade it. I heard they "rolled back" the blockchain. wut
1	1523101873	1	He hardforked which removed all data. Can you really trust a coin for daily use if the dev can just take you back a month and remove all money you gained that month. Imagine what happened to legit miners
0	1523091503	4	Yeah where can we short that shit
0	1523095329	4	I don't know if verge is a scam but it is certainly overhyped and run by an incompetent team. 
0	1523077062	5	Ive been calling Verge a True example of a overvalued shit coin since before it was released, 
1	1523098613	-1	so you have been awfully wrong then haha
0	1523103752	2	*postponed
0	1523113857	2	People also believe in higher powers like god. And you are surprised there are also people who believe in a project like verge?
0	1523115679	1	"VasaVasaVasaVasa TEHHHHH VVEEEERRRRGGGEEEE!!!!!" *Explosive diareah noise* 
0	1523117636	2	I had made the most profit off verge back in December but, botched that all up buying more as it crumpled... I finally gave up and sold... The day before it started pumping again. I sold the bottom because I did not see a pump coming out of this MF clown show... Who would?
0	1523067934	6	There's one answer that fits all of this criteria better than 'everyones just dumb'. Its easily manipulated by whales. 
1	1523076610	3	Never attribute to malice that which may be readily explained by incompetence. 
2	1523076794	3	Oh there's plenty of incompetence in and outside of XVG. But it's still a key ingredient to large scale manipulation. It's like the poker boom in the early 2000s, lots of sharks hunting the easy (incompetent) money.
1	1523074689	1	Why would a whale pump something like that?  There are nearly 20 coins, in the top 100, that are under 10 cents that they could pump.
2	1523075831	6	A large scale coordinated pump and dump is much more than just picking a random coin, scooping a little bit and dumping a small volume on some unsuspecting fomoers. A large scale pump and dump needs a lot of bag holders, and a lot of volume over a period of time. The more times it pumps hard, the more often they get to unload/reload and pump again.Imagine you have capability to manipulate an entire market, not just one whale but an entire pod. You'd select coins to manipulate that have a following that is 1) huge, 2) crypto-illiterate, 3) fanatical about their coin, 4) will fomo into a fast rising coin. Maybe the founder(s) are also in financial trouble, or susceptible to bribery or blackmail. XVG isn't the only coin I'd suspect of large scale manipulation. It's also perfectly fine to ride these waves, you just have to swear that you will take profits and not HODL.
3	1523081961	1	Reminds me of the religious.
0	1523082976	6	People who are stupid enough to buy verge deserve to lose their money.
0	1523078342	2	It is incompetence that is indiscernible from malevolence. Either way the project is fucked.
0	1523095992	3	Lol yeah I understood that 👍🏻
0	1523101968	3	Dogecoin for the win.
0	1523074820	3	This is my exact analysis as well. I don't understand how people continually buy into this coin. Even their reddit is nothing but a shill for price action...
0	1523093629	2	This guy will get whats coming to him. It just sucks that he got to screw over so many people along the process
1	1523109999	1	No, he probably won't. If he has his ass on half strait he already has an exit plan.
0	1523103268	2	You sir, deserve some free XVG for this post. 
1	1523113238	0	hey I want free shit too ! :)
0	1523107393	2	This is gunna be bad for crypto when it bursts
0	1523111100	2	I'm still sitting on the $50 of Verge I bought on a whim last September and chuckling while everyone loses their shit over it...I probably should sell (/should've sold) but at this point it's too entertaining not to. 
1	1523119049	1	Yeah man I took some fat profits back ATH but kept 80% Way to entertaining to sell off! The drama is hysterical 
0	1523097530	2	Verge is death
0	1523088075	1	Also, can someone clarify, if verge is under sybil attack, are not funds of honest people potentially under danger?
0	1523113634	1	I remember looking at Verge last November and wondering what in the hell it was even supposed to be for.  Noticed when it shot up 1500% in a week, but never even considered buying any.  Such is an infant market.  
0	1523114765	1	No such thing as bad press? I don't know, fuck everything.
0	1523116008	1	yea needless to say i was pretty disapointed. i sold at a ~60 loss a while ago. apparently i shoulda hodl for a while but i guess i had too much faith that everyone wouldnt continue to blindly throw money at it or whatever is going on. 
0	1523120098	1	They wanted proof.So I gave them proof.Now I'm banned.
0	1523120301	1	Where are they located? If its a scam in they're in the USA they will be prosecuted if its this obvious
0	1523090723	1	I got in at $0.26 and all I am reading are "wow look how much Verge is up today posts". It's UP to $0.06. Wake me up when my investment is back where I invested, until this, I'm not bothering to get excited about the future of the coin. Sorry.
1	1523106151	4	Don't worry as soon as deposits resume it will go to zero before it goes to 0.26 : wich means youll be able to dollar cost average with 10 bucks (buy a million xvg for 0.000001) and wait 10 years to make your money back afterwards.
0	1523066900	1	1337/10 would inwaste
0	1523100787	1	That's stupid for you... it never ceases to amaze me.
0	1523073551	-9	Is there anything of substance that this sub can talk about these days beside how much everyone hates Verge? We get it, you don’t like it. What can you contribute to the group? 644,600 people and this is all we are hearing about. If you don’t like it, great. Good for you. Move on. 
1	1523074016	1	This sub is all memes, “TA” and shitcoin talking. It used to be a lot more informative but now it’s just this. 
1	1523088133	1	Shhhh, you'll trigger the bots
0	1523078017	1	You should have started at the time it was called Dogecoindark
0	1523084698	1	Whats a hardfork?
1	1523095816	9	The main developer of Verge was wondering the same thing yesterday. 🤣
1	1523109334	3	A non-backwards compatible fork of a software. You take code and modify it (that's forking) in a way that its functions won't be compatible with the original code's. In crypto, it means that users have to update their nodes and mining software if they want to use the "main" blockchain. 
0	1523101276	1	one man's scam is another mans moon.
0	1523105186	1	In the long run, the market sorts this all out.  But in the short term, there can certainly be...anomalies.  I try not to let them bother me.  I am mostly successful.  You can even use the...anomalies....to make money.  If Verge is so crushingly underpowered and underdeveloped, as it surely is, you could go short it.The problem is, irrational stupid money can remain irrational for longer than your short deadline.  And, as alluded to earlier, there is the very real possibility that Verge is being manipulated, so there's that.
0	1523106361	1	As long as these kind of posts exist, crypto will continue to decline in value. And I hope it does so it cleans out these people 
1	1523109464	2	A lot of "these people" have helped clean out some of the worst scammers in the market. Crypto does not need to grow in value. It needs to grow in utility, value will follow. Go get a Lambo elsewhere.
0	1523107425	1	Isn't verge just dogecoin but with tor enabled by default? Who cares, it's a shitcoin. 
0	1523117054	1	To me verge seemed like a sketchy project. I heard many shilling voices and negative things. Which is the opposite of what attracts me to coin. Why cant most people pick up on these things? If you get a bad vibe dont invest. Listen to people but make all decisons based on what other people tell you. Dyor. 
0	1523074577	-17	I don't hold Verge but what is pretty evident is there's a pretty obvious fud campaign against them. I don't trust anything this organized in this subreddit, I'm more suspicious of these attacks then anything
1	1523082699	12	is it a fud campaign if the coin was literally exploited, the hacker created more than 70 million coins out of thin air, and the developer makes a fool of himself on bitcointalk by pushing a hard fork unknowingly as well as copypasting three-year-old already-broken code?
1	1523076207	4	lmao
1	1523076389	4	Did you say the same about the anti-bitconnect posts?
1	1523075960	-12	Couldn't agree more. 
0	1523076073	-4	This has all been covered ad nauseam.  Another fucking thread?
0	1523085869	-3	What IF this partnership is legit and a very well known company? Im curious to see how this sub will react? I own very little verge so I couldn’t care less.  
1	1523088706	10	What if a well-known company don't ask for money for a partnership ? You guys are so stupid thinking the fund raising was about a partnership. Do Amazon or Paypal or any other big company needs Verge's $3m ? Forget this $hitcoin and go for coins with real projects, partnerships and big community.
1	1523095691	4	no respectable company who did any amount of research would want to be associated with verge, 6 months ago, 3 months ago, or nowthey claim to be the first two have taken two very small and rudimentary steps towards privacy they were far from first to do, while real privacy coins have gone much further... and Verge had the audacity to say they were first to do what they knew damn well they weren't.  Competition and innovation in the privacy space are great, but Verge never brought either.  This currency is the epitome of hollow hype.  Many of it's believers decided it was going to be the next big thing before there was any explanation as to what Wraith actually was (how it was going to work).Verge was far from the first to use torVerge was far from the first to have stealth addressesfor Verge to claim to be more private than **any other cryptocurrency in the top 100** is incredibly dishonestthere are many small cap coins in the rank 100-500 range that are superior to Verge for privacy too.  The only thing Verge did right is dishonest marketing.
1	1523113337	2	*couldn't care less...If you could care less then you still care some.
0	1523109642	-2	This subreddit’s so salty over verge like what is this a post every day? Sorry your shitcoin’s still tanking but verge’ll be strong no matter how many posts you make crying about it. Enjoy your circlejerk and negative portfolios 
0	1523077235	-6	Could it have anything to do with Verge being a privacy coin and April is the month of harvest of the poppy seed plant in Afghanistan so all the king pins are using it to move large amounts of money?
1	1523090471	3	I'm sure they would use a proper coin for that if they needed to. 
2	1523090536	2	Would be either monero, pivx or verge, or spread across those. 
3	1523095845	6	by proper coin, he meant *not verge*just thought I'd clarify for you
0	1523071081	-19	All this "This is what I think happend" "He did this and that so it's a scam" "He is the one hacking his own cryptocurrency because he needs to pay taxes (lmfao)" I know this is hard to accept, but people, **Innocent UNTILL proven guilty**Lets put down our pitchforks and wait for april 17th
1	1523077830	16	Found the problem ^
1	1523084844	7	Yeah right, wait until it's proven. Just like Bitconneeeeeeeeect.
0	1523106226	-1	This is why I had just unsubscribed to this Reddit page..first of you were good at buying crypto you buy FUD especially when the price falls to ungodly proportions and you sell the good news a partnership with the biggest adoption since the top three cryptos this could be HUGE or a big flop all I know is I bought when it dipped and I’m 22% up you’re just salty your crypto hasn’t gone up 
0	1523087190	0	Remember crypto kitties: Black-papers also means it is an unofficial papers criticizing government policy. Let me repeat "Unofficial blah blah blah"
0	1523093420	-2	XVG and XBY are both cryptopia babies. Verge went on the biggest run ever even though most experts believe Xtrabytes is the one with far bigger potential.
1	1523097466	2	You consider a 4 year old project a baby? Hmmmmmm
1	1523099859	2	I would agree that XVG is easily a coin not worth investing in. XBY on the other hand could also easily be a scam coin. I think XBY is just a more well thought-out money grapping scheme then XVG. 
0	1523107133	-1	I think this guy/team is out smarting you all... I've stuck with XVG since the first and 2nd botched WP Release, Coin Pouch hack, Twitter hacks and multiple other so called mishandlings.Do I stick with it because 'I  believe in the coin; No! Do I stick with it because like believe in the team; No! I stick with it because something is at play here. It's not bitconnect, it's not a scam but it's something.You would do yourselves a favor by asking harder questions Vs pissing and moaning the coin keeps going up. I am not telling you what to do, but 'If you can't beat em'...
0	1523110935	-1	what a shitty post, so sad so wrong so stupid
0	1523117893	-2	Verge is gonna be top 3 coin. Hahaha eat it.
1	1523119938	2	Zero chance.
0	1523069597	-41	There’s a ton of Monero fan bois in here I can see. First off all so many top tier coins have been hacked and patched. XEM went through a massive hack and it’s doing ok, same for BTC and ETH. Last time I checked b cash is still hacking and scamming people to think it’s the real bitcoin lol. $100 bucks of verge Jan 17 was worth over 900k Dec 17. It also has a working block chain and acts as a currency that is accepted by a ton of merchants...but verge is the real shit coin right? Lol 
1	1523069772	18	> and acts as a currency that is accepted by a ton of merchantsrofl
2	1523074252	-4	It is accepted by a lot of merchants...

1	1523070322	3	lol your post is so retarded it will give anyone cancer. ETH wasn't "hacked". The DAO which had a smart contract was exploited. Not a 51 % attack on the FUCKING blockchain itself. Literally XVG was printed from thin air. Please tell me when this happened to BTC? If you can prove that I will back off.And Btw since you apparently think the price of XVG gives it value. Here's something to really trigger you. So what if 100$ is worth 900k in Dec? You are still a shitcoin bagholder right XD? Your tiiiiny XVG bag will NEVER I repeat make your rich.

0	1523089180	-5	Having said all of that, Bitcoin and Ethereum have also been hacked/exploited too.Ethereum and Ethereum Classic anyone?
1	1523093930	6	That was a bad contract. Eth performed as intended

4	1523096562	-4	I just find it sad that almost every coin/token has had some issues somewhere along the line and now Verge is getting totally shat on, when they are really just abunch of volunteers doing it.Parity stuff up ($200 million gone)Bitcoin 92 billion code exploitEthereum DAO hackI'm sure there are more examples.....
5	1523106367	4	Parity = stuck funds, nothing has been dumped, at best you can see it as a supply burn boosting the price by reducing supplyBTC = was roll backedEtheruem DAO = everybody voted for the fork and the day was savedVerge = hacker will dump million dollars onto the market as soon as deposits resume, the devs showed they don't even know how their blockchain works, their partnership is 99% chance vaporware, and they are going to exit scam as fast as they can, even if the exploit is fixed you can be sure there are about 10 others uncovered given how shitty sunerock is at anything related to coding.But XVG holders are such pros at crypto that they will hodl this down to 0$ from the height of their 3 month experience in cryptocurrency.
6	1523111573	1	Ok. Cheers for your input. 👍😉👍
5	1523096753	0	Ofc there are more examples. But were in the wrong sub if you want the facts. The cool thing to do in this sub is shit on tron, verge, vechain, eos, etc. and they do it with such arrogance sometimes i forget their IQ is below average.
6	1523097121	1	Ha haTrue
0	1523094338	-2	Just remember, at one point the price was literally 2-3 satoshis and bitcoin was substantially cheaper than it is now

1	1523101447	5	Not necessarily hater's, people investing in technology with a solid team behind it, will certainly not consider gambling on Verge pulling off there money grapping scheme.
2	1523102848	0	maybe you should invest in eos then. because PR is king. you can have nothing but a white paper and a marketing team and have millions in ICO but if you're just a single or small group of devs you're fucked because of haters and FUD
