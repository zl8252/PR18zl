0	1523032899	248	Am also bummed out, but still daily check this sub and prices.Super annoying but still have hope.The crypto scene in itself is also quite entertaining; lots of drama, fud, plot twists, succes stories, horror stories etc.Good entertainment and informative at the same time :-)
1	1523033912	52	That's the advantage with only having spent gambling money on crypto. It is a hell of a ride well worth the money!
2	1523048784	102	I just replaced cigarettes and energy drinks with crypto. I'm healthier at least
3	1523051353	30	Instead of having health problems in the future, you'll have some kind of money and a decent start on a new asset class. +1 
4	1523052639	15	and his kidney is in danger too. 
4	1523094967	1	Wont matter much as he'll be dead in short time due to the stress this market gives us
4	1523056151	1	Assuming you picked the correct ones, which is unlikely considering the likelihood that very few in existence today will make it to any threshold of adoption and use. 
5	1523057711	3	Good point. Go long on Marlboro and Red Bull, got it.
3	1523052018	6	yo, life prolonged already. Crypto can do that shit
3	1523076026	2	bro, that's exactly what I did lmao
3	1523072404	1	Instead of needing an organ transplant, you can sell an organ. Solid investment.
3	1523083059	1	I had to replace crypto with meth and opiates to feel healthy again
3	1523089833	1	I sold random stuff I have been hoarding for years and used that to buy crypto so I have been cured of my hoarder mentality 😊 Thank you Bitcoin
4	1523102710	2	Hodling bitcoin is just digital hoarding.
5	1523104377	1	Funny the though crossed my mind as I was typing but it sure takes up alot less space and bought ven at 0.20$ so it's all good
2	1523037316	22	Have deleted blockfolio. But buying regularly And Looking for good ICO,  believe in the market though down by 80 percent...very hopeful for future...If price falls more...will buy more. Nobody can hinder technology 
2	1523059435	2	Replaced roulette with it, definitely worth it!

1	1523067165	1	It’s better over on twitter. You can follow real experts and know where the opinion is from. 
1	1523069281	1	> Good entertainment About the only thing that it's worth right now.
1	1523090813	1	I’m in enough that taking the money out now is of no use to anybody.My learning over the last few months is that I need to keep my head on and spend less time looking at hoping and more time just keeping an eye on things.I will be just as happy to get some of my time back for a while at least!
1	1523104837	1	Crypto is by far more entertaining than anything else.
0	1523031400	90	I do think the market is maturing and that each future bubble will be more grand than the last. As someone who I can’t remember noted, tech bubbles leave infrastructure...we all recognize that the future is blockchain and digital acrylic graphs. There’s a real danger in having a short term view focused on market fluctuations. 
1	1523032429	57	Directed acyclic graphs**However I love the idea of a digital acrylic one, much better. That one I can understand! :)
2	1523048565	26	I prefer dense agnostic gyraffes. Each to their own, not like we need consensus. 
3	1523049201	7	Lol @ consensus. Well played.Dissected anatomy grafts?! Use of blockchain in healthcare...Over to you!

6	1523066199	1	Haha!Or decent aromatic goldfish? 
3	1523067254	1	Shut up and take my money.
3	1523079021	1	Nah, spherical cows in a vacuum are the way to go.
1	1523045929	2	No, you're all wrong, the future is in delayed acrostic graphs.In all seriousness, the next bubble, if it happens, can only be huge. The current market allows exchanges to mature; the number of people complaining about exchanges losing their money in limbo has never been lower. Exchanges can staff up, optimize their IT infrastructures or whatever, in some cases, add fiat to coin paths, etc.
1	1523048906	4	Digital acrylic clothes would be as much revolutionary as DAG tech.
1	1523035232	2	I also think this but when the next bullrun come I'm planning to cash out my initial investment. Then I won't have anything to worry about.
2	1523077631	0	And we will be hearing from you and others like you crying how you got out just before a 10x rise. Byeee

1	1523067015	12	I've already forgotten what the colour green looks like.
1	1523064457	4	People on here love looking at charts after the fact, and saying ‘oh but this always happens’. You know, the same people who never saw it coming and got hit just as hard as the rest of us.
2	1523076501	7	Honestly I think everyone who bought in before December did know this was going to happen. It literally happens after every run up. This was my first bubble and I figured maybe I was wrong about the drop when other coins started mooning even after btc and ripple had already dropped(Eth, Ven, Neo). Nope. Exactly what I thought was going to happen is exactly what happened. I'm not surprised the price dropped. I'm just surprised that I looked at the graphs and thought something different could happen this time.
3	1523077655	2	I’ll agree to disagree. Everyone is a genius after the fact here. I can’t remember one post in December saying “hey guys watch out for January this is what happens”. But there were dozens of posts during the dip saying “relax this always happens”. 
3	1523082245	1	I thought exactly the same. No clue why. Loser me 
1	1523112760	1	Just drawn some straight lines and triangles, then you can see when to sell or buy 
1	1523115167	1	yup typical stock market advicefirst quarter everything does bad and the following quarters are suppose to pick it up.
0	1523045707	14	I'm already breaking even (luckily got started in September last year). I'll hold the bag until it makes me rich, then sell parts of it until it makes me even richer. If I can spend it rather than just sell it, then it's even better. If it doesn't make me rich, well, it has been fun and I'll be an old crippled man telling people about the coins I still own (or not, if nobody's mining the blockchain anymore, I guess, but I imagine there will always be nostalgic people keeping blockchains alive, at least for the major coins).To me, it was like putting money in lottery, except that here the risks seemed worth it, while they never do with lotteries.
1	1523054470	2	Im in exactly the samw boat. Its annoying to be "taken back" to september.. but thats the ride. Looking forward to December 18 and seeing where we are at!
0	1523037150	63	>Maybe few months, maybe years, maybe decade.You forget a very important possibility - maybe never. 
1	1523047316	19	Yeah, weird how people seem to not mention that anymore.I have been including "or it could all crash and go to zero" at the end of every optimistic story I've told about crypto, for the past 3 years. 
2	1523047626	12	It makes no sense, though. If it reached 0, it would be bought by people who will refuse to sell for 0, so it will automatically go up again. With this logic you can conclude that it cannot reach 0 unless something catastrophic happens.
3	1523047805	5	You're mostly correct. The point is that the catastrophic can happen...For instance - I think of myself as a fairly conservative crypto investor (cold storage, very careful with my keys, 2FA, etc. etc.), but, even I fell victim to Bitgrail....shit just happens, and it's even more prone to happen in an 'industry' where fraud / hacking / scams are free to exploit whoever they can.
4	1523048486	-3	But nothing catastrophic has ever happened yet. The only places it goes wrong is the exchanges, which is not the product crypto, but the handlers of the product. If you're going to base the value of crypto on the quality of the exchanges, you're going to value it wrongly. Exchanges will be replaced by a crypto-equivelant eventually anyway.
5	1523049220	6	From what I've read about verge recently, it seems there is definitely something wrong with the product. I'm not an expert though, but if you can trick the computers by changing the timestamp then that's a problem. 
6	1523049702	6	I'm not talking about shitcoins.

3	1523053559	8	Try googling what happens to most penny stocks.
4	1523057779	-5	Crypto currencies aren't stocks though. Just because they both are numbers on a graph people suggest parallels. And sure there are plenty that are true. But a stock will go to zero for a different reason than a currency.
3	1523103593	1	You are right. Bitcoin would never literaly be worth 0. It would in a wose case scenario it could still be worth near zero which in turn would mean that it may not be able to sustain the nodes to prevent a 51% attack. As long as there is a few large nodes bitcoin will live on.
3	1523069570	1	> If it reached 0, it would be bought by people who will refuse to sell for 0,Hear of penny stocks? 
3	1523067967	0	 Yeah, nothing goes to zero. There are die hard groups that will continue to buy and use within their small community for years. Even if the rest of the world forgets about bitcoin all together.
0	1523031534	30	Yes same here. Hold for long term and just dont give a fuck anymore. Hope when i open again in desember it will make me smile
1	1523036731	1	It absolutely will.
2	1523049806	20	Based on what? Because you hope it will?
3	1523050017	-27	I have an extremely good gut instinct and in fact it is right 92% of the time. I am considered by most of the people I know to be a shark when it comes to anything financial. It’s easy to see the future when you can see 3 steps ahead just as it’s easy to score a goal in soccer when your opponent is 3 kicks behind. 
4	1523051410	24	.... so you hope it will.

2	1523063477	1	Moon kid idiots, there is no certainty in crypto.
1	1523112852	1	Don’t open it after Christmas lol
1	1523038281	-21	You won’t be able to open anything in “desember” as it doesn’t existUpdate: Looks like this sub is low on humor. Can’t you see I was referring to the typo in december?
2	1523039499	1	Whats wrong with you. We will be dead before cryptos
3	1523041471	-23	desember still doesn't exist. DeCember does.
4	1523041971	14	Sorry on Norwegian it is desember and my autocorect fixt it
4	1523047503	8	Fuck off
5	1523056990	1	I will fuck off. Right back to trading and making money in a market where all of you seem unable to do anything besides whine, and create shit TAs that propse we're running into a bullmarket "any day now". Good luck "hodling". 
0	1523033303	56	So do you ever wonder if the real reason market volume is declining for most cryptos is exactly that?Like people just choosing a couple of coins, sticking up a couple of thousand $ (or whatever they can afford) and just hodling.So that in fact because the market is made up mainly of small holders waiting for a better price, price can't increase much because the volume is going down? Crypto hasn't found mass adoption yet so the market is still mostly early adopters who want a repeat of late 2017. Onramps like coinbase bring a few people each month but most of the early adopters are already in crypto.So instead the price is gently decreasing as we bleed people who can't make their mortgage or rent payment this month and shouldn't have invested in crypto in the first place.
1	1523043482	39	Yep. In short, there is no new money. Every normie who was in is either out or is bagholding. Nobody is actively 'buying' except for a few randoms like the people here buying every day with their 100$ paycheck which doesn't move the market. 
2	1523046338	9	Except for George Soros.But he dont got much cash
3	1523048067	28	Not after paying all those protesters amirite?
4	1523059472	4	i was thinking about making a shirt that says " if it makes you feel better than yes soros paid me to be here" wear it to the next leftist gathering
5	1523078175	1	You know what's really funny? 12-15 years ago, I had some ultra-lefty boomer high school teacher constantly bitching about the Koch Brothers. I told her "Maybe Trump will be president!" and she said "What, he's just a loudmouth." Maybe when Soros is dead, your shirt will make you feel so dated, like someone having a "It's the economy, stupid" shirt from the 90's or something. So beware, Soros has an expiration date. Maybe if or when cryptos get massive adoption, and the Federal Reserve is abolished, but life is still shit, we'll blame it on the Chinese  or the Russians or something. 
6	1523115059	1	for the record i dont think soros actually pays people to be a rallys. thats a bunch of shit cooked up by brain deds on the right
7	1523117967	1	I'd think he has *some* *really distant involvement, but isn't the Dark Lord of the Left or something. 
5	1523077244	0	I wonder what the going rate would be for a protestor to not only attend but also keep their mouth shut. Keeping people quiet is a lot harder than just getting them to show up.
6	1523078306	0	Start a quiet riot. Maybe hire deaf-mutes? Then, Fox will be like: "TONIGHT: SOROS, NOW HIRING QUIET GANG MEMBERS, FLASHING GANG SIGNS??" 
3	1523054602	4	Saying he's open to trading it doesn't mean he's gonna pump billions into it all of a sudden
1	1523049098	8	Yes and no. I wouldn't say everyone has already bought in. There was a major correction that turned crypto into a dumpster fire for about two months and it's still smoldering. We need to wait a little longer to see if crypto sentiment has really died down or if people are just waiting for the correction to blow over. 
2	1523049869	11	Waaat. We are not even halfway to any adoption. The December hype was big, but kot big in terms of equity. If we see major mainstream adoption, December will look like a childrens birthday party compared to the rave we have in stall
3	1523069059	8	That doesn't have anything to do with what I said.
4	1523073262	1	Yes it has 
2	1523093869	1	People forget quickly, but not this quickly. Give it 12 months (which is no time at all) and everyone will be marvelling about how the market hasnt dumped in Jan/Feb like it did last year, sentement will be rising, people (who cant afford to) will be gambling the farm on crypto again.
1	1523100186	1	It is typical for a retail investor (not a trader) to buy when prices are going up and therefore hold only one view. The loss of interest in buying for longer-term perspective is very obvious and normal. However, this is not the case for Bitmex where volume has increased 3-5x (billions) compared to Dec-Jan.  A lot of opinions are being exchanged daily and there is a lot of new money entering the market. Just an observation from another angle as interest in trading Bitcoin has actually increased significantly. 
1	1523043296	1	Oh shit. Waddup
0	1523034864	65	Just smoke some weeds and you will feel better 
1	1523046991	35	Some? Bruh I’ve been smoking like a chimney
2	1523047201	8	Yes since the dip which start from jan till now 
2	1523047226	9	Name checks out
2	1523095289	1	High five!
1	1523067189	-1	Why not just do heroin? . What a stupid suggestion. 
2	1523067608	3	[Heroin is much more dangerous.](https://www.erowid.org)
3	1523067892	-1	A 50caliber gun is more dangerous than a 9mm. I wouldn't go suggesting you shoot your dick with a 9mm because the 50 is more dangerous. 
4	1523075030	3	Both guns kill people, heroin kills people, and marijuana kills no one. Terrible analogy.
5	1523075147	1	Suggesting taking drugs are a small dip in the market is a terrible suggestion is my point. 
6	1523078687	2	Drug yes weeds is ok you will forget all the dip
7	1523087857	2	Weed is great, I'm baked as hell right now. Kotaibaw your advice is solid. 
0	1523035335	53	Hell yeah. This shit has caused me full blown depression. I lost interest in everything in life. Not a minute goes by that I don't think about my 40k loss out of 50k initial investment. And 20k out of that 50k was my mom's... she doesn't know. To think that at one point I had 150k and could have cashed out... now I have 10k.
1	1523038340	19	Stay strong dude, i'm sorry to hear that, that's tough. It's not worth becoming despressed though. I assume your motive to buy crypto is to create more wealth and live a happy life. So spend time with your loved ones in the meantime, find things to distract your mind and be patient. What we see now is temporary my friend, crypto developers didn't stop working because of the crash, in fact, we still see new developments. 
2	1523108749	1	>  It's not worth becoming despressed though. Becoming depressed isn't just a choice someone makes one day. And money problems are actually a huge driver of depression considering people need money to live every day. You are essentially saying money isn't anything to worry about but that is only true for people who have enough money they don't have to worry about it. This guy lost a large chunk of his moms investment  and she doesn't even know about it; how is that not something to be depressed about? That must be an absolutely huge burden on his shoulders and it is something that "believing in the technology" is not going to fix. 
1	1523037837	41	agree with previous posts - it's called asymetric risk/reward.  Hang on man, you're already eating a sht sandwich.  Might as well stick around in case they serve dessert
2	1523038066	28	When I started crypto I lost tons of money by day trading. I thought to myself, "should have fucking held." Eventually I broke even. So then I started holding, and got fucked even harder.
3	1523057331	-15	Probably because you hold shitcoins.
2	1523110915	1	Yeah man. Just keep eating that shit sangwich and eventually you'll get used to the taste. 
1	1523038400	10	Don't invest money that you can't risk man. Definitely not from someone else unless you have some reason to be sure that there will be either no or insignificant loss.
1	1523038184	10	man, you must have done some horrible trades. it is impossible to do x3 and back to -80% just with hodl.
2	1523038437	6	Look what happened to ZCL/BTCP fork.
3	1523040480	13	then i am sorry for you, but if you invest in something like BTCP... crypto is not free ride.
3	1523048339	1	Not to mention Bitconnect.
4	1523054264	2	The world is not anymore the way it used to be
2	1523108642	1	Bro almost all coins are down 80% from their high. 
3	1523116658	1	yea bro, but if you are in some point at 150k from 50k investment then it means he supposed to be -94% if he had 150k. You could be able to do this math if you are trader.
1	1523035499	4	Don't touch it and you will be good in 2-3 years. I mean it depends what you have invested in a lot, yes... But if it's any good, it's ok.
1	1523099322	1	So you stole $20k from your mom. 'grats, good son. You were too greedy to get out when $50k was $150k because you thought this would be your path to Valhalla. What you should do now is admit defeat, clear out what little you have left, and pay back as much of your mom's as you can, then admit to her you still owe her $10k.But, you're not going to do that. You're going to hang on until you have nothing to show for it.
1	1523102549	1	LOL
1	1523103098	1	You are ME!
1	1523072642	1	I think my depression is the only thing keeping me sane in this market.I just don't care that I'm down 80%. It means nothing to me. Who knew there were upsides to being dead inside. 
1	1523095705	1	this gotta be a troll
1	1523045776	0	sorry man that sucks...but how the hell did you borrow 50k from your mom without her knowing?
1	1523070153	-1	Good job idiot
1	1523037344	-8	You haven't lost a dime until you give up your coins. Don't sell out.
2	1523054574	10	Unrealised losses are still losses. Please don't perpetuate irresponsible gambling "coping methods" when someone has lost their shirt gambling irresponsibly.
3	1523055986	-1	Assets of all kinds spend time above water, sideways, and below water. That's the nature of investing. You can call hodling when down a "coping mechanism", but it's made a lot of people in this market very rich over the last decade. These people did not lie to themselves that they "gambled irresponsibly" when they were down, didn't capitulate to more patient and strategic investors, but rather conceded the reality that they had invested in a volatile asset class, and maintained the patience and fortitude to realize massive gains after being way down, sometimes for years.Selling at a loss in this very young and volatile market is strictly for suckers. 
4	1523061609	5	"hodl" is so childish I can barely bring myself to write it. Selling at a loss when further losses are expected is sound business. Holding indefinitely for a hoped-for gain "someday" is a surefire way to amass larger losses and end up insolvent. For example, anyone who bought at $19k and sold at 17k, while feeling burnt, would still be grateful to have taken their loss early. Anyone following your advice to hold on while prices plummet, cannot expect to sleep properly before October.
2	1523037948	4	I lost my mind and health on this.
3	1523038517	-1	Maybe so, but that was entirely a result of your attitude and of your fear. Your "gains" were never real, and neither are your "losses". None of it becomes concrete until the moment you sell.Your own impatience and fear are what is costing you. Courage. Patience. If you don't find them, others with those attributes will indeed take your money and your coins.Crypto is not a market for impatient cowards. Those types get completely rekt.
4	1523047692	5	> Your "gains" were never real, and neither are your "losses". None of it becomes concrete until the moment you sell.That is utterly stupid
5	1523051421	3	I agree. I've never understood the mentality that losses are not real until something is bought or sold. A loss can be a realized loss or an unrealized loss, but that is a tax designation, not a statement of reality.When the price of any asset is falling, there are three common responses and outcomes:1. Sell - this realizes the loss, but keeps it at the level at the time. The loss will get neither worse nor better.2. Hold - The asset may recover part or all of its value. You recover some or all of the loss.3. Hold - The asset may fall more and never recover its value. Your loss deepens.People have to decide for themselves the best course of action. #1 gives the only guaranteed result (even if it is one that is soul-crushing). Or one can gamble and hope for #2, but know that #3 is also possible.No future outcome is ever guaranteed. Anyone who makes a guarantee that #2 will happen, or that #3 will happen, is peddling false certainty.
4	1523038740	1	Yes, and he's been in this market long enough to understand it. You'll be fine, alot of us are in similar situations. I personally have lost more than that but I'm not down 80%. We will see much better days this year IMO.
4	1523038846	1	> entirely a result of your attitude and of your fearI agree. When my portfolio doubled and tripled I started spending so much money. Then it crashed and now I'm left with debt. Entirely my fault, I know. But knowing it was my fault does not make it any easier.
5	1523039159	11	You need to be very wary of the stories you are telling yourself. If you keep telling yourself that you are a fool, that you are irresponsible, that you have lost your mind, eventually you will begin to believe yourself.Almost all of the people in life that I've met that are suffering, are suffering because of the terrible stories they continually tell themselves about themselves.Stop abusing yourself. Give yourself a break. And take a long break from crypto. If you want to just cash out your original investment one day, maybe that takes 6 months, a year, five years. It's only money. Give your mom a hug. That will be more meaningful to her than any amount of money.
6	1523047794	1	That is very wise
6	1523052756	1	Wow. This is gold right here. And I agree. Money is money. You cannot control external events, but you can 100% choose not to react to the stories your mind is telling you. At the end of the day, they are simply thoughts. OP, you'll get through this.
0	1523052123	15	The thing is; I still think crypto is so much fun. Just buying and trading and holding, the entire crypto scene, the drama, entering codes, entering adresses, all of it so much fun. 
1	1523055219	2	You could just do ACTUAL crypto, y'know, cryptography. You could go try and do a number of different security challenges that reward money. 
2	1523060220	15	Only suckers work for their lambos
0	1523044595	7	VeChain bag holder? If so, i'm right there with ya.
1	1523102327	2	Check.
1	1523103561	2	Double check.
2	1523108811	0	Held through 2.60 to 9 50 and sold at 2.70
0	1523055800	23	This is what happens to all the people who were gloating "I don't give a shit about the tech I'm just here to make money".Well if you actually DID give a shit about the tech and understood how fucking exciting this all was, you'd have something to pay attention to during downtrends. You'd have a better idea of when your projects were going to see real world applications, and you'd have a constant engagement with what is, to me, the most exciting and interested and world changing technological field at the moment.So to be honest, if the fact we're in a bear market has destroyed all of your interest in crypto then you were really just playing shitcoin roulette anyway.  Don't get me wrong, I'm here to make money too, but you can bet your arse I give a shit about the tech too. Because it's awesome!
1	1523091169	1	Yea, the tech is improving all the time, no matter what the price is on the exchanges. The crypto currencies themselves don't know the prices, they just do what they do best in blissful ignorance. I really recommend reading "Blockchain Revolution" by Tapscott. This is a new industrial revolution and it's really friggen exciting to be a part of it. I am a developer myself and have dabbled in writing simple smart contracts on Ethereum.
1	1523093572	0	I don't see any technical reason for cryptocurrencies to exist except for privacy coins that hide illegal financial transactions. Blockchain has a few niche use cases beyond currencies. You're gambling just like anyone else, but from astride a high horse my friend. 
2	1523094421	2	> I don't see any technical reason for cryptocurrencies to exist except for privacy coins that hide illegal financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies provide a secure, transparent and accountable way to articulate value within a closed network or ecosystem.  They are a way to "align incentives", in the words of Open Zeppelin.  The idea of them being fiat replacements now only applies to a small and diminishing subclass of coins/tokens, and is an entry level misconception.  >Blockchain has a few niche use cases beyond currencies.It's the opposite. "Currency", as in fiat replacements, is a niche use of blockchain.  Instant, feeless money transfer, and private money, are just one small component of what blockchain heralds.  Blockchain allows for trustless networks.  It provides an immutable record of content that is distributed throughout a network, and obviates the need for a centralised trusted entity to oversee an agreement, contract or exchange of value.  This means nothing less than a fundamental restructuring of society around p2p networks.  A tremendous challenge to existing power structures and ways of social organisation.  It will be more socially disruptive than the advent of the internet.  You don't have to agree with me.  Time will tell.
3	1523110570	1	So, based on your description of the disruptive nature of Crypto assets. Do you think that many coins (200) will survive in 5-10 years or just 10-20 coins?
0	1523033341	18	I started this a few weeks ago and try not to think about any of it anymore because I really got too greedy and fucked myself out of a few lambos 
1	1523035290	15	Too greedy now = too smart in future
0	1523039041	7	> I was stupid enough to buy   Not predicting the future doesn't make you stupid. People have been bashing themselves after buying at the previous bullruns... Have they been right?
1	1523041651	24	I bought near the high in 2013.you all just need some patience.
0	1523039457	8	I care still, since some of my coins are ERC-20 with mainnets in place, I need to pay attention to coin swap.  Not selling and also not injecting anymore fiat into my portfolio.  HODLing for years if I have to, taking profits along the way if the gains are good. 
1	1523052930	2	which coins are these, can you tell us? 
2	1523053598	0	Completed: ICX, Nebulas (NAS)Upcoming: ONT, TRX
3	1523053695	1	always wanted to buy ICX tbh. 
4	1523053758	2	I would say right now is still a good time to buy.
5	1523053975	1	if i buy ICX now, i have to withdraw it to its own mainnet instead of MEW, right? 
6	1523054363	1	no, ICX is still ERC-20 and they are waiting to do the swap, so you can store in MEW until they release information.  They have indicated that the window to swap is 3 months after announcement so you'd have plenty of time to do it.
7	1523054417	1	thanks so much for info! now you are the reason of my future ICX bags instead of ENG bags! 
8	1523054610	4	welcome to the family.  Now if you get rich off of ICX one day don't forget me.  haha
0	1523043757	6	What I will say is that I am starting to like it. As you can see, more news is making the frontpage instead of people constantly shilling or spreading fud. I also think this is also a good time for this community to think really hard about what crypto means. Is it an asset or is it a currency? If the market continues to dip, will the regulators not care about us again? 
1	1523051896	2	I completely agree with your point of view. Of course it kind of sucks to see the numbers go down but this bear market forces you to look at the fundamentals again. Of course you should be looking at fundamentals no matter what state the market is in but when it’s a bull market it’s very easy to just see an easy money making opportunity and forget about the stuff that underlies that price. I definitely view “cryptocurrency” as an asset rather than a currency. There are certain situations I could imagine in which crypto could be a full blown currency used by a significant amount of people, but can a decentralized currencies be widely adopted by citizens of a developed nation? I don’t believe so. I  hope regulators do care. We need regulation in this market, because regulation brings certainty.
2	1523118957	1	Another 2008 and everyone will swap over. There just was no option the first time they gave away trillions to evil bankers. The outrage at the time was huge, but the options were minimal. Next time the options will be good and immediately at hand, the only thing that can end the dollar is the US government incompetence, and the 'management' of SS and Medicare could easily cause the next crisis, if Super QE starts killing the dollar value, when all the no trust funds run dry.
1	1523054565	1	Front page has definitely improved
0	1523035968	15	Fear not!  The impending deluge of cash from the Soros fund will usher in a new bull market full of moons and lambos!!Hodl!
1	1523037302	20	lol if you think the Soros thing is good news. You know what that guy is famous for? Devastating financial markets for a profit.
2	1523037916	10	Moon when?
3	1523038264	4	Moon? Just sold my house, brb buying Bitcoin.
3	1523039883	2	Moonpie when?
3	1523052388	1	Mars nigga...two years from now
1	1523043274	1	Soros slush fund.
0	1523058998	4	3 months.That's all it's been. Just a reminder that 3 months is an eternity in crypto.
0	1523034691	13	I think we all agree that it's not easy being in this market.I recommend you Google "crypto j curve." We already had our small bubble but hopefully we are beyond that now and will see large gains over time as the useful projects prove they can create real world value.Hopefully you invested in coins that have a real use case. If you did, you'll probably end up fine.
1	1523120123	1	There is so little real world use cases so far. Its almost pure hype. Some of the transact coins seem to work good, but there is almost no adoption. Eth probably has the best use case, but that is for buying other sh!tcoins, so its 'use' kinda depends on the hype train rolling on, which doesn't always happen, see Intel in the dot com bust. That was a bad time to be making internet picks and shovels...
0	1523054434	12	Now is a great time to be entering I think. Yes, you have a "bag" but if you continue to buy (responsible amounts) you can average your price down and get into profit sooner when the recovery happens. Best of luck whatever you choose.
1	1523065125	12	Or you can double down on losses
1	1523109028	1	"cost average your price down" is the stupidest cryptoinvesting meme outside of "HODLing". For someone who is already in the red with massive losses injecting even more money into the ecosystem is not the right answer. 
1	1523119695	1	Never catch a falling knife, buy on strength, but soon after the turn, NOT when your sh!tcoin is on the cover of Fortune. Bitcoin actually hit the cover on January 2018 . . . 'How High Will It Go ?', yes, that is literally what the Bitcoin cover said, damn near calling the exact top of the market with their pump !!
1	1523058394	0	This.
0	1523044367	8	"#Vergefam" probably. Look at them pumping that dead shitcoin.
0	1523063696	5	Go walk in nature, talk to your kids, read a book. Get a life.
0	1523031255	7	✊
0	1523035996	8	I simply mine 10-12 usd / day, transfer them to Neo (super cheap), claim Gas, get more neo. It really works. Have collected 10 Neo out of thin ...electricity this way. Thank you bears
1	1523047134	3	how much was your mining rig?
2	1523055792	11	$4500! He'll have that and the electricity costs paid off quarter past never.
1	1523052835	2	What do you mine
2	1523074842	1	hi, sorry for the late reply. Well I use sniffdog algo in zerg pool which switches every 5 minutes. Not a miner expert or anything but I am quite pleased considering the marketing.
3	1523086370	1	What GPU and card do you have? 
4	1523087628	1	4 1070 GTX, 3 1080 Ti's
5	1523087955	1	Woah can I ask what country you are in? What's electricity costs?
6	1523089665	1	no prob. electricity is 0.1 Euro per KWh but through a minor adjustment you can get 8 hours at 0.06. So 4 GTX + 3 Ti (Downclocked) are approx. 1350 W --> 1.35 KWh so the equation is  1.35 [(0.1) x 16 + (0.06) x 8) =  approx. 3.3 USD / per day in electricity. So net profit 7-8 USD. These are now, on a bear market and my calculations are not 100% accurate. But I channel revenues instantly to NEO so that I start accumulating GAS. I have a 3 year plan (equals the card warranty) that so far goes 95% by the book. If you are not bored I will share it you. Not much and nothing that will rock my finance but is indeed a passive income! Plus, if the bulls do come that will be awesome. But my plans are on this bear market. Edit. Country is Medditerannean planning to install photovoltaic if it goes well till the summer.
7	1523095031	1	All the best and goodluck to your endeavour! Do let me know how it goes in a few years time. 
8	1523101429	1	haha lets hope that at least I end up with profit!
1	1523053500	1	What are you mining and what hasheate? I’m not big in mining but just curious!
2	1523075036	2	hi sniff dog algo. Switches algo, hence hash rate every 5 mins. Not an expert have just 4 1070 GTXs (5% OC), 3 1080 Ti (20% Downclocked), considering buying another 1070 or two to see if I can reach 16- 20 USD / day. 
0	1523035956	10	I’m here for the tech news and progress of all crypto projects.I check prices to find deals on coins. Whales are building assets in a bear market. This is a huge opportunity to continue to build assets for the future.Bad news/market sentiment = good time to buy

0	1523036926	3	See you tomorrow
0	1523046218	3	I was always taught that you shouldn't INVEST i'm something if you don't understand and believe in its future.Around May last year I hopped on. However, I really believed that there would be a crash inevitably since it was blowing up too fast too quickly and most coins didn't have an actual product. Yet, I hopped on anyways because the idea makes sense and for the coins that I invest in, the people made sense. I was too young to hop onto the Internet 2.0 bubble, but I believe that this is going to be a long venture with similar payout timelines. The apples and MS of crypto aren't even out yet (though the Xerox may be). Having your foot in the game and an eye on the market at this point is gonna allow you to hop on the next train well before the others. That being said, that train may never come.
1	1523051129	-1	WRONG FAKE NEWS !!!! Ohhhh it’s coming, shhhhhhh!!!!!!!! Let it die down when nobody is looking BANNNNNGGGG RIGHT IN THE FUCKIN KISSER!!!!!
0	1523047429	3	Why do I have a feeling your portfolio consists of Verge and TRON?
1	1523102654	1	Cuz moooooooonnnnzzz!!!
0	1523060939	3	No, this is the best time to buy.  Need to think long term.
0	1523066514	3	You'll be back tomorrow.At least you are smart enough to hodl through it and not selling like some week-handed noob.
1	1523094627	1	Except he should have sold weeks ago. Anyone hodling now should realize that they have been duped in order to create a base for the crypto pyramid scheme, or they think the scheme will work out for them. 
0	1523067654	3	Lol! This post would suggest, it may be buying time.

0	1523040339	2	it is crazy making money man.  we all need a break and it sounds like you need one really bad.  enjoy this downtrend for some much needed R&R, because it will be time to get back to making money soon.
0	1523046410	2	Yes - George Soros
0	1523046464	2	I’m constantly reading news about how institutions and large investors are just waiting for the right time to get into the crypto market. Even some that were not too thrilled about it before seem to be changing their mind. I think we’ll know before the year is over which direction the crypto market is going. Even the slightest positive indication from the SEC could have a huge positive impact on the market. Tom Lee, the former chief equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase seems to think it may all change after the US tax day April 17. Another 10 days or so to see if he’s correct.
1	1523096798	1	From what I've heard, Wallstreet money is buying over the counter, which means their money isn't affecting the marketplace. At least for bitcoin, which everything is dependent on so far. I'm sure they'll buy the tasty alts when the market gets low enough, but I dont have hope for a resurgence in the near future if this is the case. Retail money isn't really interested in the market when its going down, which is good for smart investors, but not good for this current market cycle.  If wallstreet is buying OTC then they're just getting ready to dump their bitcoins on the market when the time comes in a couple years, oh boy. 
0	1523048195	2	dude wtf are you even talking about, you were under the impression that you were gonna buy these "bags" and be rich in by april 6 2018? are you ok bro?just chill out, you invested in something that makes sense.chill, out.

0	1523063849	2	When you're in it for the long term, why while you need to be updated every five minutes? Forget it. Enjoy life, go for a walk, be with friends. Crypto is going nowhere, because it is the future. It's not the future yet. 
0	1523066548	2	Nope. It’s still smart to keep an eye on the markets daily
0	1523076253	2	Didn't setup my coinbase account because I lost my license. Got a new license but forgot I wanted to buy crypto. A few days ago remembered oh yeah I wanted to buy crytocurrency. Jump on. Purchased a few thousand $ each of Ripple, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. Move to wallet and time to forget for a couple years. Thank God for losing my license, before I was going to spend $8-10k on half a bitcoin. 
0	1523038810	3	I still check every day but i've cashed out my initial investment (and then some), so i'm really just watching the action unfold. I have zero worries. Even if all this fails, if even things as big as VeChain or new innovations like IOTA turn out to not work out in the future, I still have a shit ton of MOD, and will have a shit ton of SMARC, which will payoff pretty fucking well imo regardless of what happens to the crypto "market"
1	1523065749	0	...This fucking guy
0	1523048937	3	Capitulation
1	1523054749	1	Not until the rest of you are saying the same. Bankers and exchange owners included.
0	1523055489	4	Man if that means not having to suffer through another one of your posts, I hope you stick with it
0	1523036933	2	Many people lost money this year. It`s sickening. The market is shit, but I am still holding because I believe it will someday bounce back strong. I hope it doesn`t take more than several months, because, for me, seeing money value down for years is unacceptable. 
1	1523054108	1	Nice backticks. https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics
0	1523056930	2	I'm tired of "buying the dip" I refuse/can't afford it.  Why buy the dip?  all the swing traders, make money and sell off, every couple of days. Rinse and repeat, It's infuriating. Just fucking HODL. As a HoDLer I accumulated buy buying the dip, but soon it's all going to worthless because of these fucking swing traders and Pump and Dump groups. 
0	1523032305	1	I still care, I just only check prices like once a week or something aside from seeing how btc is doing.
0	1523035049	1	I centralized all my coins to Binance and hardware wallets and deleted everything after the bitgrail fiasco. I'm just waiting now.
0	1523035213	1	Yeah man I don't check delta anymore and have pretty much forgot about it. Just hoping in 6 months it recovers 
0	1523035357	1	Im with ya brotha
0	1523036684	1	I had sell targets in 2017 and hit them about every 2 weeks. I don't expect to hit even one in 2018. So, yes, I don't give a fuck at all. Now, if my targets aren't met in 2019, I'll be pissed.
0	1523038517	1	Yeah, I've stopped caring too much about price.This show though, exciting as hell, twists and turns every day. Love the young crypto space.
0	1523042547	1	Very tired. Restarted my rig today for 100 times alrrady. 
0	1523042837	1	I see one of these copy pastas everyday.
0	1523042901	1	I spend my time mostly to read and learn more about this tech. I don't understand the mentality of deleting blockfolio or stop looking at cmc of some people. Still keep my eye open scouting for potential projects but with extreme caution and skepticism. If there is a time to find under radar project, it is during these bearish moment imo.  
0	1523043568	1	See you in a few hours. 
0	1523044360	1	Hold some coins, use a second stack to do some trading. I’m not making money (due to the deepening red), but I’m increasing my stack so it’ll be profitable once the market turns again. If you believe in the tech, then stop worrying about momentary price. Bet on the future and make the decisions today that will be the profit later on. This market is actually not that bad for trading on volatility. 
0	1523045202	1	Dont give a fuck check in!
0	1523046618	1	Yep. Me too. And ultra tired of rumous, fake news, fake FUD, more rumors and more fake FUD and shit "news".Hodling until this will go for real.
0	1523046650	1	We see a post like this at least once a week...I think more and more people are concerned about adoption vs current market price since majority of all investors are at a loss. 
0	1523047306	1	used to check prices and this sub a couple times a day, now it more of a once-a-week activity for me. it's too depressing. still hodling but i'm trying to forget about crypto for the time being
0	1523047311	1	Now is the time to go outside.  I'm serious.  Go do something else and maybe once or twice a week eyeball what you've got and check the news.  Take stock of the wisdom you've gained during the last bull run.  Take solace that you're already in the market when, not if, the next bull run starts.Now is the time to go out and enjoy life for a bit.  You'll know when it's time to be glued to the screen again.
0	1523047415	1	I'm a bit less stressed now, cashed out most of the profits and now holding just what I invested initially which is still in profit.
0	1523048229	1	You sound like you bought at some sort of ATH due to FOMO. 
0	1523048413	1	I'm just lucky. I got in before the big boom by a bit so I made back my initial investment and more. I've pulled out a bit more than my initial investment at this point and just hoping for the rest to go up someday. If it doesn't it's fine, but if it does than good for me i guess.
0	1523048879	1	don't look again until 2019 or beyond... it's impossible, i know, but good idea to get away for awhile... if you picked the right ones you will be smiling later. :-D
0	1523049195	1	Buy again and lower your average buying price. This way you will need only a smaller growth to reach breakeven.
0	1523049372	1	I'm down only 5%, so no. Actually pretty happy with my entry point.
0	1523049631	1	DAE get sick of all these DAE (something easy like "HODL not sell") posts? Just looks like you're asking for the internet points IMO
0	1523049809	1	Good for you. If you can invest right now turn the shit off. Keep up on news and check the price once a week or whatever. Not much is changing right now. I figure no new ath's till Q3 maybe even Q4. Itll take some time. But next year will be more like 2017 but better. So invest while prices are down because next year youll be wishing you poured more into some solid projects. 
0	1523049842	1	I fully agree with your title, but frankly with most things, not just crypto.
0	1523049845	1	If you truly believe in your investments, and you aren't trying to daytrade in order to make some additional money, just ignore it all.  You don't have to delete your apps; just try to use some self control and stay away from it all for a while.  Set some price alerts.  I realize that some people people are hurting financially from this market, but if you didn't invest more than you can afford to lose, that wouldn't be the case.  I set some price alerts, and stopped looking at prices and charts every day.  I take a glance every couple of weeks or so.  You will go crazy if you obsess over this market, and constantly checking up on it isn't going to change anything.  You are torturing yourself if you are doing this.It's only been 3 months since we changed to a bear market.  That is nothing; patience is a virtue for a reason.  Just think about the history of bitcoin's price movements if you are getting antsy.  *I realize that this is difficult for some people, especially if you overextended yourself and are suffering as a result.  OP is right (to an extent).  Crypto is the future.  We will come back eventually, and strong.  Cheers.

0	1523053321	1	Sign of capitulation
1	1523107961	1	Wouldn't the sign of capitulation be if he says "fuck it, I'm out" as opposed to "I am holding forever"?
0	1523054455	1	Yeah, I stopped caring about if it goes down lower. It gave me some interesting content to follow for a while as well as giving me an insight into trading. I fail to see how people can put all their money into something so volatile and expect not to get burned. I went into this like a blind man into a minefield.
0	1523054458	1	Its all a big Ponzi scheme guys. Now it's dead. I'll still hodl all my coins now but yeah if this market is regulated anyone can manipulate it and fuck everyone else.

0	1523054836	1	Would it be correct in saying the \*majority\* came in and got burned? It's going to take one hell of a bullrun to keep those people onboard.
0	1523055222	1	im kinda in the same situation has you on the part of not selling any time soon, on the other hand im still in pretty good profit so i guess it's an unfair comparison 
0	1523055290	1	When I get tired, I grab my mouse, and scroll out, and see the big picture.
1	1523108071	1	Wouldn't a scroll out tell you to sell now in this downtrend, and buy back in when a bottom is formed?
2	1523120210	1	You say that as if it's easy to guess the bottom.
0	1523055341	1	Honestly, if you didn't put all your life savings in. Why should you care? If you didn't go all in there shouldn't be a rush.
0	1523055380	1	Hey this was me for 3 years, now I’m up 12x...  no 11x...  10x... haha but seriously hang in there, seeya in a couple years.
0	1523055911	1	I originally bought for the long term. Then December happened and I thought "oh that was fast". And it sucked me in. So now I'm back to waiting for my favourite projects to do what they set out to do. When $sub $ada $hst $powr show real utility they'll run again, December was just a premature false start.
0	1523056120	1	Sorry to see your capitulation.
0	1523056177	1	Another day , another used to be moonboy kiddo turned crybaby. :))
0	1523057739	1	I  don't keep track of my delta app anymore, no. I put in quite a bit relative to my savings \(about half! I know, don't invest what you can't afford to lose \- in my case that was around six grand, and I work, so I figure it's not the end of the world if I *do* lose it, and hey, it might bounce back in a few years, maybe even sooner.I might put some more into ICOs every now and again, but that's it. I am, however, fiendishly addicted to the crypto space. It's just really interesting! The blockchain innovations are *craaazy*, like men walking on the moon crazy \(no pun intended, probably a Freudian slip though\). The crypto projects are a healthy mix of fascinating, hilariously stupid, and less hilariously fradulent. There's even a good dose of drama going on between the key figures in the space if you're that kind of nerd, which I am, and it all feels like history is being made, which it is. In front of us.I'm not going to invest in anything else for a while, but the blockchain/crypto space has become a part of my life. I started out writing a few articles about it and now cryptocurrency is my full time job, and I'm cutting ties with former clients and turning down pretty good job offers to work for less money in this space, because damn. i got the bug, it's too late for me.Don't do crypto, kids!^(PS) ^(Just) ^(do) ^(it) ^(once) ^(though) ^(it's) ^(really) ^(cool)

0	1523058560	1	Checking the prices constantly doesn't make them go higher, so it is just as well.

0	1523060109	1	How good it feels to have initial investment cashed out and tethered up with the rest since 12k :3
0	1523060139	1	Don't just bury your head in the sand. Look at this is an opportunity to average down. 
0	1523060285	1	I don't know why you guys lock yourself to just 'bagholding',There is still so much you can do. If you're stuck in an investment than diversify it. Best to have 20 chances to moon rather than 1. Even though it minimises your investment, this is crypto, moons can be 100x!If I had just bagholed than I'd be down almost 10x my ATH but instead I'm buying and selling digital land on decentraland. Buying and selling etheremon, I'm moving, I'm increasing my stack bit by bit. I've increased my portfolio by $30k doing this.There's still a lot you can do, don't let the state of the market dictate the state of your mind and make you feel locked or helpless.
1	1523061608	1	I would do this but, taxes. I just buy and HODL over and over so I never have to deal with bullshit taxes.
0	1523060868	1	In the unfolding situation, hesitation is the worst strategy. Steady plodding brings prosperity, hasty speculation, on the other side, brings poverty. This might sound banal, but it's nonetheless true.
0	1523061674	1	I love seeing these kinds of posts. All the angry comments, lost hope, given up mentality that's floating around these boards has my buy sense tingling. Three months off all time highs and the impatient have completely lost all hope. They are playing you all like little tiny itty bitty fiddles, hook, line and sinker. Man up boys, consider why you invested in the first place and you'll be enlightened and realize where this thing is destined to go, in the near future and beyond.

0	1523065512	1	Have already broke even and pulled out my initial investment. And with the coinbase bcash shenanigans I was able to give myself a nice christmas bonus on top of that. Now everything I earn is a happy bonus. I have sell orders placed at like 19k btc and 2500 eth for those. If it ever hits, cool. If not, whatever. :)
0	1523065591	1	Oh, chill out.  Who with half a brain didn't expect the market to go down eventually.  
0	1523065631	1	I mean ... hopefully you never have to "take your profits" .. hopefully your holdings are your profits and you can just spend them ....
0	1523065691	1	You'll wish you'd paid attention years down the road. Forget the money for a second. You're living in one of the Wild West periods of technology. Wouldn't it have been cool to have a front seat to the birth of the oil industry or integrated steelmaking?Fuck that - wouldn't it have been cool to keep tabs during the Age of Discovery, where big black parts of the map were suddenly becoming visible?Don't worry about the money. Technology always gets better. It's been headed in that direction for the last 13,000 years. The money will come. Just enjoy the ride.

0	1523065841	1	I only invested a few hundred dollars so I'm not too bothered which way it goes. Like many other people it helped me learn a lot about investing and the way crypto currency works and it was fun and I was happy to pay the price.I have also stopped looking at the prices, last time I looked was late January, at first it was because I didn't enjoy seeing the price fluctuations and now I just don't care!I still have a lot of faith in crypto currency though and the longer this goes on the better some of the news is becoming, if anyone can remember when the internet came around it took a long time for adoption.When the internet first came about it was slow and confusing and no one liked it so much, but look ahead over many years when adsl broadband came around and there were plenty of regular people using it at home and the speed was much faster. I think we still have plenty of time to go. 
0	1523066383	1	None of this crash surprised me. I even told my crypto friends back in January that I wouldn't be surprised if market cap would be back to 200b by June. I've adjusted my portfolio based on use cases I can understand and not market hype. I've been that way since day one. If it all goes to zero then fuck it. At least I supported something I believed to be a great good for the world. 
0	1523066494	1	I just cashed out for pm’s. It’s just an endless sea of “revolutionary” and “pioneering” blockchain technologies and turd coins right now.

0	1523070088	1	yep. i don't check this sub barely ever anymore. I check the prices maybe once a week. It's too late for me to cash out now so I'll just leave it for a few years and maybe I will be rich then
0	1523070566	1	come for the money, distract yourself with the tech.
0	1523072841	1	I've been chilling on my long holds. Early january I was in weekly swing trading mode. It's totally possible to make some money still, and time things right, selling stuff into USDT anticipating crashes. I actually did that after the january crash and made a lot after market recoverys and subsequent crashes.But it gets really tiring so I just made a long term portfolio and it's really nice not actually giving a fuck that bitcoin dropped to $6,500 today. I saw the news, it doesn't bother me at all.
0	1523074289	1	the only people besides seasoned day traders who made any money with crypto were the bull-headed bastards that never sold. hold that shit for at least 5 years.
0	1523075392	1	first time I've checked this sub in a couple weeks.  I am just hodling which was my goal anyawys..but have stopped being excited over crypto's future for the time being. Figure BTC might be back to 20k one day..just no clue when and nobody else does either.
0	1523075683	1	I was not going to comment but I think this is exactly what whales want you to do, fall asleep at the wheel. In these times the rich get richer and your average investor has a choice - be a victim and have things happen to you or take charge. You should use it to - get smart on technicals- understand fundamentals of projects that are progressing,-learn the tech - there is 10 high paying Blockchain Dev and solution architect jobs for every qualified applicant, -maybe event start something - VC money everywhere. The vision of Blockchain and a decentralized economy is about freedom and independence and to not be a sheep that is lulled into the lies they tell you and the lies you tell yourself. 
0	1523075861	1	Oof its painful. But everytime ive tried to sell it seems to spike in price in price immediately after. Im hoping things will take an upturn, but its too painful to look at my money depreciate in value everyday so ive stopped checking prices.
0	1523076168	1	Capitulation. The last sign of the bear cycle
0	1523076849	1	Theres only so many dips one man can buy!
0	1523077014	1	Remember when you were getting ready to invest and someone (or many) people told you "NOT to invest more than you're willing to lose" ? Be prepared to lose it all. At the same time be prepared to get insane returns. The only way to find out which way it will flow is to HODL. 
0	1523077333	1	Sounds you got in at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.
0	1523077874	1	Measure your wealth in good crypto coins not dollars then u will realize we are inning one still  No one does that yetMaybe never sell out
0	1523078478	1	Ladies and gentlemen... this is what capitulation looks like.We all suffer with you at the moment but remember that this is what a volutile market is. Big ups and big downs :). Im a bit tired to but since my bank blocked visa and mastercard against Coinbase im convinced that crypto is the new era.Banks buying exchanges, price manioulation, banks blocking payments to coinbase etc. Everything starts to unfold. Crypto is the new money... what we see now is just the banks and big fish doing everything they can to secure their power in the new economy by ripping off small investora as most of us are. Nothing changes banks and investment firms will forever make millions by tricking the littleman, even in crypto... best way to limit their power is to hodl for now.hodl long and prosper. \\//
0	1523078694	1	I keep DCA-ing and don't any single fuck about current price...My average cost will follow the market (due to DCA). Once the rebound and bull start kickin, I'll rip the benefit...
0	1523078867	1	see it more of an opportunity to learn. Watch the markets ups/downs, keep up with news, trends, opinions and see if you can glean anything from it. If not, then you are good walking away. I'm taking the opportunity to learn all I can. Best of luck to you!
0	1523079703	1	im with you man. hang in there.
0	1523082390	1	The amount of people who put in gambling money, got bored and hodl is probably fairly high. A small minority got way to emotionally invested (perhaps due to.over financial investment) and still hang out here. Don't worry, it might go up again in a couple months, and a bunch of excited idiots will flood back in

0	1523086673	1	I haven't looked since the huge dip in January/February lol Don't give a fuck and I think many people as well. And I am sure more people not giving a fuck are the reason why the price hasn't going up.People in Korea don't care anymore. I don't see anyone talking about crypto and it's the same reason why the prices are not going up. No one is buying or caring. 
0	1523088639	1	Why would you post something like this if you didn't give a fuck, makes no sense.
0	1523089143	1	Apparently you give a fuck since you posted this.
0	1523091050	1	This is how bull markets start.  It's a matter of having enough people that refuse to sell. A certain critical mass in relation to buyers.
0	1523092382	1	I haven't checked Delta for like, a month. I'm still trading but I don't care to know about the total balance. 80% of my shit is straight holds in cold storage anyways though so it doesn't really matter right now - i only care about the short term plays and what I keep on the exchange.
0	1523092405	1	The market is so boring for last 2-3 weeks that I find myself not even check coinmarket for few days. It always goes like this: BTC rises 300-400 USD then goes down agan > rinse and repeat
0	1523094716	1	Just shut up and lets meet in 5-10 years. ^letshopeforthemoon^._.
0	1523096672	1	Went from constantly consumed with crypto to barely paying attention. I am still holding the projects I believe in for if the market ever turns around, buy until then it's just too depressing, I'll be enjoying life.
0	1523096731	1	I'm not tired and I do give a fuck, but I'm not stressed out or worried, if that's what you mean. There's a very real possibility that we'll see a renewed turn for the bearish (even more so than until now) in the next week or two - *or*, we can see a reversal that leads to newer highs. One of those two will almost certainly occur.To me, if it turns even more bearish, that just means I can get more for my fiat when I get my next paycheck. And if it turns bullish, that means I can see realized gains faster. I don't think cryptos are done. Since I believe that, well, up would be nice, but down isn't bad either, as that opens up more potential for future gains slightly longer term. Either way I'm riding this either up or straight into the damned ground, whichever happens, no half measures. I don't think I was stupid to buy, either, I used the best info available to me and made my choices. No regrets, nor do I (as I said) think this is remotely done. 
0	1523100317	1	Hype got out of control but i bet you the value of yr initial you won’t take a dime out when it ramps up to break even. I said the same thing after the Dao 
0	1523103555	1	Sunk cost fallacy.
0	1523115198	1	At least you're not selling.  BTC and the alts will come back in due time.  Only choice is to HODL.  If you sell now and take a huge loss all you'll do is transfer wealth to the elites and whales.  As Buffet has said many times..."The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient" and that holds true in crypto too (assuming you've value invested in legitimate projects of course).
0	1523118387	1	This seems to be the common sentiment now. This means we have reached the capitulation phase of the correction. Prices will begin recovery soon. 
0	1523048579	1	Discipline..discipline...discipline...cant stress enough how important it is.. I know people will say its easier said than done and I personally used to be one of them.I've mentioned this in other subreddits and I'll say it here.One of my favourite quotes from warren buffet is the following"if you look at the price when investing.Your actually gambling".Always invest in what you believe in,because that faith with undoubtebly be tested very very hard..its not a coincidence that in life you are far more likely to meet poor people,than it is to meet rich ones.Learn to stay forcused on the future which is why you got into crypto in the first place(at least i hope you did).the rest will take care of itself.Another important aspect that is mostly overlooked.put a high value on your time and effort.rich people do that constantly.If after all you've been through to even contemplate the idea of simply breaking even shows a lack of self worth.I am not trying to insult you ,but trying to awaken your senses that you started this journey.....now see it through.What I wrote here is the words of wisdom my father passed on to me and it has served me well the past 20 years in my professional career and investments.hope they help you do some soul searching and decide to push your limits to find out what your trully made of.that is what life is all about,self discovery.
0	1523058677	1	Oh hell yeah. I grew so tired of waking up to see my holding decreasing in value because of Bitcoin trading pairs. Grew tired of great partnerships resulting in the price either decreasing or barely moving. I don’t even check the price anymore, just the news. It isn’t worth it. Keeps me from FOMOing because I see another coin rising while mine doesn’t. Much less stressful. I made sure I was happy with the amount of coins I have, and I’m now 100% content just playing the waiting game, but not obsessively like I was when the prices started dropping in January. Ignoring the prices may result in me missing out on something special at a significantly low price, but I’m fine with what I can’t see. Ignorance is truly bliss. I recommend it to anyone who’s stressed here. Best of luck to you brother.
0	1523060294	1	just remember in 2000 amazon stock went from over 100 to below 10.....you can be sure that many people where broken by such a huge crash... the ones that saw the light at the end of the tunnel and had their investment thesis intact and didnt sell ended turning 10,000 into over a million in 17 years

0	1523035389	-1	This absolute desperation of yours makes me happy, meaning upward breakout is near ;)
1	1523036271	1	This. I've even felt some of it myself but then you catch yourself and realize that it means the market cycle is ACTUALLY here. It's not when you want to say it's here, it's when most people genuinely feel the fear and depression. 
2	1523043588	3	Except that most of these coins aren't blue chip stocks and are more akin to penny stocks, which people lose everything on all the time.
0	1523043350	-1	It's a great feeling know that you hodlers were wrong. Everyone said to just hodl and you'd be rich. It's hilarious. 
1	1523057448	5	Lol as if hodling meant for 3 months... fucking moron
2	1523070041	-2	You better not be holding, because a moron that holds after a 70% drop is...just something we cannot categorize 
3	1523070208	3	no better time to sell than after a massive drop!
4	1523118444	1	Better to sell now then when it's at 2k.
3	1523079632	3	I hodled through an 85% drop, and I'm now doing swimmingly, thank you very much.  I just don't think crypto is for weak hands like you.
4	1523118412	1	If having weak hands means selling near the high then you're right. Of course you can't sell at the high, but on the first bear flag you should've sold and then bought lower. You're literally throwing money away by holding. 
1	1523049417	3	First of all the fact that you get a great feeling from that speaks volumes about what a turd you must be. Second I'm not sure why you think anything is over, It's just getting started. Hope it doesent ruin your mood when others do become wealthy or successful 
1	1523079512	2	Well, I've hodled, and I'm up 6000%.

In financial circles, this term is used to indicate the point in time when investors have decided to give up on trying to recapture lost gains as a result of falling stock prices. Suppose a stock you own has dropped by 10%. There are two options that can be taken: you can wait it out and hope the stock begins to appreciate, or you can realize the loss by selling the stock. If the majority of investors decides to wait it out, then stock price will likely remain relatively stable. However, if the majority of investors decides to capitulate and give up on the stock, then there will be a sharp decline in its price. When this occurrence is significant across the entire market, it is known as market capitulation.

0	1523037779	-2	imho the best way how to get over this not so funny bear market is to do swingtrades. for example, my main hold is Ven, i used to keep at least 75% and try to diversify the rest hoping to catch some pumps.once it happen, all profits going back to ven. the worst thing what can happen is that you will get stuck with bunch of altcoins which is not too bad. it keeps me focused on other things than how we going slowly downhill. There is still a lot of opportunities how to increase your stack even in bear market.

1	1523050634	2	YTD stands for "Year to date," meaning since January 2018. I think you mean "over the last year."What you are missing is that likely the majority of cpyto buyers entered the space in November/December last year at the height of the mania.
