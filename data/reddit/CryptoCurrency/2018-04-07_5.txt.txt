1	1523075046	65	It's called paper terrorism. 
2	1523108606	4	It would actually be following the law they created.
3	1523112038	5	Thanks Jimmy, let's not forget the obvious.
2	1523109893	2	Thank you. I've been looking for the name for that for a long time.
2	1523094650	-4	i would call it paperissm.
3	1523101318	-1	Paprycide.
0	1523091415	22	protip: move to portugal 
1	1523111991	4	Or trade on an unverified account with some random name like 99% of people are doing.This is so stupid. They will punish a handful of people who chose to trade over the table and the vast majority doing it under the table will just laugh.
0	1523080537	29	I mean, some countries make it illegal and some countries just make it impossible to trade in cryptocurrencies. Also, it was an announcement and not a passed law. Looking at financial markets, anything thats just a statement without an action is just a way to try and manipulate the market in my opinion. Are there any polish exchanges? Im sure some of these guys will be buying up all the liquidations and then flip-flop from their original statement and before you know it, the law never goes into effect, but a few officials and their friends are sitting there with their pockets full
1	1523085727	7	I think BitBay is polish if in not mistaken 
2	1523099941	2	it is. 
1	1523086024	7	I can't be alone in having assumed Poloniex must be when I heard the name.
1	1523092099	2	> it was an announcement and not a passed lawImportant to highlight it. Thanks for the clarification.We need more people to post summaries especially when it is a complex matter in a foreign language.
0	1523083849	26	Get your coins by mining if you can. Try to mine by GPU/CPU's. ASICs can alarm the gov. Do not use any centralized exchanges. Always do your trades on a d-ex. Never ever get back to FIAT. Find a way to spend your coins as is.They'll be helpless against this.
1	1523085878	16	Its retroactive. They already screwed them.
2	1523087561	8	I just read that part. "time machine"That's really fucked up.
2	1523095256	3	How are they going to regulate what they can't touch? Like the guy said, once you're in fiat, you're back in their territory. Once you're in crypto, you're no longer in their territory, regardless of whatever time machine they have. Unless I'm missing something.
3	1523096895	3	Transaction is taxed, trading cryptos itself, as far as I understand.
1	1523111001	2	Or mine with hard drives. The government won't even notice the impact
2	1523114943	2	Yep. HDD's are also valid miners.
1	1523085367	2	It's done man, this shit applies to all the trades that were already done.
2	1523094653	1	Crazy
1	1523103894	1	Or gee, I don't know, use localbitcoins? I don't know what the situation is with throwaway debit cards, foreign bank accounts and gray payment systems in Poland, considering that it's in the EU but not really the first world, but there's always cash as last resort.
0	1523063918	154	To be fair, Poland is fucked in every other way in respect to it's government and is heading towards a very dark place. So, there's that.
1	1523118227	3	But... but... their country made The Witcher
1	1523079166	25	Yeah, because we here in the US are totally not going to that very same place. Nuh noh noh.
2	1523085125	13	Mmmm MMMM MMMMMMM
3	1523104279	8	HEY^HEY^HEY
4	1523105693	8	WAAASSSSuuuu WAsuuuu WAAASSSSSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPP!!!!!
2	1523081834	44	We are nowhere near Poland levels. It's just pain dishonesty to act as if we are. Are we where we should be? No. However, we're not in the same ballpark.
3	1523088774	5	Umm what's happening in Poland that's so much worse than US? Have they elected a neo nazi yet? 
4	1523114635	6	TIL Donald Trump hates Jews and will take our guns away
4	1523097994	7	People here are pretty close minded. It's not even the "neo-nazi" part that makes it as bad as it is for Poles, its about incompetence in market regulations and taxes. Basically the biggest Polish companies are only government owned, energy & resources companies. We do not have a high tech automotive, electric utility or finance industry like the western countries have. And yet the government does not support private entrepreneurship, therefore making sure that we will remain a periphery of any progress for years.
5	1523098252	14	My bff tried to warn you fucks. 
6	1523110657	2	Hahahah
4	1523089230	13	[removed]
3	1523089058	-9	It's much worse in USA IMO. There is no voters suppression in PL, pigs don't kill innocent people, government isn't actively seeking nuclear war with DPRK.
4	1523090198	6	I really wish people like you would seek professional help. 
5	1523092634	9	It's funny how you can't say anything bad about the USA on Reddit. Keep living in your dreams of your country being number one :) The reality is that your debts will most likely let you go into bankruptcy in about 5-10 years and then you guys will start to invade every country you can. Downvote me, the truth will always stay the truth.
6	1523103648	6	The US has plenty room for improvement  and plenty to be criticized on but all of those guys claims are sensationalism. Just remember in your (lol) 5-10 years, if the US goes bankrupt, the world economy goes to shit with us since you failed to understand that economies are intertwined these days.
7	1523111863	2	Nah I get that. I also didn't want to bash the USA. It is just strange that every country is shit except USA on Reddits eyes. You are right. Germany will go down with you guys. (Depends how strong it will go down) It's just that American people seem to live in the USA and have no idea how the rest of the world works. America is not even close to be the first.I hope it goes well for all countries! But keep in mind you always have to look at something in different angles. The world is in war right now because countries like America and Russia can't get their shit together. Please research politics like you do with crypto, your eyes will open, trust me. I hope you have a wonderful day! 
5	1523093285	-3	Did I misrepresent current situation in the land of the free??
6	1523103786	1	You would still spin your paranoid and sensationalist bullshit. 
7	1523105185	-1	Would? Do you even speak English?
8	1523110174	1	Would is correct so apparently you don't... and it doesn't matter. Again, seek mental help, your thought process isn't healthy. 
6	1523101051	-6	you forgot about the decadence leading to the normalization of every sexual perversion imaginable...
7	1523106331	2	Last I checked we weren’t Rome. 
7	1523102061	1	Wait wut?
3	1523107923	1	You have blinders on. 
3	1523087686	-2	Hence my usage of the words "going to".
4	1523088153	2	Assumptions are unhealthy. 
2	1523088362	6	Not at all, because the US population is beginning to see through all the bullshit.
3	1523097304	-6	Your president is Trump.
4	1523097759	1	I don’t have a president. I have a prime minister.
2	1523111565	2	the world is not any more the way it used to be, noh noh noh.
2	1523088626	3	Lmao, not even close.
2	1523081398	3	I‘m pretty fine with Germany atm., come over mate 
2	1523084036	-11	You can leave and move to Poland if you think so, stop hating on your own country, smh
3	1523104037	3	" you can't say that because you were born in a particular geographical area! Me smart"
3	1523091416	1	👍
3	1523087825	1	🤦‍♀️
2	1523091236	-9	Do you mean a return to making a priority of policy that is good for industry, corporations and job creation, the securing of our borders, the rejection of socialism on a global scale?  Because that is exactly where the US is heading.  Unless you're of the variety that wants to see our country's economy and culture in the crapper, I'm not seeing where the problem lies.
3	1523117638	1	Not sure why you’re getting downvoted for your truthful and logical statement. I guess the truth hurts 
3	1523104144	0	 you're right, why would we ever prioritize job creation and Infrastructure for technology?
1	1523116154	1	Bhahaha, look at what I have started. Fight peasants, fight!
1	1523089788	-11	Why because Poland refuses to go the route of the dodo like the EU and have their population and culture destroyed by migrants who won't assimilate?  Real dark place there.
2	1523119973	1	You’ll be downvoted by American 56%ers who can’t fathom the idea of a national identity or national culture, but you’re the right one here. 
2	1523097667	-1	/\/\ FOOL /\/\
3	1523104195	0	 solid reasoning, care to elaborate?
1	1523087218	-11	No, it is a perfect fine democracy.Just because you don't like it doesn't mean those who live there don't like it.And will just watch while it goes the way of turkey.Because that's how democracy works
2	1523105910	3	Didn't the ruling party basically fire the Supreme Court, ending judicial oversight? Yes, it's perfectly normal... 
2	1523089219	1	It's democracy with a unhealthy bit of troubles at the moment caused by government. However it still works. 
2	1523088407	3	Fascist spotted.
0	1523092616	9	Germany may be the best EU state for crypto taxation (0% after 1 year).Poland may become the worst EU state for crypto taxation.There can't be such huge discrepancies in members of the European Union. It won't last long before some countries try to find a common ground. If very different tax rules apply, there will be a **strong tax competition** among  EU countries. That goes against the current (urgent) movement to create what they call "tax harmonization".
1	1523105763	3	Pretty sure the Isle of Man is one of the best. No CGT at all if I understand their tax code correctly. 
2	1523106665	2	Go figure the place where some of the craziest fuckers on earth go fast has completely reasonable crypto tax laws. 
3	1523111685	2	Well it's an island where many of the UKs richest people reside so it's not much surprise it has favourable tax codes for the wealthy. It's really a mini tax haven within the UK.It doesn't have any Corporation tax either if my memory serves me right.Edit:because I can't spell.
2	1523111550	2	>  Isle of ManIsle of Man is not a member of the EU.
1	1523094234	4	> 0% after 1 year)IF you dont trade during that 1 year, though
2	1523101620	2	And if you don't receive any form of dividend (think staking). Otherwise I agree with /u/Organic_Pineapple. 
0	1523085309	15	They want to fight a force that they don't understand, so they fuck up people's lives. Typical Poland. I'm leaving this shithole for good.
1	1523104253	2	portugal is the way to go
1	1523101979	1	Ireland and England are okay. Easy to get their with a EU passport. If they ask about employment just say you're good at car washing...
2	1523105555	2	Also Ireland is great if you like paying 33% on all your capital gains. Banks need their bailout money after all.
2	1523106801	1	Sad because I can't wait to get off these shitty isles.
0	1523084351	5	Oh oh oh. Polish get out now lol. It makes not much sense too. For every transaction you pay 1% of the amount... indefinitepy... how can they measure this though? I mean, I would barely be able to get a record or so from all my transactions and I think I'd just and do 2 dummy transactions on record and pretend those were the only ones?
1	1523096849	2	>Polish get out now lolPeople tend not to like it when they come over here (UK) even though they do good work for cheap
0	1523059519	30	The only thing the Polish government does is destroy shit...
0	1523074380	12	Wasn't there a time when people fought wars over bullshit taxes like this?? "Like what happen did your balls drops off?" joker...
1	1523085819	5	Yes there was, for instance if a mayor was caught stealing from the town, or deceiving...he would literally get dragged out of his office, and brought to justice immediately.     Maybe hanged if it was severe.    Nowadays we just read about corrupt politicians everyday. 
2	1523086818	0	lol even worse after that guys screws the people over they vote him back in when he promises free shit again. Seriously if i ever get become a politician im gonna run democrat promise all the usual liberal bs (i live in liberal part of America) and then just not deliver on any of it then blame someone for it not working and come election season promise the same shit again and just stay in office forever... 
3	1523099361	1	Just because some people suck doesn't mean it's ok to become a sucky person. Aspire to help others instead!
3	1523087391	0	Republicans screw shit up, democrats take the same thing and screw it up more. 
4	1523087800	-1	Oh i hate both parties im just saying democrat because of where i live if it was more conservative place i would just run republican and do the same thing and not deliver either. It really doesn't matter because just like with shitcoin's no cares about the tech, or reads the whitepaper( or the bill getting passed) it all about making voters/investors FEEL good.
0	1523080601	5	So basically anyone trading crypto in Poland has to pay the government a 1% commission on their trades and file paperwork (which one would hope could be electronic/automated).
1	1523107134	1	1% of every singe transaction one has done.  Doesn't matter if crypto to crypto, or crypto to fiat. So if you've got 100$ and traded this sum once you owe 1$, twice 2$, and so on. And you have to pay capital gains tax on top of this. Oh and for the 1% it doesn't matter if you gained or lost something. 
2	1523110114	1	BananaRepublic Belgium has a 0.27% tax on every transaction for equities, doesn't matter if it's a bad trade or not. You have to pay it.  The big joke is that you don't pay this tax for futures and options. Why? Because professional traders use derivatives much more compared to your average retail trader. Crypto is also taxed 33%, but at least you don't have to pay any taxes as long as it's not income, so I can literally accumulate a million Euro without paying taxes, as long as I don't withdraw any. 
0	1523103242	3	In short: Every time you exchange fiat to crypto, or crypto to crypto, you pay 1% of the _**value**_, not of the profit. This means that after 100 transactions you're taxed 100% and should just give up your money for the government.also, *I'm not too sure about this*, but when you finally cash out, swap crypto to fiat, you pay standard business income tax on any profit(and the previous taxes don't count as losses). You can't trade crypto without registering a company.And, law has not changed, the interpretation of the law used by Polish IRS changed, which makes this retroactive, so anyone who traded over the last 8 years could be due couple billion in tax, and IRS won't give up even when it gets so ludicrous.
0	1523077840	7	[KURWA](https://i.imgur.com/GWdWNQj.png). Poland cannot into ~~space~~ moon. :(
0	1523087488	6	I am truly sad for Poland. I never have been there but I know they are experts on building sailboats. What a shame. I would get one from them with bitcoins.
0	1523095320	3	"blablabla crypto can't get rekt by governments blablabla crypto is above law blablabla" well that's true if you're ready to leave your friends and family and go abroad. 
0	1523068298	6	Work for someone who pays with bitcoin. Hodl it. Trade it. Profit. Governments can suck my ass. 
0	1523084525	3	Well, people can always meet up in person and send each other crypto, then pay each other in cash for what it's worth so the transactions will be off the books
1	1523099631	3	US is already busting such creative individuals in sting operations that aim to target those who aid in money laundering. 
1	1523098106	3	Aka tax evasion 👌🏻
2	1523120122	1	so free trade = tax evasion? sounds about right if you're a STATIST
0	1523085847	2	Escalate this to the EU supreme tribunal or is this not the case?
1	1523103616	3	Well, they first need to sue someone over their unpaid tax and the defendant needs to appeal this trough every single court climbing to the EU Supreme Court. Until they start suing nobody can do anything against this.
0	1523090705	2	Time to move to Malta.
0	1523092637	2	its easy to travel in EU:) fo them move somewhere else atleast virtualy
0	1523082778	6	The ultra conservative aka right wing party is ruling poland
1	1523096895	5	Law and Justice Party is a creepy name...
2	1523104470	1	 rhetoric is a Powerful Beast
1	1523095992	7	right wing my ass, this party is starting to look like communism reincarnated more and more
2	1523105905	5	Both Right Wing and Left Wing are Authoritarian. The free market was never right wing it was always "North Wing" or some other third wing. People were sold propaganda that the Right Wing was Pro Free Market, so that they could be tricked into Fascism. Oh you like free market? Well we have big business. That makes us free market right? 
2	1523099746	-1	Poland is a weird country. Our previous ruling liberal party was very socially conservative. On the other hand current right wing government is very socialist.... 
3	1523100103	1	I judge governments by their economic decisions, religion, partiotism etc. are just chaff and marketing to me, both of those parties are very leftist 
4	1523100326	2	Fair enough. Most people assume the whole ideology + policy package when they talk about alignment, after all the ruling parties have impact on more areas than just economy.
0	1523059329	5	But, but governments can't do anything to crypto! its p2p!!!This sub :/
1	1523063218	25	just use decentralized exchanges or exchangs that don’t require kyc. problem solved.
0	1523085783	1	Oh wow. That's awful, if I was in your situation I'd leave the country and go anywhere that doesn't have ludicrous rules!
1	1523086975	4	>ludacrisOh man... it's spreading...
2	1523087437	1	Apologies, sometimes my spelling is a bit shit. Oh well, lucky I deal with numbers irl.
3	1523087833	3	No worries, it just concerns me when seemingly the only time people have seen a word used is when it's deliberately misspelled as the name of a rapper.Not you specifically, just a trend I'm noticing. Been seeing it a fair bit lately
4	1523088063	1	Hahaha my bad! Photographic memory, literally the only image I had in my head of how it was spelt. Will not happen again! Same here. It'll really concern me when I begin to see their, they're and there mixed up. 
0	1523101566	1	Poland has much more urgent problems than this...
0	1523101758	1	Sucks to be a Polish trader. I expect they'll see a heck of a lot of underreporting.
1	1523107531	1	A few months earlier the government got all info on people trading on Polish exchanges, and e.g. bitbay is Polish. So it'll be impossible for a lot of people to do this. 
0	1523102022	1	Don't talk about crypto with people from the government, quite easy to not get into trouble.
0	1523103835	1	Well this is fucked up.
0	1523104482	1	Who thought this was a good place for a crypto bank??  Oh yeah, bitfinex.
0	1523111460	1	It's very simple. We hurt short-term because of these decisions certain governments make but they will be hurting more in the long-term. Blockchain technology is here to stay. They better adapt and welcome it so they can flourish off of it as well.
0	1523112752	1	>Oh - tax debts are inherited and can pass on to children.What in the actuall fuck?
0	1523115902	1	I'm surprised smart people still live there.
0	1523115912	1	I'm surprised smart people still live there.
0	1523117030	1	Suicides? This isn't something I like to say, but just fucking move honestly.
0	1523078361	0	Why is poland fucking up so bad??. They made great strides recently for freedom over there and yet this smells like commie bankster fud
1	1523080195	3	You vote right Wing, you get right wing 
2	1523082011	3	Thats not right wingStatism is statismBanks love statism
3	1523086862	12	European politics don't mirror the US.The spectrum tends towards the right being socially conservative, authoritarian to the individual and nationalistic combined with a bias towards corporate deregulation. The left tends to being socially liberal, permissive to the individual and globalist combined with a bias towards protecting the individual.The Polish government is definely right wing in European policy blocs. By US definitions (especially amongst crypto libertarians) both are statist. There isn't really a non-statist option. Being surrounded on all sides by people who want to invade you for centuries really makes one reliant on infrastructure.And Poland has been invaded a lot. 
4	1523116458	1	AgreeThey need to embrace cryptoAnd likely will in the end
4	1523089055	-5	They not right wing, they are pure socialists. 
5	1523090205	4	stop it. just stop it with the lies. i mean: WHY? why would you do this in public, where it's for everyone to see what BS you spout. that's just...stupid. 
6	1523090508	-2	What lies? Their politics have nothing to do with right wing. They introduced social benefits like no other party before. They increasing public employment and they are increasing taxes. If anything this is going more towards communism than right wing. 
7	1523097070	0	Yup, people just throw terms like 'left' and 'right' without any idea what they mean.
8	1523106206	2	Aye, and we are being downvoted while somebody above made the same comment and is being upvoted. Reddit logic...Those people do not want to go into the essence of the problem and understand it but just want to label it accordingly to their philosophy and discredit anybody that disagree without making an argument. They just do not want to discuss, for them everything is either black or white. 
6	1523097127	-1	I just love it when somebody edits comment after i replied on it. Also, instead calling people out maybe make some arguments? Or your understanding of discussion is to call people stupid because they dont agree with you?
2	1523084104	-1	God save.
1	1523086108	0	Its funny because Iceland gets nailed by banks constantly. They just booted another minister out over Panama papers a year or so back not even 8 years after banks collapsed them.  Maybe they got it right this time.

1	1523065580	16	40 million people contry aint that small. Thats a biger population than Canada. 
1	1523057450	5	Not so small, actually.

3	1523063218	-6	They should have left the EU a long time ago. The EU is almost as cancerous as coinbase.
2	1523063325	0	I don’t doubt that. Although the polish government is fairly corrupt, which now that I think about it doesn’t have much to do with your statement :)
1	1523060582	2	10/10 poles joke
0	1523094590	0	It's ok. Most Polish are in the UK working anyway. Factory job i worked taught me so much Polish.. Ok just enough to ask a beautiful girl on a date... Most awkward date in history but she was super nice.
0	1523091960	-1	shit...hole
0	1523058891	-42	Literally nobody gives a shit about Poland or what happens in Poland. When was the last time you heard anything happening in Poland on the news?

2	1523059670	-21	Not an American, so my point still stands. Please provide an example to prove otherwise.Besides, regulation in Poland will have zero effect on world crypto market. 
3	1523060072	18	Because it could happen in any country Einstein!  Ignorance truly must be bliss.
4	1523060175	-25	Not really. When was the last time any developed country looked up to Poland for laws and regulations? And thank you for calling me an Einstein. I'm honored. 
5	1523061480	14	Dude how old are you? Judging by your response I’m going to assume that you’re a preteen. So let me try to explain this in a way that will make sense in your prepubescent mind.This isn’t about what the cool kids are doing. America is arguably a world power and hasn’t set any legal standards since the abolishment of slavery. In fact the US is behind most developed country’s in almost all categories. Regardless, this isn’t about political philosophy. It’s about the fact that the majority of the crypto market (noobs) think that crypto is untouchable. It’s not, and Poland proved that. Therefore your comment was arrogant, you’re ignorant, and you’re really going to have to learn how to read between the lines if you ever plan to make money  in this market, or to just get by in life in general.
6	1523078984	7	America abolished slavery a couple of centuries after Great Britain. So no, they didn't set that standard either 
7	1523083483	2	I standard corrected
6	1523061794	-6	Wall of text. You still don't understand that nobody cares what happens crypto wise in Poland. It's like saying government of Nicaragua is clamping down on crypto. It has no effect on the rest of the market. 
7	1523064176	19	I love how four paragraphs is considered a wall.
8	1523084167	5	It is by the illiterate.
8	1523064256	-4	We are not here writing poems or essays. It's reddit. Anything over one paragraph is a wall of text. 
9	1523078617	9	You should stick to Twitter, kiddo.
9	1523066961	-11	I'm upvoting all your comments for saying the truth bluntly in a way that triggers people hilariously
7	1523069306	8	You don't read books do you?
8	1523069349	4	I read facts from iced tea bottle caps. 
7	1523062388	0	No. It’s not. Get smarter. 
1	1523085474	1	Idk? Maybe being starting point of fall of cccp?
0	1523079040	-9	What is Poland?
1	1523107241	1	#FREEAV3KAlthough I’m pretty sure he’s been out lol 
1	1523081247	-9	Part of Russia in East Europe. 
2	1523083238	6	You're one nasty individual for saying that. 
3	1523110793	1	Why am I nasty?
2	1523090845	1	I almost never downvote sub-0 comments, but that is either outrageously stupid, or terribly unfunny.
3	1523117715	1	Sorry but what polish government doing with constitucial court is terrible and the persecution of journalists is only happening in Russia. I have a lot of friends in Poland but this country is part of Russia. RIP democracy 
0	1523109119	-2	That tax seams reasonable.  Given that 15,000 will likely turn into 15,000,000,000 a 500,000 tax is nothing.
0	1523076593	-21	No one cares about Polish.
