1	1523055282	76	Confirmed: OP is a whale looking for cheap BTC
2	1523081295	9	Sadly in this unregulated market whales dont have to FUD to make the market crash, they can easly do it by themselves and make tons of cash. --> Avg buy bitcoin / eth / whatever. --> After accumulating for lets say 100 million dollars --> Short whatever you bought --> Dump the 100 million dollars of whatever you bought before your short ends --> cash in on the short and buy more of whatever you bought after you crashed the price to get more than you initially had --> continue until the market gets regulated.
3	1523110991	1	What do you mean by "Avg buy"? Buying progressively as the price goes slowly up?What if the price crashes fast and you cannot sell high enough to get your money back? The short may just compensate your loss.
3	1523111983	1	Why would you short an asset you are holding 
2	1523057718	-14	If you truly believed in crypto you'd hope the price would dip further so that you could buy more cheap.
3	1523064502	23	I want to be a billionaire. I truly believe in the US dollar. Therefore I hope the US dollar crashes and loses 90% of it’s value. 
4	1523064916	-4	If it recovered after you bought low then you would be very well off.  I knew someone who tried something similar with Zimbabwe currency.  It didn't work out for them though obviously.Edit: Okay you downvoting fuckers, please explain to me how that math doesn't work out?  If you truly believe in Bitcoin's sucess or whatever currency long term, the short term price is irrelevant.  In fact, if you still had fiat to throw into the market, you would actually hope that the price would dip lower so that you could buy even more with your fiat.
1	1523110657	1	No, sell before majority of people sell their coins. Just don't be greedy!
0	1523050717	69	The whales want you to sell lower and your telling everyone to sell lower I’m so confused right now lol
1	1523066019	12	I think what he's really saying is that today's low is tomorrow's high. Those who got out halfway through this downtrend could have doubled their holdings on the way down by being patient and buying in lower. Chasing pumps does not serve you unless there's a trend to show for it.Is there a guarantee the price goes lower from here? No there isn't, but the reality is that we're in pretty sizeable bear market. This is where folks need to assess the risk of entry and exit points. We could be up 1K tomorrow and down 2K in a week's time.At this point, people are probably better off holding. 
2	1523067881	11	Exactly. This."At this point, *the vast majority of* people are probably better off holding."
3	1523084358	0	T H H H HIIIIII SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS 
4	1523087280	1	>T H H H HIIIIII SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS Watch out, everyone! This guy talks parseltongue and could be a death-eater!I cast winguardium hodliosa, we're safe and crypto is rise.
5	1523090235	5	It’s winguardium hodliosuuuuh.
2	1523073423	1	Yeah that’s what I’m saying selling now is a loss cause especially if you came in dec or Jan and if you are way positive from being in the game a lot longer we all know how this goes just hodl. I’m sure a lot of us wish we sold most of our bags back in dec-Jan I only chipped off 20-30% the growth made me paranoid but it is what it is let’s face this bear market to the death of us 😩
0	1523049470	17	I buy more as well when it goes down
1	1523114090	1	Only difference is the amount they buy is enough to make them a valued board member if crypto worked like stocks
0	1523049667	31	Thanks.   You forgot to mention this isn't investment advice, so when I miss out on investing more because I took this as investing advice, I know who to blame.  
0	1523050364	26	Congratulations! You actually managed it to advice people with exaclty the opposite your „theory“ suggests, buy high and sell low. Man I knew that not everybody can be Warren Buffet but damn am I glad that people like you sold everything, Still have faith that all dumb money has left crypto after this bear market.
1	1523057516	0	Not really. If people were all sociopaths and truly believed in crypto, they would Fud it as much as possible to try to get others to sell, so that they can buy in at a cheaper price.
2	1523059486	7	Bitcoin is dead.  Sell now.  It will never go up again. *Sets laddered buy orders starting at $4.5k
0	1523065722	9	How do you think that whales can more nimbly trade in and out of coins that your average person? It is *well known* that as funds grow, just the opposite happens. Look at Buffett. He has stated flat out that he could get much better percentage returns if he wasn't managing so much money, but he can't buy or sell without moving the market.If you are doing worse than the market average by trading, it is because you are either stupid or unlucky. You have every advantage over a whale.
1	1523072608	3	Exactly.  I swing trade 1-2 small cap coins at a time. I cant trade the amounts i want without moving the market either.
2	1523072960	3	Well it just supports my statement even more. The more money you are working with, the more inertia is weighing you down as you try to jump in and out of the waves.
1	1523114338	1	Happy that Buffett is considerate. Just saying though, for example George Soros could destroy all of Crypto within months or even weeks if he wanted to, which he probably will try to do seeing his past history.For the uninitiated: George Soros shorted the GBP and made a profit of 1 Billion USD, he also tried to short the stock market around us presidential election, though he got rekt that time. This guy isn't afraid to go against everyone even if it means he might be hated afterwards. With him entering crypto i am predicting much more manipulation in the market coming months and years.
0	1523061172	7	I have not sold any of my coin since the start of crash. I have bought some.
1	1523088159	1	Same.
1	1523066322	1	Same. I sold a little at the top. Thank jeebus. But not enough, durnit. But have bought on the way down. I should buy more tonight. Haven't bought it while it's this low yet. Good prices and I predict bull 
0	1523077783	6	OP is salty he didn’t make money so we telling everybody to get out. OP will continue to be salty when he’s out any everybody else is still in when the bull run comes.
0	1523057307	20	r/iamverysmart
0	1523052552	4	Found the tethered whale!!No I will not feed you cheaper coins!!!
0	1523049609	3	And have you sold everything?
0	1523066134	3	yeah man you have it all figured out
0	1523088710	3	This guy is anti-crypto, basically. Look at its post history.
0	1523069390	10	The whole “whales” argument seems more like a urban legend that people use to have a imaginary thing to blame
1	1523073817	8	It's just human nature to invent an imaginary god or nightmare to help explain the fear of something unknown, and unpredictable. In this case it is the mythological whales which are mysterious and to be blamed for the bad times of the market.
1	1523073635	2	It's not
0	1523052583	2	Actually I sell when it goes up. Then when it goes back down I have the power to buy even more.
0	1523055908	2	Conspiracies... Go away
0	1523061668	2	thanks just bought 100k
1	1523062736	2	i bought 1000k match me
2	1523063501	18	nice just sold 100k
3	1523106666	1	And this is how you earn money
0	1523068759	2	Amazing isn't it
0	1523072182	2	Yep. However yesterday they actually DUMPED to 6.6 and just now they PUMPED to 6.8. Gotta love fucking Margin trading huh
0	1523055389	2	Whale comes up for air.....spews....sucks....goes back down...
0	1523050636	1	Manipulated or not, for now I've been doing well.
0	1523051239	1	I buy every dip, i hope some whales buy every dip😁😜🦄
0	1523067661	1	Ancient Chinese secret huh?
0	1523069329	1	Funny part is, this post is perfectly placed to BE manipulation. xD
0	1523074890	1	I have an app, with 20 tickets on it, of the top 20 coins, and they all go up and down together, you can clearly see the manipulations.  That's why I dont touch ky crypto.
0	1523076119	1	In these conspiracy theories why are the whales always on the same team, and have perfect situational awareness vis-a-vis the market? 
0	1523078966	1	You moron they did that because they want your tokens Soros and co is now long and your ass will be grass soon
0	1523081810	1	It's so simple.. HODL 
0	1523083004	1	Has anyone attempted any large scale wallet analysis to see if the sellers can be linked / correlated with large whale wallets (at least in BTC)?
0	1523084300	1	Wish I was as smart as you :(
0	1523085033	1	>My honest advice to most of you is to get out with whatever you have left. You are being manipulated.Why should I care if i'm not stupid?
0	1523085303	1	you act like this only happens in crypto, and not since the beginning of mankind.snooze
0	1523092037	1	Best advice is to pick a realistic selling point somewhere above your initial buy in and wait.
0	1523092186	1	keep telling yourselfs whales are accumulating, doesn't make it true.
0	1523092213	1	Whales, whales, whales bla bla bla.... its not only the wales for fucks sake. This is so simple minded it hurts. Maybe you should get out with whatever you have left and leave us alone with your professional opinion.
0	1523095504	1	Yes, this man speaks the truth! Sometimes I do feel bad about all those manipulated people that I am making money on, but then I look at my lambo and I feel great again.P. S. Please don't share our tactic publicly. Sincerely yours, Whale, big huge Whale 
0	1523097045	1	This guy😂
0	1523105056	1	10/10 advice.
0	1523105607	1	Or you can just do what I’m doing and holding what you have not trading back and forwards everytime it goes up 10%. Keep an eye on the market don’t panic and wait for things to actually look good not just a quick pump.
0	1523105730	1	I agree with this and have been saying it myself but it's more of a shifting of money they are doing between BTC dominance and alts they are making a killing off of everyone buying back their alts every time they decide to shift the dominance. 
0	1523109981	1	As long as the next low is greater than the last high I don’t think this will cause concern. It’s not like we cycle from $100 -> $1000 -> $100 over and over. 
0	1523110377	1	Shhh
0	1523114004	1	There is a lot of truth to this and i feel like it will continue to happen. No coin is safe from whales since they're all so small market cap wise compared to what these whales/instituinal investors try to short/manipulate otherwise. Until we see multi trillion marketcap on crypto and on single coins there are gonna be a lot of down and up spikes. Also, with George Soros entering the market beware. This dude shorted the GBP (Great Britain Pund/sterling pund) and won 1 billion on his 10 billion short. He also tried to short the stock market around this years U.S presidential election. This guy doesn't even need a depression or a good oppurtunity to destroy the price of coins like BTC, ETH, Ripple and so on. If he had decided to short the market back in january during the peak of the bullrun, well shit, we would've laughed at being down 80% because we would be down 99%
0	1523114942	1	the fundamentals of pump and dump
0	1523115541	1	Who the hell would upvote this moron?
0	1523116095	1	Just wait until the Soros single-handedly manipulates the entire market with his deep pockets for his personal favor.
0	1523117914	1	Glad you're enjoying the show, but honestly how about something a little more constructive. 
0	1523057718	1	It's called trading motherfucker. Just follow the waves, profit. Retire young. It's that fucking easy... 
0	1523074300	1	It's not that simple but I understand what you're trying to do and it won't work.  It's just easier to blame whales than it is to actually learn the most basic elements of TA that might help them understand what it going on a bit more.  I also love how TA is damn near shunned here when it's incredibly helpful to know.  
0	1523072606	0	Lol dummy your honest honest advice is actually "HODL til the whales bring it back up" with the way you worded your title
