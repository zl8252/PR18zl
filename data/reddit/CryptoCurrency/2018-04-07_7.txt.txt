0	1523059337	17	Hopefully this starts picking up after the April
1	1523062479	-1	I read "stars" instead of "starts", and I figured we're so desperate we are resolving to use fortune tellers. Well, actually, the marker is doing some shit so weird it might be the time to...
2	1523078538	0	Right
0	1523048316	68	LETS GET READY TO CRUMBLE!!!!!
1	1523074628	16	It's sad because these people are probably having to pay taxes on money they lost in January. Double dildo üçÜüçÜ, that's rough. üìâüòµüî´
2	1523078384	15	Took 10k profit in December. Decided to diversify into altcoins.  They all proceeded to lose 65-80%.  Feelsbadman.
3	1523079297	6	I specifically didn't take the 5 digit profits in DEC because of taxes. Lost it all the direct way.
4	1523079826	5	I wasn't aware like-kind trades would be taxed I foolishly thought it was only when you convert back to usd :,(
2	1523083785	-1	"Having to pay taxes on money they lost in January..." I'm sorry but correct me if I'm wrong but that is not how investing works. You don't pay taxes on losses you get tax write offs. I know that is true for stocks. So I cant imagine such a stupid law exists. Edit: unless you mean they cashed out profits in 2017 and they have to sell at a loss now to cover the taxes owed. Then i agree double dildo indeed.
3	1523084736	5	You get some btc around September. At the end of Dec you buy alts. Because you traded your initial investment to alts now worth 3-4x more - it's your gain and now you owe a lot in taxes. Today you're probably worth around your initial investment, and you're forced to cache it out and pay out in taxes for your paper gains in Dec.
4	1523086916	5	Man you're fucking killing me here, thats outrageous beyond belief.
5	1523091448	1	My own country just proposed something much worse so that doesn't sound so bad : )
6	1523103289	6	you must be polish
4	1523106061	1	It's still appalling, but it's not like you'd have to actually pay any taxes at that point because the loss you make on selling the alts cancels the taxes.   But it's absolutely stupid as a law,  and it is stifling innovation. 
5	1523109918	2	No it doesn't cancel it. You owe the paper gains as of Dec 31. The loss in 2018 can be used to offset gains in 2018 and if you don't use it all up you can use $3k in offsets every year thereafter.
5	1523109978	1	Wrong fiscal year
6	1523110257	1	Thank you for the correction - yes,  was thinking in terms of UK fiscal year.  Yep - it's fucked up.
3	1523109951	1	> No it doesn't cancel it. You owe the paper gains as of Dec 31. The loss in 2018 can be used to offset gains in 2018 and if you don't use it all up you can use $3k in offsets every year thereafter.
1	1523071198	-11	Fuck u
2	1523072390	4	I estimate Bitcoin $5500 by April 17
3	1523074604	2	Pulled from your arse?
4	1523078392	2	Just like everything else in this sub
3	1523073636	1	Wrong
4	1523073685	1	5501
0	1523048270	107	America strangling innovation.  Home of the free indeed.
1	1523110113	3	$25B could build a pretty big wall. 
1	1523064928	10	Price has nothing to do with innovation or development of the tech.  Why would developers of a cryptocurrency care what the current price is?  Its main goal is supposed to be solving a problem with the way money works.
2	1523068642	21	I think you just got auto banned from the XVG and TRX subs for typing that
2	1523093726	0	Not entirely true when the only thing funding the developers is cryptocurrency. Workers are also more incentivized because most of them get bonuses or a small stake of the company in the native token. Furthermore, company reserves are also often held in cryptocurrencies to be liquidates as the company needs them. Obviously there are different monetary policies in terms of how blockchain/crypto companies manage funds, but a lot of them are associated with not liquidating everything during ICO to have fiat funds available. Therefore, if the price tanks, company potentially loses a lot of funds when they are forced to liquidate for company management during those times. Now obviously there is no 100% reliance on price, but to say it has NOTHING to do with it is a clear overstatement. 
2	1523111534	0	> Why would developers of a cryptocurrency care what the current price is?Many cryptos keep a large sum for themselves for various reasons. Laugh all you want at TRX and XVG but even ones like XRP have a massive stash. Plus lets not forget Lee dumping all his LTC at ATH- clearly he cared about the price.
3	1523115426	1	Are you suggesting he knew the future? 
2	1523064972	-2	because it makes it harder to make free money from coin sales ;)
1	1523087150	3	regulation is required otherwise it'll become a pump and dump.
1	1523061801	-5	Taxing investors =\= strangling innovation
2	1523063551	37	Strangling investors via taxes and confusion around a speculative investment == strangling innovation
3	1523074820	9	Also, taxing trades doest exist in any other asset class, it's a clear attack on crypto.  Imagine if every stock trade were taxed?
4	1523075478	5	They are, in the exact same way. You‚Äôre only taxed when you sell something at a gain. It‚Äôs punishment for weak hands in a bull market. You can get a tax shield when you sell something at a loss, so I suspect next year taxes will be kind to people, though the government minimizes what you can write off which is bullshit 
5	1523075617	2	No they are not at all, I was a broker for 3 years, you are taxed on gains, NOT trades And you've edited your post.  This is now how crypto is being taxed, look at the law.  They tax you on each and every trade, gain or not.
6	1523075671	1	We talking about Poland or the us here? Crypto trades aren‚Äôt taxed in the us, only gains, which for trades in 2017 would be massive gains. 
7	1523075804	0	The US, I'll get the tax law for you, this was a big deal December 31st.
8	1523075875	3	Okay go for it, since that‚Äôs not the law I look forward to your source. Edit: I suspect we may be arguing the same thing. You say trades are taxed but what I think you mean is altcoins trades which capital gains at the time of selling coin X is a taxable event. That statement is much different than saying trades are taxed, which is like what Poland is doing. An alt to alt trade has no tax effect unless there is a capital gain realized 
9	1523076951	1	Wait, now I'm confused, I'm referring to crypto to crypto trades in the US, where we are taxed on each and every trade.  Is this like a vernacular thing I'm missing?
3	1523087194	0	nope. 
2	1523072521	4	Trying to shoehorn it into existing tax systems certainly does.  According to the current system, buying and selling a single crypto could create 6 "taxable events".  How can that possibly make any sense to anyone?
2	1523063193	12	Sure it does. Robbing people of their money to give to the government is a huge strain on innovation. 
3	1523087220	2	found the libertarian 
4	1523099767	1	I prefer voluntaryist. Libertarian has some baggage and there are many statists that call themselves libertarians. 
3	1523068565	0	In my eyes taxing crypto only serves to legitimize it in the long run- more exposure and regulation makes it safer and more accessible to the early majority adopters (7%-40%). ‚ÄúDeath and taxes are unavoidable‚Äù, taxes are a fact of life, and if crypto is being taxed, crypto is becoming a fact of life as well
3	1523065069	-9	great, more libertarian shitposting
4	1523065101	1	How is that libertarian? Just a fact. 
5	1523065221	-13	"robbing people of their money", which is more or less "taxation is theft", i.e. generic libertarian junk. if that's not what you were going for, you picked a bad way to word it, but I wouldn't call you an idiot in that case
6	1523065393	-4	How is taxation not theft? That‚Äôs exactly what I was going for. 
7	1523065940	4	Holy shit I cannot believe people like you exist. Governments cannot exist without tax. Do you really and truly believe the government is completely unnecessary? You can‚Äôt truly believe that can you? You can argue all day about how much tax is appropriate and that‚Äôs okay, but to say that all tax is ‚Äútheft‚Äù and therefor unnecessary is literally retarded. Hopefully you‚Äôre just exaggerating and not actually that stupid. 
8	1523066280	-3	Governments could exist without taxes (depending on how you define government), but they‚Äôd be voluntary and not exist through the use of force. Governance does not require theft. Theft is immoral and thus taxation is immoral. 
9	1523067505	6	Go to a country that doesn't collect taxes and you'll come running back to the US at full speed with gratitude (as much as taxes do suck, it's a fuckin reality.) and if you hate them enough and are willing, states like TX and FL do exist to bring your % down..
9	1523066635	3	There are certain things/programs which make society better (read; increase the greater good) which do not benefit the individual that runs them or turn a profit. These include many things, but perhaps the best example is the police force. In your crazy, government free world, who pays for the police? Do people optionally pay a fee to be protected by a 3rd party? What if this third party Militia goes rogue? Who stops them? What if you can‚Äôt afford protection? Is it now okay for people to rob you because you have no police to defend you? No law system to punish those who wronged you? Your ideas just do not make sense. Don‚Äôt spout this non sense online. 
9	1523067316	2	Taxes are important because it allows for the nation to have money in all places strategically used for specific purposes. Without taxes who‚Äôs gonna pay for public schooling? Everyone pay for private schools and drop the 12k a year? Why would governance be voluntary? Who has the time to VOLUNTEER their time to study law and make decisions on OUR behalf? Isn‚Äôt that in itself a full time job? You don‚Äôt understand what kind of shit hole of a country we would be if we didn‚Äôt have taxes. I‚Äôll admit some taxes are absolutely atrocious and need to be reworked. But for the love of god please please please reconsider your stance on taxes. Otherwise you look like an asshat. 
9	1523072562	0	The best part of posts like this is the IRS agent reading this will love nothing more than to hunt you down
8	1523067736	-1	Fucking objectivist idiots who will one day use social benefits. Hypocrites, intellectual gnats and retardsincapable of understanding the cost of being part of our social fabric. 
9	1523071949	0	The cost of society is being robbed? Doesn‚Äôt seem very civilized to me. 
2	1523072418	1	Uhhhhh, just pay your taxes
3	1523076749	2	Of course I pay my taxes. I don‚Äôt want to get murdered. 
0	1523061259	28	YEAH SELL THAT SHIT!!!!!!!!  I LIKE PEOPLE WHO PAY TAX!!!!!!! HURRIE UP! SELLLLLLLLLLL!!!.   WHERE YOU DID WAITING FOR!!!!! NOW I KNOW WHAT A HODLER IS.  A HODL IS SOMEONE  WHO HODLING BTC 4 MONTHS AND SELL ON THE BOTTEM TO PAY HODLTAX
1	1523065425	5	I laughed way harder than I should have at this haha
0	1523097274	8	It's so weird that people accept to be robbed on money on which they already paid (income) taxes in the first place. Tax on tax on tax.
0	1523047067	14	The Winkydink Twins must owe a ton.
1	1523047189	20	not really, they've been holding since like 2012. Sell a little, pay a little tax. Most unrealized gains.
2	1523059030	4	Didn't they just buy a $30M house though and had to liquidate a specific $ to start the exchange and increase growth? 
3	1523067620	15	Yeah but they were born Into a very wealthy family, and of course have the Facebook winnings.  I'm not sure they have had less than 100mm for close to 15yrs...
2	1523082380	2	Especially since it's all long term capital gains

0	1523074753	13	I've been telling everyone this since December, the crypto market has been crashing because of the new tax law that taxes trades.  That scared all the none nerds out of crypto.
1	1523088338	9	Taxes on trades isn't new. Taxed identially to stocks. This is the tax on inexperience. People who weren't affluent prior to crypto making rookie mistakes. This is why experienced investors preech buy and hold or beginners.
2	1523108398	3	That's the problem.  They need new tax laws as crypto is NOT like stocks.  The fact that buying and selling a single crypto can create 4-6 "taxable events" is ridiculous.  This is NOT identical to stocks as the only way to screw yourself in stocks is to sell for USD and make a decision to reinvest money that you owe on taxes.  You can screw yourself in taxes with crypto by holding and not immediately creating 2-3 new taxable events to get back to USD.  Tax law that encourages you to completely cash out every December 31st is a flawed system.This is a tax on an outdated system trying to shoehorn crypto into it because the people making the laws don't understand it.
3	1523114357	2	That's not remotely true.The only difference is that exchanges are too lazy to provide 1099s and too lazy to provide fiat pairings for all currencies.You can trade stock for stock and not move to USD and it would be the exact same taxable events. However that's not in the wheelhouse of the average investor so they won't run into trouble.FYI, I haven't had 1 taxable event in crypto. (Fiat to Crypto only.) HODLing isn't a taxable event (in the USA).
4	1523115582	1	Nope, 100% true.> However that's not in the wheelhouse of the average investorThat's exactly the point.  Tax laws should be based around the common use of the asset being taxed.  Simply having BTC or ETH and deciding at any moment you liked to buy a dip in another coin(taxable event), you are pretty much obligated to immediately calculate the USD value increase of your BTC/ETH as well as figure out FIFO/FILO, sell that percentage of the coin you just bought to BTC/ETH(taxable event), and then sell that for USD(taxable event).When things like GVT get going it's going to be USD to BTC(taxable event)>BTC to GVT(taxable event), GVT to manager token(taxable event), manager token to GVT(taxable event), GVT to BTC(taxable event), BTC to USD(taxable event).The current tax system DOES NOT FIT.  Not to mention most other countries don't tax until a certain level of gains are made, only tax crypto to fiat, and a few don't tax crypto at all.  What is the purpose of putting our citizens at a disadvantage to the rest of the world?
5	1523115766	1	Not everyone should be in crypto. Period. Before crypto, angel investors needed millions and millions of dollars, now they need $5. Crypto lowered the barrier of entry but didn't lower the skill cap to do it."Ignorance of the law is no excuse, and I am quoting a New York City judge on that!" - Ron White
0	1523048079	12	Been saying this for a while
1	1523071119	-28	Stfu i hate people like u. You help create the FUD. GTFO
2	1523081082	10	*the anger phase*
2	1523083917	4	Glad to see you aren't emotionally attached to your investments. 
0	1523046370	18	If thats true, more cheap crypto for meee! üò¨
1	1523051519	42	People have been saying that since 16k btc.
2	1523053344	23	Yeah Every time some alt dips "OMG sale!" 600% down later "can't wait to buy it cheap!" 
3	1523060429	19	Yet 95% of people somehow claim to have bought in at $.00001 and aren't fazed at all by this crash.
4	1523062401	6	I bought some coins not far from ATH and I being punched pretty badly in those investments right now.
5	1523062766	3	Yeah, I bought a few small bags right after the first dip and thought I was getting a deal. Whoops!
4	1523104914	1	Same kind of people who bought Bitcoin when it was still Antshare (!)
2	1523057197	3	Well one day they will be right.
1	1523046630	1	Christmas came early! 
0	1523076367	5	When people get rich quick off of magical internet money the piper has got to be paid. Hopefully with this new found tax revenue the government will be more supportive than ever
0	1523116706	2	That is certainly something that never occurred but honestly seems likely. We see stories all of the time of people saying they are screwed because of day trading and taxes. If your investment profited you 9,000 from a 1,000 dollar investment and you traded for a different coin, you now owe somewhere between 15% and whatever your income tax rate is. 15% of 9,000 is 1350. More than your original investment by 350. If you lost all of your gains after 2017 and now only have 1000 or less, you net lost 350 at least. A lot of people wanted to make some quick money, I doubt a lot of people are willing to pay the IRS out of pocket just to keep their current investment that keeps falling. It‚Äôll be interesting if this stops around mid April. I honestly don‚Äôt think we have a catalyst for a bull run yet, but maybe very slow gains over the next few months. 
0	1523062951	3	???but when you sell, then you need to pay taxes..o_0?
1	1523069724	4	Not until next year. 
1	1523063537	-1	Only sell enough that keeps you within or under your current tax bracket.    For example, i can sell ¬£11,000 and pay zero taxes in the UK (Might be slightly lower) but if i have earnt wages or benefits etc... i have to lower my sales or face paying tax on it.    I think on my current earnings i can cash out a max of ¬£4,000 a year tax free. Anything more will see me owing a fuck ton of cash since ALL my yearly earnings will now be taxed at a higher rate.
2	1523065545	8	It actually puts your entire income into the higher tax bracket? In the US the tax brackets are progressive, so anything in the higher tax bracket is taxed at the higher rate, but the portion of you income below that level is taxed at the lower rate.So, for example, if I made $1,000 and the tax brackets are 0-800= %10, and 801-1000 = %20 I would pay 0.1x800 + 0.2x200 = 120, not 0.2x1000 = 200.
3	1523077801	1	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_Kingdom
4	1523077974	5	Way way TL;DR dude.Edit: Got bored, looks like UK is also using progressive brackets so you'll never lose money by making more money.
4	1523077813	1	**Taxation in the United Kingdom**Taxation in the United Kingdom may involve payments to a minimum of three different levels of government: the central government (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs), devolved governments and local government. Central government revenues come primarily from income tax, National Insurance contributions, value added tax, corporation tax and fuel duty. Local government revenues come primarily from grants from central government funds, business rates in England and Wales, Council Tax and increasingly from fees and charges such as those from on-street parking. In the fiscal year 2014‚Äì15, total government revenue was forecast to be ¬£648 billion, or 37.7 per cent of GDP, with net taxes and National Insurance contributions standing at ¬£606 billion.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
3	1523105830	1	Crypto gains in the UK are treated as capital gains not income.
2	1523105557	3	Are you talking about the tax free allowance on income? There is a separate capital gains allowance in the UK: 11300 gbp per year per person. Gains from crypto are not taxed as income but as capital gains. What's more,  if your gains stay within this allowance,  you dont have to report it to HMRC.
3	1523110013	1	Thank you for clearing that up. I was unaware of the capital gains tax. I assumed it was bundled together with income tax.    Thank you.
0	1523072379	4	Can't wait to scoop up as much as I can at a discount. 
0	1523081080	2	When asked about Lee‚Äôs previous prediction of Bitcoin‚Äôs price, the analyst maintains his full-fledged positivity:‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still positive. The important trends to focus on crypto are that there‚Äôs a lot of underlying progress, adoption is still growing,‚Äù adding that ‚ÄúUltimately, we expect bitcoin to find footing after April [17], tax day.‚Äù
0	1523071739	1	Even if you assumed taxes went to things that were extremely beneficial, that doesn‚Äôt make them right. Theft is always immoral. 
1	1523078826	4	Pay your taxes, or you're a thief.
2	1523084052	1	You know that taxes are just a legal way for governments to steal your money, right?
3	1523087808	-2	No, it's not your money, and never was.  It's society's cut of the economic activity you have created together.
4	1523105705	5	Except we had the largest wealthiest economic boom in American history before they instituted wage taxes.  Taxes are out of control and disproportionately affect the poor. 
5	1523112398	0	Yeah, it's easy to make money when you've got half a continent to loot after having cleansed it of its original owners.  Not that much of it went to the people at the bottom, since inequality levels were massive.  That's why they call it the time of the Robber Barons.But then how do you explain the massive growth following Roosevelt's New Deal, with top income tax brackets reaching over 90%?
0	1523063169	0	What's up with the influx of shitty articles on these wack blogs? 
1	1523072266	1	I'll preface this comment by saying no one knows, including me. And I had not thought of this angle reading this article, but it is the plausible explanation for the downward move I can think of, so maybe there is something to it.  And I have lived thru at least 5 major boom/bust cycles.
2	1523091803	1	Possibly. Nobody really knows, honestly. I do know that everyone was saying this when the 'crash' started though (mid-Jan to Feb), that people were 'cashing out for taxes'. Then it turned into Chinese New Year, Futures ending, Valentines Day, April Fools Day, etc etc :P
1	1523074381	1	Isn't that all of Steem?
2	1523091601	1	Steemit? Not as bad as these no-name blogs with a  domain that keep getting spammed and making the front page. 
0	1523077684	-1	The claim doesn't make sense. The capital gain is taxable after selling. How would this analyst know how much people sold and whether they were up on the position to begin with?
1	1523088508	2	Volume and address count.
2	1523113900	1	That isn‚Äôt enough information to determine this.
1	1523116798	1	It‚Äôs not illogical to say it could be a big contribution. You day trade in 2017, then you continue to say trade in 2018. You lose quite a bit but because it‚Äôs 2018 you can‚Äôt report the losses on 2017 taxes meaning you now owe a lot on the capital gains that you technically made.
