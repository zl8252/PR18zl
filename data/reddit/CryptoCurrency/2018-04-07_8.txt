How is it OK to put up fake ads for myetherwallet to trick newbies?   The social media ad blocking is a direct result of bad actors in crypto.  Would you rather everyone did nothing about the scammers stealing?
1	1523100175	43	This! I am happy crypto adds are blocked. I was going nuts on them "this bitcoin thing ..." adds. Or any of those scammy ico adds. Jeesh, still have flashbacks thinking about them. Good riddance i say.
2	1523111713	2	Good thing I sold all my assets to buy ETH and bought full bags of Bunnytoken before anyone else. MOON LAMBO HODL BUNNYTOKEN,,,,100K,,,,EOY
3	1523113063	1	🤣🤣 hehe. Yea i sold everything i owned to by Tai courses. No bags here. 
1	1523099958	10	Agreed. Crypto ads are either that or ICO scams for dumb money.
1	1523113240	2	Honestly, whats the difference between fake crypto ads and fake ads for for example banks or other phishing platforms? Theres gotta be a mechanism behind that at google and others to reduce phishing. They just need to apply this as well for crypto. Ultimately, advertising would be great for crypto. 
2	1523114346	5	It's MUCH easier it is to get away with 10000 stolen Ethers than 10000 stolen Euroes. There's one difference for you.
3	1523114511	1	Yeah and yet you pay for the ad with creditcard
3	1523116084	1	doesn't really matter you can do phising for all sorts of things.
1	1523108744	0	I’d rather that a company that takes money from people to advertise on its network have some verification that it’s not selling ad space to obvious scammers. But as per usual these fuckers don’t want to do that as it’ll cost them money. 
2	1523109129	1	See, the thing about scammers is you can't verify or prove they are scammers until they actually scam.  How would one know Bitconnect was a scam?  If you had common sense, that would tell you it was a scam, but you couldn't prove it until they actually scammed.
3	1523112468	-2	Right. So then remove the ones that have been proven to scam.  This is like twitter saying they’re going to ban all plumbers from advertising because there’s been reports of a few plumbers doing substandard work and leaving pipes leaking in homes. 
4	1523112711	3	That is a terrible analogy.  Plumbers are licensed and insured, and if they are not then they SHOULD be banned from advertising.  Especially if 99% of plumbers advertising seem to just take money and run.  Use some fucking common sense.Glad you mentioned twitter.  So should twitter have allowed those "send .5 ETH and get 5 ETH back!" tweets to go on until they prove each individual one is a scammer?
5	1523113558	1	actually yes. Censorship is a double edged sword. And the analogy is spot on. Crypto firms should also be licenced and insured and what fuck not. But they aint - surprise. I bet that in almost any country you can also do plumbing and other shit without licence, just don't get caught. As you can do crypto and other stuff. Its google/facebook/twitters responsibility to hold people accountable for what they are advertising on. A fucking email address and a CC number is not enough. They are just greedy that way. 
5	1523113733	1	Woah Betty. Easy on the swearing. I didn’t realise this was such a touchy subject for you. I think it was plainly obvious that any tweet asking to be sent 0.5 ETH that would return 5 back was a scam without needing to see evidence of wrong doing. All I’m saying is that the companies have taken the easy way out again rather than do their jobs and actively manage their advertising network.  
6	1523114091	2	>Woah Betty. Easy on the swearing. I didn’t realise this was such a touchy subject for you.Because there's too much dumb shit like this here.  You expect facebook to wade through 5000 scam ads to see if 1 is legit?  Or would you do the same thing and say, "lets just ban them all for now."  The only thing I agree with, is if the industry matures it will be hard to get that ban lifted.>I think it was plainly obvious that any tweet asking to be sent 0.5 ETH that would return 5 back was a scam without needing to see evidence of wrong doing.Going by your own suggestions, they should allow it until they prove its a scam.  How do you know you won't get 5 ETH back, besides common sense?>All I’m saying is that the companies have taken the easy way out again rather than do their jobs and actively manage their advertising network.Again, besides "common sense", how do you vet a legit crypto company from a scam one?  The only thing that makes sense to me is if they're selling an actual product/service, rather then just selling their coin.  I haven't seen anybody doing that yet.  Nor do I think they'd be banned from advertising that product/service.  They're not banned from being a crypto backed company advertising a service, they're banned from being a crypto backed company that only advertises that crypto.Nobody has come to market with anything sellable besides a coin.
1	1523100995	-15	1. not all ICO/crypto is scam2. we don't need any company saying what's good for us3. They permanently misuse user data for their own benefit and not protecting it properly 
2	1523101424	8	Not all, but many are scams.  Google is a company and as such can do what they want with their own pages.  Do you not realize that after they are put on notice about straight scams, they may be liable if they allow it to continue?  As in... I will make a MEW clone, buy the top space on Google, so when people search, they may come to my fake MEW and give me the keys.  Don't like it? Don't Google shit.  It is Google's website and they can do as they wish.  Same as we can all do what we wish with our sites.
3	1523101823	-13	they can do only what's allowed by legislation. It does not mean that once you give them the data they can do whatever they think of. It's not only about blocking ads, it's also banks blocking wire transfers etc. Those companies have power because we give them our data but at the end of the day they very often misuse it, share with unknown parties.And finally there seems to be at least some "weapon" to show them that not everyone likes what they do
4	1523102226	5	No one is forcing anyone to use any site. Data mining is the trade off for "free" web services.  Do you honestly believe that FB spends millions on development for the greater good?  Everything that is "free" on the web, actually, has a price.  What legislation? It's a web business with business being the word to remember.  Don't like Goog;e, FB, cool, don't use it! Pay the cash to develop out your own search engines, setup an email server, create whatever you want and monetize the work anyway you see fit.  Read the TOS to any free service.  You can always use paid services instead and not worry about data miners.
5	1523110470	2	Read about gdpr before touting the old line of its a business. We all know that, no reason we should let shady shit happen, Google and facebook still have to obey the law. And yes, privacy laws matter and are part of what is keeping fragile democracy alive.
5	1523114470	1	>If you're not paying for it, YOU are the product.
0	1523101170	36	99% of those ads were for scams, I'm glad that they banned them.Allowing those ads probably did more bad than good because of how it made people think of crypto, and with all of the newbies getting scammed instead of putting their money into legitimate projects, also harming the reputation of crypto.
1	1523103081	3	They were getting way out of hand.  Reminded me of when they cracked down on the diet, pharma and work from home garbage. Scammers should never be allowed to buy ad space.  Google and FB do this a lot across segments which become riddled with scams.  It is not because it is crypto.  It has been the policy for years.   OP seems to think it is targeting crypto only.  Trust me, it is not. 
2	1523109508	3	>OP seems to think it is targeting crypto only. OP sounds immature and inexperienced, which is common here.
1	1523107512	1	There really should be a process for a project to prove it is legit though.  Does this only include token sales?  As in if something like if the GVT trading platform is successful, will they be allowed to advertise the platform on google?
2	1523109431	1	How?  How would you prove Bitconnect was a scam to the idiots who wouldn't listen?  How would you prove Bitconnect was legit?  You cannot prove a scam until they already scammed people.  You are left to common sense and chance.  At a time when 99% of ads were scams, they made the right call.  
3	1523110192	2	I have no idea but if it's permanent for anything related to crypto, that's a pretty unfair advantage to give to existing companies.  GVT is a good example.  If current stock brokerages start letting people trade crypto and they can advertise but GVT can't because they are crypto based, you just decided which one has a better chance to succeed.  The same thing will apply to any crypto that actually delivers but isn't allowed to advertise but competitors in the same area not using crypto to do the same thing but less effectively can.
4	1523110717	1	Coming from an industry (vapor) that was banned from google, paypal, facebook, amazon, etc early on..   Its a good thing.  Legit companies and skilled people can find a way.  When its a free for all they are on equal ground with idiots and scammers, and they win.  Most scammers give up if its too hard.  They're after EASY money, not hard money.
5	1523112449	1	If you have a legit company and your competitors can advertise on all of the biggest advertising platforms on the planet but you can't, you have zero chance out of the gate.  That is NOT a good thing.  Please explain how you "find a way" against that.
6	1523113064	1	>If you have a legit company and your competitors can advertise on all of the biggest advertising platforms on the planet but you can'tThey're banned too...You mean a legit company with an actual offering and purpose, besides selling their shitcoin/scamcoin?  They can advertise that service.  They just can't advertise their shitcoin.>Please explain how you "find a way" against that.Did you completely miss the first line of my comment?  I have a $10,000,000 company that is banned from google, facebook, paypal, amazon.  Guess I have zero chance?
7	1523114297	1	This isn't clarified anywhere.  I keep using GVT as an example because they are one of the few I know of close to a finished product.  Their competitors would be something like if Merrill Lynch decided to do the exact same thing.  So when GVT is up and running, would someone like Merrill Lynch be allowed to advertise but GVT not even though they are doing the same thing but just because GVT is using crypto as the entry point, they are not allowed?> I have a $10,000,000 company that is banned from google, facebook, paypal, amazon. Guess I have zero chance?Idk.  Are you doing something that could easily be duplicated by an established company that $10,000,000 is the cost of their phone bill?  If so, then no, you'd have no chance if they decide to take your business.
2	1523110803	1	When almost all ads for a specific category are scams, it's not really worth their time. Also that process would get abused anyway.
1	1523103192	0	Exactly this!
0	1523105119	7	I don't think that Crypto needs the advertisement. And neither have I seen any legit crypto ad on there. Nothing of value was lost.
0	1523105440	5	ICO´s who has to adwertize are scamms anyways
0	1523106321	3	I haven't seen a single ad for a legit crypto. It's good the way it is. We want people entering the market the correct way instead of through ponzi schemes which will leave a sour taste in their mouths and potentially spawns crypto haters. The ad ban is fine
0	1523103931	5	All of the crypto ads are scams.
0	1523106474	2	I still see bunnycoins ads on my machines without adblockers, a 100% pure scamcoin, so I'm glad they gonna block "crypto-ads"
0	1523107185	2	The only crypto ads I've seen are all like "Discover how people are getting rich with Bitcoin !!!". I'm glad they are blocking it.
0	1523108354	2	I'm not mad, crypto ads on FB, Twitter and Google only attract dumb money.
1	1523108452	0	It’s a lame excuse to apply a blanket ban. 
2	1523117456	1	I beg you. What reason would any of those companies have to apply a blanket ban? There's thousands of crypto traders inside these companies as well. I don't know why, but humans always think they're being targeted by everyone without taking even a second to think rationally.
0	1523108953	2	The vast majority of those ads were scams to begin with. While the blanket bans are heavy handed hopefully these companies will tweak their rules. 
0	1523112796	2	99.9% of ads were scam coins, these companies are doing crypto a favour. It will also teach those entering the space how to research. If someone gets burnt buying these shit coins through these ads, they will tell everyone they know crypto is a scam.In the bigger picture, the more joe bloggs cash that comes in slowly but surely the less the banks can manipulate the price as they are doing. These companies should be praised for banning these ads, it's bad enough they can buy ad space on some sites and get articles posted (ain't cheap though so most won't choose this option anyway).Hopefully we'll see less ICOs or regs to tighten them up, way too many ICOs, most of which will never last and are just cash grabs.
0	1523095527	4	Here’s a question: What will the EU do about blockchain? Clearly no blockchain is compliant with The GDPR. Are they going to ban all cryptos since they can’t exactly just sue someone for not being compliant?!
1	1523096190	0	Privacy coins that make it hard to identify transactions of particular user on a blockchain explorer may be OK. Otherwise a ledger of all your activity with each payment processor is there for all to see for all time which is not compliant with GDPR unless you have explicitly consented to this.
2	1523096658	1	Exactly. How’s the EU going to enforce their new directive?
1	1523099425	0	That's not quite my interpretation in this case. GDPR applies to companies you'd do business with, so if one of those companies stores your private data on chain and doesn't include a mechanism to remove it or erase it, then said company could be liable for very heavy fines. Again, it's not the protocol that's a concern here and laws related to business practices have little room for application in this context.
1	1523101217	0	Well GDPR actually defines pseudonimity and actively encourages it, as all Bitcoin type protocols are pseudonymous they actually align with GDPR quite well.All a business using crypto has to do is to be able to dis-associate your crypto address from the rest of the data in their own system, and they will have complied.  Any service that designs in one time use addresses will automatically comply with GDPR.At least that's how I'm interpreting GDPR after reading it myself, I'm not a lawyer.
1	1523097239	-2	> no blockchain is compliant with The GDPHow so?
2	1523099142	2	blockchain is distributed database that can be read by anyone using a blockchain explorer - this is not a problem if user explicitly consents to have their transactions recorded there - but if user has not consented then in theory user could demand through EU court that his data be removed from the blockchain, which of course is impossible and then the e-commerce processor might become liable to a fine. Will be interesting to see how this plays out.
3	1523101461	-1	You don't need to delete data from the blockchain (assuming you don't place personally identifiable data in it), you just need to forget the public key/address for an individual in your own non-blockchain systems.  The transactions then become non personally identifiable.
2	1523098954	0	He is so wrong, blockchain is entirely voluntary. GDPR is not relevant.
0	1523108656	2	Most of you are missing the point. There are scams in every industry. Doesn’t mean they have to blanket ban everything. Ads are vital in a growing industry, especially to facilitate mass adoption.    
1	1523117190	1	There are far more crypto scam advertisements than anything else, though. I have yet to see a crypto ad that's not a scam; I can show you a million non-crypto ads that aren't scam if you want.
2	1523120183	1	They still promote awareness of the entire space.
1	1523109535	0	Tbf, you can still get through. I remember when they were banning any and all ad with copy that included blockchain, crypto, cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, etc. But they don't do that anymore - I see promoted posts for cryptocurrency conventions and events by TechCrunch and stuff. Honestly it's fine for now. It was bullshit before.

0	1523109398	1	I'm so glad the ads are gone. It's made all of the user experiences so much better. If you need an ad to enter crypto, it's probably not for you. The only exceptionsI can think of are:* Education courses (I work at an education company that has a blockchain and cryptocurrencies course, this has been a bummer)* Wallets* Exchanges And the last two seem to be doing just fine without the ads. I do hate all the centralisation and bla bla bla but advertising high-risk financial products is not how we are going to get the respect and trust we need for more adoption. I have so many dumb acquiantances who got burned off scams like Tron from social media ads... We are better off this way. 
0	1523110641	1	!remindMe 2 months
0	1523111391	1	May I request exchanges to remove my personal data? 
0	1523111543	1	You should definitely consider cancelling you accounts for these services. But not for this reason. 
0	1523112092	1	1.) They aren’t fighting crypto, they are protecting themselves from being complacent with scams and exploitation.2.) Asking them to comply with a law they have had years to prepare and be ready for will not hurt them in any significant way. 
0	1523113682	1	You won't do shit. These companies own you and run the services you use on a daily basis, otherwise they wouldn't have your information. That is unless you suck about giving that out too. Another brigading post from somebody wanting moon lambos.Also, I'm sure the 20 people that request their information is really going to put a damper on their 100m+ revenue model. 
0	1523113686	1	If fighting against them includes continuing to use and produce value for their services, I bet your other efforts won't amount to much. 
0	1523114269	1	Lol? Do you even know what GDPR is for? If you say you don't comply then the company will just delete you out of the system and you will be gone, do you think that they care about you? If you're not a big contributor to them then they'll gladly throw you out of their system.
1	1523114539	0	I know and you? Not only they have to delete everything they have but also take care that all third parties where they shared the information do the same. Of course. One person is nothing but hundreds thousands is a different story. And you know how these companies make money right?
2	1523116262	1	I work at a bank where we have to personally ask every customer for their agreement about GDPR... and if they say they don't comply, we just add in the system that they don't agree, which means they won't be getting custom info based on their data... Nothing else, you clearly don't understand the new law at all.
0	1523115013	1	I think you have a hate for the companies having your data rather than blocking crypto. They did the right thing, at least for now. Too many people getting scammed from the ads shown on their websites, any company would do the same...
0	1523119009	1	They can try and suppress crypto. You tell people they cant have something and what happens? People want that thing, they wonder what it is, it becomes more desirable. Crytpo can be slowed but it wont be stopped. No way can any one or anything stop this global life changing tech. 
0	1523094065	1	I think you will find this is “yesterday news” to most people and their onto the next big problem with the world. 
0	1523096251	1	UK leaving EU system soon ™
0	1523098121	0	Yes we must fight together. Everyone who read this should take action. Don’t wait for others fight for you cos it won’t work individuallly
1	1523099646	0	But first you need to make decentralized blockchain with "proof of fight" algorithm to verify individuals actions.
