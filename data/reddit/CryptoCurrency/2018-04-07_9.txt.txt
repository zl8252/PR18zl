1	1523091780	1	You are receiving this error message because your command is not formatted correctly. Here are the potential mistakes you made:       * You didn't capitalize the flair name.       * You used a plural flair name instead of a singular flair name. For example, if you want to tag a submission with *Tool* flair, use *Tool* instead of *Tools*. See here: `[AutoMod: Tool]`.  Flair names like *Support*, *Politics*, *Trading*, etc. do not require this kind of treatment.       * You used two words instead of one for certain flairs. These flairs are *Focused Discussion*, *General News*,  *New Coins*. To assign these flairs, use `Discussion`, `News`, or `New` respectively. Since this AutoMod rule copies flair text to the flair css class and CSS classes can't be two words, we can only use one flair word in commands for two-word flairs.  If your flair commands are formatted correctly but fail to work, please [inform the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FCryptoCurrency).*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

0	1523086000	2	But how was the steak?
1	1523087058	3	it was great, can never complain.
0	1523108570	2	How complicated and how lomg does the transaction typically take? What are the additional costs compared to standard payment?
0	1523115497	3	Now wait 3 hours while your payment is being confirmed :)
0	1523095557	2	Boos means mad in dutch, weird name 
1	1523097022	2	It actually means angry. Gek is the Dutch word for mad.
2	1523097126	1	No but mad like "I'm mad at you", not like "this guy is mad" aka he's crazy

0	1523101795	1	Whenever I’m back home in LA from college, I typically stop by to pick up a steak as it’s a block away. Saw that they accepted bitcoin and it became my way to pay.Tried showing the K-Town location Nano once before as well.
