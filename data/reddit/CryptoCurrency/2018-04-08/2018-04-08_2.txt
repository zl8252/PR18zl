0	1523173362	186	@bitcoin was owned by Bitcoin Cash team right? 
1	1523176316	187	The hilarity of it all is that account was almost strictly only posting anti-bitcoin propaganda. Its what I don't understand about many BCH proponents, instead trying to stand on its own merrits and speaking on why they believe its a good coin, the account set out to only bash Bitcoin. It screamed snake oil.E: word(2)
2	1523201774	10	Kind of like how r/btc is about r/bitcoin. Like can’t y’all just go about your own forkyn bizniz
2	1523176900	11	It's literally what they accuse the "core" people of doing though...My biggest question is why they're staying with PoW?
3	1523183292	31	Arent some bch people in bed with bitmain?
4	1523189005	15	Yes because segwit reduced antminer hashrate compared to competition due to antminer patented mining optimizations which were lost in segwit
4	1523185596	3	Myself and the BCH Queen swing with bitman and bitwomen every week or so.
3	1523210780	1	The BCH crowd only says that CORE is the fork because they view the whitepaper as a flawless bible, and Satoshi as a literal prophet. Satoshi was against other coins so they have to refer to BTC as the fork to keep the narrative.
3	1523193576	-5	Yeah let's change the PoW everytime someone gains an advantage. Other companies will try to catch up. Theres too much money on the line. Monero just split into what like 5 different coins? Just do they can keep their bot nets profitable
4	1523193844	7	No. They forked and bitmain kept the asic chain active ("classic")
5	1523201687	1	Yeah so then regular monero can still run effective botnet mining operations 
2	1523194267	1	This 
2	1523185375	-29	>anti-bitcoin propaganda.Facts ≠ PropagandaYou're telling me that someone mentioning harsh facts such as /r/Bitcoin being censored, Bitcoin Core developers crippling Bitcoin and not letting it scale, theymos controlling three Bitcoin communities/websites (Bitcoin.org, BitcoinTalk.org and /r/Bitcoin) is propaganda?[The story of /r/Bitcoin, /r/BTC, Bitcoin & Bitcoin Cash](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/z/dl8v4lp)[A collection of evidence](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/83vgdm/a_collection_of_evidence_regarding_bitcoins/)

3	1523186235	8	Segwit ftw. Bcash sucks
3	1523196758	5	Go away you fucking shill
4	1523196939	-2	Username checks out.
3	1523189424	0	Yet again their argument is one of conspiracy and feels. The problem many have with bcash is a technical one
4	1523190166	-14	Conspiracy? Facts that you don't like are considered conspiracy, propaganda or FUD ? Blockstream did invest in Bitcoin Core, the team that develops Bitcoin./r/Bitcoin is a censored echo chamber controlled by TheymosBitcoin Core decides to stop scaling Bitcoin.
5	1523207011	-1	I don't think you guys understand how bitcoin development works.The fact that you could fork it is proof of that. You also need to accept the fact that you have lost.
6	1523207181	1	>I don't think you guys understand how bitcoin development works.I don't think you guys understand how censorship and manipulation works.>The fact that you could fork it is proof of that. You also need to accept the fact that you have lost.You also need to accept the fact that the truth is coming out everyday.
4	1523205747	0	Conspiracy and feels?  r/bitcoin is censored.  The block size was artificially held at 1 megabyte despite calls for an increase, which wouldn’t harm Bitcoin at all, at least for an increase like 8 megabytes.  These are facts that are available to anyone willing to look.  I rarely actually see technical arguments against BCH.  Pretty much the only things I see are that it’s supported by Roger Ver, Craig Wright, etc.  There are also the very compelling arguments of “bcash,” “btrash,” and “bcrash.”  
5	1523206933	1	Thank you, I had never heard any of that before :|.r/bitcoin moderates altcoin discussion because it is a bitcoin sub. Other altcoin subs remove bitcoin discussion for the same reason. This is how topic moderation works, andyou guys have blown it way out of proportion.And there have been countless technical discussions about how on-chain scaling is not sustainable. So, I'm not sure where you are looking, but it's been done to death.
3	1523192783	-10	Lol at your Downvotes for telling the truth. Fuck this subbreddit and this whole fucking site. So manipulated. Who would have thought cryptos downfall would be a social media problem
4	1523193395	3	Many people get triggered and go to a denial phase when they hear facts they do not like.
5	1523194184	3	Lol its probably cause you tagged /r/bitcoin
6	1523199440	4	Or alternatively; r/cryptocurrency doesn't like either BTC or BCH. Not everything is r/Bitcoin or r/btc manipulation you know.
7	1523199548	2	You're right. This sub does lean towards alts.
5	1523195111	-1	I think it’s more that they believed all the jargon a few months ago and sold all their bch after the hard fork instead of just keeping both coins and being happy whichever one wins. Skin in the game big time now methinks
4	1523193178	-1	The moment bcash comes up the quality of comments plummets. These threads have honestly convinced me that the internet in it's present incarnation has been totally compromised as a platform for free speech and debate.
5	1523194134	-1	The moment bitcoin cash comes up the entire thread gets brigaded on hows it's a scam yadda yadda. And all technical arguments against it are nowhere to be seen. I've never seen such coordinated trolling of a topic.You're right. The internet is fucked and centralized discussion platforms are the reason cryptocurrency will never work
6	1523195427	9	The problem is that people can't/don't want to think critically, not the internet and social media platforms themselves. People are influenced by emotion and group sentiment rather than sound logic. It's hard for people to hold beliefs that are nuanced and legitimately uncertain. For many reasons, it's hard to understand Bitcoin in its entirety, but everyone pretends to know the absolute truth.Nevertheless, I've developed a strong distaste for Bitcoin cash because of it's willingness to serve e interest of centralized miners, and the abbhorent behavior of the majority of it's community.
7	1523195847	1	You're right. Emotions rule. Technicals are boring.The mining isn't centrally controlled. If you think it is then so is BTC. This is a lie the Core camp spreads as FUD.The community.may seem crazy or whatever but we're fucking sick of all the lies and deception the other side has been doing. If we don't get more radical or whatever the trolls win
8	1523196347	3	I don't pretend to know the solution to the community divide, but radicalization generally backfires. I think a strong, intelligent community narrative is the goal. We are probably making history here, and people will study the rift between the communities. I hope the rift is short lived and never causes harm. We  just need to always remember what crypto is all about.
9	1523196546	2	Agreed. Strong community first. Cheers.
9	1523201776	2	I'm going to go out on a limb and guess 50% of the comments in this post are paid. There's a pattern to the false comments; it's hard for me to make any judgment on the coins communities when I can't even trust the opinions being espoused for/against them are genuine.What surprises me is that it's not apparent to people that this is occurring on both sides.
3	1523204062	0	Change the record.> Theymos, Cripple, Core, CensorshipAll shilly buzzwords. Seriously if there is such a huge problem for you here **you now have your own coin, your own site and your own sub** Why are you still preaching the same garbage? If BCH is so great and Bitcoin so evil you have your out now so why are you still here crying?I really didn't want to bring this up too but one of your complaints are about Theymos owning r/Bitcoin the Bitcoin.Org and the Bitcointalk, well I don't know if that's a fact but I'm Pretty sure Roger also owns a Bitcoin forum, the r/BTC sub and the Bitcoin.com domain and up untill recently the Bitcoin twitter handle, so stop being a hypocritical shill and go back to your happy place man seriously. 
4	1523204300	1	I'm not crying. I am providing harsh facts that people don't like.Yes, Roger Ver is a moderator in the /r/BTC subreddit with several others. There are open mod logs in the subreddit.The Bitcoin.com is owned by Roger Ver and he isn't doing anything wrong with it.You have no evidence to prove that Roger Ver handles @Bitcoin.https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8apksg/roger_ver_according_to_rbitcoin_and_others/
5	1523204374	1	I'm sure 0-confirmations are safe and the earth is flat too. Dude. Enjoy your crypto. Seriously. 
6	1523205146	1	>sure 0-confirmations are safeIt is safe up-to a certain point.>earth is flat too. You use that excuse, just like the majority to shame those that have opposing views.Have a nice day :)
7	1523205190	2	> Have a nice day :)You too man. 
2	1523183976	-36	You say:“instead trying to stand on its own merrits and speaking on why they believe its a good coin, the account set out to only bash Bitcoin”But that’s the EXACT thing bitcoin core does to bitcoin cash. Just add cash to the end of it and it’s the exact same about bitcoin core:“instead trying to stand on its own merrits and speaking on why they believe its a good coin, they set out to only bash Bitcoin cash”
3	1523184335	26	What? Bitcoin has been standing on its own merits since 2013
4	1523201182	1	Since they forced the bitcoin cash fork im obviously talking about. Now all they do is try to discredit it because they are threatened 
4	1523194990	-2	That's the same Bitcoin that Bitcoin Cash is now. Segwit and a reliance on a second layer is not Bitcoin
5	1523197040	3	I love how you guys parrot practically the same thing each and every time. Almost like it’s scripted. I applaud the fight for bcash. I really do. But at some point you’re going to have to give up pretending to be the real bitcoin and strike out on your own and leave the current bitcoin to do what it wants.  But you can’t seem to. “We’re the real bitcoin” you scream every time while everyone else just rolls their eyes and gets on with life. 
6	1523197552	2	Anyone can think for themselves what the real bitcoin is. BCH more closely resembles the Bitcoin pre segwit and lightning.Scripted = talking points
3	1523184405	15	The point was that this twitter accounts posts were mostly anti-bitcoin.  If you don't see how that's odd coming from an account with the @Bitcoin name, I don't know what to tell ya.  This is certainly a game played by two, but the Bitcoin Cash side trying to convince people that Bitcoin Cash = Bitcoin isn't doing Bitcoin Cash any good.
4	1523195049	0	It's a version of Bitcoin, called a fork. They both can call themselves Bitcoin. Hell even Bitcoin diamond can call itself Bitcoin if it wants to
5	1523196941	4	That argument is hard to sell. People provide it like it's a common thing in software forks to claim the fork is the original.  Sure they can say that. It's just a bad look and not true. Just because you fork off something doesn't mean you're the original or that you somehow are allowed to use the original name **without consent and/or consensus**.I don't see Ubuntu calling itself the real Debian.  I don't see OPENBSD calling itself the real NETBSD.  I don't see DRIZZLE calling itself the real MYSQL.  I don't see Joomla calling itself the real Mambo.  I don't see Fire OS (or any Android fork) calling itself the real Android.  I don't see WordPress calling itself the real b2/cafelog.  All forks that went ahead and did their own thing, trying to become their own "brand". Sure, some of those original forks weren't as known beforehand but even when they were in their respective fields, the fork still didn't try to mislead people.  Imagine one of the above-described forks owning a twitter handle of the original and discrediting it.
3	1523185132	11	Nope. Sure there are some snarky comments about Bitcoin cash but the Bitcoin community is mostly occupied with promoting segwit, the lightning network and the usual "hodling"meme. On the other side, the ant-bitcoin, anti-segwit and anti-LN bashing and outright lies coming from the likes of Roger Ver(segwitcoin) is unreal.
4	1523201042	2	You are fuckin delusional
5	1523201943	0	The kind of response I expected.
2	1523193328	-11	We 'bash bitcoin' Because that's the reason BCH was created. There was a good amount of people in bitcoin who wanted to scale on chain but due to censorship of opinions these voices were suppressed. We believe BCH carries on what bitcoin used to be, before segwit and this broken ass lightning network.Watch any video about what bitcoin is and those are the merits of what BCH is. Have fun explaining to your grandma how to set up a lightning node AFTER explaining to her what bitcoin is. Yeah layer two solutions can be a thing, but not at the expense of the base layer
3	1523196522	8	Someone who supports bcash finally said it, Bitcoin cash was created to bash bitcoin. Thank you for confirming that with your first statement.
4	1523198491	2	This is super obvious.  No matter what anyone thinks BCH and BTC are at war and only one will win.  And yes BCH is a huge threat which is why everyone talks about relentlessly.  I own both.  I have no idea who wins but this is a fight for sure.  
5	1523200328	1	At this moment I own neither but I still tend to use both honestly, the ONLY reason I really hope BTC comes out on top is because if BCH comes out on top, I can see people using it against us already  "whenever there's a crypto on top, you can easily just fork it and take it's spot."
4	1523197462	1	It was created because there was a disagreement within the community... So yeah at its core it does counter BTC
1	1523174238	-4	Yep, just like they still own /r/btc Bunch of con artists
2	1523176246	87	r/btc was created 2 years before bch forked. Created for members of the bitcoin community who were banned for voicing suppport for issues such as big blocks in r/bitcoin. Now it just so happens the BTC community who moved to r/btc are in support of bch
3	1523178999	5	Been reading up the btc and bch divide since had a chat with you last time (it was you right?). I hold an equal number of bch and btc now. Fuck layer 2 solutions mate never knew that was what it was about lol.
4	1523179788	11	>Been reading up the btc and bch divide since had a chat with you last timeglad to hear it. [This](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/) comment sums up the history of r/btc and r/bitcoin pretty well. 
5	1523180232	14	It's crazy so much happened before the mainstream world came here. I was never into the dev part only bought btc coz I liked it. Almost bought drugs back in 2012 with it but chickened out. I remember back then the sellers didn't need to check confirmations, btc broadcasted meant btc sent with almost certainty which was the case with Steam when they started crypt too. I remember true adoption across the internet happening and I thought hey I'll just spend my btc if govts move on it. But then I saw adoption dying down right in front of our eyes and for the longest time I had no idea why. I just thought btc got old. Had no idea btc dying in adoption was a business roadmap to make it less useful as a currency. Fuck that. I now hold both as btc is still decentralized and we should all be supporting it as it's no one person, though I get what the divide is about and I'm sure whatever's right will win in the end. Just keep making the networks stronger by people and resistant to this kind of censored manipulation and we all win
6	1523181563	7	People's poor memory of those times also works against them, in the worst possible ways.To use what you said as an example, yes, not every business required confirmations on Bitcoin deposits in 2012. You have now remembered this as "sellers didn't _need_ to check confirmations" instead of "sellers didn't _bother_ to check for confirmations". By the end of 2013 (long before blocks were full) almost no such businesses remained. The reason? It became more and more common knowledge how to exploit this naivety to steal. (In r/btc you'll be "corrected" that events which happened years later were instead the reason.)That's just one example of how an innocent mis-remembering, a single word change in a sentence, can be used to revise history to suit a narrative. Fanboys and red-pillers alike are both interested in telling you what they believe politically and would like to believe as well. Look at the facts and events that demonstrably happened and decide the truth for yourself.
7	1523184557	-2	>It became more and more common knowledge how to exploit this naivety to steal.No it didn't, Steam was processing payments on broadcast, silk road was too adn so was every other merchant accepting btc in 2013. Anyone running a full node could accept payments on broadcast safely pretty much 100% of the times.>That's just one example of how an innocent mis-rememberingHow is it innocent misremembering? My point was so many merchants were using it then and noone is now, not 0 conf. Stop attacking tidbits which are trivial and used to make my larger point that you completely ignored. BTC would have continued being adopted by hundreds of thousands of merchants like 2013 if this whole shitstorm hadn't happened and if it continued to scale like it was. None of that is misremembering.Tell me if the compromise for security was anyway going to happen in the way of LN, what was the problem with a block increase? the hard disk capacity increase over time automatically is a much stronger argument then handing over the  chain to a layer 2 third party dont you think? All of this is coming out of research I do not care about your petty fights as not every user was  a part of the dev teams or consensus
8	1523185490	7	One of the central arguments the BCH community makes has to do with unconfirmed transactions being safe to treat as confirmed, so to me that's hardly a tidbit.There were ways to make a transaction get stuck and ways to double spend successfully, long before blocks were ever full, and long before replace by fee. And it was used to steal from businesses who naively accepted unconfirmed deposits. That's why that practice died out. I suspect you may not remember everyone stopping this practice across 2013. It was common at the start of that year and rare by the end. I mean no animosity, but that is what I remember.There was never a magical period of time in which there weren't ways to make a transaction get stuck or double-spend successfully. There certainly was a period of time in which some businesses assumed otherwise. For at least the last four-five years, you have had to do additional checks and logic before deciding if it is safe to trust an unconfirmed transaction, or risk getting burned pretty quickly. It's far easier to require confirmations than do that.
9	1523186044	2	> I suspect you may not remember everyone stopping this practice across 2013. It was common at the start of that year and rare by the end. I mean no animosity, but that is what I remember.I think my memory maybe hazy but you're confusing years. By 2014 adoption had pretty much died and due to the very reasons I'm talking about. Not due to 0 conf. Tell me, if youre running a business and the network is not congested enough that transactions broadcast instantly, what problem will you have with accepting transactions on broadcast? You have the latest blockchain with the most work, I am technologically not getting what can be the problem of that. Right now the broadcast takes so much time, and a lot can happen till the tx is added to the block and you sending it, but other than that can you explain from a dev point how a 2013 merchant accepting btc on broadcast could be setting themselves up for a security risk? Do you have examples of double spends happening and merchants getting duped? I remember no such case seriously, may just be wrong but afair silk road was pretty much run on 0 conf. 
4	1523193462	5	Cheers.This entire subbreddit is full of get rich quick kiddies or btc shills that don't understand how Core has fucked up BTC to no end so they can push the lightning network.Seems like /r/btc is the only place where actual technical discussion happens, BCH or others
5	1523195408	2	It just seems so disingenuous to have a sub called btc be against btc and for bch.
6	1523195735	7	This is why it is called /r/btc. It has existed much longer than BCH. Everyone in support of bigger blocks was banned from /r/bitcoin and migrated to the new subbreddit. https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43
7	1523204083	2	I realize that. It still seems misleading.
8	1523204219	1	Can't change a subbreddit name :/ 
6	1523203300	3	It was /btc before bch even existed. The /r/btc sub was created as an alternative to the heavily censored /r/bitcoin forum where you can say what you like without fear of getting banned or shadowbanned. Fast forward two years and the /r/btc forum is still a forum for free speech about Bitcoin, the only difference being that the ticker has changed. Bcore and Bitcoin (Cash) can be freely discussed at /r/btc and to call that disingenuous highlights your complete lack of understanding of the situation. If the forum could be moved back to /r/bitcoin that would be excellent as that would mean the private, for-profit business co-opting bcore no longer controls it.If you wish to view a forum that focuses solely on Bitcoin (Cash) you can go to /r/bitcoincash
7	1523204314	1	I realize that. >to call that disingenuous highlights your complete lack of understanding of the situation.Or maybe it highlights your lack of understanding the English language. I never said it was disingenuous.
7	1523206391	0	>Bcore and Bitcoin (Cash)This shit is why nobody takes you shills seriously.
8	1523207061	0	I'm trying to educate you. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. Bcore is an altcoin. Read the whitepaper.
9	1523207113	1	ok homes. whatever. 
4	1523195690	-1	"Don't know what it's about, but I know I don't like it. But I'm part of a group now so I feel better, right mate?"
3	1523185638	3	Not exactly true. It's only a part of the community that originally migrated. After the fork you got downvoted to hell for using Bitcoin so most of us left r/btc too.
4	1523188563	0	Point me to even one comment of someone being down voted for using bitcoin
5	1523209057	1	Try post something about bitcoin that isn't negative, you'll see. 
3	1523188437	1	So why did RV have to buy the subreddit if it was already here and echoed similar thoughts ? 
4	1523190753	3	It’s so he can promote his website bitcoin.com 
3	1523176460	-13	Then you should be in a sub named something like "/r/bch" and not the acronym on all exchanges for the real Bitcoin. Even if bcash became the dominant currency, it would not have been okay to steal that acronym and use it as your sub.
4	1523176892	10	> Even if bcash became the dominant currency, it would not have been okay to steal that acronym and use it as your sub.Did you not read my reply? this wasnt on purpose. The community in r/btc has been there for sometime now, and happy to be there. Its not a BCH subreddit, its for discussion of everything bitcoin including all forks, it just so happens the majority of the community in that sub favor bitcoin cash. Discussion of anything other than BTC in r/bitcoin is not allowed. 
5	1523191357	6	>Its not a BCH subredditNo offense, but if you believe this then you're truly ignorant.  I don't mean this in a way to start an argument, but I really feel that so many in /r/btc are so out of touch with the rest of the cryptosphere.There are many reasons why just about every crypto sub you visit has such a low opinion of BCH.  Many /r/btc posters continue to post how /r/cryptocurrency is just a bunch of stupid, naive, and idiotic noobs supporting "core's" narrative, in spite of it being crypto's second largest sub.  I just shake my head and figure that many BCH supporters simply don't get it and never will. /r/btc is a constant cesspool of hate and anger.  I used to believe that you could still hold a different opinion and not be downvoted to hell there.  Fact: that is improbable today, and has been for quite a while now.  It seems to be getting better nowadays but people will keep calling it what it is until the status quo changes.
5	1523206865	1	Hahaha, the censorship there is just as bad as on any other crypto subreddit. You're either delusional or a shill, gtfo.
5	1523185819	-3	Completely wrong, you get downvoted to hell for not being pro-BCH. It's a shill shithole. There is no discussion taking place.
6	1523188520	2	This is a lie. If you spread hate and hostility you will be down voted. Ask an honest question and you'll get an honest answer 
2	1523178075	-3	The BCH guys need to get a life
3	1523184082	-11	They have :) 2 transactions, cheaper than 1 cent. in less than a minute: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1vZEhJBaF0
4	1523199493	1	It's amazing how cheap transaction fees are on a chain that no one uses.
4	1523191599	1	There is hardly any value proposition for BCH nowadays.  BTC's fees have been cheaper than BCH's for several stretches the last few days.  If fees were so important, Nano would be king, putting 0-conf to shame (which Satoshi himself said never to accept).  BCH is neither here nor there.  Nothing against it.  Just being a realist.
5	1523191776	1	Nope. BCH fees are on Dogecoin level. Nano suffers from DDoS Attacks. That's why it's down from $15 to $5 now. Completly free transactions always lead to spam or DDoS Attacks. - Just try to calculate how expensive it would be to "spam" 8MB Blocks or next month 32MB blocks for a whole day. Smart Contracts and Tokenisation will be available soon on BCH. With some neat features. Just search for Anti Gox Mechanism. It will change everything.
6	1523192185	7	>Nano suffers from DDoS AttacksProof please.  Also, respectfully disagree with the reason why the price is down.  BCH's drop from ATH is far worse.Nano has decentralization concerns but BCH is far worse in this regard.  Take out the Hangzhou servers and just about half the nodes go out.  Of the seven major mining pools in Bitcoin, each one already has a higher hash rate than all of BCH.  I can speculate and trade, but I most certainly wouldn't invest.

3	1523206674	-1	Oh ok, so 200k out of the millions that use the real bitcoin.God, you're all idiots.
4	1523207007	1	You're an idiot, the sub number is 200k. Noone uses Bcore because it's for 'hodling'. Bitcoin Cash is for use as a currency.Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin.
5	1523207419	1	That's why bcash is worth a fraction of the real Bitcoin. I'm done talking to you idiots. Not even worth the effort it takes to type a response.I can't wait until the market corrects the mistake that is "bcash" and all of you lose your money.
1	1523197431	3	Yes, and don’t forget r/btc is actually about bcash. Fucked up shit if you ask me.

1	1523190637	3	I think confrontation is inevitable but harmful in either case. I believe that bcash was sprung from a combination of good intentions and selfish from others (reward seeking miners in particular)While BCH may be closer to the original Satoshi vision, Bitcoin has held the name and mark of BTC in a nearly democratic majority consensus. There should be respect for this and any FUD or confusion otherwise is toxic to the community as a whole. On the other hand, Bcash has its inherent and clear use case advantages (although scalability may still be problematic). BTC was meant to be a decentralized digital currency, and Bcash is certainly closer to that end (rather than storage of wealth - or digital gold Misinformation, misleading, and shitting on one another is generally bad for the crypto revolution. There is room for both technologies as this market is still in it’s infancy. And it should also be considered that a number of other projects come closer to achieving Satoshi’s white paper goals than either BTC or BCH. 
2	1523191299	4	> And it should also be considered that a number of other projects come closer to achieving Satoshi’s white paper goals than either BTC or BCH.This point is very important and I thank you for making it.As someone who has never needed to utilize BCH, and as someone who currently uses BTC solely as a means to acquire other cryptocurrency, the infighting, from an "outsider's" perspective such as mine, is rather ridiculous. Gratitude to you for explaining the differences in the utilities and motivations behind these coins without being a jackass.

1	1523187663	11	Bitcoin is not a trademark, but can still be impersonated. Remember, the reasons OP gave are only his assumptions, not official reasons.
2	1523187938	-11	If a fork is an impersonation than all of bitcoin is impersonating itself.
3	1523189511	4	> impersonating itself.One can't impersonate himself. That doesn't make any sense. 
4	1523194893	1	Exactly.  That’s why it doesn’t make sense to say that a fork is an impersonation/fake of Bitcoin.
5	1523196213	4	A fork is not Bitcoin. There is only one Bitcoin network. Simply the network most people call Bitcoin. What Bitcoin is is decided by the majority. But nice try at mental gymnastics.
6	1523201657	0	Wrong, there are many bitcoin networks.
6	1523196613	-4	Username checks out.If a fork is not bitcoin, does that mean there is no Bitcoin?  There are many different versions of Bitcoin, and they are all forks.  You can choose which one, if any, or maybe multiple, you use in any way you want.  Miners choose based on what makes them money.  I choose which one to use based on how well it works.
7	1523209135	1	Satoshi defined bitcoin as the blockchain with the highest proof of work done. 
5	1523196777	-1	Bitcoin is bitcoin. Bcash is an attempt at impersonation. They only way they can get new investors, is to trick them into thinking it's "bitcoin". That's why the @bitcoin handle was banned, because the sole purpose of it's existence was to defraud people. 
6	1523197234	3	Bitcoin is Bitcoin.  x=x.  Bcash is a Brazilian payment service which, as far as I know, doesn’t use Bitcoin, and with the amount of attacks they’re getting I highly doubt we’ll get adoption from them.  BCH is a fork of Bitcoin, just like BTC, BTG, and any other fork.  I think it is more effective and useful than BTC, which is why I and @Bitcoin support it.  If BCH is an impersonation of Bitcoin because it is a fork and supporting it is fraud, then the same is true for BTC.
7	1523198234	0	>BCH is a fork of Bitcoin, just like BTC, BTG, and any other fork.Except those forks don't try to defraud people. They don't claim to be bitcoin. They know they are a minority altcoin. They don't advocate the downfall of bitcoin. 
8	1523204556	1	BTC does claim it is the only Bitcoin, which I think is just as inaccurate as “BCH is the real Bitcoin.”  There are multiple Bitcoins, and no one chain has claim to “the only Bitcoin.”  BCH and the BCH community don’t advocate the downfall of Bitcoin either.  We support the continuation of Bitcoin through BCH.  
9	1523207194	1	The language you're using just proves my point.  BCH isn't a continuation of bitcoin. It breaks Bitcoin protocol rules. It's a minority altcoin. 
6	1523197902	-1	> is to trick them into thinking it's "bitcoin"How are they doing that? - It's not like they stole an entire subreddit, right? And using the name Bitcoin to market themselves. - It's not like Bcash people get angry, when you call their coin Bcash, when the real name is Bitcoin Cash. They don't get totally mad over that and lose their shit right? - It's not like there's a webpage that is called Bitcoin dot org ( com ). Hell even I get confused. Surely they don't use that page to advertise their coin? - Surely their entire value proposition is not based around how someone else sucks? Just honestly, it's ridiculous. If I wanted lower fees, I'm taking Litecoin. Simple stuff. No need for a shitty fork, stealing the name and network. 
1	1523184039	-12	Lol. Exactly. But the bitcoin core fangirls and paid bots just finally decided to go hard on it because of twitter saying they would crack down on it. So bitcoin core is just playin twitter for fools.

0	1523196783	5	I’m not saying I agree with this, but Bitcoin Cash would be much better off marketing themselves as the “ better alternative” for Bitcoin. Instead they’ve decided to spend their time bashing Bitcoin even though they have their own chain. Think what you will about BCH, I don’t agree with their strategy, but you can’t deny that BCH has a very loyal and hardworking community. This strategy is not good for them long term. 
1	1523206800	1	This is absolutely correct. They don’t get it.  No one really cares about this whole “real bitcoin” narrative other than entitled, angry pre-2015 bitcoin holders. Bitcoin finds itself in a position of desirability because it serves the purpose of liquidity for the entire crypto market. Whether lightning works out or not is a different matter altogether and many couldn’t care any less if it doesn’t. There are many other promising options. If this wasn’t bad enough, BCH comes in with limited differentiation. It’s neither super fast unless you trust 0-conf which satoshi said never to accept, it’s never going to be free, and it’ll take ages for it to even be considered for smart contracts.  When it pumps, it kills the price of bitcoin which triggers most of crypto. By making all these enemies, how can BCH win? Even Mike Hearn said that BCH is just repeating their past mistakes. Loyal as the BCH people really are, there is no smart play on the board. It’s Jihan and Roger’s covert ASIC boost coin mixed with Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre’s filth. So much baggage. Good luck to them all.

3	1523204040	0	Go ahead and do it then? Who's stopping you? 
1	1523177005	13	Well, trying to say "this is bitcoin" is disingenuous.  Honestly.  They can say WHY they believe that their upgrade (because THEY upgraded and forked) is better, but since it wasn't the consensus, it's a fork, and needs a new name.That's ok, just don't call it bitcoin.
2	1523177580	17	When people say “BCH is bitcoin” they’re obviously not saying “BCH is BTC”. That would be ridiculous and clearly wrong. What they’re saying is that BCH is a legitimate form of the bitcoin project which is pursuing on-chain scaling as was always intended, rather than Segwit and LN. And the only reason why it’s not called just “Bitcoin” is for the reason you mentioned. That’s why it’s called “Bitcoin Cash”. Ethereum and Ethereum Classic don’t have this problem. Probably because they all understand the history of the fork and why both are legitimate implementations of the Ethereum project. 
3	1523193103	12	Maybe ethereum doesn't have this problem because no one ever says "ethereum classic is ethereum." 
4	1523198083	4	And whoever heard of ethereum core
4	1523204164	2	I know a lot of people are new, but "ethereum classic is ethereum" has been said a thousand times during/after the fork. 
4	1523199791	1	More like "ethereum classic is ethereum without the bailouts".
4	1523205511	1	And no one seems to call it eclass either...
2	1523178826	1	Just the opposite. By every single measure in [the actual document that defines the term "Bitcoin"](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is already more "Bitcoin" than BTC. No more so than in the very title, where BCH is committed to being "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic **Cash** System" while BTC is actively moving towards becoming a high fee, high friction store-of-value system.  That same paper also clearly laid out the Sybil-resistant consensus system by which Bitcoin should evolve. Almost all of the recent, major changes to BTC were achieved by actively subverting this Nakamoto consensus via every unethical means available (/u/theymos, UASF anyone?) This may be most obvious in that SegWit is now activated on the BTC chain *without the promised 2x increase part of the consensus agreement*. **This means SegWit activated on BTC illegitimately**.  It was this exact "SegWit2x' charade of a consensus agreement that ultimately forced the on-chain scaling contingent of the community to fork the block chain while still a hash rate minority. It was a final defense to prevent SegWit from forever polluting the original Bitcoin block chain, as we all clearly knew that 2x was an empty promise that would never take place. Now that the Rube Goldbergian, security-sapping complexity of SegWit has sullied the BTC block chain, the only measure remaining to prove that BCH is the real Bitcoin is most total aggregate proof of SHA256 work (since it already currently holds the "longest chain" measure over BTC, as specified in the white paper). If BCH market capitalization overtakes that of BTC for any significant period, it will have this characteristic as well. When and if this will occur remains to be seen, but every day demonstrates that one system works and is consistently honest and reliable, while the other continues to be mired in unreliability (related to congestion and fee uncertainty,) its own unnecessary complexity, and its community leaders' innate duplicity.

3	1523189211	15	> real Bitcoin is most total aggregate proof of SHA256 work (since it already currently holds the "longest chain" measure over BTC, as specified in the white paper). LOL. First of all, this only applies to temporary chain splits within the same network, not hard forks. Second, this is completely and utterly false. BTC is the chain with the most accumulated work, because its difficulty is about ten times higher than that of BCH and has been since the fork.
4	1523190441	8	The ignorance is staggering.. He really thinks that block height is the sole measure of how much work has been done.I can fork bitcoin, set the difficulty to 1, and create a chain that has millions of blocks. He's completely misunderstanding what total work is.It doesn't surprise me that bcash supporters are this ignorant. Roger Ver has done more to hurt this industry than any government or regulatory body. It's sickening. 
4	1523195864	-2	By the way, if what you claim were true, BTC would have stopped being "Bitcoin" itself long ago. There have already been several hard forks on the BTC block chain before BCH, and SegWit was another one since.
5	1523196126	6	Wonderful. The BTC/Segwit chain has the most accumulated work, therefore it is the real chain. QED.
6	1523196440	-4	That is the **only** metric by which it can try to claim being "Bitcoin", as it departs from the white paper far more than BCH virtually everywhere else. Based on this fact, I don't think it's unfair to say the matter is currently highly disputed.
7	1523196848	4	BCH uses a different signature type from Satoshi’s original signatures, which would mean it diverges from the original vision as well. Neither BTC nor BCH is Satoshi’s Original Bitcoin^TM - and that is how it *should* be. Stop dwelling on the past and on what one man wanted. Bitcoin is what the world believes it is, and that is BTC.
8	1523197000	1	Details of the signature type are not specified in the white paper, nor are details of difficulty adjustment for example, aside for generalized descriptions.  I'd argue removing witness data from being signed is a far larger deviation from the white paper, as is adding the concept of "block weight".
9	1523197294	4	It’s still not the original Bitcoin as defined by the original implementation. The real question is, who the fuck cares? You’re going to value a single writing of one man more than the opinion of the entire community? 
4	1523195554	-4	Please read the white paper, and try to understand it this time.
5	1523196019	5	[No, you.]( https://i.imgur.com/3sgQz8w.jpg )Please tell me again that BCH has greater proof of work invested in it so I can laugh in your face.
6	1523196382	-2	I never said that BCH currently has greater aggregate proof of work, only that it currently satisfies the three words before your own underlined quote:  > ... "the longest chain"...  So aside from the contradictory clause that you underlined, BCH already satisfies every metric specified in the white paper for being "Bitcoin", whereas BTC has violated the white paper in philosophy *and* by not following Nakamoto consensus for SegWit activation. The only metric left is the community consensus for total aggregate proof of work *instead* of the longest chain metric. Based on fundamentals, I still believe that one will also fall to BCH as a simple matter of time.
3	1523209400	0	Big pile of text but doesn't know that it's not about block high but number of calculations done....Your 100. 000 extra mined coins (due to miner abuse of the EDA) makes Satoshi twist in his grave. 
2	1523177071	0	what protocol is behind the BCH network?
3	1523177683	0	The same as bitcoin dark, Bitcoin private, Bitcoin diamond etc... But no one complains about those..... Because they're not a true alternative. People aren't really complaining about bitcoin cash away from the echo chambers of social media. When you explain to someone irl what bitcoin cash is, it makes total sense to them why it was needed and why it will be needed in the future. Unfortunately brigading social media by blocking accounts, censoring subreddits and attacking any mention of Bitcoin Cash on other subs just isn't going to change the fact that a simple block size was safe and effective, making the entire lightning network a fucking joke to anyone looking in from the outside. 
4	1523179288	11	You really say BCH is the same as BTCP technology-wise? 
5	1523181618	-2	My apologies. They are all forks but yes bitcoin private claims to add 'the privacy of zk snarks' 
6	1523181728	4	"Claims"? You know it's a fork of ZEC which already had shielded transactions running. 
7	1523187634	1	I was simply quoting their website. 
8	1523190445	2	Claims implies that you're not convinced of that functionality. 
9	1523193317	1	No it doesn't. I simply haven't looked into it, sorry. 
2	1523179283	-4	> trying to say "this is bitcoin" is disingenuous.It's not, since BCH is simply trying to preserve exactly what bitcoin has been for 9 years now, before segwit and Lightning became the new direction, a radical departure from what bitcoin was in the past.If anything, calling modern BTC bitcoin is disingenuous. The only reason it keeps the name is because Core devs have Wladimir in their pocket and he controls the Git repo. Only reason. If not for that, segwit would've had to fork off, not BCH.
2	1523177333	-8	It has a new name, Bitcoin Cash. And is closer to the whitepaper than ever imo. Closer than this whole lightning mess.... 
3	1523182069	8	It doesn't matter if it's closer to the white paper, it's still a fork 
4	1523188005	0	Bitcoin has forked plenty of times from it's original code.
5	1523189203	4	Via consensus. 
4	1523184350	-3	You are saying a fork only has 1 true way?A left and a right is a fork. There is no original way after. You just have to pick which one you believe to be closer to the whitepaper
4	1523185865	-4	Ah ...right. Good luck with your trojan horse Segwit which makes Bitcoin totally diffrent. Why don't you name your science project Segwitcoin Lightning?BCH works as digital cash, today. What Bitcoin was intent to be. See this.No lightning required.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1vZEhJBaF0
3	1523205755	0	So by your logic version 0.5 is Satoshi's real vision. 
1	1523178430	2	This! Because the truth is it was never really been about the risk of confusing people. It’s always been about some people feeling threatened, and scared their precious bitcoin is being challenged, or god forbid, taken away. Well what about Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen, Roger Ver and all the devs and users who flocked to r/btc to escape r/bitcoin’s censorship. What about *their* Bitcoin being taken away by a group of *new* developers, who locked Gavin out of the github, DDS attacked Mike Hearn’s last ditch effort to keep development decentralized with Bitcoin XT? That project has just as much right to exist as Core’s segwit, LN implementation. 
2	1523180149	0	Sure it has a right to exist, but not to pretend to be Bitcoin. Which is why they can spread their bullshit with @Bcash or whatever, but not @Bitcoin.
3	1523181879	10	Dude, you’re talking about some of the absolute first uses and developers of bitcoin, who not only spoke to Satoshi directly, but we’re chosen by him to lead development. These people were kicked out. So, if you’re going to play the ridiculous “bitcoin is a trademark and only one group is allowed to use it” game, then I’m sorry but you’re going to have a hard time. I suggest BTC stop playing the world internet police, and get on with actually making LN *work*. 
4	1523182532	-6	Looks like you bcash sycophants are more likely to have a hard time.
5	1523182589	9	Whatever dude. I wish you the best. 
6	1523182671	-3	I wish you the best too, as long as that doesn't include crashing the entire crypto market again in misguided attempts to cause "the flippening".

4	1523182112	7	No one has suggested it is accidental. But maybe try showing some intellectual curiosity and ask yourself why so many of these “morons” include some of the earliest Bitcoin developers and users. Perhaps you’ll find a good answer. 
5	1523182727	7	I guess Vitalik is one of these "morons" aswell https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/930276246671450112
6	1523184094	6	Exactly. I’ve come to the conclusion that the quite remarkable number of anti-BCH posters on this sub are either willfully ignorant or they’re shills. No other explanation. 
7	1523184593	6	Most of them are just trolls, but this isn't a new issue. 4 years ago much of the hate and hostility in cryptocurrency was from anti bitcoin trolls. Then all of a sudden in 2015 the majority of trolls were supportive of bitcoin but anti big block. Now the majority of the trolls are anti BCH. 
7	1523184508	2	Ya, frankly rereading the history I think you have a fair point.I do not enjoy the impostor type behavior, but can see the point that it's a bit lashing out. Now why they communicate it to the public at large? I mean again, it feels like impostor behavior. Calling it Bitcoin internally might seem fine, but promoting it as such to the public really isn't a great thought, IMO.
8	1523186819	3	Sure. I see it a little differently though. I think it helps first to understand that all of the people involved in Bitcoin Cash were originally passionate supporters and advocates of Bitcoin. Indeed, the conflict between the BTC and BCH communities begins to look very different once you accept that this is really just a prolonged dispute between two factions within *one* Bitcoin community. It's just that one side were forced to fork off the BTC chain in order to preserve and pursue those features that they believe are necessary to Bitcoin's integrity and success. I think it is worth highlighting that nobody, least of all the big blockers, wanted to fork the Bitcoin project. Everyone tried for years to prevent this very occurrence, with various agreements and compromises etc. But these agreements were broken, and now we have the situation that we have. At the end of the day, I think it's most positive to see these two coins as two different approaches to the scaling of Bitcoin. And we're fortunate in a way, that they are both being trialled in the real world. Yes, they are, like all cryptos, competing. But at least their relative strengths and weaknesses are no longer theoretical—we get to really see which approach *actually* works. For those actually interested in a long-term economic and financial revolution, surely this good.

0	1523179648	16	Hahaha. This is idiotic. Why is everyone so butt hurt about the other. Why don’t people want bitcoin to be better? Sorry we need to be more specific, why don’t the people who totally control the btc supply and keep crushing community efforts to fix it, and also crush dissent to their actions, against the community trying to make btc more usable? Can anyone please provide a simple explanation for that?I feel like most people are new and just think BCH was a scam copy, without looking at legitimate gripes the bitcoin code had for AGESSS and a promised solution from core devs that I am pretty sure is soooooo overdue, it is frankly ridiculous that anyone would take at face value promises from these guys? I mean core track record has been appalling. I’m not saying cash is the gold standard, but unlike the continued wait from the core team, they presented an idea to the crypto community and it’s up to us to decide whether we want to start using cash over core. Why the constant FUD? Are you guys scared? Maximalists should let their product do the talking, because frankly if we are being objective about this there are differences regarding usability between the two. LOLATALLOFYOU. Let’s just let the market settle it for usPS. I hold equal amounts of Cash and Core, IDGAF, about your idiot turf war, NEWSFLASH- a lot of us don’t really give a shit.
1	1523186385	-1	Shill. There's no such digital asset as "Bitcoin Core". There's Bitcoin and B(itcoin) Cash
2	1523195248	8	Reasonable arguments! He must be a shill!!!!!!
1	1523192668	-1	It stems from having a lot of really really bad people in Bcash and having a lot of guys trying to shape the future in bitcoin.As long as Bcash is associated with ver and jian, it'll never get further than it is right now(while most people think that the only reason they are further than other forks is those 2)Drop the terrorist and bitmain: Maybe get more adoption and love but most likely get back down to other fork's levels.keep the terrorist and bitmain: Stay exactly where they are through bruteforce.I don't like bcash but that's because its basically made by a bunch of hitlers, otherwise it would concern me just as much as litecoin and any other decent crypto that doesnt affect my life at all(0%).  Lots of people are feeling the same as me.. We see a lot of whining by bcash maximalists and no one wants to hear cry babies supporting a bunch of baby-hitlers/villains.
2	1523203935	3	Bitcoin Cash is not bcash, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin and you're too fearful to admit the truth because you sold your Bitcoin for $200 after Bitcoin fork/upgraded to Bitcoin (Cash)Please educate yourself, Bcore is not Bitcoin. It is not intending to be peer-to-peer currency and it is centrally controlled by a private for-profit business called Blockstream.
3	1523206526	-1	Oh please. Hardforked difficulty algorithm precludes bcash--shitcoin cash--whatever you want to call if from ever even aspiring to "be bitcoin".
4	1523207038	1	'bcash' = I'm terrified of Bitcoin Cash - the real Bitcoin.

0	1523179576	13	People in r/cc unironically cheering censorship. Okay.The @Bitcoin account is the same person it's always been since its inception, people are butthurt that he follows the original path of Bitcoin instead of the derailed version of BTC. Bitcoin's value is in its use as a currency, that's what gave it value in the beginning, that's what will bring it more value in the future, whether in the form of BCH, BTC or any other fork that pursues that use case relentlessly and achieves adoption. So far only BCH is pursuing that path. Hopefully this is a temporary setback for @Bitcoin, as it has happened before and was undone. People love to report and troll him constantly, but his followers would grow daily despite it. Anyone new to this scene and are seeing a shitshow they do not understand, I urge you to read the history of BTC and BCH from as many sources as you can and draw your own conclusions. 
1	1523191271	12	How is this censorship? The @bitcoin Twitter handle existed to attack bitcoin. If somehow I got my hands on @monero, then used it to bash monero all day, and say that Aeon is the real monero, I'd expect to be shut down. It's juvenile and immoral. If bcash just focused on themselves, I'd have a little respect for them. But they're just the whiny 5 year olds of this community. They don't have a leg to stand on. They exist just to attack bitcoin.  It's just pathetic. They are toxic. 
2	1523204389	-1	> If somehow I got my hands on @monero, then used it to bash monero all day, and say that Aeon is the real monero, I'd expect to be shut down. It's juvenile and immoral.Why? 
3	1523207100	1	Because it's fraudulent. 
4	1523207587	0	Explain how. 
2	1523195522	-9	Us bcashers attack bitcoin because that's the reason BCH was created. A group of people tried to speak out and raise the blocksize so fees would never go up. They were ostrasiced and censored from the main discussion forums. Bitcoin Cash is the original bitcoin before all this segwit and lightning nonsense.Its merits are that it doesn't need a second layer to scale to visa levels. That's it.
3	1523197712	7	Guess what, that's what consensus is for. The whole network decided to go with the core team, not the bcash alternstive proposal. You lost, it's that simple. You are the minority. You don't get to determine the rules of the majority.Continue seperately with your own coin, absolutely. But don't try and argue that yours is the true bitcoin everyone should use, if it's been well decided otherwise by everyone else.
4	1523197983	-3	You're right. We are seperate and the minority. But we havent lost. People need to know the history and the technical differences of the two coins. There are constant FUD attacks based on absolute nonsense against Bitcoin Cash that normal people won't even look into BCH. It's sad.I always tell people to buy the Bitcoin that will forever have subcent fees.
5	1523204874	2	Why would I look at BCH when there are tons of better alternatives? From technology perspective both BTC and BCH are relics.
6	1523207425	1	It is partly a brand thing, no doubt. Normies do know of Bitcoin over say something like Nano. But BTC is a relic because Core has done no innovation on the chain. The best thing they did was Segwit. Also these coins have Bitpay, which has thousands of merchants. BCH has many of these early developers that are now free to innovate again. Op_Codes are coming soon which will open the chain up to be able to tons of new features. If these were on BTC early on, the alt coin market would not be so ridiculous. ETH would be worth way less, etc.
0	1523173962	12	Ongoing process of bcash falling into obscurity
1	1523176921	18	It's still #4 or #5 on market cap.... That's big.
2	1523184109	14	And more volume then litecoin now. I believ bitcoin cash is 3rd or 4th highest in 24hr volume most days.......I guess some people call that falling into obscurity?
3	1523199315	-2	We'll see in the next bullrun, when the chains have to work more. We'll see how Segwit performs and to what degree Lightning can help in early stage. The last argument Bcash has going for them is that currently we don't have high transactions in real Bitcoin, because transactions are lower. Another bullrun will come and we will see how that last argument they play is that Segwitfucking sucks. It's still only at 30% adoption by the way - Segwit.ASICS are not the problem. Eventually it will be cheaper to purchase one for yourself and help decentralize the thing. ASICs get a lot of shit, they really don't deserve. But having a chain that is 25 TBs big could be a problem for decentralization. People claim that hardware will just magically get better. So what was a normal harddrive like 5 years ago? Like 150GB? What is the average now? I'd argue 500GBs. https://www.statisticbrain.com/average-cost-of-hard-drive-storage/Direct proof. Sure, space gets better, but sadly not in proportion to how fast Bitcoin is growing.The scaling isn't there. Just like processors and graphics cards are also not siginificantly getting better. It's because there's only so much space these people can use. Sure, technology will get better, but eventually Bcash chain will scale into something that is 1000TB and good luck for the average person trying to get that. There you have a centralization problem. Average Joe will never get a harddrive that big. He *might* however purchase a miner for 1000$ and make money with that. ASICs ar enot the problem. Pools are a problem in that they have all say. However pools are also *needed* to reduce variance on your earnings. You either get the block, or you don't. People react to "political changes" like that. At first Segwit was blocked too, but pools aligned and shifted in such a way, that eventually it was pushed through, when it was *really* needed - when we had no other choice. Segwit fixes that problem. Bitcoin is *by far* the most decentralized currency out of 1600. There's promising projects that try out Proof-of-Stake. Bcash is not such a promising project and Bitcoin is totally fine the way it currently is. It's also getting better via additional layer solutions, which Segwit opens up. Ver claims that Bcash can also have Lightning, but the guy that worte the fucking paper says it cannot. And even if they can, isn't their original argument anyway that Lightning sucks and Satoshi had all that shit figured out 9 years ago already? You think Satoshi created the perfect tool already? What do you think he would have done, if he heard that bigger blocks result in more centralization? Bcash focuses on transactions. Bitcoin focuses on being fucking decentralized. Pretty sure Satoshi would have said the same thing, because he couldn't look into the future and predict that his "funny paper" will eventually lead to become a TRILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. Yea, he thought about that already. Real Bitcoin is not going to have this massive crazy chain - thanks to Segwit.Why is there such hate for Bcash? Because they fucking stole our name and trick honest people that want to try Bitcoin and they trick these innocent people into this fake fucking SCAM that is called Bcash. Great fucking work. I would have ZERO problems with Bcash, if their name was like "Digital Cash" or any name really, just not ABUSING the Bitcoin brand. We'll see the truth that Bcash is trash the next run. By that time it will probably roll back to insignificance. Want lower transactions? Use fucking Litecoin. Excellent coin. Works fucking great. Big fan. https://www.tradingview.com/chart/I4cvi83W/If Bcash was so much better and is adopted like everywhere, why is the value pretty much not winning against Bitcoin whatsoever? Make the choice, dumb your fucking coins and buy the real thing. Fucking buy Litecoin with it. Nano, ADA, IOTA, anything really. 
2	1523206794	1	Lots of shitcoins have snuck into the top 10.
1	1523179173	10	Isn't it being added by merchants all over? BTC is too, along with bch. honestly i do not get this divide. Both are different iterations of the same thing, neither is going anywhere so everyone should accept the status quo and make their respective networks better instead of fighting. 
2	1523184220	-2	The divide is all because of bitcoin core and blockstream. 
3	1523184967	6	Still they don't control consensus they still have to go through immense resistance while implementing their own proposed solutions. Focus should be on decentralization for all not which type of decentralization you like. Also centralized shady entities are behind bch too. For one Bitmain's role in the fork , so it's not like shady people aren't on both sides of the divide. My point is these people aren't BCH OR BTC, those are still decentralized networks with consensus that may or may not agree with these shady entities' goals and strengthening that is what the focus should be. 
2	1523206745	0	BCH is only getting added to anything because Roger Ver is shelling out massive amounts of cash to keep it relevant.
3	1523207164	2	Do you even know what you're talking about? People like ver and voorhees and all those called bch shills now were the only people fighting for bitcoin when it went down. Noone denies this, even though I absolutely agree he's an idiot. Malicious? I will disagree mate.And you're downright dumb if you think Newegg Microsoft and bitpay added bch along with btc and no other coin because Roger ver paid them money. Bch has plenty ty of hash power and number of nodes right now. Don't understand how these are not two versions of bitcoin, and the world does see it as such. 
4	1523207348	0	I love the idea that idiots think Roger Ver is a super hero or advocate for the community.He was in the room when the Mt.Gox bullshit went down, he is a scammer like the rest of them.
1	1523204125	2	Bitcoin (Cash) is bitcoin and as such you're delusional if you think it's going away. Bcore on the other hand has nothing backing it except a private unprofitable business called Blockstream. Bitcoin (Cash) has the backing of billionaires, developers, bitcoin.com, bitmain, @bitcoin and more. Adoption is growing at a phenominal rate and it is I believe already accepted by more businesses than Blockstream's bcore coin.
2	1523206715	-1	The way you guys speak in such canned responses makes me think you're paid to do this. I hope the pennies that Roger Ver is throwing you is worth it.

3	1523210984	1	Lol no that's not the name, bcash is actually the name od a zcash fork. You just call it bcash because you feel threatened by it. Be honest with yourself.
2	1523178408	-9	Bcash is mostly just a word used because it triggers people that support the scam cryptocurrency since they want to play pretend that bcash is the real Bitcoin. They have tried several times to cause "the flippening" which crashed the entire market since everything is linked to BTC, thus making many people even outside of the BTC community dislike them. The word only became popular because Roger Ver flipped out at people for using the word.
3	1523179497	4	Keep [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting). Out here in the uncensored world, it's not terribly convincing.
4	1523179511	4	**Gaslighting**Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

8	1523195883	-2	That 100 million coin « bitcoin » will be called bitcoin core also.Just because they have fully control it, made radical change on the original design already (just as radical as 100million coin IMO).
