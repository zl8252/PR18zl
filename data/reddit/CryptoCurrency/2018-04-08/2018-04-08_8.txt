0	1523189761	11	I doubt that 500 votes will change anything. But still signed up. Good luck guys.
1	1523191448	2	It's just a milestone. After 500 there will be next milestone like 1000. We've just started.
1	1523192565	1	1m didnt change a thing on different topics, so petition wont do a thing here either. A stronger caliber is required, like an ally inside who for sure gonna screw us over later. So...The only how i see it, is to push to change from 'democracy' to liquid democracy. Much easier to convince other ppl to follow. 
1	1523204866	1	Name 1 thing change.org has actually changed
0	1523192854	10	Doesnt this bring basically every trader hugely in debt? What will happen? People just not paying taxes? 
1	1523209045	1	No. People misunderstand this tax law. Yes you have to pay tax on every sell of crypto but that only affect direct sells. NOT trades that were made on an exchange. This tax need to be pays by the exchange.So basically this tax interpretation is horrible for exchanges but ordinary people should be fine.
2	1523209351	1	And if you trade fiat? Like BTC/USD?
3	1523210362	1	Then you have to pay capital gains tax.
2	1523211106	1	yeah, no...

1	1523192695	1	Im sure it will. Not many have balls to embrace the pain of change
0	1523199681	3	>Dont pay taxes, use monero & exchanges without kyc + vpn>If you have larger ammounts get out of the country, fucking poland is surrounded by countries with similar economies... hell maybe you can even live cheaper

0	1523204792	2	Reminder Poland official authorities were caught bribing famous youtubers and other social media influencers to undermine cryptos just weeks ago
0	1523200907	1	Signed!
0	1523208001	1	why would people be worried about transactions. there are a lot of anonymous exchanges
0	1523197416	-1	It's hilarious how you plebs have been conditioned into thinking democracy works.
