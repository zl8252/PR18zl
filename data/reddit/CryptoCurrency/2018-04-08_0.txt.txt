0	1523169262	139	It's funny how the government/RBI says they're out to protect the consumers, while we sit and watch 7000 Crore scams go by every year and our taxes hiked. 
1	1523176066	56	Yeh gorment bik gayi hai BC...
2	1523182945	27	Lol for a second I thought this was /r/india
3	1523196392	3	Those idiots at /r/india will hate Modi for ~~everything~~ this, then vote for congress, and when congress does the same thing, they'll blame congress and vote for Modi.Rinse and repeat.
4	1523203910	1	Never seen a more censored sub than /r/India. India needs a more than a healthy dose of critical thinking and a strong infusion of skepticism towards the government. 
5	1523205685	1	I gave up on that sub a while ago.  I'd advice everyone to avoid that place, It's moderated by a bunch of people who have literally nothing going on in their lives other than censoring a fucking internet forum and pushing agendas. It's kinda sad, tbh. I sincerely hope that no one ends up like them,
6	1523208564	0	It's a good thing that I was banned from r/india.
2	1523177676	19	Bc rbi is supposed to be autonomous but we know that it's not ..i mean demonetisation was such a scam ffs
2	1523197749	2	Translation - "This government is sold out ****"
1	1523184105	10	Blockchains are humanity's first incorruptible system. Those who vehemently deny this, especially to willing consumers, speaks loudly
2	1523184693	5	Pump and Dump. Pump and Dump. Pump and Dump............
3	1523186028	7	That is not corruption that is manipulation... Which every single financial asset is susceptible to. Usually by governments 
4	1523187047	1	That makes sense. What about scammy ICOs for example which claims to have a limited supply of coins but in reality keeps pumping more and more coins to the supply?
5	1523192607	1	Then those ICOs in question are potentially corruptable and if the code is posted it is going to be found out. If it is not, then one has to trust them and accept the risk of something being corruptable in such ways.
5	1523197284	1	Try to understand the sheer fallacy of your argument. For an analogy, tell me how 'because its used for crime' is a valid argument against the dollar? For another, if hitler endorsed sun rising from the east, does it mean sun rising from the east is suddenly a bad thing?
1	1523210778	1	I didn’t know this sub had so many indians.
1	1523193883	-6	so cause there are other scams they should let people get scammed by cryptos also? great logic
2	1523194563	1	If you get scammed by cryptos that's your own fault. Just because there are credit card and debit card scams by people who ask PIN on the phone does it mean banks should ban all cards? 
3	1523196575	-1	wtf
4	1523197327	1	what? you got something to say or will you just keep getting astonished at how the world works?
5	1523197572	-1	yeah i have said it already, you can read it again   take as much time as you need
4	1523197970	0	good argument
5	1523201277	1	yes better than yours, by your logic if you get raped its your own fault also, just say no and you'll be fine
6	1523201951	3	Look at the number of downvotes you have received and try and understand you are wrong in your statements. If you still feel you are right, please go ahead and get scammed some more. 
7	1523204040	0	i just have the guts to speak the truth, nothing more
8	1523204220	3	Cool man. You're smarter than everyone. Cheers. 
9	1523204357	0	well luckily upvotes dont determine the truth
6	1523201821	2	I want to tell you how stupid you are, but I have no frame of reference thay can match your stupidity. You are sperm that should have been flushed down the toilet.If you are stupid enough to fall into scam why should other smart people have to suffer? They have brains to not get trapped.Please. Stay away from cryptos. In fact stay away from money also. You need to trade in cows and potatoes. I think you'll still get scammed 
7	1523204262	0	you must be very smart then, i think its good. but yeah in my stupidity i dont condone rape, so i think here is where our ways in life go in different directions
8	1523204371	2	I never brought up a random and completely unrelated topic like rape in a discussion about Cryptocurrencies. That shows how smart I am. 
9	1523207768	1	but that is what you are saying, you want rape to be legal
0	1523173318	20	I urge my cryptocurrency family to sign that petition.
0	1523166593	27	This is the attitude guys!
0	1523180063	14	It's good to see that people are standing up to the RBI but will this make a difference?
1	1523183001	7	No. This govt doesnt listen. 
2	1523183535	1	That's sad.
1	1523181251	1	Doubtful. Let's see..
1	1523188257	1	Sadly it won't. 
1	1523197802	1	difference in what? Whats the problem? What is so unexpected about this move I dont get it. Were you always expecting govt and banks to comply with something that will absolutely and irrevoccably take control out of their hands?
1	1523183023	0	Nope. Unless we start donating all profits to BJP via electoral bonds
0	1523169088	74	This government is anti-poor and anti-lower classes. Demonetisation created an havoc amongst the poor and they were the ones who suffered the most. People fucking died in queues just to get their own hard earned moneys. The rich got away easily by converting their cash into gold or depositing into multiple accounts using agents. Even here, the rich whales would be able to manage their cryptos by setting up accounts elsewhere in the world simply because it's possible for them. Middle and lower level crypto guys like me are fucked. We can't create bank accounts outside India. The only way is localbitcoin but it's risky and the prices are higher. I am going to cold store my cryptos and wait for things to improve. Also hoping people to find other legal ways to trade cryptos for INRs.  P.S Fuck this government.  
1	1523171744	15	Sincerely, good luck to you guys
1	1523173370	10	Seriously, that's pretty fucked.
1	1523177778	4	Fuck governments in general my friend.^at ^least ^that ^was ^the ^objective ^until ^the ^new ^wave ^of ^shills ^and ^suits ^took ^the ^spotlight
1	1523172399	1	The Fed is the root 
1	1523197387	1	Just buy and sell OTC among friends. Thats what it was always about. Use it for what it's meant. They can't stop you from using btc thats what it was meant for.
1	1523208418	1	Yeah.  Humanity will move forward and evolve ,and not gobackwards no matter how it looks at the time, there is always resistance to evolution or revolution, but resistance to that will step aside, it has no choice because evolution, expansion is bigger than 'fear of it'. I like your idea of keeping it in cold storage, things may indeed improve. Good luck.P.S i think all these boundaries between countries will also change and evolve into a more global citizenry so that evolution of mind and technology need not be limited by politicians, borders and languages and cultures but instead supported by variety.Unity in diversity
2	1523211119	1	Amen to that.
1	1523191596	-2	Lol. And you'd vote for the Khangressi chutiya who already sold the country. I will take Modi over those cunts.
2	1523193387	1	In terms of scam both look equivalent, the 2004-09 reign of Congress was fantastic. Economically Congress has appeared to be better. Congress might not be better than BJP but it certainly wouldn't be worse
3	1523197580	1	Hows Congress not better than BJP lulz. Congress is not a neo fascist organization with reports of brutal violence from its grassroot volunteer cadre army almost every week. Seriously,. the level of violence our main party's volunteers use on civilians in broad daylight with full public and govt support, its unmatched by even ISIS. Not even a long time ago, BJP's cadres have smashed babies' heads against walls just because they were muslim in the run up to 2014 elections. BJP's members use the most inhumane methods just to murder muslims and lower castes including putting **burning tyres across babies' heads** during the frequent riots that they cause almost every day now. These things are all on video with BJP's members on camera.This is the government leading the country, worse than the worst genocidal governments of 20th century, and you say it's not worse than Congress lol
4	1523211284	1	90% percent of the media is bought by them. They run the show. Normal guy who just watches news is brainwashed into thinking that the majority is in danger. This is pre-rawanda period. Things are scary indeed. Congress and BJP are equally corrupt but BJP is pure evil.
3	1523196853	0	> 2004-09 reign of Congress was fantastic.Ahahahaha, yeah, the time when everything was great in the world *period* economically. If you use the worldwide economic boom to make Khangress look good, then every govt looks good. Anyway, Congress has scammed and fleeced our people 10x more than BJP or Modi. And they sold our country to NGOs and other interest groups all over the world. The Attorney General of India from the Congress era of 2009-14 was taking payments in her fake company from NGOs and interest groups from all countries all over the world and defending known terrorists for them. Our top lawyer was working against the interest of our country for money. That is the level of complete scumbaggery I expect from that Raul Ghandy (his real last name, look it up) and his entire party of corrupt cunts.Edit: [Proof](https://www.firstpost.com/india/ex-asg-indira-jaisings-ngo-suspended-for-6-months-for-alleged-fcra-violation-2811714.html) of that woman's corruption. She needs to be jailed for taking money to defend known terrorists, the bitch.Here's the [numbers](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DaKvWUwX4AAiFHg.jpg). A second [source](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/indira-jaising-ngos-fcra-licence-cancelled-4414280/) of that woman's corruption and how she sold the country during the Congress era. Let me make this clear that this woman was the Attorney General of India during the second term of the Congress party, the party which the above poster is defending. He is defending corruption at the highest level whilst claiming that the current govt is as corrupt.Edit 2: INC shills out in force. 
4	1523198213	6	From what I have noticed in my daily life, things have only gotten worse in the last 4 years
5	1523198280	0	Yeah, shit's gotten worse everywhere mate. It has nothing to do with the BJP. Open your eyes and ears to news from the rest of the world.
6	1523199123	2	Government induced communal violence in part of it? Lol
7	1523199742	0	Govt has not induced anything any violence in India. People choose to do things themselves. Look at the US, there's fuck loads of communal violence there too and it is fueled by the govt, in part. Even in Europe, things are close to the lid. Seriously, you have such a narrow view and more complaints about the Indian govt and Modi have repeatedly, if you paid any attention ever, chastised people who are engaging in violence whereas in the US Donald Trump is not even trying to chastise any such violence, both by individuals or by police authorities on people. You pay zero attention to the govt and people in charge and 100% attention to the media which has been working hand-in-glove with the INC even before Modi and his party took the oath. 
8	1523200575	2	You had me in the beginning, but when you claimed that Congress is controlling media I literally chuckled.Rahul Gandhi was depicted as immature and Chhota Bheem watching maniac, which continues till now even though his newer interviews are pretty mature.JNU's bharat ke tukde honge video was doctored and media portrayed them as enemies of country, but when the truth was revealed there was barely an article.Arvind Kejriwal had multiple accusations against him when he became CM, most of them were wrong, the only source for him to speak anything is Twitter. The LG denies every single positive reform for Delhi, he was appointed by BJP, I have never seen such huge involvement of central government in Delhi. Modi's degree fiasco was a perfectly valid question, the original certificate was printed in a font which was invented after Modi passes out of his college, it was hushed down by the media.
9	1523203188	1	> JNU's bharat ke tukde honge video was doctoredYeah, right. That was *doctored*. JNU's been the bastion of Breaking India elements for the last 15-20 years. > Modi's degree fiasco was a perfectly valid questionBut, JNU students whilst taking our taxpayer money are shouting "India we will tear you apart" slogans is doctored? You are fairly biased and its obvious.
4	1523197753	0	Yes 2006-2009 the golden period of world economy.Idiot
5	1523197869	2	Well, considering that the first shots fired in the global economy were in 2008 crunch, yes, between 2004 and 2008, it was really good. And even then, the credit tightness only effected India from 2009. 
6	1523207528	1	Didn't even affect India then. Go get a clue. 
7	1523207963	1	Wow, you have the worst responses. Must be nice being a troll bot.
2	1523209254	1	I was a Modi supporter until late 2014, but after seeing his antics, I realized, 'better get looted by a foreigner(Italian Waitress) than getting back-stabbed by a pretender.
0	1523187351	9	India showing their off their old protocol PoC (Proof of Corruption)
1	1523196519	1	Learned from the best (i.e. the Brits)
2	1523209017	1	haha
0	1523173811	31	Fuck this government. Couldn't put a single corrupt politician behind bars for legit scams, can't arrest bank loan defaulters who took millions -- but coming after the middle class and small investors who want to invest their money knowing the risks!
1	1523189208	13	I thought you were talking about America for a second.
2	1523191272	10	I thought he was talking about basically every country in the world. 
2	1523208781	2	Modi loves to follow America's example of capitalism even if it means screwing midlle class and lower income people,. only making the rich , richer
0	1523192575	5	Indians, Goodluck! The power of the people!!!
0	1523193471	6	Some senior dude from RBI lost his money in the crash of 2018, it seems
0	1523184491	6	In India, the government is now very tough about crypto-currencies.I want to wish good luck to our colleagues from India.
0	1523189586	2	Few hundred milion people should be enough.
0	1523191892	2	If they wanted to ban why did they allow in the first place? RBI wants people to exit now in this bear market when they cannot get back anything near to their original investment!
0	1523201259	2	Waiting for it to be unbanned after the Indian banks have bought in.
0	1523201518	1	Life finds a wayTerdbrain control freaks still do not get itSad
0	1523187751	-4	We all know crypto is ponzi no need for ban
