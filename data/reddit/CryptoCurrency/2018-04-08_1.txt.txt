Submission title: So no one else finds it a bit odd that Verge is actually going up in price in a bear market, after a hack attack, after being outed for paying McAfee to promote it, and after the 1 developer begged for money from his own community to allegedly help pay his taxes?

4	1523203180	6	Vergeconnect
4	1523202850	3	ohhh nooo, it's a scammmmm
4	1523210669	-1	Fuck!!! Stop saying this god damn wasssuppop bitconnect shit. Seriously is the most annoying thing ever.  It’s clear it’s from the band of 2017s most annoying bag holding, quick riches, YouTube watching  noob selection.
3	1523203229	13	***VERGECONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECT***
2	1523206079	11	What's the scam exactly? Verge didn't even have an ico or a premine. Which is why they need money from the community to get into partnerships. You can't say the same for your other Whitepaper coins that don't even have a product only millions in the bank
3	1523208509	6	"they need money from the community to get into partnerships"you have to be a special kind of delusional idiot with huge bags of this shit to just accept it as normal that a big company would ask for money to start a "partnership" xD delusional
4	1523208920	-2	You're paranoid. If you think verge dev can just pull scam. He is known even his passport is circulating around. How do you invision this scam happening? One day verge no longer exist and dev and the whole team is on the run? Be real 
5	1523210932	1	The only thing making me even semi hesitant as to xvg being 100% scam is the fact that the dev is incompetent. I would like to think he is capable of pulling off a scam but he has shit the bed everywhere else so maybe he couldnt do it.
6	1523211078	1	You're the kind of person who screams at sports players on TV as if you can do better. Verge dev is more competitent than you and many more d crypto envelopes who contribute to projects whether they have experience in crypto or not. Verge dev has been doing this for years he knows what he's doing. He has built the product and is managing it pretty well without big PR despite the hate. But at the end of the day people make mistakes. Obviously hates are watching everything he commits on github and they will find mistakes but that's actually helping the project so hopefully that'll keep going 
7	1523211150	1	Yea I am actually one of those people.
5	1523210772	0	im rly feeling for you man. honestly. you must have bought deep into that shitcoin. that announcement will be the biggest "sell the news" event in crypto history. rip and keep telling yourself that verge hasnt raised 20 red flags over the last months
2	1523210622	1	Carlos really is the gift that keeps on giving.
1	1523204393	13	“The crypto market is a device for transferring money from the stupid to the scammer.” - Warren Buffet
2	1523205472	-4	He actually said that?
3	1523205660	12	> He actually said that?Yes, source? - my ass.
4	1523208356	4	Where do I buy this sauce?
5	1523210047	1	You can make it pretty easily yourself
3	1523206032	3	No, he has a similar famous quote about how the stock market is a tool to shift money the impatient to the patient
1	1523200248	4	It’s exactly the definition of a shitcoin ran by scammer(s)
1	1523203077	1	[removed]
1	1523207565	1	It's a necro scam coin, every time it does it comes back and rescams a new group of newbs all to eager to part with their money to be part of the ..... Wait for it...... Part of the.... "Verge Fam". 
1	1523204680	1	It's a shitty scam coin. 
1	1523193959	-8	Same difference. ;-)
2	1523197331	35	Not same difference. One is fraudulent, the other isnt - its just shit (but honest).
3	1523198029	7	At first it was a run-of-the-mill shitcoin. Then it was hacked and turbo-mined while news of a major partnership came out. Then there's the McAfee involvement. I guess you could say Verge has earned it's scamcoin badge.
4	1523198617	4	Oh I fully agree that Verge is scamcoin, I was merely pointing out that shitcoins are not scamcoins as one involves deception and the other doesnt :)I also agree that shitcoins can turn into scamcoins with the introduction of deception.
5	1523207529	3	*When shitcoins become scamcoins* on the next Geraldo
3	1523209606	1	Hmm... I see your point.
2	1523200756	11	While all scam coins are shit coins, not all shit coins are scam coins. They’re just shit
3	1523209348	1	Ha!
1	1523203656	0	Sooo... I shouldn't have any?:(
1	1523210517	0	First of all, you’re giving way too much credit to the dev team. They aren’t savvy enough to plan and pull of some Italian Job heist.Second, what scams have they pulled so far? Shitty marketing and communication and delayed promises, with hyped up expectations. Yes. But they have had numerous chances to exit scam and “penis” out but haven’t.Third, everyone just needs to calm their titties and wait for the announcement.
0	1523193978	79	Eventhough I think Verge is an absolute shitcoin, I seriously doubt that Sunerok really needs those donations to pay for his taxes. I think that guy has more than enough money. 
1	1523194039	60	So the extra money for announcement was just icing on the cake before he exit scams or what?
2	1523194177	38	YES
3	1523194269	11	Dang... people are dumb.
4	1523200114	11	Not to mention that after the hard fork the wallet address of those donations has changed and he can cash out without anyone noticing....if he so chooses. I know nothing of him other than his ridiculous videos and personal attacks on reddit....but he doesn't strike me as someone you want to be investing money in.
5	1523206065	3	That’s a great exit scam 1. Ask for donation2. Have someone take advantage of a known vulnerabilty3. Hard fork 4. Withdraw donations from new wallets without anyone knowing the money even moved. 
5	1523209475	1	No, he definitely doesn't, and people will find out real soon why it was such a bad idea.
5	1523203246	1	Agreed, Sherbie. Nor does he seem like someone that a major company, and game-changing partnership, would gravitate to. I do wonder how much of the price rise is 1. XVG morons, 2. people who hate XVG but are riding the price up and will dump prior to the 16th, and 3. trading bots. 
3	1523203001	0	I’m afraid you’re going to be disappointed if you think it’s going anywhere that soon. There’s still way too much money to be made.
2	1523194345	8	I think it's just to fund their scammy project, because he doesn't want to waste his own money on the project. Sunerok has been the developer of Verge for several years. If he bought $1000 worth of Verge 1.5 years ago, he would currently have over $3.5M. I'd be truly surprised if the guy isn't a millionare by now. 
3	1523194462	16	But you know how people are, they get a million, they spend 2 million, maybe he needs his bank account refilled.
4	1523207649	4	Mom's basement is getting pretty pricey. He needs more money for hotpockets. 
5	1523208484	1	Damn right, and he needs to pay her now whenever she runs down with the bedpan so he can shit while coding some new Verge hardforks without interruption. 
1	1523210741	1	He literally went on r/coinbase and [asked for a response to his support ticket because his taxes were due](https://i.redditmedia.com/lUf1JEUSoG7uwrFtz7THFzGHtBB27iLyQQmmdMGbaQY.jpg?w=431&s=a03e742a20433fab81eb5c7d3a958679).
1	1523210743	1	I think you are totally wrong, the man is a fucking moron and I have no doubt that he has tried to dodge what is owed.
1	1523206193	0	It's FUD but worse, Dumb FUD. Verge need money for partnership because they don't have millions in the bank from ICO or premine. 
1	1523206055	0	And if its so obvious, I'm pretty sure this is some kind of federal crime or something. Either way its fucking weird though and unless they are partnering with Amazon itself...
0	1523196557	44	McAfee involved, RUN..........
1	1523209748	2	Ha ha, so true... he's the seal of a shitcoin.
0	1523196117	47	You can't fix stupid lol
1	1523203950	13	People were warned about BitConnect for months.. you're right, nothing we can do.
2	1523206364	-6	Please explain to me how verge is a scam when it's a fully functional coin with open source code and no premine or ico? 
3	1523206811	7	If you don't see that it's a scam now, there is no amount of information that I could give you that would change your mind. I hope the best for your investments and good luck 
4	1523207164	-4	I did ask for an explanation how it's a scam and all you can say is that I should see what it is. Perhaps you don't have an explanation and simply repeating what someone else said baaa
5	1523209545	1	So, let's see:- Verge Subreddit is censored like the bitcoin subreddit (Do they have to hide something?)  - They proposed the big Wraith Update for years, which was basically a feature even Bitcoin had several years before (Stealth Addresses)  - [Lead Dev didn't realised he created a hard-fork by applying a fix against the recent attack](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3256693.msg33947280#msg33947280)  - [Lead Dev can't count, create half-assed fix against the recent attack](https://github.com/vergecurrency/VERGE/commit/7294e062a61f78ffb05689b562f90985463d1179)  - Verge lacks many features which a real privacy coin would have (Ring Signatures, RingCT)- [For a long time, verge leaked ip addresses](https://altcointoday.com/privacy-coin-verge-allegedly-leaking-users-ip-addresses/)and thats only the tip of the iceberg
6	1523210780	1	You're clutching at straws. You think because the developer made a mistake in the code that means verge is a scam. Belive me there are way many more mistake in code that is closed source. Atleast with verge everyone is watching what's being committed so that's helping. Bitcoin does not have a privacy option just give it up. As for the IPs, if I remember correctly that was just FUD when wraith was released and it turned out the IPs were scrambled and ip were visible by design and are still now but they're not the real IP of the transaction. 
5	1523208490	-1	Don't you follow news? And also read what OP already written.
3	1523208624	2	What do you need to know that hasn't been shared here 100 times?.. fake fundraising, fake partnerships, hack, fork, lost funds. 
4	1523208785	0	Hack fork is one thing that is fixed now. Fake fundraiser is bullshit because it's not fake unless you know something I ddont
5	1523209580	1	Thats good man. Leave out the fact that the coin does nothing. Leave out the fact that it was an ACCIDENTAL FORK LMAO. Forget that the sole developer (which makes this coin centralized... a wannabe privacy coin with every transaction visible on it's completely public blockchain is fucking centralized) has missed every deadline he set for himself.He could have actually needed donationa for his taxes, sure. But isn't it concerning the Satoshi 2.0 (as his community hails him) needs help paying his taxes? Like, sure, you could be right. He could actually use those funds to actually pay his taxes... but, that is also a point against verge. Not for.
0	1523200947	16	Partnership with the US gov. Verge pays their taxes and the IRS doesn't dome verge. Great partnership!
1	1523202172	1	LOL
0	1523196670	56	This is like the tenth post about this this week. Try using the search function.https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8af0gc/let_me_get_this_straight_about_verge/And yes, I agree entirely. But there's no reason to have twenty posts about it. If people want to be retards, not my problem.
1	1523199370	14	It is. Slightly. That market cap could be spread out in tokens that you hold. Also, no one wants scammers to get away with it. I don’t care about stupid people, I do get a little annoyed when obvious scammers get away with stuff though. 
2	1523202227	4	>  I do get a little annoyed when obvious scammers get away with stuff though.Same here. Why do mugs like me work and invest our money for the future when we could just easily scam the hordes of retards involved in crypto?
3	1523204508	-1	That’s what the scammers did haha. Smh. But, at least I don’t have to lie about it for the rest of my life. 
1	1523207131	0	Even though I agree with OP (and all those post), isn't it obvious that this is a paid chill/fud situation? The thing is; who want to see Verge down?
1	1523209733	0	I'd rather see posts like this, then another fucking WaltonChain partnership post, so I think I'll keep posting stuff like this.
2	1523209788	0	Yeah cause those are the only two possible things to post
3	1523209822	0	True
1	1523200992	-11	Check this OPs history. They are kinda a legend of exposing shit. So maybe people will listen this time.
2	1523202212	13	„Legend“ lolHe has a reputation of whining about old news that everybody already agreed on. Yes - Verge is sketchy as hell. Wouldnt touch it. Just like Bitconnect and POWH coins. People are allowed to make their own decisions. DOYR and you will be ok. No need to be Mr Knowitall Toldyouso about it. 
0	1523195203	21	The price is up because deposits are shut down. Period. 
1	1523196016	9	Care to explain?
2	1523196276	38	Sure! All the exchanges shut down Verge deposits so no one can dump their bags. This has led to people repeatedly dumping the SAME coins over and over. With the low supply and the illusion of movement and volume, noobs and moonboys are being tricked into buying the recycled bags and are holding them in hopes of a pop to 20 cents like last time. Unbeknownst to them, the bottom is going to all fall out when everything in this story comes to light. This is going to be be a HUGE fuck up in crypto. The exchanges should honestly just shut down trading. Xvg til this gets sorted out, but there is a lot of money to be made in the fees of so many transactions so don't expect that until it's court ordered pretty much. 
3	1523208518	7	WTF? there's no shutdown of deposits on binance, just checked.Sure, XVG is a shitcoin, but don't just start spreading FUD for no reason...
3	1523206938	2	From the exchange's point of view, the best thing they can do is allow people to continue trading it and collect fees.Basically shaking the last bits of change out of the coin before it implodes.
3	1523197510	2	Shutting down trading is also going to piss people off who just bought it and can't dump it as the price rises a little more
4	1523199744	-4	And who cares?
5	1523206337	4	Who cares? What if it's your money?
3	1523210663	1	Why are you talking out of your ass? Just moved some from wallet to Bittrex to Binance and no issues or stopped deposits 
3	1523208024	1	I can and have deposited xvg to Bittrex for trade since all of this going on with no interruption. 
3	1523209797	0	Ha ha, I'll go grab my popcorn when it does.
3	1523203112	-5	>All the exchanges shut down Verge deposits so no one can dump their bags.

1	1523200025	7	They were enabled again yesterday I believe.
2	1523200810	4	If that is the case, expect today to involve a dump cycle
3	1523200934	3	I hope so
1	1523209522	0	Not into xvg, so I don’t know the tech but is their project a threat to some other major project or smth? This anti verge propaganda is seriously ridiculous, people even comparing this to bitconnect.. jesus christ. 
2	1523210157	1	No it really isn't a thread to anything. It's just a bad copy/paste job and the sole dev has no fucking idea what he's doing
0	1523204392	26	I don’t hold any verge but I find it hilarious how butthurt this sub is getting that it’s doing so much better than their coins. To the point that they have to post multiple threads about the same exact thing every day.
1	1523205195	10	Yeah you’ve hit The nail on the head here. “Wait, one of the eight coins I chose isn’t doing as well as one of the 4,000 others? It must be a shit coin! Get your pitchforks /r/cryptocurrency!”Who gives a shit. Let’s just see what happens. 
2	1523205552	15	It’s also funny how they pretend that it’s just out of ‘concern for investors’, when they so clearly want to see it crash and burn.
2	1523208297	-2	"one of the 4000 coins is doing better than the 8 I have invested in? It must be a shit-coin!"    Is how you imagine people actually think? People have very real concerns with Verge, ignore them at your peril
3	1523208436	2	^ LOL, peril.
4	1523208636	0	LOL  >Who gives a shit. Let’s just see what happens    Some insightful stuff
5	1523208855	-2	You guys are so dramatic. It’s money... virtual money. It’s not like someone is holding a knife to someone’s throat. 
6	1523210319	-1	"You guys are so dramatic, it's only huge amounts of assets"   It's not a hostage situation no, you are right. You can say that about anything that isnt a hostage situation though, are hostage situations the only thing that matter to you in life? Kind of specific really. 
1	1523205721	-1	Verge is doing well with all this hate imagine when these idiots finally accept the fact that Verge is here to stay unlike their Whitepaper tokens with millions in the bank and nothing to show for it
1	1523209115	0	We'll see how well it does after the 17th.
0	1523207169	3	If you haven't read Influence, I recommend it highly.There's a great write-up in it of a doomsday cult who's comet comes and goes, and they're left on earth. Most people would expect that to wake the cult members up - but it actually caused them to double down on their craziness. Instead of deciding the comet prophecy was fake, they decided they must not have been pure enough and devoted themselves further.What I'm saying is that people who buy into a cult like Verge do very irrational things. The more obvious the scam becomes, the harder it is for them to admit they were wrong and pull away.Fascinating stuff.
1	1523208602	1	Ha ha, just like POWH3D, the developers are actually telling these idiots it's a scam, and yet they still invest... reverse phycology at its finest.
0	1523207935	3	Plot twist..OP is an investor in monero.
1	1523208369	2	Shhh... ;-)
0	1523206020	4	Can't wait for that partnership with Theranos and Herbalife.
1	1523208851	1	Ah ha ha, did you know that Carlos Matos is working with Herbalife now?
2	1523209331	2	Ahah u saw his Herbalife smart car but he's really working for them ?
3	1523209890	1	No, Herbalife is working for Carlos. ;-)
0	1523201771	6	Verge is a source of neverending drama.I adore this coin purely for the entertainment value if nothing else.
0	1523200971	8	Might as well ask why 900 people drank the poisoned kool-aid at Jonestown.  Verge is a technocult.  I'm coining that term. 
1	1523204313	5	**Technocult** sounds like a group of people hyped about techno music. I imagine sandstorm. 
2	1523208839	1	Sandstorm is not techno, its house. However, technocult should be a word to describe everyone at Detroit Electronic Music Festival.That's a technocult.
1	1523210438	2	A majority of the victims of Jonestown did not drink cyanide by choice. A lot of them were found with lethal injections in their necks and several others were shot dead trying to escape. The event is often mistaken as a mass suicide but there was clearly a huge cover-up. 
1	1523204676	2	The Cult of Vergenality

0	1523207127	2	The crypto market does not follow logic. 
1	1523208654	1	No, no it doesn't.
1	1523210642	1	does any market follow logic lol? shit even the real estate market doesn't follow any "logic".
0	1523207941	2	there are much better coins than verge
1	1523208354	1	Yep, much much much better coins.
0	1523208548	2	Does this sub need yet another fucking obvious post about this shitcoin? 
1	1523209338	0	Why yes... yes it does.
0	1523209796	2	Delusions are delusions. 
0	1523194075	5	So now I understand why it's April 17th for announcement. It's the tax day. 
1	1523196095	7	Why would they announce on tax day?  Sorry i am new to this. 
2	1523199343	4	To hype up as much as possible before he dumps it all. 
3	1523200409	5	Why wouldn't you put the announcement date a day or two afterwards to avoid the pump faltering before the date like REQ, VEN, PRL and NANO all have recently
3	1523206894	1	Dim
1	1523194277	0	Yep
0	1523202943	4	Verge purchasers are a "special" breed.
1	1523210499	1	Let's call then Vergins. 
0	1523206971	4	When you have been here for a few months, you should know better. Look at Dash for example... All the info of it being a eleborate scam is known for years (for those willing to do the research and not follow youtube shills blindly) yet it still was worth $1500 with a market cap of $12b. The same for Tron, Bitconnect, etc. There are always people stupid enough to buy into such scams.
1	1523208744	1	I couldn't believe my eyes when Dash went that high... now look at it.
1	1523210948	1	here's the thing, there's no global scale to be able to confidently indentify a coin as a "scam". It's really just opinionated and self-proclaimed by the haters, that it's a scam. There's no nailed in coffin hard evidence that its a scam whatsoever. You people don't think "deep" enough. Which is why you all lose more than you make. You only touch the surface and then quickly becone judgemental. You realize your doing the same thing right now as a Ford vs Chevy comparison right? Yet both have their own market and own use cases. Your comment is absolutely redundant and irrelevant to a realist who banks off the crypto market every day even in a bear market.
0	1523199976	3	The funny thing is that the contributions themselves are also taxable income to him too. So he could still get hammered for tax fraud if he doesn’t report this correctly.
1	1523209516	1	You're exactly right, but he won't have to worry about those until April 15 2019, so he'll just kick the can down the road until then.
0	1523196961	10	Or, *or*, the partnership is, in fact, legit, and a great one. Partner wanted to see how committed vergefam is, aka testing to see if there is demand for the coin and therefore, partner's products. Partner & Verge know that people like shitterofdestroyedcoins will shit on their decision to postpone, but it's another test to see the resolution of vergearmy. It seems like they passed with flying colours. 
1	1523197655	25	You had me at vergefam
2	1523197925	9	I'm getting downvoted bc people here have no sense of humour :(
3	1523199631	6	I think they probably just missed the sarcasm. Which says more about Verge people than you. It says that there are really people who would un-ironically use that line of logic. 
4	1523201232	3	On the contrary, I think people here dislike Verge alot. Pretty sure most of the downvotes are coming from the anti-Verge camp, upvotes from Vergins. Oh well, cryptoEdit: yeah, you're right about the upvoters missing the sarcasm. "On the contrary" isn't a right use in this case.. more of "In addition to that"
5	1523203373	2	I definitely missed the sarcasm the first time around, for pretty much the exact reason Jax states above.  Basically, I reason that there have to be actual people thinking like that because how else do you explain what’s going on.  You’d have to be seriously hooked on the Flavor-Aid to still be a supporter at this time. 
1	1523200081	7	You forgot /s 
1	1523209649	1	Oh, I see what they did... Herbalife was real smart on this one.

0	1523204762	3	Who cares. Don't get involved. 
1	1523205620	5	No, I must hate because I missed the both pumps and my Whitepaper tokens are not performing well 
1	1523209093	0	The truth must be told mac.
2	1523209372	1	The truth tells itself in this case.
0	1523207457	3	Let's just look at the top 5 coins.  Mother Bitcoin - slow as fuck, not suited for everyday transactions.  Good as a store of value and is the gold standard for Crypto.  Has suffered exploits as well.Etherium - ERC20 platform best know as a platform for shitcoins as well as some use case. Dropped massively recently.  Not suitable for everyday transactions.  Was exploited for 2 weeks straight.Ripple - Total pile of shit coin, centralized platform for banking transactions offering partnerships that can use the network, but no the coins to no value of the people actually holding the coins.  Less than half in circulation.  Owners are billionaires.  Bitcoin Cash - Insider traded Bitcoin fork.  About all I know or care to knowLitecoin - Another exploited coin.  Founder dumped entire stack at ATH, since then it has done nothing but lose value.  So there's your soft exit scam if you really want to know.Then rounding out the next ten is a collection platforms and currencies that all have questionable use cases, their own sets of unique issues, and may or may not be there.So what you should really understand is that they are all shitcoins in their own special way.  Every one of them has done something shady to get where they are and keep going.  Until you can reckon with that and understand that the space is manipulated and people are cult like about their coins you won't do well.    
1	1523208535	2	> Litecoin - Another exploited coin. Founder dumped entire stack at ATH, since then it has done nothing but lose value. So there's your soft exit scam if you really want to know.Totally agree with you here.
0	1523203244	3	I answer your question by throwing back another question:Why does girls fall in love with Justin Bieber?
1	1523204499	1	The answer to both questions: retards falling for marketing.
1	1523205917	-1	I'll answer your question with another question, why do girls fall in love with beiber but not you? 
0	1523205444	5	Its going up because people are smart enough to know1. Verge was not hacked. 2. It was a mining exploit. An exploit that has been done to Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin and monero.3. Verge dev fixed this issue within 72 hours, Faster then the coins listed above.4. The exploited coins are locked and now worthless. If anything the supply just shrunk by that much.5. The Partnership is real. And as many of you who think its fake the people with real money are going all in. That is why it keeps going up, duh!6. It is an exclusive partnership. 7. Partner is a house hold name.8. Partner has global marketing capabilities.Good Luck All. 
1	1523205857	5	I had not read that the coins were locked.  
1	1523207940	2	A household name... Yakuza?
1	1523208293	1	The partnership is real... And how do you know this? Or are you just hoping it's real?
1	1523207703	1	Delusional.
1	1523208978	0	Wow... how much are you getting paid?
0	1523199941	2	I would find it odd but then again there is no logic in this market.
0	1523198719	2	Instead of Verge invest in popcorn.
1	1523209545	1	Hey... a man could live of some popcorn.
0	1523201857	1	Yeah, it's screwed up. XVG community can be considered radical with their extreme ignorance, but not much we can do. But remember, price of an asset will eventually reflect it's true value. In this case, probably $0
0	1523203670	2	I gave up trying to understand this situation. It defies all logic. Only thing to do is watch the show. 
1	1523209172	1	It's entertaining ain't it?
0	1523200747	2	The main issue is that people still talk about it. Just ignore it and it will go away.
1	1523209367	3	Not likely, it will just get bigger and bigger.
1	1523204838	-1	Just ignore people being scammed? 
2	1523206035	1	What's the scam exactly? Verge didn't even have an ico or a premine. You can't say the same for your other Whitepaper coins that don't even have a product only millions in the bank
3	1523208266	0	From the post, the guy was just asking his followers for money for no reason. Maybe it’s not a “scam” but you can’t ignore bullshit when you see it. 
4	1523209057	1	How are they going to get money if a partnership requires it? There was no ico or premine. The only way is if they fund it out of their own holdings. Are they expected to dig into the wallets everytime they need money for verge that is a community project? I don't think so. Its not a personal investment it's going to benefit all XVG holders. Therefore XVG holders should donate if they like and remember no one forced anyone to donate
5	1523209734	1	If giving money to someone for no real purpose isn’t bullshit then idk what is 
6	1523210394	1	Except there is a purpose
7	1523211244	1	“Purpose”
0	1523198162	0	Stop posting dumb shit like this. It's literally unpredictable what is going to happen. Crypto is an unstable market and people choose their race horses.
1	1523209575	1	No thanks man, I'll post whatever I want.
0	1523205628	1	Classic maneuver - if u know it’s some bs ! Don’t fall for ir
1	1523208905	1	Yep
0	1523207142	1	It's an irrational market. The market went up several hundred percent in a month, then lost almost that entire value in the next month and a half. The players are everyone from experienced traders, to 4chan pump groups, to hoards of people who don't have a clue what a "Bitcoin" is, but they want in, because their mate in the office is getting rich from itWhat were the recent stats, over 80% of ICOs are scams? there are several thousand coins at total count, many of which don't really do anything at all.. you can mint this stuff in your basement with artificial supply caps, companies can churn out "tokens" which have no legal or financial link to the actual companies performance.. if the whole thing crashed to dust it would have minimal impact. I mean the tech behind is ground-breaking and some coins are the real thing, but all the while we're gambling our hundreds of magical internet beads, industry and business are developing their own blockchain tech, so when the revolution hits - a lot of this stuff might be redundant (with the remainder being potentially worth a lot) Yeah Verge is dodgy, but so was Bitconnect and that didn't stop people. I get that Reddit has launched a community crusade against Verge - but there's a lot of people who simply don't read this site. 
1	1523208643	1	Yeah, people have to really take a huge step back, and really look at this entire market for what it really is.
0	1523209968	1	Im gona need some chips with all that salt
1	1523210098	1	Ha ha, coming right up!
0	1523210047	1	Answer me this... are any of us in this not to gain more money?If a coin is going up, people will invest. Shitcoin or not. It’s that simple
1	1523210133	2	Yeah, good luck with that... until you can't sell your Verge because no real people want that shit.
0	1523210375	1	I think ASIC money + hype  is driving  the current price. 
0	1523210495	1	already designed my vergeconnect t shirts , asoon as it crashes and does a bitconnect im going to sell them
0	1523210773	1	Really shows how fucking retarded the vast majority of people in crypto are. This project has been nothing but red flags from the get go. Total shit/scam coin. That fucking donation to release news scam was the icing on the cake for me. AND PEOPLE FELL FOR IT!!!!!!! If you have two brain cells to rub together you can realize that is a scam immediately. In what world would that be an acceptable practice? Delusional VERGENS
0	1523210945	1	Yes. People are genuinely this dumb, I'm afraid. There's a reason BitConnect was possible.
0	1523211186	1	But Bitcoin is shitcoin too but somehow people value it. Bitcoin solves NOTING what cant be solved by top 500 coins. All crypto is just mater of psychology. People hold crypto because they have belief in it. SOme in stupid shitcoin called litecoin, some in ethereum, some in verge
0	1523199511	0	Extra hyped shitcoin for brainless. No need to worry.
0	1523206394	1	Can we make sure we upvote this at the top for as long as possible so the community can vent about how much of a piece of shit Verge is? The coin gets exploited to the tune of 100 million XVG and the price goes up over 20% when the know nothing dev finally gets the fix in place.The partnership is even funnier. The lead dev has been assuring everyone that the partnership is still on. Who would want to partner with a team who show's such little concern over their chain getting exploited. The dev wouldn't have even known what was going on if ocminer from bitcointalk didn't bring it up to him. Who would partner with such incompetence? It doesn't matter, there will be no partnership announced on the 17th, and the community will accept whatever bullshit the dev team gives them.It's going to take something catastrophic for Verge to die the death we've all been hoping for. The subreddit is a cult and their faith is only stronger now. They didn't view the exploit and the developer response as confirmation of how shitty their chain is, they flipped it around to make the dev look like a hero after being prodded by the bitcointalk thread to get the fix done. I'm guessing it will take a 51% attack or regulators stepping in to put an end to Verge.
1	1523208813	1	Yeah, little does everyone know, this big partnership he's been promising... is with Tron.
0	1523205107	-1	Your post is FUD desguised as a genuine question. Get a life an accept the fact that Verge is a fully functional crypto currency unlike a lot of Whitepaper tokens in the top 30. There was a hack but that's excepted in the software world. It's now addressed (or not for some reason if you ask a hater) . It didn't pay McAfee he promoted it before he realised he can make money of his indorsements. Verge asked the community for money for a partnership because verge didn't have an ico or a premine so the money has to come from the community unless the DEVs start eating into their own share everytime there is a partnership. The fact that the price is going up shows that's only the haters who are bothered. You're clearly exagurating the issues and whining because you hate how verge grew so quickly and you didn't have a chance to buy it, guess what this is just the begining, we'll see projects grow even quicker in the future and Verge's growth will look like nothing. Except it or stay poor forever with that whiny paranoid attitude 
1	1523209064	1	Hmm... the community seems to disagree bud... truth hurts.
2	1523209217	1	Community does not equal this /r/CryptoCurrency thread. Check the price if you need proof
3	1523209918	1	> /r/CryptoCurrencyIs the only one that matters, the rest are all just circle jerks.
4	1523210359	1	Irony or satire? 
1	1523208423	1	This could be a post from a bitconnect thread, it really could. You have blinders on, sorry
0	1523198265	1	well, it makes the bearmarket more fun tough with these projects that totally fail.
1	1523199597	-1	Yes! At least we have something to laugh about :)
0	1523204175	1	I honestly feel like if somehow Verge actually secured "the greatest partnership in crypto" I'm leaving the scene and not coming back until I have regained my sanity. I already can't imagine how it increases and think if this happened to ANY other coin. Look at Nano for example, look at IOTA. It blows my mind.
1	1523206766	1	If Verge does secure a legit partnership, then it's the kiss of death for crypto. The market should tank 50% and should take a decade to recover.
1	1523209152	1	Partnering with Herbalife is a big deal, but it won't do anything for the price.
1	1523205814	1	Iota is Whitepaper bullshit and speculation. Internet of things really what have you even used that requires iota? All of a sudden we will need iota. Bullshit. Verge is a fully functional and here right now you can't compare the two 
2	1523206072	0	Wow looks like we are playing sports teams here. First off, tell me if Verge is truly private?
0	1523205611	1	Trx and verge speaks to the idiocy of crypto investors in general. It’s okay let them crash and burn 
1	1523208917	1	Agreed
0	1523207598	1	Haha classic
0	1523207686	1	Thankyou for making a more long winded post that has been posted several times. 
1	1523208423	-1	No problem bud, and if it weren't for our long winded posts, all that would be in this sub-Reddit is WaltonChain partnership announcements... am I right?
2	1523209108	3	Nah man I don't mind news good bad or old but these kinds of posts... Why not just jack off? Same same but different.
3	1523209327	-1	It's all good, it's number 1 for a reason... the people want it.
4	1523209884	1	Nice. Number one post. Soak it in.8===DEdit: I don't hold verge or anything I'm just tired of posts about nothing.
5	1523209963	2	Not the first, and most certainly won't be the last... I'm kind of god around here bud... you should recognize.
6	1523210191	1	I think I like you now. 
0	1523209088	1	BITCONNNNECTTTTT
1	1523209293	1	The Verge shills are coming, and they are coming in waves!
0	1523200384	0	Ppl will believe anyone with  lots of $$ will say coz they believe they have $$ so they must know. Trump is an example 
1	1523209396	1	True
0	1523200623	0	Not odd at all, considering the fact that everytime good news comes out for a coin, the price usually goes down. Here we have bad news, so the price is going up. Seems backwards as fuck, but that seems pretty normal in the crypto world lately ........ sadly.
1	1523209385	1	Ha ha, I hear that.
0	1523202805	0	Because the dev is smart and tricked people into thinking that Verge is a strong coin and what happened didn't have an impact at all.
1	1523204099	-1	He's not smart, people are just ignorant idiots.
2	1523206917	1	The meaning of my sentence says it...
3	1523207237	1	Your sentence implies that this person is smart which is not true. He's a scammy piece of shit, it has nothing to do with him being smart. In fact, it's an insult for smart people. You don't have to be smart in order to exploit someone else's ignorance and retardation; however, you do have to be a massive cunt to do that. 
4	1523207437	1	Dude, it's sarcasm... I said "smart" but meant dumb, yet that he is tricking people into thinking that everything is fine.
5	1523208393	1	My bad.
6	1523208859	1	No problem man, we both got the same point so it's fine xD
0	1523205713	0	If you posted this in the verge sub you would be banned instantly 
1	1523208893	1	I wouldn't touch that shit with your dick mate, that place is pure poison.
2	1523209969	1	They all think they know better tho. I actually made.money on verge, and then gave up on it really quickly after that...sold it all and did good..then I was able to watch the shitshow from the outside. It's a sad scene over there. I'm banned from the sub for speaking truth.
3	1523210084	1	Bruh, everyone made money in 2017. You could have literally have thrown darts at fucking coins and invested in whichever ones they landed on, now, the real smart people will only survive in this market, along with the really good coins and tokens... 2017 will never happen again.
1	1523205972	1	For repeating the same information over and over and over and over and over.
0	1523198079	-3	Buy on the rumour sell on the news
1	1523209588	1	Bad news and all.
1	1523201751	-1	the worst rumor in crypto alongside what is possibly the worst news yet
0	1523203025	-3	I cant wait for token pay debit card for verge. You guys need to be happy that verge is helping crypto be more mainstream. You guys invest to get rich, we invest because we see verge as a game changer to this industry, bank with no middle man.. Cant beat it, join it. Time will tell. 
1	1523205833	1	Honest question; what makes you choose Verge over any other privacy coin and to add to that, do you understand the tech behind it?
0	1523200224	-1	Hey your right. A 1 month candlestick graph of any handful of coins and then verge will show a month dip for all those coins. But for verge its a month long pump. Hhmm? Inalready dont trust verge.
1	1523209438	1	Very easy to manipulate, and keep people locked in, I bet if any of them go to sell, no one would buy that shit.
0	1523202631	0	A coin going up during a controversy, well, that's Crypto Currency for ya.
0	1523203393	-3	Because following the crowd makes you rich right? Because listening to the news gets you gains right?  Lmao. You're all fucking sheep. You're getting gamed.
0	1523204794	-3	Lol somebody sold before it started goin up
1	1523209077	0	Ahh... ya got me.
0	1523205390	-1	He lives in his mom's basement? doesn't he have the dough for his own place after scamming the vergtards for so long?
1	1523209028	1	He can't touch the money yet, after the big Herbalife partnership announcement, he will get one last push, then exchange it all for Monero, then cash out.
1	1523205538	0	Unlike other scams on the top 30 with nothing but a white paper and 30mill in the bank, Verge didn't have an ICO or a premine so if anything the DEVs are pretty poor unless they start selling what they own.
2	1523205745	0	Of course Verge didn't have an ICO, it was a joke at first. Sunerok for sure has millions, he's been scamming the idiots buying his coin for well over a year now...
0	1523209674	-1	"Now come on, even if you jerk off to this coin"  At those words, you lost my interest.  Women do read.

1	1523203412	1	Hi bot
0	1523196886	-41	To be honest, all coins other than BTC or ETH are shitcoins. What makes verge any more of a shitcoin than something like ADA, NEO, TRX, or XMR etc. Arent we in this for the gains? $100 bucks of verge in Jan 17 was worth 900k in Dec 17. ETH was hacked, BTC was hacked, NEM had a massive hack and so did other cojns. I bought a bunch of bags of “shitcoins” under 2 cents and if any of them get my a boat who really gives a fuck lol. Dogecoin had a market cap over 2 billion and no one batted an eyelash. Either buy some bags and ride the waves or STFU
1	1523197511	14	"What makes verge any more of a shitcoin than something like ADA, NEO, TRX, or XMR etc. Arent we in this for the gains? "Thats a tough one but i'll take a crack at it, here goes:  you're fucking retarded.
2	1523197594	-8	Blow me lol. Lambo coming soon on 4/17 bitches must be a Monero fan boy or missed the lows to get in. That’s ok, I’ll sell my XVG to you when it’s over a buck hater 
3	1523198171	6	He's never going to buy your shitcoin because he isn't a fucking retard.
4	1523198228	-14	Must have bought at the ATH. Feelsbadman 
5	1523200327	5	You must have bought at all, even worse.
2	1523202824	-1	You're the naive one here, Ada is far from a shitcoin.
3	1523203724	-1	Careful with ADA...Don’t get fooled by a fancy white-paper written in Latex (where they spend 1 page on explaining a simple ratio, by selling it as “adversarial stake ratio” and disguising a uber-ridiculous simple formula into smthg that looks great because it looks like complex math)Don’t get fooled by smart sounding marketing like the fancy name given to an algorithm (“orobouros”) or the existence of a “foundation”.Don’t get fooled by the market cap of a project that has yet to deliver anything...-> Let’s see what they deliver and if their code is really “mathematically perfect”(Now let the downvotes come to me!! :-) )
1	1523196992	8	Please do some research. Thanks.
2	1523197136	-5	Research what exactly? everything I said were facts? Stop worrying about other projects and either buy or GTFO. I got my verge bags at a penny. I have 6 figures of verge . I also have 5 figures of tron that I got for a penny. They’re all shitcoins BTC is still king which is why the market tanks when BTC tanks. Move along 
3	1523197167	7	Hahahaha
3	1523203889	2	Yo congrats if you really got that shit at a penny, But you really should have sold at the ATH, because 6 figures on paper means fuck all when the devs of your literal dogecoin fork are the ones behind the 51% attack, This coin is going back in the shitter for sure. It's the greatest pump and dump of all time (shoutout to bitcoin private), and good for you if you got a piece of it, I'm not mad at all. But if you think XVG has any type of future you're completely and totally hopeless. 
4	1523209953	1	If it goes down the shitter than it’s all house money for me. I have a bunch of “shitcoins” as I stated, if one of them or multiple can net me 100k or more who cares which shit coin pops off? Lol Jesus man
3	1523197565	0	Nah I think they're perplexed as to "ETH was hacked, BTC was hacked, NEM had a massive hack and so did other cojns"
3	1523197808	1	Everything you said are not objective facts. Just because YOU think BTC and ETH are the only two legit coins doesn't make it true.  There's a lot of scams out there with undelivered promises, but that doesn't mean all coins are scams.  There certainly are other coins contributing value to the CC market.So far, from what I've seen there are only 5 coins that pass the 'definity not a scam' test.  Those are BTC, ETH, XMR, LTC, and I'm like 99% sure on Decred.  I'm sure there are other coins that I'm not aware of yet too.Most of the other coins that I like are on the 'probably not scams' list.
4	1523202060	0	Let me guess, those are the coins u invested in?Everything is a crap shoot in crypto.Probably, we'll only truly know the shitcoins when they are decoupled from Bitcoin.
4	1523197840	-2	Monero fan boy in the wild lol
1	1523196965	7	You obviously have no idea what your talking about.
1	1523203130	3	Man, these people need to chill. Either you believe in the project or you don’t. No need to bash and spread fud. 
2	1523203923	-1	You do know this is literally a rebranded dogecoin fork, right? 
3	1523208043	1	Lol do your research. 
3	1523209843	1	You do know that if your favorite coin started off or still is an ERC 20 coin it’s a shit coin right?
