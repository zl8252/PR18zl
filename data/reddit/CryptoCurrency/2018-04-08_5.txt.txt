1	1523183088	4	greed is a powerful emotion
2	1523191411	3	Greed for the lack of a better word is good.
1	1523177664	1	The market and the buyers that matter aren't though. 
0	1523154977	26	Even decentralized trust is not the full story; it's just means to an end, the latter being *peaceful consensus*.
1	1523160926	4	Ah, i like that... peaceful consensus is a great way to describe it.
2	1523164676	4	And ICOs. Thousands of them.
3	1523189032	1	And millions more 'investors', crying silently in corners
2	1523171978	1	unfortunately most people here don't give a shit about that and want to make $$$, so, no dice
1	1523181998	1	Still waiting for a blockchain election trial.

0	1523162703	16	Except without a valid cryptocurrencies to keep incentives aligned, you don't have a secure chain. Also none of the non cryptocurrency backed blockchain projects are decentralized ATM... (Barely any cryptocurrencies is either for that matter)
1	1523191451	2	Exactly. Blockchains cannot work without a reward. Blockchains can implement a currency + other features ( like Ethereum ), but they cannot be features without a currency.Anytime you hear an expert saying that he doesn't believe in cryptocurrency but 'blockchain technology' is great, you know it's time to change the channel.
1	1523177712	0	cc?
2	1523177996	1	Shorter than cryptocurrencies. I'll edit
0	1523177563	4	How are you going to pay for decentralized trust? IMO the "currency" part is the incentive system for said decentralized trust to emerge. Which is why I have hard time trusting autonomous systems (they would inevitably centralize one way or another).Do agree that the blockchain's main innovation is security -though- than actually creating an alternative monetary system (which may too happen, but it seems to be a much more long term goal)
0	1523164029	4	let's not lose sight. let's just lose money
1	1523208452	1	That is one game I’m really winning at 
0	1523172854	2	Nailed it 👍
0	1523177869	2	Trust is yet to be established
0	1523176987	4	What decentralized trust? *WHEREZ MUH RIPPLEZ! RIPPLEZ TO DA MOON!!!*  
1	1523177725	1	lol
0	1523183165	1	Once ppl understand what you can build on second layer stuff like the EVM and lightning, as well as sidechains, then we will see a bull market like no other. Information asymmetry.
0	1523188004	1	I agree with that statement, blockchain is about removing intermediaries. Its hard to lose sight of that vision, especially as the legacy intermediaries start taking over the space to retain relevance. 
0	1523197447	1	Bitmain owns all non asic resistant coins like bitcoin bch ethereum etc. Not decentralized sry.
0	1523209418	1	> That addiction has paved the way for the political manipulation of our democracy on a scale that we have never seen before.Some facts for this bold statement? It's very easy to drop a bomb like that into an article, just so long as there's stats to back it up.We've had radio for over 100 years, TV for almost 100 years, newspaper distribution on a massive scale for 200 years.All of these have and are still being used for political manipulation, perhaps not at the speed of the internet, but nonetheless, still very much a viable method of manipulation. As for the scale of these technologies vs. that of the internet? That would require a fair bit of research to determine.As such, any other information in this article I will discard as being untrustworthy. 
0	1523173462	-2	blockchain was meant for currencies. not any of this other hype train bs. you are the one losing sight. 
1	1523178034	2	What you just said, is like saying that the internet was made for academia only. Blockchain was invented for the purpose of a currency indeed.  However, it is also a new platform for IT to develop on. This allows us to reevaluate existing solutions to problems, which may be inferior to a blockchain solution + solve problems that we were unable to solve before. Blockchain is not made to be the perfect solution for all your problems, but it does definitely shake up some industries. 
2	1523178268	1	Every application of blockchain outside of cryptocurrency that I can think of requires centralization (unless you go ahead and name one), and the whole point is supposed to be decentralization I don't see the reason for compromises. The blockchain needs to inefficient for the security protocol to retain integrity. It makes less sense than years of optimized database solutions. Businesses don't need the trust fac
3	1523179543	1	Businesses might not, but consumers do! I think websites as airbnb and uber already shows that consumers want to move away from using big companies, however that produced new big companies. Blockchain can do what airbnb and uber does, without a centralized authority taking all your data. I am also working on a few projects myself, that I can't share, but other projects that really like are: Sia for decentralized storage and multiple start ups trying to become a decentralized ticketmaster. Of course there are many more, but I am not going to do the research for you ;)
3	1523189511	1	Im genuinely interested, lets go with Supply Chain, how is the application of block-chain to that concept centralized?Im not interested in hearing about current implementations, because [currency isnt very well decentralized yet](https://arewedecentralizedyet.com/), I just mean the actual theoretical best case scenario?
1	1523177939	0	So its not also a perfect use-case for something like land registries for example ?
0	1523160532	-2	But /r/bitcoin tells me that Bitcoin is the only crypto I'll ever need and that any other altcoins are shitcoins irrespective of what they do. Are you telling me they're full of shit?
1	1523162757	2	No seems like a good advice generally with maybe a couple exceptions.
2	1523164575	-5	[removed]
3	1523165867	9	1. The community of bitcoin can be considered cancerous because it's usually a meritocracy (if you don't contribute, you're not that useful) and yeah feelings are not often people's priority. But cancerous appearance is also a reflection of crypto as a whole. It often appears cancerous  since only loudest voices are heard. However if you look passed Reddit for example or Twitter and go to where innovation happens (github repos and slack channels and not necessarily bitcoin ones but all other OSS projects building on it), it is much friendlier (and got way less shitty memes).2. Not sure why you think it's outdated tech. Lots of actual blockchain innovation comes from bitcoin Dev research (mast, schnorr, scriptless script, ct, bullet proof, segwit, drivechains etc..) and is often added to altcoins. They are pretty conservative in what is actually added to the protocol but that's because it requires a high level of technical and community consensus and safety/security is prioritised over adding the latest unproven/untested  tech.3. A subreddit has nothing to do with a coin especially when none of the actual bitcoins Devs are mods.. the fact you think so reflects more on you than on bitcoin. Most of the actual tech discussion happens on github and opened mailing lists and is of pretty high quality. Also most of crypto subreddit are goddamn cancer a lot of the time including this one. What you consider censorship is often moderation since everyone and their grandma try to shil something in crypto subs.4. No development team was hijacked. In fact lots of the early Devs  (2010/2011 etc) apert from the loudest ones (aka Gavin/Mike/Jeff)  are still working on the project. There's a pretty balanced and diverse list of contributors as well (more than any other crypto project for that matter). And it's even better than back  <= 2013 since now there's truly no leaders.5. Again contributors are  the most competent out there. A lot of academics working on it, lots of blockchain improvements actually done by bitcoin Devs etc..  check the github repo and the actual code, you'll see the code quality is pretty great. You can easily find credentials and experience of most of the bitcoin contributors and researchers and see they actually know their shit (from fixing bug in open SSL, rewriting an ecsda curve which is now widely used in most crypto projects, being part of Linux kernel Dev etc....)Edit: also want to dispell this idea of 'development team'. Bitcoin core contributors are mostly volunteers and don't have team leads and such. They can also contribute to other projects or a contributor might only contribute once. It's quite decentralised and anybody can contribute and get their changes peer reviewed/tested and merged if it meets the standards.> Slow growth due to marketcapNot sure what that even means. If you mean that the speculative bubble of last year slowed its growth I can agree somewhat since it was a distraction for most project and development and encouraged everyone and their taxi drivers to launch useless ICOs, diverting mind share away from bitcoin and other useful projects to shit tokens.Tbh your reaction tells me that you're pretty cancerous and has some serious hate going on. But that's fine, bitcoin will still be bitcoin despite your current ignorance!Good luck tho on whatever project you are into, would love to see the github repos of those so I can check them out, I'm sure it will be an outstanding display of diverse contributors, open governance process and innovation. Always opened to learning!
4	1523178005	1	I want to ask you; who is theymos? is he a dev? 
5	1523178263	1	I think he does have tech background and was involved in  bitcointalk at the very  beginning  (had threads with satoshi) but I don't think he has contributed to the bitcoin repo in years if ever. Afaik He is owner of bitcointalk ATM and head mod of r/bitcoin. Also maintainer of bitcoin.org?Basically someone with too many admin position IMO even if he is an OG.
6	1523179681	1	I don't get how he came to come in possession of r/bitcoin. And yes he is the owner of bitcointalk as it was given to him by satoshi if I remember, I still dont get how he went from that to owning most btc channels. Thanks for the help nonetheless
7	1523180304	0	Well he was just very very involved at the beginning and willing to spend quite a lot of his own time and money and believed in the tech 100%. It was quite rare at the time. And honestly I'm not sure who would do the job better either (although don't think he does any of the modding himself on r/bitcoin). At least theymos seems to be pro bitcoin ATM and until now hasn't been bought into pushing for any of the other altcoins so there's that... But in the end my opinion is either there needs to be no moderation whatsoever and people need to accept that it will be a complete shitshow full of vote manipulation and altcoin shilling, or there should be extremely strict rules in term of content maybe only related to mailing list or github issues/PR/BIPs idk. Or maybe it shouldn't even exist. Same issue with bitcoin.org which could also be hijacked/bought eventually and currently 1 or 2 people owning it are single point of failures.
8	1523185572	1	No my opinion is that communication channels shouldn't be so centralized anyway. Every community should have their own community channels which are censored or not censored acc to consensus in their respective circles. r/bitcoin censoring conversation should *sbsolutely* not be a root cause for fork of goddamn bitcoin, a p2p world currency. It's downright ridiculous if you ask me, if not for anything than just the language; no way an accurate representation of the majority of the btc community even understands English lol (asia is a dominant player noone speaks english outside cities in most asian countries) and yet the English speaking part holds the top brass and their decisions go down the chain.Right now because of the world being just homogenized America, everyone logs on to the same sites and forums everyone else is as basically all the internet services infrastructure is monopolized in a very small area. That's what I believe is a bigger problem and something we need to break free of.Decentralization needs to happen down up not top down and all these issues will be solved. Right now people come to btc by finding these channels, so no way who has no direct pathway to these channels will ever join the conversation. So its basically an echo chamber either way right now. 
4	1523175003	0	Good post. Alt coins are all for the most part shitcoins
4	1523166749	-1	> Tbh your reaction tells me that you're pretty cancerous and has some serious hate going on. But that's fine, bitcoin will still be bitcoin despite your current ignorance!It's literally lead devs banning people for frivolous reasons on the r/bitcoin sub. Also the dev team gets most of its funding from banks and other investors with an agenda. As for the slow growth, it has a massive market cap, how fast do you think it will grow? 99% of people are here for the money. Investing solely in bitcoin will give a growth rate magnitudes smaller than a strongly diversified altcoin portfolio. 
5	1523178165	2	>Also the dev team gets most of its funding from banks and other investors with an agenda. Not sure if you're imagining the btc dev team to be like a room full of nerds somewhere in the world, but most devs are anonymous. Lol they don't get their dfunding from banks, I think you talking about blockstream which may have a hold on communication channels but not consensus. the dev team is still massively decentralized to be said any one generalized thing about and not sound utterly stupid
5	1523167608	4	I mean none of this is true really. What lead Dev is banning people? Name one? Dev team doesn't get most of its funding from banks. Some Devs do work at a company (blockstream) which had AXA strategic ventures (which is VC arm or the insurer) as an investor (among other investor). Those Devs contribute to a minority of total commits and only 1 of them has merging rights (and never abused that to bypass peer review process). Also most those Devs have been contributing to bitcoin before it got funding and their contract include closes which prevents company to tell them what to do regarding bitcoin protocol. Blockstream has done pretty cool stuff over the years as well lile bitcoin satellite or their own LN client (although imo not as good as LND's), they've also funded research and their Devs and researchers are responsible for some cool papers (including scriptless scripts and CTs - plenty others).Regardless their ideas are also subjected to same standard every other contributor is subjected to.  You have other companies (like MIT, chain code lab) that employ bitcoin contributors and account for more commits than blockstream does. Bitmain also gave some grants to a Dev, so does coinbase etc so quite a diverse source of findings (lots of others don't get any funding at all). Do point me to a crypto project with more diverse group of developers and a transparent governance mechanism, I'm genuinely interested. Regarding returns in fiat then for sure last year (unless you invested in the wrong multiple alts that went to shit) would have given a much better ROI than purely holding bitcoin. Doesn't mean it will be true in the future tho and doesn't mean a thing if you didn't cash out as well. But anybody with eyes can see lots of those projects have not enough users or value props to justify the market caps they achieved in Jan or last June and a lot of alt investors also would have faired better in buying bitcoin than whatever alt flavor of the months was shilled here.Bitcoin is the safest bet atm in CCs but of course probably won't give you the highest return short term. Personally I love to grow my bitcoin stack and invest accordingly in some alts. However I'm not delusional enough to think most of those coins will be anywhere close to where they've been at or currently are at in the next couple years and I know a lot of them will die like a lot of others did before. Also not delusional enough to think alts got anywhere close to the amount of research and development (general mindshare) and more importantly security that Bitcoin has.
6	1523178046	1	Isn't bitcoin crazy resource heavy and also takes forever to approve a transaction? 
7	1523179216	1	Bitcoin full node software is actually not crazy resource heavy and syncs up pretty fast despite the long history of the bitcoin blockchain.If you're talking about PoW then yes it uses lots of electricity to secure the network atm since hashrate are follows the price like for all PoW backed blockchains. Which is great because it also means it's very expensive to attack.Regarding transaction approval time im not sure if you mean rhe average block time (10mn) or if you mean average confirmation time of a tx (which right now since low usage/fees usually confirms in 1 block).Regarding the block time, 10mn gives you good trade off between security and orphan rate. Shorter like litecoin chose to do (2.5mn) means each confirmation has less finality and orphan rates are higher (means in the end greater mining centralisation).In short the block time is IMO fine as it is and guarantees a quite strong finality on first confirmation. Shorter block times comes with trade offs that would risk making the chain  less secure and censorship resistant. I'm not aware of any BIPs that involve changing the block time but if it's backed by strong evidence it wouldn't affect the chain negatively I'd love to see one (although since it will need a hard fork/ won't be backwards compatible I doubt it would have a chance to be adopted).Found this stack exchange on this:https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/1864
8	1523179618	1	Thanks, what I mean is when you buy a hotdog with bitcoin, how long does the transaction take to be processed? 
9	1523179883	1	It depends, if the merchant accepts 0conf then it would take a couple seconds but the merchant doesn't have same assurance of the finality of the transaction (but given value of a hot dog tx it probably doesn't matter for the merchant). In this particular scenario it seems very improbable someone would try to double spend the 0conf.Alternatively this is also why people are getting excited about the Lightning network since it allows instant transaction - 1. Possibly faster than 0conf and 2. Higher finality, more private and more trustless than 0conf - plus won't take onchain block space. However it's only in beta atm and there are some UX pitfalls.
1	1523177801	1	Sometimes some old btc holders will come out of the wood here and tell you that too, but mostly noone gives out that kinda golden knowledge for free I gotta go straighten this out with them brb
