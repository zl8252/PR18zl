0	1523142453	16	>Bitmain furthermore announced "MoneroClassic" as their own forkCan I get a link to this?
1	1523160859	17	Lol, they forked other people's invention to gain a strangle hold over mining.
2	1523190141	5	they did literally the exact same thing with Bcash
3	1523203894	0	But hurr durr Satoshi no vision  desuuuuuu
1	1523143585	12	See: https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/89v8h9/antpool_officially_announced_meneroclassic_fork/
0	1523176916	13	Fuck yeah they cheat the shit out of you. Chinese businesses have no ethics, they run sweatshops there and there are no private labor unions! You want cutting-edge miners? You better look into owning and operating a foundry, and not in China.
0	1523141653	45	Best part is some chumps will be buying these as new in box three months from now. It should be illegal what China's bitmain does. Trump should put tarriffs on those. 
1	1523142733	33	They only have themselves to blame. The Monero devs have been saying for a long time that they will never allow ASICs to overtake the network. The social contract for Monero is different than Bitcoin's, where stability of the protocol is one of the strongest selling point.
2	1523142859	20	Yes however the shameful deed here is that bitmain mined silently on them with intent to sell them as new to end users later. This time they might have cocked the entire thing up and been exposed by the fork. Which is both hilarious and not. 
3	1523169931	7	Hasn't this been speculated, if not proven, for years?
4	1523178933	5	I bought my first USB ASIC in around 2013 and people were talking about it then. There’s a not-so-fine-line between “testing” and mining for profit before shipping. If you could double (or more) the profit of every unit you sell by mining with it for a few weeks / months could you honestly say you wouldn’t? I don’t agree with it at all, and agree it has a hugely negative impact on the market, but money talks!
5	1523190634	3	my argument has always been, why would anyone sell you a machine that prints money?and the response is always some bullshit like, "they have better margins on selling hardware" or "the price for electricity is bad there"yeah okay chumps, have fun with your used and already-outdated machines that are trying to compete with Version2 that they're going to spin up as soon as they sell you Version1
0	1523149881	17	This has always been the case and is nothing new - we definitely need more asic resistant crypto in the mainstream, and posts like this to commonly come up informing people. You're doing good work OP.They use the miners for themselves until their not nearly profitable and then sell them to suckers. Can't really blame them, why would they sell you something that would make them more money than you'd be willing to buy it for
1	1523181394	3	Also, why would they sell something that would complete against their own mining.I imagine they only sell their old units because it is cheaper to increase the mining difficulty than it is to take all their old units to a landfill.
0	1523182173	8	haha this is bcash all over againBitmain cant abuse ASICBOOST -> fork bitcoinBitmain cant use ASIC's to mine Monero - > fork monerohilarious and anyone who didnt see the greed in forking btc must be braindead to not see it now :p
1	1523187476	5	Indeed. It's the btrash debacle all over again indeed.Anytime a positive evolution threatens Bitmain's interests, they mount a smear campaign and convince a few dimwits to fork and use an inferior chain. Jihan doesn't care about the ideas underpinning cryptocurrencies, he just wants to make a quick buck. If making a few dollars more means convincing people to use an unsafe product, he doesn't care. Weakening Bitcoin by creating bcash and destabilizing the hashing power for both coins ? He doesn't care as long as he can continue to use covert ASICboost. Weakening Monero by compromising the privacy of everybody through ill-thought forks ? He doesn't care about privacy or what Monero is about. Making more money by 'testing' his ASICs for months and shipping them just before the new generation takes over? That's what he cares about.Jihan doesn't give a fuck about crypto, decentralization, monetary systems, and freedom in general. He only cares about money.And it's the same tactic each time: 1) launch a smear campaign against reputed devs who are actually working for free 2) spread FUD and conspiracy theories in order to convince hapless idiots to join him. And by the time his inferior chain inevitably fails, whether its called Bcash or Monero classic, he has already amortized his miners and left some fools with bags of worthless coins.
2	1523205387	1	I'm still shocked at the value of BTrash.  It's just that, trash.  Yet somehow this crap coin is trading at $650.
0	1523165377	12	We need to unite and kick ASICs out of crypto.I'll forever respect monero for kicking bitmain 's ass
0	1523185569	7	I think Vertcoin would be a great alternative, I’m not sure how but they claim to be asic resistant 
1	1523205332	2	VTC has forked against ASICs in the past and they continue to monitor the network for this very thing.  If ASICs are suspected, they will fork.

1	1523177476	1	..as $11000 door stopper?
2	1523178750	1	and can be used as room heater!!its a bargain 
0	1523174644	2	Global hash rate is now 359 MH/s. Damn.
0	1523178309	2	As someone who knows more about the Asic situation, what do you think of myriad coins solution.
0	1523141996	5	Yea this situation really sucks, so many people seem to have bought the new Cryptonight ASICs not realising by the time they get them Monero and most other Cryptonight coins would have already hard-forked (LeviarCoin, Intense Coin, Sumokoin, GRAFT and IPBC all seem to be going anti-ASIC). :(
1	1523188368	3	>so many people seem to have bought the new Cryptonight ASICs Those people can only blame themselves. The whole reason for using cryptonight was that it was designed to be ASIC resistant. The devs promised ASIC resistance from day 1, and they have regularly stated that ASICs will not be tolerated. ASIC resistance is part of Monero's DNA and the last fork is just the devs delivering on their promise.
1	1523191117	1	what about masari electroneum 
1	1523147177	1	Just about the only one left will be Electroneum.
2	1523158665	0	I’m kid of wondering if buying one of these miners cheap would be worth it to mine something else like Electroneum.  Any chance they will fork too?
3	1523160800	1	Electroneum team said they are going to follow Monero, just never said when they would.
4	1523188399	1	Well copy pasting the PoW code shouldn't be too hard.
0	1523162841	2	I wonder how different the crypto world would be if Bitcoin has forked immediately away from ASICs back in the day.  Much of its problems and staganation have come from centralization and Bitmain shenanigans.  But it has stood there and took it like a little bitch instead of rapidly doing something about it like Monero and other modern dev teams.
1	1523166181	4	In fairness, hindsight is 20/20. It's easy to see in retrospect what a clusterfcuk ASICs are for a coin, they might have been great, adding stability, more environmental etc.I'm just glad BTC paved the way making all the mistakes so that projects like Monero are better because of it.
1	1523167758	2	It's not all positive to get rid of ASICs.  Bitcoin is the most secure coin in the world, while Monero can now be 51% attacked by anyone controlling 5% of the ethereum hashrate.
2	1523168993	5	In numbers: with the current hashrate at 370mh/s someone would need to control around 200.000 Vega GPUs to do this. Possible, but I think unlikely. And ethereum got bitmained too. Good part of the hashrate should be asics.
3	1523204236	1	Or a few giant botnets. 
4	1523205068	2	No way. Biggest botnet known was 3MH/s with 500.000 infected machines.
3	1523172568	0	is that supposed to be a lot of money? because it seems like its under 100m.
4	1523184841	3	The trouble would be finding that many to buy.
2	1523188944	3	It has more hash rate than anybody else, but how secure is it really ? Is it secure when a handful of people can collude and gather a majority hashpower? Is Bitcoin secure when 3 companies located in Asia produce nearly all the miners? They sell their ASICs to make it look like the network is decentralized, but it's an illusion. Those companies have the option to centralize the network anytime they want, by keeping their equipment instead of selling it.
0	1523180435	2	ASICs will always happen in any PoW coin. Changing the algo is not a long term solution, as you will be changing the algo every single time a new ASIC comes about for it. It's playing whack-a-mole with human nature, is anti competition, anti capitalism. I'm not saying don't do it, I'm saying that every time a system is anti human nature, it collapses on itself or is subverted in a big way.I wonder how much a member of the dev team would get for tipping off a miner manufacturer about what next algo would be. Definite financial incentive there. Watch out for that human nature, shows up where you least want it to. As for centralization, pick your damn poison. You either got centrality with the dev team who can impose their socialist "we know what's best" views on your coin, or you can have a free market that competes for the best possible mining equipment, with centrality for the first mover. You know for damn sure the big chip manufacturers have been watching Bitmain closely, especially after they just raked in 3 BILLION dollars. Yeah, Bitmain got first mover status. So did Apple with the iPhone. You got hundreds of competing smart phones now because it's been proven profitable to make them. Bitmain just proved it VERY profitable to make ASICs.Will be interesting to see what happens with Monero in the following years. I predict mayhem and resentment. Also interesting to note that there were 4 groups that forked the "classic" chain,  all calling it something else despite it being the same chain.*popcorn intensifies*
1	1523181191	4	Monero has a 6 month hardfork cycle, so it is possible to tweak it everytime with the scheduled hardfork.And regarding the dev centralization: no need to follow the original Monero developer team. There are now at least 4 choices. They won't be developed further, but if you disagree with the dev team you could stop using the original Monero chain. Since the anti ASIC stance was openly communicated long before and is a part of the cryptonote whitepaper the Monero devs only keep their promise of killing ASICs. And it worked flawless as we can see.
2	1523181475	1	Thanks for the insight, didn't realize it was part of their original promise. I think time will tell if it worked flawlessly. Flaws like to take time to manifest, and come up in unexpected places. 
1	1523186527	1	I think you have a valid concern about the potential of a member of the dev team to tip off a miner manufacturer. However, the code is open-source and edited and reviewed by the community. Someone having the exact code change months ahead of everyone is highly unlikely as there will be slight tweaks from input and discussion. Monero POW change discussion:https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/3253
1	1523187979	1	> Changing the algo is not a long term solution, as you will be changing the algo every single time a new ASIC comes about for it. It is. Changing a few line of codes is way cheaper than building customized hardware. Chances are you won't even need to change the algorithm each time since we have sent a very clear message to ASIC manufacturers that it is not profitable to design dedicated Monero hardware. They probably won't even try to unless they want to end up with a large stock of weird-looking electrical heaters every 6 months. Either Jihan move to something else, or we'll bleed his profits. Since the guy is only in this game for the money, it's safe to assume that he'll choose the former.>  you can have a free market that competes for the best possible mining equipmentThe whole reason for using cryptonight was its supposed ASIC resistance. The community was promised ASIC resistance from day 1, and the developers are just delivering on that promise.  
1	1523199067	1	Check out Decred, where the community is generally pro-ASIC because the users share on-chain power with the miners.

0	1523175139	1	Bitmain just wants for people to buy their shitty and expensive miners
1	1523205541	1	I think it's more than that.  They secretly mine massive amounts of currency prior to releasing their ASICs.  Then once their own ASICs aren't as profitable or they create a more efficient miner, they sell them for top dollar, at prices they know won't turn a profit for the consumer.  I think the only reason they sell is to protect the value of the currency they've been mining.
0	1523186142	1	when 8MB blocks? :D
0	1523189183	1	Monero...CLASSIC?? Seriously??? Jesus christ...This is one of the most blatant and egregious cash grab attempts I’ve seen. Smfh.In spirit I guess I understand it somewhat. They have to do whatever it takes to keep their dicks up; keep those ASICs humming (and selling) Privacy and ASIC resistance are the pillars of Monero. Subverting & essentially compromising everything that the coin was created for, slapping the Monero devs  (probably one of the most genuine communities in the ‘crypto-sphere’) in the face, and ultimately throwing dirt on Monero’s name...all so you can further ensure you have the retail mining market cornered? This is one of the lowest, scum-baggy things I’ve witnessed in crypto thus far
0	1523198725	1	I've read your post twice and I'm still not sure what you think is wrong with ASICs?
1	1523205264	1	Centralization.  Bitmain was secretly mining with what appears to be greater than 50% hashrate.  Meanwhile there was no competition.  ASICs aren't bad as long as they are distributed, but in this case it's very clear they were not.
2	1523208135	1	Yep, current estimation is around 80% of nethash came from Bitmain (and others). 
0	1523169844	1	The "monero classic" move is pretty dickish, and not likely to stand since they made it a feature of the cryptocurrency from day 1 that it be ASIC resistant. For all that, when it comes to BTC / BCH / et al I don't think ASICs are a bad thing necessarily since ASICs force the miner to mind the currency they're mining and act in its best interest since higher value means more profit - as opposed to GPU / CPU miners who can hop to whichever cryptocurrency is most profitable. That's the theory anyway, though what I've mainly seen is risk-adversity and bowing-to-authority that allowed BTC to stagnate. 
0	1523187692	1	If you think GPU rigs and hacked mining botnets are a permanent solution here you are a fucking retard.
0	1523159979	-4	Let the free market decide whether they want ASICs or not.
1	1523175077	4	The free market (profit at any cost) encourages scamming, destructive power mongering and other abusive practices. It should be regulated.
2	1523175829	-2	Then it's not a free market.
3	1523176127	6	Don't care about semantics. According to your definition, a free market would be a bad thing then.
1	1523166782	4	There's no free market when bitmain can manipulate the entire market (:
2	1523172286	0	that _is_ the free market. when a company corners a market space, that's that, they're in control. They no longer have to give a fuck about consumer needs, because they make money anyway.
3	1523173047	6	doesn't sound very free to me
4	1523174798	-1	that is literally how a free market would work. the US is not a free market and never was, nor will it ever be. regulations help to prevent monopolies; obviously they don't stop them 100%, but something like, a toilet company buying all the other toilet companies and then jacking prices 1000% wouldn't happen. Not to mention the plethora of things the FCC, FTC, EPA, the Treasury, and a billion other things all do.
1	1523205669	1	I agree, and the free market is deciding against them right now.  Until ASICs are widely distributed and affordable, there will be a huge anti-ASIC crowd.I wanted to purchase a LTC asic at one point, and I couldn't without ordering 50 of them.  Seems fair...
2	1523206063	1	>I agree, and the free market is deciding against them right now.Not the entire free market. Some want it, some don't want it.>I wanted to purchase a LTC asic at one point, and I couldn't without ordering 50 of them. Seems fair...Bitmain is a private company and it has full rights to decide who it should sell to, how many should they sell, where should they sell it, when should they sell it.
3	1523206555	1	Yup I completely agree.  But these are the reasons people hate ASIC manufacturers.  If ASICs were readily available (i.e more market competition) and at a cost that supports a lower barrier to entry (i.e GPUs), there wouldn't be much of an issue.  GPUs for many algorithms are similar to the behavior of asics in that they displace any other mining profitability (such as CPU mining on many coins), but they are readily available in different models from different manufacturers.  Current GPU distribution more closely resemble an end-state ASIC situation once the free market has done its work.Personally I'm surprised American companies haven't started making ASICs.
4	1523206950	1	>Personally I'm surprised American companies haven't started making ASICs.The products would still be made in China most likely
1	1523164465	0	No one is saying they should be banned. The free market is working exactly as planned, and OP is doing his part to inform others of why they should think a little harder about ASICs. Just because you disagree doesn't mean it's anti-free market.
