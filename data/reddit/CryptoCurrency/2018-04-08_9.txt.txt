1	1523184776	1	me too!!
0	1523156518	123	People play video games too often. People work too often. People drink too often. People smoke too often. People check social media too often. Choose your poison - at least this has a hope attached to it. I do see where you're coming from though.
1	1523157045	53	People like to be occupied.
2	1523168461	34	It's easier than dealing with a less than satisfactory life.
1	1523165182	21	Hey man...back off. Drinking has hope attached to it. Atleast thats what I tell myself.Full Disclosure: I hold Box wine, Sake, and some Vodka.
2	1523174047	9	Scotch is my HODL.
2	1523167857	2	Many solutions to life‚Äôs problems have been found at the bottom of a Whiskey bottle.
1	1523164763	7	I‚Äôve swapped all of the above poisons for crypto poison and I have made some money and hope for a better future!
1	1523174842	7	And here, I'm on reddit too much. But at least I see reddit as more of a self educating community rather than Facebook or instagram where you mindlessly scroll on dumb ass videos and cat memes.

1	1523168304	-2	Exactly, an addiction that's making you rich, there are worse addictions. 
2	1523181400	6	Yes... rich...
0	1523157396	59	Why take a shit when my portfolio's been doing that for me?
1	1523176024	2	Seriously though. 
1	1523157548	1	Because this bear market has seasoned us be in pain more than one way. 
0	1523164391	12	I stopped checking crypto bc I became addicted to r/skincareaddiction. I now throw my money at moisturizers, serums, acids, everything. 
1	1523166267	6	A consistent routine is important. I like to cleanse, tone, and then moisturise. Then I worry about my face. 
1	1523186896	5	I just checked this out. It's CC for the ladies.. Whilst all the blokes are in here worrying they might miss a bullish breakout, the girls are in there worrying they might have another blemish breakout! 
1	1523197925	2	Skincare is hopeless, I've been doing it for more than 10 years I know my shit, crypto has some hope at least
0	1523176107	12	you guys smoke crypto or snort it?
1	1523186952	3	inject it with a big fat needle
1	1523200124	1	hahaha
1	1523205746	1	Better absorption up the bum
0	1523163192	6	this title is tumblr-tier
0	1523167356	4	Day trading was a big thing in the 90's. I can guarantee someone had this discussion then. 
0	1523168110	4	You have a real problem, if you measure your pooping in ounces, OP.
0	1523161536	3	This used to be an issue for me, then the crash of 2018 happened... saved my life really.
1	1523170252	5	Did you sell your positions or just get tired of seeing your portfolio get raped every day while holding like me?
2	1523200308	1	You gotta trade to not lose money bro. Ive been trading since 2015 with same strategy and have never lost (alot) of money. Just gotta turn into sniper mode and get in on those small various spikes throughout the day. Make sure to only do as many trades as you can so that your able to sell back to BTC before u go to bed every night. This way, your able to start fresh every morning with a new trade, rather than hodling because it went down on you.
3	1523209137	1	I wouldn‚Äôt give this advice to anyone who wasn‚Äôt trained at day trading. It requires sternness and ignoring greed, which is hard for like 99% of people:
4	1523210258	1	True, most people don't acquire the consistency it takes or patience to make smart decisions, which results in them losing money constantly qhen trying to trade.
2	1523209014	1	I‚Äôve been hodling since 2013 so I stopped caring back then and lived my life... Then the bull run happened and I went crazy into 20 different alts and was checking every 7 minutes. Now I‚Äôm back to never checking. Finished my masters. Engage with my family. Live my life. Still holding on all those positions though.
0	1523165752	3	So what? This is the future, our future! Who cares the job, wife or kids...
0	1523167393	3	I used to when I first got into it, but now I only check about 5 times a week. I just got the attitude that whatever is gonna happen, is gonna happen.  I got in to hold for the next at least year anyway, but probably even longer like 5 years.
0	1523171012	3	Moved everything to a hardware wallet and haven‚Äôt checked coinbase, blockfolio,  cointracking, etc. since december.  Has anything happened since then?
1	1523173306	21	Bitcoin just hit 35k
2	1523200636	1	38k....in Yuan
0	1523179752	3	It's 4:28 AM where I'm at.... can confirm addiction
0	1523184071	3	If I'm not checking coinmarketcap, I'm checking reddit. Cypto is one addicting subject.
0	1523187024	3	Battle crypto shits ... shit coins down. 
0	1523154631	5	Gamblers anonymous
1	1523155356	2	Not trying to convince anyone they are gambling. Just saying if you want to stop and cant check out gamblers anonymous
1	1523154716	1	Not gambling if I hodl 
2	1523157001	10	Hodling is still a gamble. Just a longer game. 
0	1523173398	2	Yea when it was going up and making money or at least not in the toilet yea I‚Äôd check 100 times a day. Now that it‚Äôs in the toilet, on the brink of collapse and a joke? Nah, rarely check anymore.Who the hell is still into crypto anymore lol it‚Äôs over. Still collecting furbies while your at it?
1	1523194915	1	I disagree but I upvoted you because I laughed my ass off. Lol
0	1523193175	2	I wouldn't call it being addicted, but being invested in your money.I'm in the same boat and check stuff daily, just because I want to be up to date. With a market as volatile as this one, you don't want to miss out I feel.Comparing it to let's say stocks, you won't check that stuff all the time as it usually stagnates majority of the time and explosions aren't as big/common as crypto.
0	1523164382	3	Just find a hobby and stop caring so much about it, easier if you don't have a significant portion of your money invested.I used to check hourly, now I check whenever I remember to check, like a couple times a week.
1	1523187170	3	What if Bitcoin is my hobby?
2	1523201651	2	If it's your thing then enjoy! I'm only talking about people who consider it a problem in their lives.
1	1523188645	1	Eh I run a business, also doing app development, and funding a charity.I have plenty of hobbies, but this hobby has 100k in BTC
0	1523180184	5	I'll be the first to tell people they're weak for not being able to control themselves. Anytime someone says, "Ugh guys i'm just gonna turn off the computer for 2 weeks until this blows over" I cringe and cringe hard. You are such a mouse your only option is to stick your goddamn head in the sand? What do you do when you have a hard time at work? What about tough times in your daily life in general? Do you just lock yourself in a closet until the sunshine comes back out? Get real people.That being said, since December i've not slept more than 3.5 hours a night. In the beginning it wasn't too bad, but the effects are starting to become apparent. Blurry memory, nodding while driving, feeling like shit. Crypto markets never close, so being asleep you could potentially miss out on some major news or action. I know a lot ofpeople here in the hold-gang will say this isn't a problem if you just hold, but I think the "hodl" thing is just a giant meme perpetuated by whales to keep prices inflated. Ever notice how the people preaching this 'hodl" meme never talk about selling? Like, ever? It doesn't make sense to hold indefinitely. If your goal is simply to collect digital monies and never convert to fiat, you're probably clinically insane.So yea, i'd say i'm addicted at this point. Not to crypto though, to money in general. I worship it. I live it, breath it, and would stick my cock in it if I could. Money gives you options and power. It doesn't directly buy happiness, but it sure as fuck keeps the sadness away. Anyone who says money is the root of all evil doesn't fucking have any.
1	1523198169	3	Someone's been watching too much _Boiler Room_. 
1	1523187856	1	It‚Äôs okay to love money and your right people who say money is bad don‚Äôt have much as you can‚Äôt attract what you condemn Money brings a lot of blessings into you life and others, it‚Äôs a wonderful tool to be used for good Just don‚Äôt forget to respect your health and happiness in other areas of life as well other wise you will become imbalanced üôÇ
1	1523190128	1	Guess what costs a lot of money over a lifetime?  Poor health.  Look at the big picture.
1	1523208159	1	To paraphrase Daniel Tosh, "Money doesn't buy happiness but I've never seen anyone frown on a jet ski".
0	1523163979	2	"Addicted to food? Yes. It's a real Problem.How many times do you guys check your **refrigerators** everyday?How many times do you say ‚ÄúI'm going to cook ate home‚Äù and 8 hours later you find yourself **thinking about takeout** like a crack head looking for their next fix.**Buying a shit ton of groceries** seems like the best option. But it‚Äôs almost hard because what if you miss major **tastes** and you want to take profits.Today I found myself taking a shit at work looking through **my shit**.* The point is, if you haven't mortgaged your house, you're doing this wrong.
0	1523160109	1	It depends. Are you doing it to a detriment? I'm still keeping up with everything else. Only my long term holds are in an app to check and IDGAF what they are doing right now (I'll start looking if/when another big run happens). I do check Binance daily...just to see if I need to short something...I like my positions too much now, though.
0	1523162855	1	Keep Reddit and a portfolio tracker. Make it a thing to lock all your coins, that way you can't sell them if some panic sets in. Ride your investments to the bitter end. Since you can't touch your coins, either by your own mental accord or by a real lock, you won't have the urge to check as often, if at all.
1	1523163318	2	No
0	1523171895	1	I day trade BTC. I'm pretty sure i don't check the price enough.
0	1523172579	1	The title is something a local newspaper would post.
0	1523174481	1	that was me. now i just **** care and leave it there.
0	1523175834	1	Deleted delta about 2 weeks ago. my life is much better now. it was only hard for the first 2 days. then you get used to it. and because you don't see the prices every hour you automatically check reddit less and less. for me it has finally become what it always should have, a long term hold. all the fear and personal fud  is gone because I just have almost no clue what's going on. I love it.
0	1523176393	1	I feel so much happier since I stopped checking coinmarketcap. This is why you don't put in money you can't afford to lose, so you can relax and assume prices are going nowhere but down for the next few years. Time for me to forget crypto and enjoy life. Earn money from other sources. But if it goes down 85% from ath.
0	1523179924	1	You can checkout anytime you want, you can never leave.
0	1523180412	1	How is it to take a shit at work?
0	1523181405	1	It is actually a waste of time
0	1523181583	1	That‚Äôs the only free/private time i have to look at my crypto things... poo time is life to me!
0	1523184224	1	As in, addicted to money.
0	1523189996	1	Reading this is going to make me miss a moon or something, gotta head back to the price discussions thread.
0	1523190045	1	If this is bad, imagine how bad it was at the end of December. 
0	1523191610	1	currently at work, pooping for 16 minutes, your post is pretty accurate.
0	1523196864	1	The market shitting the bed for 3 months straight really helped with my addiction problem.Now I can't even bring myself to check my shit except maybe glancing at it once a day while taking a dump (just like my portfolio).
0	1523198850	1	Anything can become an addiction, and this sounds like something you're going through. That's too bad, but it doesn't mean everybody is going through it as well.
0	1523200341	1	"Deleting all crypto related apps seems like the best option"The advice everyone is giving atm in this bear market. I bet the majority of you won't have that problem once the bulls come back and you're making a killing again. You'll be refreshing the shit out of your apps and won't mind :D
0	1523201167	1	My solution was to get a Trezor and put 90% of my coins in there (leaving only 10% for trading) with no way to easily see their value, then set a really weird pin that takes a while to remember and plug in. That way I am usually far too lazy to plug it in and check their value without actually having a reason to.
0	1523164626	1	Been in since 2012. Can't believe I've wasted 6 years. Hopefully I'll be retired soon once the next 10x happens.
0	1523170446	1	Yes I am and not in a good way. I am constantly checking to see if I am closer to break even so I could bail from the market for good.
0	1523175931	1	no shit im addicted to crypto, I have over $100,000 of my money invested in this shiti check prices religiously every 5 minutesi have multiple telegrams running on a second screen at my officewhats your point
0	1523179546	1	I also check my bank account everyday, it‚Äôs called responsibility not addiction, do us a favour and commit suicide before you try to uneducated other people any longer.
0	1523167749	0	Dont tell me how to live, you little prick parasite.
0	1523159306	-4	I despise every person who talk about addiction, its more about direction of your focus. And strongly believe, everything is about willingness and util.I‚Äôve smoked somewhat a lot time to time, yet always stopped when I‚Äôve wanted, no ‚Äúside-effects‚Äù to force to continue. If you let a kid to play computer, as long as he finds something to gain utility from, he **will** continue hunting for that utility, unless you can make him get that util from some alternative source, this is also not an addiction.If you cannot help yourself not to check anything crypto related stuff, go ahead and learn to day trade, it should be a lot more profitable than original investing (its a ‚Äúhobby‚Äù too, and u will learn important things). But if you really can‚Äôt find anything better to do than keep looking at crypto news etc, u must have a boring life, go out, find a girlfriend, friends, or a hobby you like, and keep practicing. 
1	1523159566	4	So just cause you dont experience it, no one else in the world struggles with addiction?üòÇüòÇyou got some learnin to do
2	1523159926	1	No, but I would see it as a environmental factor. Take as example alcoholism, they don‚Äôt drink just because they like to drink, more often their life is fucked up, and many times they do go for suicide, other times they don‚Äôt. They gain more utility from unconsciousness, than being sober, and alcohol is great for that.
1	1523159845	2	I have a job, girlfriend, golf hobby, gym hobby, eating hobby, all of the above. Yet, I still find time for crypto. 
2	1523162045	1	This response is extremely biased, because all of those activities are on a huge spectrum. How many hours you work/ forced overtime, how I depend is your girlfriend, what‚Äôs your definition of a golf hobby (18 holes every few days, every weekend, a couple times a month?)Then the big question is what you consider ‚Äútime for crypto‚Äù. There is a huge difference in reading what /r/cryptocurrency says once or twice a day versus utilizing all available resources, and making reactive decisions based on your research.
3	1523163733	1	Yes, and no. I am just talking of Addiction in my view. I am talking of pretty damn huge topic in narrow spectrum, yes and perhaps pretty damn generalized, but I am not going to ask somebody's private information or to go dig his/her's private life.
4	1523164099	1	?? My comment wasn‚Äôt directed at your post. 
5	1523164355	1	I would interpret it as its kind of answering both of the questions. 
2	1523174921	1	Eating hobby?
2	1523160153	0	If you really want to put less focus on crypto world, and shift it to something else, I think you have too big stakes to play with. Only invest as much as you are willing to lose. Money is a powerful util to many of us, and some people might be just more conservative, than others, I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say it is a addiction. 
3	1523162225	1	How would that impact his behavior? I see people posting on all theses subs with like 10 grand Worth of crypto. The amount you have has nothing to do with how consumed you are with crypto.
4	1523163197	1	I could see it impacting your behavior in many ways, as example, what was that money meant for in the first place?If you were to save for a new car, and then think of putting portion of that money into crypto, in hopes to afford a better car, you have a stake. I know I would pay great awareness, if I did such.Or if you basically bite more than you could chew. Like what I mean by ‚Äúconservative‚Äù, you have more emotional attachment towards your money, maybe you work much more to earn the money etc. Of course you don‚Äôt want to lose your hard earned money.But there is a lot environmental factor towards how we behave around money.Sorry for quick but unstructured answers
5	1523163399	1	If you saved for a new car, then looked at crypto as a way to double your money to buy a new car... that is a full blown gambling addiction and not a crypto addiction. Day trading is not about 50% gains daily, it‚Äôs aboit small gains and preventing big losses
6	1523164002	1	Yes, as I said it would be a stake, not necessarily full blown gambling addiction. If you choose to put money to invest into original stock market, instead of using that money to buy a car that you've wanted to buy for long time, I wouldn't call that gambling, its investment at its best.And yes, I know what day trading is, but you could potentially(under right circumstances) make a lot of money, that is in cryptocurrency, as it is extremely volatile. 
0	1523159906	-3	Oh this is so lame, downvote to oblivion. Get a life.
1	1523160005	4	Says the person on the crypto subreddit. 
2	1523162080	4	Whatever bro, I could stop any time I wanted.Send help.
