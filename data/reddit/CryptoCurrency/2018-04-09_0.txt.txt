0	1523252789	910	This is why CoinBase is so popular. 
1	1523254091	220	Correct. CB’s ui made it so my grandma could buy bitcoin. 
2	1523256896	221	Hope she didn't buy at 20k
3	1523273216	221	She believes in the tech tho
4	1523278723	81	Grandma not in the best position to HODL long-term, she's probably getting out as soon as she has Lambo money.

3	1523272332	5	When you buy and sell and how long you can wait all matters, it's not about the numbers.
4	1523274098	24	Not when you're 94 and could die in a week
5	1523287217	6	You could die in a week at any age ;]~
5	1523274322	0	Depends on what the goal is, if the goal is to create money for the grand-kids or something. What would be wrong with that ?
6	1523278993	4	Because she gets to die knowing that her investment for her grandkids just lost 60% of its value.
7	1523279646	1	Only if she believes it won't go back up.
1	1523253920	300	I agree so strongly I had to type it.
2	1523254844	59	I second so strongly I had to type it.
3	1523255696	30	You won't believe I third so strongly I had to hype it!

Clickbait headlines typically aim to exploit the "curiosity gap", providing just enough information to make readers curious, but not enough to satisfy their curiosity without clicking through to the linked content.From a historical perspective, the techniques employed by clickbait authors can be considered derivative of yellow journalism, which presented little or no legitimate well-researched news and instead used eye-catching headlines that included exaggerations of news events, scandal-mongering, or sensationalism. For sites that thrive on thousands of click-throughs to content, many authors see the use of clickbait as a means to tap into human psyche by crafting these eye-catching headlines.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

1	1523254863	54	It reminds me of the Binance's "Simple" and "Advanced" interface. For a new folk they look pretty much the same.
2	1523259214	58	Honestly, I used advanced because it's actually less complicated.
3	1523264218	12	Haha! Same here! I knew I could not be the only.
3	1523278128	1	Yeah once your brain adjusts to where everything is it’s a lot more straightforward with more concise information than using simple
2	1523263291	11	the funny thing is that the advanced interface is actually more intuitive and easier to figure out than the simple one. 
1	1523274753	1	Yes and no. Despite understanding the concept of buying BTC and other crypto, you STILL need a wallet, and that part remains intimidating. Build a better wallet and they will come.
1	1523277565	1	However we need places like coinbase to attract more investors to this space.
1	1523285267	1	It makes it super easy to _invest_ for sure. It's perfect for people who Google "that bitcoin thing from the news" and want to get some. Thier mobile wallet is also decent, but has some issues and is still a good deal harder to use than something like Apple pay. I realize that isn't a fair comparison, but I think op is right in that that doesn't matter to the average person.
1	1523289099	1	Was going to say this exactly. The problem isn't entirely ease-of-use, although I do think that could use some improvements. Non-technical people could figure out pretty easily _why_ they'd want an MP3 player long before they knew _how_ to use one. I think _how_ is pretty well covered for the big coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum; the question most people will ask you is _why_ they should bother. Right now, unfortunately, unless you're interested only in investing, there aren't really any good answers to that.
1	1523289569	1	And why coins have been fighting so hard to be listed on Coinbase. Look at the /r/Ripple community. I like to play a game where I sift through threads and see how deep I have to go until I see a Coinbase comment 
1	1523282874	1	What's the bloody point of blockchain when all its users end up using a central point of exchange?
2	1523286034	2	The idea is that people can graduate from these ridiculously simple exchanges and become full fledged crypto users. Oversimplified user interfaces provide a way in for the average person. If these "gateways" into crypto don't exist... you don't get mainstream adoption, no matter how good the tech behind it is. So I guess the *real* question to ask is: *What's the point of blockchain if nobody uses it?*
1	1523260456	-4	CB doesn’t keep your coins secure though?
2	1523264092	2	Wut?
1	1523289423	0	This is what we're trying to achieve at Bitcoin.com, through Bitcoin Cash. Cryptocurrencies should be all about user experience. Quick and cheap transactions are exactly how that should look to me.
0	1523247698	736	As a designer who manages to pay the bills and eat from my craft, the crypto space is filled to the eyeballs with horrible design models. 
1	1523252205	102	But then I see the Delta app and I start questioning if I even belong in this field lol.
2	1523255204	66	There was a post about a guy who lost 200k On Ether Delta because he forgot a decimal. I mean that is for sure a big fuckup but seriously it's not only a bad interface, it has no fail-check. It's cool when you are playing around with 100 bucks to buy the shittiest of shitcoins but I would never have the balls to trade 100k on it.
3	1523255346	125	hes talking about delta portfolio tracking app not ED
4	1523255568	22	Oh my bad. I actually don't know the product he is talking about. I'll check it out and see what's up.
5	1523258085	19	You still are not far from the topic. For adoption you have to make the tech fool-proof. Make it easier than banks, more secure at the user's end. 
6	1523259740	10	Absolutlez, and we are far from that. I simply do not yet see my parents switching from the convenince they currently have while paying for things. 
7	1523271449	3	I can’t even get my parents to use paypal..
8	1523280165	4	PayPal? In my days we called them male prostitutes or sailors!
5	1523274771	1	You should definitely check it out! best portfolio in the crypto space with meaningful weekly updates!
3	1523278327	1	I lost money on EtherDelta too. Fun times.
3	1523279376	1	But there's another side to that. Let's say the market is moving FAST and you're trying to get a limit order in. Any sort of pop-up/fail-check that says something like "are you SURE you want to do this??" type of thing is going to waste a few seconds and completely ruin your opportunity. 
4	1523280394	4	If you are doing this by hand and hope to get to a second long oportunity window, it is already a shitty plan.
3	1523288955	1	Someone was made pretty happy from that...
2	1523261275	15	[deleted]
3	1523269166	9	I feel like you guys have low standards... It looks professional, but that's it. If I paid someone for a design, I'd be disappointed with less. 
3	1523292546	1	No, your average using is going to struggle on here.  I struggled on here after plenty of time on Bittrex and Coinbase/GDAX.  The hardest part was lack on intuition... errors like "you can't make a purchase without putting money in another wallet" instead of "click here to move ETH from your vault to your active account and purchase"
2	1523266243	3	Coinomi multi wallet also has a nice clean design.
2	1523263373	1	Care to share a screenshot of the UI of the Delta app? I'm on Blockfolio
3	1523263915	6	[portfolio](https://i.imgur.com/Fo8cONC.png)[watch list](https://i.imgur.com/6Lvz7Js.png)[markets tab](https://i.imgur.com/idRLent.png)[portfolio - default settings](https://i.imgur.com/zUK1k84.png) (light theme, smaller font, less compact)
4	1523265307	3	Woah thanks!
2	1523287127	1	Dunno What you’re talking about, delta is great.
2	1523273318	1	and then I see exodus. Beautiful.
1	1523261915	6	I guess it's more about what designers try to charge when they hear the word blockchain.Noone would deny a work from a good/proven designer but some people/companies were trying to charge as high as $100-200k for designs alone few months back(not coding, or marketing).
2	1523279468	1	Opportunists can be find in all echelons of society, and all of them respond similarly to the mountains of gold crypto offers since the ICO hype.But there is another possibility: the briefing. Depending on what was asked, and how it was asked, prices can become quite high quite soon. And be aware that “We want a simple design, nothing too fancy, it just has to...” can skyrocket in no time, depending on the buzzwords you blurt out after that.Especially with n00b clients, who have no concept of your business, you better err on the safe side.
2	1523294869	1	I agree but after raising 100 mil during ICO it shouldn't be a problem to pay even 500k for amazing design. 
1	1523276654	4	Yeah, ok, but first it should be able to scale, that’s why nobody is worrying about design now. I’m not sure mass adoption of bitcoin would be a good thing at the moment, probably it would just clog the whole network.
2	1523289890	1	Wondering about scalability *is* worrying about design. Design is not just "look and feel" a very big, **big** part is how it all works. It's way easy to send an email or pay a credit card online and there are many complex layers underneath it all and yet, users are not exposed to the esoteric methods - crypto is very complex and does not forgive mistakes. 
3	1523295118	1	But op was specifically referring to user interfaces, flows and things like that. 
4	1523295379	1	The OP to this entire thread or this subthread? I am the OP of the subthread and I was referencing flows as well. Potato potato. 
1	1523279008	1	The crypto space needs wallets with the look, feel, ease of use, and big selection of currencies to store that a wallet like exodus has combined with the security of a nano ledger s/trezor. Right now you either have to sacrifice security if you want a great looking multi coin wallet or you need to sacrifice the great design and ease of use you get with exodus for the added security of a hardware wallet.When I’m buying items at the grocery store I should be able to pull out my phone, open my crypto wallet app, select the coin I want to pay with (or use your default selected coin), scan, confirm payment amount then be done in seconds. It needs to be as simple as Apple Pay or PayPal etc. and it needs to be this way whether you are in the USA or Canada or Japan or the UK, etc. This is where crypto currencies can shine one day, but we aren’t there yet.The non currency focused cryptos are a whole different discussion. You likely won’t ever see the average joe buying your more niche coins unless it’s managed by a someone else similar to other investment funds. Those will likely gain traction in a few years if crypto continues to grow.
1	1523288925	1	What do you expect in a world where the Masters was won by a fat guy in a pink shirt... and his bro was rocking orange pants. This is was shit posting leads to.
1	1523255912	0	This.
1	1523259091	-5	Ever trade on Bitstamp? Jesus Christ that's ugly and confusing.
2	1523263514	6	Are you kidding? If Bitstamp has done one thing well, it is its UI. It is one of the simplest and better looking interface in this space
0	1523251649	332	Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’re still building infrastructure. We still have to figure out utility. We still need incentive to use crypto. User interface is a major problem for adoption sure, but nothing is really ready to be adopted. You’re talking about MP3 players when we don’t even have mp3 encoders fully worked out and the world doesn’t yet see why we should switch from CDs which work perfectly fine.
1	1523259735	60	> We still have to figure out utilityhere it is, ladies and gents. the big problem with crypto. if you want a currency, you need to be able to purchase things with it. real things. like hamburgers. 
2	1523260064	23	Clearly you haven’t heard of WhopperCoin.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/08/28/burger-king-russia-cryptocurrency-whoppercoin.html
3	1523261801	4	This is basically just an automated reward point system. Buy six Whoppers get the seventh free!
2	1523280269	5	Authorities are stifling this though, making it harder to get fiat into crypto and slapping taxes on it so we don't know if buying a hamburger is going to cost us $20 tax because we mined a Bitcoin in 2010.
2	1523273312	3	Yeah no problem.Not getting charged $20 for a $5 sandwich because you used the wrong debit card by accident. Banks can suck it.
2	1523278345	2	You can buy stuff on NewEgg, and they sell way more than just computer parts.But actually using crypto to buy stuff is contrarian to the whole "hodl!!!" investor nonsense. 
2	1523287248	1	and then even if you have that, why would the average joe want to switch?  Crypto solves global currency problems, not really individual problems.  There's not a single thing about me going to buy a hamburger right now that makes me wish I had another form of paying.  The only reason any normal people are involved in crypto right now is pure speculation and FOMO.
2	1523289288	1	Sorry to crush your world, but there is no actual ham in those burgers.
2	1523294216	1	Stability of some sort is the end game if this is going to be currency no?  I feel that goes against the plans of many here.
1	1523253810	81	This. Early adopters are generally over-optimistic. This year and next year will be the real infrastructure war. Tail of next year will be the middleware multi blockchain war. 2020 to 2022 will be Dapps.
2	1523261303	9	What do you mean by middleware multi chain war? 
2	1523254580	-10	So, maybe the market is volatile but stagnant price-wise for the next year or two, then we see another major bull run near the start of 2020-ish is what you're saying?
3	1523263902	7	This is it. You've entered the future
3	1523287947	1	[removed]
4	1523289174	3	I think it's because the message that ericclarku is trying to convey has nothing to do with price at all, yet the guy that was downvoted implied that it was.
1	1523254897	20	Best reply yet. Yes some blockchains have been around for a few years. But in reality the people adopting right now are still the super early ones. All the development is still on the backend. Maybe someone couple get nice frontend going but that usually means a real headache later it develop in reverse order. Oh and with bit-connect scans and other exchanges that are still struggling to make transactions handshake right, I'd personally rather see work on getting backend fixed than nice apps.
2	1523255416	11	I just had a talk with a guy from EY yesterday. Apparently they recently started developing an internal blockchain technology department for Smart Contracts for their ERP systems. Crypto has amazing potential and it is being activley worked on but it is mostly behind closed doors and not really for public usage. We need the community to come together and do the same thing that is being done on the Dark Net. We need etsy/amazon like marketplaces, we need flashy and simple UI, we need people who are willing to work for crypto or sell products for crypto.
3	1523292933	2	This sounds retarded, why use "blockchain" for ERP?
3	1523287451	1	I believe SPHTX is connected to E&Y.. one of the best use case projects I've found. Im very tempted to go all-in on it and forget corrupto for a few years
3	1523295153	1	Well Ethos should fix a lot of problems with their concepts such as universal wallets etc. But God knows how long it's going to take... 
1	1523258218	12	I completely agree! I started encoding my first MP3s ripping my own CDs for ease of use way before iPods or iTunes even existed.I would have never told my dad to do the same due to the "user experience". But technology and adoption wasn't even there to be a mainstream issue with CDs. I am always an early adopter of technology compared to the average Joe and revel in the joys of figuring out something how stuff works, but not everyone wants to do this.We are still in the laboratory phase when large companies start to accrue the licences necessary to build B2B solutions. B2C is still about 5-6 years away.
2	1523294269	1	The first ripper (audiovax?) that auto populated lists from CDDB was a game changer.
1	1523293561	2	Sounds like it's a cyclical problem, what comes first utility or simplification for mass adoption?  there's no utility but you need simpler ui/process as a means for adoption vs without utility there is no simplification. I think both goes hand in hand, need innovation both sides of the fence for faster growth.
1	1523272980	2	Exactly this. Its so close, but so far away. Fuck a UI if the product is a failure. We're in the alpha still, beta at best. Tell your mom, dad, uncle, grandma, chill the fuck out its coming.Its early adopters who see an opportunity who are annoyed at the lack of ease. This is because of mobile devices and the internet, sharing information about this shit is so easy everyone wants in not realizing how infant it is.
1	1523287721	1	I had an mp3 player when it was nerdy and we had to use tape drive type storage.  It wasnt until it was cool and cheap with a sexy ui(ipod) that mp3 became the standard, but it took a marketing genius, in Steve jobs.
1	1523293102	1	Smart Contracts are on of the utilities. I see a few things coming from blockchain technology. * something to take advantage of automated transactions * something to take advantage of a public and immutable ledger  Smart contracts are one of those emergent technologies. It's applications for insurance, shipping, construction, fintech, ect are huge. I imagine that accounting and legal services will benefit the most (obviously). What other accounting and legal services, I can't say. Smart contracts seem to really encompass a lot of that potential
1	1523294678	1	I'm just interested in following where things go or come from.
0	1523252424	121	"Mainstream adoption starts when it stops requiring an explanation"  I have been writing this point in various places across the net since last July 2017.  It feels like the Drupal world to me.  Dev speak to devs and head scratching when people left for WP.  Don't get me wrong.  I prefer Drupal over WP.  But people out in the world who have days so busy that they can't find time for dinner with the people that are their tribal unit -- their family -- aren't taking the time to understand the difficulty of blockchain algos, mining, how to get money from their account into a dex, and more.  As one person said to me -- an enthusiast for crypto -- "why?  what's in it for me to stop my life for the time I would need to learn how to use this? I'm fine with what I'm doing now. Yep it costs me a fee but I don't have to do anything else to use it. "   I want more people in crypto.  But we have to find our way to use simple words, simple sentences, and simple tools that are beyond easy to use.  
1	1523254874	34	What “fee” are you referring to when you say “yep it costs me a fee” which I assume you mean fiat? All I see left and right for crypto is fees. And scary danger warnings of how I can lose my money and I’m entirely responsible for it if it’s gone it’s gone lol. Hard selling point for anyone uneducated in crypto. 
2	1523267393	0	i'll just leave this here /r/nanocurrency 
2	1523265974	0	PayPal/banking fee.
3	1523268873	11	What banking fee? I'm not sure if the US is different but where I live banking is mostly free. I can transfer wherever I want for no fee. It's instant to any other bank in the country. Sure, I don't see the fee the merchant sees for card use but I gain a lot of protection from it. Recently my luggage was lost on a trip and I got money to replace everything. Once I accidentally sent money to a wrong account and just called up my bank and they had it back instantly. What protections do crypto afford me? Why should the average person give up theft protection, accident protection and all the other protections most civilized countries have?
4	1523270191	5	Bcuz decentralization bro. And Wall Street thugs. And fiat. Yeah. 
5	1523278900	3	This, but unironically.
4	1523273684	2	I answered a question about fees. I didn't call for the downfall of global banking. Take a chill pill. You literally answered your own question one sentence later. Everything has a fee. Just because *you* don't pay it, doesn't mean it's free. But as both OP and you pointed out, the product is worth the fees.
1	1523263654	34	And we should also stop referring to people who don't want to spend time reading up on these things as "stupid people". They are not stupid, they just don't have time for this crap. I say this as a guy that's fully in for the ride and tries to defend the crypto market and explain it, but seriously, take some time to talk to people, it looks really, really hostile. Both in ease to use and community. The sooner we drop the holier than thou attitude, like we are the only ones that are "woke" and everyone else is a money wasting idiot, the sooner the mainstream will begin to see cryptos as a legitimate marketplace for EVERYONE to use, instead of a nerdy pyramidal scheme circlejerk for internet dwelling neckbeards. I'm not exagerating here, I've talked to people and this is literally what they think of cryptocurrencies as of today. Any of you frequent 4chan? No? Good. Take the image you have of 4chan right now. That's exactly what the mainstream thinks of us. We have to change that.  
1	1523254713	7	The only answer I can give right now to these rhetorical questions is “cause fuck the banks. They don’t like you. They like to hurt you and profit from it. Do you want that?” But Normies don’t wanna hear that, so I don’t say that.Edit: hey thanks for the downvotes. Are we so far from the original reasoning for creating crypto currency that we’ve forgotten the reason this shit was thought up?
2	1523255457	16	Yeah, and banking in a lot of countries is free isn't it? In the UK I don't pay for my current account or when I use my debit card, and most credit cards are free (or you pay a fee for a card which comes with additional benefits). Sure I pay a fee if I don't pay off my credit card, or if I go to into an unarranged overdraft, but they've lent me the cash so that seems fair to me. Is this not the norm in other countries?
3	1523256616	12	The merchant pays fees when they charge your card, and these are reflected in the price of goods.
4	1523258108	10	But it's built in so people don't notice it, the fact that credit cards have purchasing fees literally doesn't even exist at all to the vast majority of people because it's unseen and most people don't care or realize. On the other hand, fees in crypto are a HUGE part of it, you hear about them, you see them in your ledger, you consider them when doing a transaction. This adds another bad layer to the complexity of crypto and it's future potential.Back to OPs point, design, marketing, and perception are major factors in helping issues like this (and many others) moving forward, but these things don't seem to be discussed much at all if ever.
5	1523258665	4	I live in the UK too, I would say most people here who have a clue about life know that the banks charge the merchant a small amount for card transactions, it’s hardly a big murky secret, just an acceptable trade off for the convenience.
6	1523264021	2	Agreed but with crypto, the consumer is liable for the fees whereas merchants currently are. And I think it's fair to assume that merchants won't reduce the price for consumers even if they don't have to pay Visa/MC/Amex fees, which should technically make payments more expensive for consumers by whatever the TX fee is. On the flip side, merchants would make a strong push towards crypto payments and may offer discounts. Time will tell
4	1523262111	1	If Crypto is ‘mainstream’ and used everyday are the merchants going to reduce the price of the products because they no longer have to pay a fee on the things you buy? 
5	1523262594	2	Honestly, look at the insane lengths that major supermarkets go to just to get their prices a tiny bit lower than competitors, the competitive advantage of free transactions will dictate this eventually.
6	1523266579	1	You assume that companies like Walmart pay fee's?, I know if I was part of the team, the fact i'm letting visa handle all my transactions and holding on to billions of $ for a week at a time (giving them insane interest rates no doubt due to them effectively having a rolling Billion in the bank) I would be in a position to have fees pretty much waived. 
7	1523266644	1	I live in the UK, they pay fees here, not sure how things are in the US.
8	1523270251	1	Honestly, you think Asda (Walmart) pays to use Worldpay/Visa in the UK. It would be less than a fraction of a % if at all anything. When you are moving Billions it becomes very profitable to just be able to hold on to the money for a short while. Companies like Worldpay could survive on the interest generated in a week alone, yet they effectively have a rolling balance due to the weekly payout schedules. Asda?Tesco have a large stick to help beat negotiations to there liking (its hard enough to make them pay tax let alone fees on visa).

6	1523271760	1	But supermarkets don't give you a discount for paying with cash. 
7	1523271885	1	That’s because not everyone pays with cash!If nobody paid with cards then the lack of card fees being priced into their profit margin would filter through as a discount in slightly lower prices.
3	1523256464	2	I want so badly to reply to your reply but I just don’t understand what part of my comment you’re referring to.
3	1523281319	1	Dude every credit card has fees for using it. You ever used one at a cash machine? 
4	1523286396	1	Honestly? No. I only use my debit card to get cash out/cashback.
0	1523249987	82	I was just thinking about this this morning. You put it very eloquently and succinctly. I completely agree with you. Every person I explain crypto to asks me questions about how "usable" it is and how they can get crypto. Once they learn about exchanges, private and public keys, and having to be their own "banks" for their assets, they immediately are turned off. 
1	1523261877	21	Familiarity breeds contempt.  How many people who use fiat, really know how banking works?  How many really understand how to detect fake notes or coins?  How many understand how a credit card company operates in detail?I personally shy away from explaining the details of crypto, I just show some coins on my phone, ask them to install Coinomi and make transfer using a QR.  Explain forgetting the passphrase means losing the coins, job done.  For exchange, I'm in Europe so Lykke is super simple, on your mobile, and withdraw to your bank.Want to get crypto easily? Dump Facebook and jump on steemit, put your blog there and get paid, I got my gym instructor on there and she made hundreds of dollars.Let's face it most of us are nerds, we get tangled in the joy of the tech too much.  Just show people how simple it is to actually use.
1	1523254549	7	When you hold cash you are your bank. Most people I know ask me why the fuck I carry cash. Most people 22 and under I know only use cash for nefarious purchases. This seems to me like a wall but I don’t know shit
2	1523255569	18	Therein lies one of the major fundamental arguments *against* cryptocurrencies that I've heard.Basically, people wonder why you carry cash, because a bank is much more secure and convenient. When you tell people about a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin for example, they wonder why you would use Bitcoin because using fiat and having a third party like a bank is a bit more convenient. Therefore, some company or entity will come around and try to bridge that gap between those people who just want simple banking, and Bitcoin. Those entities will try and make Bitcoin less esoteric and alleviate some of the barriers to entry for the average person. Then those entities basically become the giant third party intermediaries that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were created to be against.I don't agree with that argument, but it definitely is an interesting topic of discussion and point of contention that I've seen many people have over crypto.
3	1523269041	2	In your scenario you have to ask yourself why Fiat would be replaced by Bitcoin.
3	1523261148	2	People who don't trust banks won't wonder why you carry cash and that's kind of the target audience of bitcoin. Crypto banks will have a place in the market though, it's still empowering the user to decide on how much power they're willing to give up to intermediaries.
4	1523264107	2	If you believe crypto banks will have a place in the market, do you think it would turn cryptocurrencies basically into what we have today with fiat? Do you believe crypto banks will be beneficial to cryptocurrencies? Why or why not? I'm not attacking you, I just like hearing people's opinions on this topic.
5	1523268825	2	There will always be a bank type system because our entire culture is living outside our financial zone. People will always need to get a loan for a house or from a car or for something stupid like clothes. And someone will always be looking to capitalise on that greed. Ie by loaning money at an interest rate benificial towards them. Hopefully the difference in crypto will turn out to be that people who do not want to trust a bank with their money now finally have an option to move it "out" of any controlled enviroment. You will have gram and gramps that have a crypto bank that manages all the nitty gritty. And then you will have the people who dont have any interest in the bank and theu have full 100% control over how they spend their digital cash and who has access to it.

0	1523253904	12	Adoption will happen once it's as easy to use as credit cards and cash and still has the added benefits of crypto.
1	1523288555	0	Do you know what product is planning on native buy-with-credit-card implementation? BAT in Brave, baby.
0	1523246640	55	[Good read by founder of NEO and Nebulas -- semi-related to your thoughts](https://medium.com/nebulasio/crypto-bubble-2018-things-we-can-do-before-it-bursts-3a0d86fcd117)Basically stating 2017 was the year of "awareness" -- everyone now knows at least of Bitcoin. This year needs to be the year of adoption and scalability with real functioning dapps with users coming out. :) 
1	1523253814	14	This won't come for free. There needs to be a lot of effort, simplification and evangelization... The right product, user experience, seamless interaction.Remember for how many years we got "next year will be the year of Linux on the desktop" jokes. This never happened: there was no killer app, no reason to switch.  Yes,  you can say Linux is today ubiquitous - on servers side, in the core of Android - but it's desktop market share is still tiny.  This would mean blockchain being a successful technology, but no crypto currency in our pockets...
2	1523264790	7	Except Linux runs most phones and servers and although you don't see it. Its really everywhere and we will see the same with Cryptos. Just in the back and not knowing/caring
3	1523288578	3	I actually think this is also the most likely outcome for blockchain tech. I see the people on here thinking they'll be paid in crypto and buy hamburgers and pay rent in crypto to be the equivalent of the "year of the Linux desktop" people. Sure, you can do those things, and some people will, and there may be some advantages even, but for the vast majority of people in the Western world, there's just no reason to switch.I think crypto could actually revolutionize things for the "unbanked" and for people in financially oppressive counties, and it certainly will be used in "the backed" of the economy to some degree, but most people in the space seem to just want to make $$$ on another useless ICO, rather than solve these problems.
2	1523275800	2	This will never change. There are very few people that get UX right AND get to spend their time on the right project, even amongst the top paid companies otherwise you would see a lot more (former) "Apple" and "Google" companies.Proper UX not only takes talent, time and dedictation - it takes a lifetime and many many iterations to get it to a state where you can say ok (until the next iteration).Its hard to maintain as well, since it needs constant awareness of everyone involved and even more resources to stay like this.People laught about it all the time and deem it as non-important and/or think its easy to pull off because they manage to somehow spot it by using it.Its also insanely underpaid for (and its not the only area of perfection that is like this - look for example at smartphone cameras and their software performance - and Google's HDR+ algorhytm. Yet most people can't even distinguish the good from the bad including professional "review" pages like DxOMark - often since they are paid to write their shit).UX will funnily only truely blossom when AI takes  human stupidity out of the game (including my own). And thats a few decades away.
2	1523293966	1	Well, FreeBSD came before Linux, and now iOS is everywhere eh ?
1	1523294956	1	Thanks for the share, that's a really great write up. I think the idea that people will just suddenly switch from 'fiat' to cryto is fundamentally flawed. You can draw parallels with all kinds of things people have eagerly awaited through the years such as the mass adoption of Linux desktops or even a worldwide socialist revolution. The reality is people are far too busy with their own lives to really care and these things don't just suddenly take over on their own. They need to provide a value to people and they need to integrate with their own lives.That's why I think we'll only ever see crypto as a 'back-end' solution much like the web protocols  than something people consciously think about. I really don't think there's a crypto in existence today that does something better than anyone else (not just in theory, in reality), and integrates easily into people's lives. Until we do that, it'll forever be speculation.
0	1523253136	14	I feel this is quite true. Easy usage is very important. And I guess we all can be honest to accept that cryptocurrencies currently aren't exactly easy to use. First you have to find a way to buy crypto, then a way to store it properly, then figure out how to pay and how to accept coins and so on. I hope it'll get easier in the future to use cryptocurrencies. That there will be UI's that makes them very easy to use and very easy to manage. Because every day I have to think about how awesome it would be, to have a widespread accepted cryptocurrency you can pay with (for example). Just recently I've been on vacation. All the things you have to care about, taking cash with you to change, which credit card to use (which is accepted, which has the lowest fees ect), where will you be able to trade money and so on. Having a widespread used cryptocurrency for payment would solve all those issue. No matter what country you're in, no matter which shop, where you are... you are (should be) able to pay with a cryptocurrency with low or no fees at all. (That would be a dream!). And actually should be possible, right? It just has to become easier to use!
1	1523278461	1	First you have to build second layer networks and after that point you can build apps that are easy to use.That is the only way to achieve instant and cheap transactions without losing the ability to verify that no one is breaking the rules on the base layer (A.K.A. running a node).Looks like Lightning network is promising. As soon as someone like Bitpay or Coinbase will integrate second layer and merchant with an easy UI it will be possible to have mass adoption.people will want to use crypto.
1	1523281226	1	Everyone I know has a no foreign transaction fees credit card so that's not a strong argument either. I just use one Visa card and it's accepted everywhere. No thinking involved. Crypto will actually be a lot more of a pain in the ass for me.

0	1523255038	5	Easy usability requires a certain degree of social trust, to protect against cases of loss, theft, and to address issues of inheritence, etc.   What we need is the embedding of social relationships, including conflict resolution inside the blockchain. Users will be able to specify their trustees, and entail them a degree of power.   I've writen about it here:  https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7zonbc/the_revolution_cant_happen_with_shitty_ux/
0	1523256837	8	Cryptocurrency is inherently linked to cryptography and keys. Its primary benefits are undermined by oversimplifications or an all-powerful third party who protects you from yourself. We already have that model, and it's slick, easy to use and convenient, and it's called a bank, a credit card, paypal, etc.When you screw up your iTunes library, you can just resync, reorganize and redownload. When you screw up highly secure money and lock yourself out or get it stolen, there is no such recourse. So when you're the sole party in control of funds, there is a minimum required knowledge to prevent total loss. It cannot be responsibly dumbed down beyond that point. And when you're not the sole party, you've created counterparty risk and/or a situation where an authority could choose to confiscate your funds. The absence of these properties during normal, intended usage is one of the key features and purposes of crypto.
1	1523266681	6	I agree with this completely but this doesn't mean that we can't still dumb things down. This is wayyyy down the line but imagine having a single app that functions as a wallet and an exchange that hold/trades all cryptos with whatever pairs you want? Combined with an easy to use UI, mass adoption would be evident.And yes everyone will have their own public/private key but what if you could, for example, input a family or friends address and name it "Bob" - similar to how a name in your contacts is just a 9 digit phone number underneath. Crypto is currently mostly a grey area right now and we won't know what can and can't be done until things start ironing themselves out. I personally believe there will be options for people who prefer others controlling their money (at the price of easier usability) and people who prefer to do things themselves. If you look at binance, very soon they will have a centralized and decentralized exchange and it will be up to the people to choose which they want to use.
1	1523280799	1	Then crypto will never become widely adopted because people care about easy usage more than security.  If people really cared about security, they'd all be using Linux, Tor and other similar programs, but they don't.  Hell most people didn't flinch when Microsoft announced that Windows 10 had a backdoor.

0	1523255547	9	I’m sure some people once said the same thing about the internet 
1	1523271455	7	They did, and developers had to figure out how to make the internet user friendly. Even after the WWW debuted, it was almost impossible to use. Back in the mid-90s, services like America Online and Compuserve were enclosed playgrounds with no access to the rest of the internet. Users who wanted more had to install and configure a third party TCP/IP on their computers, which was complex and difficult. Now operating systems come with connection protocols already set up: they are "plug and play." That's where crypto/blockchain needs to get: "plug and play."
1	1523266268	1	Its like using ugly ie or using chrome/Firefox/vivaldi
1	1523287697	1	The internet was a fundamentally new way of relaying information and media that had obvious implications in the average person's mind.  Crypto is a fundamentally new way of approaching currencies (much less interesting to the average person) that doesn't have any obvious implications or purpose in the average person's mind.  Dapps is about as close to that as possible, but even then your average person or even people in crypto cant immediately see the immediate advantages of that platform over any other digital platform.

0	1523244700	31	This is why I invested into Request Network. It's a simple "pay with everything" button on websites that is designed to be easier to use than Paypal.Like [this](https://i.imgur.com/RJm2oC3.png) Pay with every crypto or fiat option and the store gets USD or whatever they want. So they can accept and support crypto without having to risk the votality of holding it.I think projects like this will usher in the next bullrun due to their easy-to-use factor like the ipod for MP3.
1	1523248729	4	i like req but i don't like the fact that the only point to holding the coin is for lesser fees. is there something im missing?
2	1523248963	4	I'm also curious about this. Could you shoot me a comment if you get an answer? I love the REQ problem but domt want to invest in it. 
2	1523256377	4	Fees of paypal are huge, so that's a big point actually. Another point could be transparency / auditing.
3	1523257041	6	again, i feel like no one is reading my comment. i have zero concern for the technology or cost of fees. what gives the token (req) value. if it is nothing other than req lowering fees, then there is no reason to hold req imo
4	1523265678	2	I think it's  got value because people expect it to go up in value as usage increases and supply declines due to burning. You are right that a token may not be needed in that use case  but it probably helps funding the project.
4	1523270305	0	you stopped reading after my first sentence maybe?
2	1523249463	5	Req is burned with each transaction. So with adoption the value will appreciate since the supply will decrease. 
3	1523249890	9	Yeah i get that but is that all to it? Is that even enough to make it worth holding req? I just dont see a reason why a token is even needed? It's a similar case to ripple where the token can be used but is not needed.
4	1523252290	10	isn't this basically every cryptocurrency ever?
5	1523264848	10	Not for utility tokens like OMG, the OMG token will be used to secure the network through Proof of Stake consensus; it is integral to building a fully decentralized and permission-less network . As is the same for ETH when they switch to PoS. 
6	1523293199	1	Pos actually does the opposite of what you are arguing for. Pos will just make holders hold more and not actually use the token for what it’s meant for. 99%  of “utility tokens” don’t actually have any utility. 
7	1523294519	1	That's not correct. The token is 'meant for' staking, thereby allowing a person to validate transactions; the OMG token isn't meant to be used as a currency- it can be, if people want to use it that way- but its utility by design is to add security to the network
5	1523255013	5	>ARK Fan
4	1523254327	1	Not really ... untill now there doesn’t exist a payment network or payment processor that was free. Req will be cheap but not free. Computing costs, developers cost. 
5	1523256976	6	please read my comment. my concern is not with the technology, it is with the tokens value. The technology can be great, but if the only thing giving the token (req) value is the fees, then there no reason to buy in
6	1523285523	1	As I understand, there's a fee (in REQ) for using the Request Network, but you don't have to manually buy REQ first before you can use the network, that happens behind the scenes. The fee is a fixed percent on your transaction. The fee on your transaction buys and burns the REQ that is required without needing your involvement. It is a plug an play kind of UX.So the incentive to hold REQ is not for lower fees on your own transactions, the reason to hold REQ is the understanding that as more tokens are burned, the more valuable the remaining supply is. The value of your REQ comes by selling it to the network to burn when facilitating other transactions. 
3	1523253378	4	sounds like a counterproductive model.  If they rely on transactions and rarity for the price to increase then there will be a limit to that once it reaches a value that no one is will to transact because everyone is waiting for it to go up.   It will be in stalemate thus no more transactions. If no one is transacting it then it is useless thus it will become worthless.
4	1523257546	3	The amount of req burned will be adjusted according to its value. The token burn is a way to ensure growth in the token value if the network is adopted. Any transaction on the request network, any crypto or fiat, will burn req on the backend, so you dont have to hold req to use the network. But i don't get what you are saying with it reaching a limit. Its the most basic economic model. As the demand increases, supply goes down and the price goes up. 
5	1523258617	4	> Its the most basic economic model. As the demand increases, supply goes down and the price goes up.Sure that works for commodities and assets, however since this seems like it is used for doing transactions (i.e. currency), that is not how currency works.  
6	1523271884	2	I agree. If REQ is trying to become a widespread payment/currency processor, burning their own tokens to reduce the supply is counterproductive to that goal. Burning tokens is only useful for those hoarding the tokens for gain rather than using them.
7	1523286146	4	The amount of REQ burned per transaction isn't a fixed token amount, it's a percent based on REQs value.  If your transaction fee is .01 cents for example and REQ is valued at .01 cents on the open market....then the fee is 1 REQ. As more REQ is burned, the remaining supply becomes more valuable though and drives the price per REQ up. So when REQ is $1, that .01 cent fee would only burn 1/100th of a REQ token. 
8	1523286381	1	Right, but my wider point is that there is absolutely no reason to burn tokens other than to drive the price up for speculators. In that case, it isn't really a payment system, but another speculative investment vehicle.
9	1523286934	1	The burn is what pays back investors (who funded development costs) and also the devs who work on the platform. So yeah, in an ideal world it could have been built altruistically with no fees, (so could every other product you use) but that would require someone to sink a lot money and time into developing it for free. That's not really how the world works. 
4	1523292301	1	Currencies that actually want to be currencies will only sucked if they stop trying to incorporate price action. RN reduces reply over time, causing deflation, meaning no one will want to actually use it as currency, thus it'll never actually be used for shit. 
1	1523269662	1	Poor example, just a button does not imply any simpler payment [than it already has been for years](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NseUl.png)Users still need to first have that crypto and understand it before using it with req (need easier Eth UI wallet for example) On the merchant side of it, there are allready lots of payment processors doing the difficult work. The core issue with adoption is not on this side of payments, it's in the core of the projects with hard to understand tech for holding (most people only understand coinbase for it's UI, not those difficult hardware wallets) and maybe even more important, the mining/staking. Getting fully decentralized means that even the avarage user should be able to support the network. This is where UI/UX needs improvement.
0	1523255669	3	The “netscape” of bitcoin.  Not sure how we make bitcoin usable by older/non-techie generation without a centralized custodian (coinbase pay or something).Maybe adoption really requires the next generation who never knew life without the internet and digital asset ownership is normal.

Currency is only the tip of the iceberg, everyone’s missing the mass that will be unavoidable soon.  People will be using products like these soon and not even know they’re using a blockchain. 
1	1523284444	1	This is what I've been saying. As a currency, yes, Bitcoin, Ethereum, whatever has a place. But I see vast ecosystems that will replace what we have. Google has everything that blockchain can replace. From money, to shopping, to hosting content, to aggregating content, to messaging, and even whole operating systems! I really love Ethereum and NEO because they're providing a space (that is also trendy and attractive to designers) that you can build ecosystems on. I just made a Steem account last week after months of probing and procrastinating, but after using it, I'm like "this feels good and could really replace what we already have, *because* it connects us to blockchain."
2	1523297876	1	You used Google as an example for what blockchain can replace, but is there some demand for this?  Honest question.  Blockchain in general is being overhyped for what it can do but not much reason (demand) for it.  My opinion anyways.  Unless it replaces some process cheaper and more efficiently (mainly for business, I don’t see much in the way for normal consumers) I think we will continue to see or come to the realization these coins we have aren’t really worth anything.
0	1523281421	3	Thank you. Those of us that have been in the space since 2012 have been saying this for seven years. ***But when you’ve got developers in charge of literally everything from start to finish, you end up with a product that nobody wants to use.***And this is a heavily developer dominated space. And they don’t play nice with the rest of the industry, usually. Case in point, [Bitcoin Core Devs](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf).This is why forks like bitcoin cash were created in the first place. The Core developers had [absolutely no concern for end-users, or usability](http://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-ceo-core-team-systematic-threat-to-bitcoin/).They cared nothing about Bitcoin staying competitive or relevant in the marketplace.  It truly became a debate between developers and business minded people.The devs wanted to write awesome code, to the detriment of the usability of Bitcoin. They outright rejected every suggestion we brought to them. Which is why forks of BTC were ever started in the first place. Marketers, business minded people, and those who understand the need for a good user interface need to have more influence over where this industry goes in the coming years.
1	1523288667	1	Do you know what crypto-related product has a user interface? Brave browser, baby.
0	1523295083	3	Hey there, thanks for stepping up for design, its always great to see. I'm the product design lead at a company called uPort (Decentralized Identity on Ethereum) which is a part of ConsenSys. Before uPort I worked on IBMs Hyperledger, and before that I wrote my thesis on Blockchain and Design. I've been thinking about this a lot over the years (actually, everday). I agree with your general point. Blockchain/crypto needs designers. However, I think there are a couple caveats here.Blockchains, imo, are still in beta. Maybe not bitcoin, but Ethereum for sure. For that reason, I at least understand why UX design is not at the forefront of many teams minds. Also, I bristle a little bit when I see dApps being marketed as production level products on what is still a beta platform. I am happy there are at least some designers here working on things this early in the ecosystem.Scalability is tightly bound to UX.  This was evident with CryptoKitties (there is some misconception here but that is a different topic). High transaction fees or slow blocktimes make things unusable. Devs need to solve this. Dealing with private keys is bullshit, but having private keys is necessary. In the case of Coinbase, you don't own your private keys. This might be great for UX and it may seem like a perfectly fine tradeoff for many of us in the western world, however this is untenable for people who can benefit most from blockchain: those in underdeveloped economies or living under oppression. At uPort, we currently use a biometric for ordinary transactions and use the seed phrase for account recovery. Storage of your seed phrase is another problem which we are trying to address with something we are calling Social Recovery which makes storage of the seed phrase feel more like a Social feature rather than a Security feature.To your point about about Jobs. As a designer, I have mixed feelings on Jobs. He had great insights, however he probably isn't the greatest model for designers. Jobs/Apple, at least in those days tended to assume a lot of things about what users wanted rather than reason from first principles. Also, in general, the comparison is a little different. When Jobs made his mark, computers worked as intended for the most part. The computing market was much more mature than the blockchain market currently is.Finally, a couple links. This is a funny/interesting article I bring up in my talks about design and blockchain (I've been focusing on Key Management as of late) and I think it echoes your sentiments.https://uxdesign.cc/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-the-ux-in-cryptocurrency-7262d2754713And finally, this is an article written by my friend an colleague, Sarah Mills about design and blockchain and what we are doing at ConsenSys (we are about 40ish designers deep at the moment and still growing, I imagine we have invested more into design than any other company in the space). https://media.consensys.net/designing-for-blockchain-whats-different-and-what-s-at-stake-b867eeade1c9

It's really easy to use and accepted almost everywhere I'd want to spend money.Crypto has a lot of problems which prevent it from reaching mass adoption, and one is that most cryptocurrencies are fundamentally at odds with what the majority wants.People don't care about ushering in a future free from banks and government regulation.  They don't care about a mythical, tax-free future.  They *like* banks and governments, because in the day-to-day they are a lot more convenient than crypto.  And they're a lot more convenient because they work within a system which is centuries old.A cryptocurrency will have a shot at gaining mass adoption when it becomes indistinguishable from its non-crypto competitors.
1	1523266005	1	So we need crypto banks and decentralized governments? 
2	1523266147	2	I don't know, but I think the key thing will be that at the ground level it looks just like everything else.  The spaghetti above the user can be anything - it's already a mess that your average person doesn't think about.
3	1523266273	1	I have been thinking that a replacement for MEW is due for Ethereum for example. 
0	1523257064	9	As a UX UI designer I have been approached by several crypto companies looking to design their product but non of them seem to set aside any realistic budget. The problem is that nobody from these teams understands design and think we just exist to make shit look pretty. It is a fucking joke to see what teams who have raised millions offer for design projects. Designers are the rock stars of crypto projects. Let me say that again. DESIGNERS are the rock stars of crypto projects. Not the shitty dribbble ones who make pretty shit but pros who make shit usable. It doesn't matter what kind of a super duper crypto project you create with your highly overpaid developers, if the thing is not usable by an average Joe then your product ain't going nowhere. If you are a team reading this, get that through your thick skulls. And don't fucking pm me for work, I don't work for free.
1	1523286154	2	Hahaha that dribbble comment. All the ones with the most likes aren’t even useable. I keep looking for ui/ux freelance work for crypto but there are hardly any either, let alone ones that pay at normal rates. 
2	1523286848	2	Yeah nobody is spending a dollar now. They scammed their millions and cashed at the bank to do minimum amount of work. Even the prominent coins and tokens are guilty. The big Chinese ones can't even hire a fucking translator lol.
1	1523263306	1	r/iamverybadass
1	1523287059	1	If you don't mind sharing, what is a price range that you would expect to be paid for similar work, and what is the price range you are being offered?
1	1523264154	1	> the rock stars of crypto projects.  Can it get any more cringe than that?
1	1523266623	1	Why would a programmer who is making an open source free wallet pay you when they get no returns. The guy I teamed up with understands this and we have agreed to split donations but we are not doing this for money, we are doing this for the community
2	1523274031	3	They wouldn't. Never said they should. I'm talking specifically about teams who have either raised capital or already had an ICO and have plenty of money to hire a UX designer. 
3	1523277595	1	Ah kk
1	1523271942	1	I am currently doing full stack development and I'm  convinced that cardano and Tron are shitcoins because they don't even have an Android app after a half year.Most work should be done back end, which the infrastructure should already exist.Programming is both easier and harder than people realize. The big picture is easy, the details are hard.No excuses to anyone in this space, anyone can program with enough time.
2	1523273213	1	I don't mean to dismiss programming as easy, I first hand understand that it takes a lot of patience to learn and grow as a developer. You guys make things work and there's no arguing that. It's just that design is often an afterthought whereas it should come first in product design. UX is not about thinking where to place buttons how many clicks are needed to accomplish that, while that's certainly something we consider. UX is about looking at your product and figuring out how to simplify it down to the most basic level. When things are really easy to use, you know a designer did his or her job. Making things easy is hard work and takes practice, testing and iteration. I think if more developers realized that and works hand in hand with designers then we'd be much further along in crypto today. I hope people reading this take note and really consider starting with design first. My last post was more or less to get attention. I don't actually think of anyone as a rockstar, guru or a ninja haha and despise anyone who seriously thinks that way about themselves. 
0	1523250759	2	Very good point, OP. Although I think we have to restructure the underlying architecture to "get rid of" passes, phrases, private keys, million digit addresses and replace it or at least build on top a system with more user friendly elements like email/username/passwordI am pretty sure there is a coin which plans to tie addresses to the username of your choice. I genuinely forgot its name though
1	1523256307	1	No coin is needed, lookup Ethereum name service (ENS). 
1	1523283616	1	Divi
0	1523253971	2	I think a phone with a secure element and an ipod-simple interface would be great.I feel like the techie types in crypto are very much heavy PC users and don't realise many people barely touch a PC anymore, and do most web-related stuff on phones.
1	1523278341	2	That's also beneficial for worldwide adoption. Many third world countries have phones but no computers. 
2	1523279584	1	Yeah. Like here in China people are very open to mobile payments and are almost cash free in some cases, but many people are migrant workers who use their phone for everything. 
0	1523254081	2	Wallets are the interface.
0	1523254133	2	Needs to be easy and cheap to buy/sell, send, and store.  And people need to feel secure that it wont go missing/get hacked.
0	1523256545	2	Thumbs up for ETHOS Fam.
0	1523261105	2	I think scalability actually is the product.Cryptokitties was rapidly growing in adoption until Ethereum's scalability limits began to push fees up and limit how many transactions people could do. Before hitting the scalability limits, MetaMask was getting something like 100,000 installations a day.Ethereum has several scaling initiatives being developed, including sharding for the main chain, Plasma sub-chains, and [semi-centralized Dappchains](https://medium.com/loom-network/loom-network-sdk-alpha-release-first-5-dappchains-announced-sdk-roadmap-1dddec789004). Once they are widely deployed, a DApp like CryptoKitties could see global mass-adoption.
1	1523281594	2	No.  Scalability is not the product. Scalability is the technical need that facilitates the product. There’s a huge difference. And it’s important to internalize that.Here is how you should think of it: Will scalability by itself result in usability? No.***You can’t have usage without scalability. But you can have scalability and no usage.***Therefore scalability is not the product.
0	1523267904	2	So, I'm going to dredge up my comment from this thread:https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7ljpp4/the_market_decided_to_have_a_steam_sale_of_its_own/But on top of that, the winner is going to be the first big bank that integrates purchasing and managing cryptos like any other online banking service.  Dealing with wallets and all the other technical babble has to be completely invisible to the average joe.  It has to be as simple as it is with regular banking and mobile payments.
0	1523270945	2	100% agree we need to dumb it down so much that even a 10 year old can understand how to use itthis is why credit cards became so popular you essentially just carry a plastic card which is swiped and you are set ofc theres more to it than that but point is its so easy and simple to use we are currently not there yet
0	1523271882	2	Every time I read a post about how a person has half their passphrase in one vault and the other half in another vault and how access to these vaults is managed through some complex process *and* people still reply with how this is still a vulnerability in some random attack, I realize one thing:  no way is any of this ever succeeding. User interface is important but there is another thing missing from crypto:  use cases.  You see, when the idea of credit cards came along, the banks tried it in a few limited areas and literally expanded to all of US with HUGE market penetration within 10 years from that first test.  There were clear benefits to using a credit card.  Right now, the biggest good use case for crypto continues to be ransomware and illegal purchases.  Realistically speaking, no one gives a damn about blockchain if all it means in practical terms is no refunds, no charge backs, no recourse when things go wrong, no tracability, no accountability, and no cash back.  It's worse in every way except privacy.  The thing about financial privacy is that governments ultimately control financial privacy and cryptos can't really count on offering this to any meaningful extent for long.We need to find good use cases for blockchain.  Even if user interface sucks, people will jump through many hoops if there is a point to jumping through hoops.  
1	1523287271	1	40% of the world population is unbanked (so no credit cards), they just have bills, when they are lucky it's USD, when they are not it's the local shitty unstable currency with high inflation.For those people having access to a stablecoin on their phones for example would be a huge leap forward in terms of financial security and transaction opportunities.Also most of the "issues" you listed concerning charge backs/refunds/recourse are easily solvable with escrow, invoicing and reputation mechanisms which are either already here or developed through smart contracts as we are talking.Cryptocurrencies have a usecase as long as there are people believing they have one and this population is not shrinking.
0	1523275503	2	You nailed it. But it takes 99 versions (respectively iterations) before the killer application spawns imo
0	1523278231	2	UX design for crypto apps is incredibly difficult. When making the portfolio app [BitUniverse](https://www.bituniverse.org) we've found that it's a very delicate balancing act between making something that's clean and understandable, and giving users all the information they need at one time.For example, our landing page is the user's portfolio overview page. The idea of this page is to give users a top down overview of their entire portfolio, so we have statistics showing daily profit, total balance etc, and even a graph so that people can easily see at a glance how their coins have been performing over the past month. Below that we have some specifics of held coins, but we can only include a limited amount of data before the screen starts to look cluttered.This is a difficult issue that a lot of apps in this space need to solve. A lot of them are financially oriented and therefore intrinsically complicated, so working out how to make things as easy as possible for users to learn & use on a daily basis requires a lot of time and experimentation.
0	1523278567	2	>the idea of wallets and private keys are bullshit. think about how scary that is to a normal person.We have bank accounts and debit cards w/ ePay, how is that any different?>think about it like your points card at Target.Check out how starbucks does it...it is really easy....or even jaxx.....It is getting there, people just do not see the bigger picture and just want whatever is "mainstream"
0	1523278627	2	I also remember when I didn't know how to use an MP3...Same concept applies?
1	1523281328	2	jesus christ! i need to know how a whole computer works to listen to mp3's??!!?? i just want to put my 8 track cassette in a player and hit the play button. /ssometimes people just have to suck it up and learn something new.
2	1523289129	2	Exactly my point!
0	1523280470	2	The buzzwords work good on newcomers. When I first got in I admit I feel for all the stupid "gen 3 coin" "higher tps" bs that you hear. It's not that tps isn't important, it's just that it gets shouted as the only thing that matters half the time.As far as mainstream, yeah we're a ways away. Just the fact that you can have for instance bitcoin and someone says "send it to this address" and it's a bitcoincash address, you just loose your money. There is just way too much going on to make it that easy for people coming in.
0	1523285700	2	Entirely correct OP.  Bitcoin is a completely stable and proven anchor point for storing the final Confirmation Hash of almost anything a person could want.  All we need are good apps anchored to that proven blockchain.There is little need for other altcoins.
0	1523287108	2	The "UI's" are coming..
0	1523294853	2	Metamask is the closest thing to adoption that we have.You all can hate on centralization all you want, but crypto won't be adopted until there is a safe space to use it in.Why the fuck should I buy your toaster with crypto when you wouldn't ever have to send it to me and I can't get a refund?"User Reviews" are a BS method and we all know that. You can set up really easy scams that way. For example, legitimately sell 25 cheap items, then scam someone out of a 0.5BTC purchase.
0	1523244717	4	You're exactly right, and I hope we start seeing the start of this with the decade's end
0	1523245968	4	I agree absolutely.I’m a designer and would be willing to talk with a team who shared this perspective.
1	1523278794	1	My guess is Dash needs more people and have the budget to pay for them.
0	1523251356	3	Ethos is trying to give people usernames (among many other things). They likened it to the impact individual email addresses had on the spread of the internet 
1	1523263798	2	Individual email addresses were the first form of digital identity though so their impact was massive. I don't think that applying user names to wallets or whatever they're doing will have the same impact somehow.

0	1523276293	3	This post get's allot of upvotes. I wonder how many of the upvoters here realize that is what Dash is laser focused on, in fact it's going to be easier to use than Coinbase, in time there will no more public-keys an private key's, accept for in the background, because you register, any name you want, once Dash evolution is live, like say your phone-number, email adres, nickname, and so on, and unlike Coinbase its going to be completely decentralized.  In fact you could set your account up to sent you you're lost password to your email address, all of this and more is in the works..  Unless your project is going to copy&past the code, there are not going to have it, because it's tons of work, which Dash is able to do thanks it's paid by the blockchain, and voted in by the holders of the coin to make this user-friendly platform a reality.

2	1523280482	1	Seriously when will guys like you stop, you should know Dash Core Group is now legally owned by the masternodes.https://www.dashforcenews.com/dash-core-group-becomes-first-legally-dao-owned-entity/Your attempting to FUD Dash, you guys are part the reason why Dash is not getting the credit it should(I know that why you do it). It's so much easier to shout FUD, SCAM and so on, and people move on the the next coin that does not get this level of shit over it.You should know I keep a record, of people like you that Slander, with Dash Core Group being legally owned, by the masternodes, and more good stuff, they took the time to research and got defence opensource patent's on tech they developed, so that guys like JP Morgan can't take it from us.   As time goes by, it will also be possible to sue people like yourself for slander, when and if that time comes if nobody else will do it I'll pay for the proposal.Furthermore Dash is funding multiple projects in country's such as Venzualla and Zimbamwe, so they can use Dash instead of the currency's that inflate by 1000%+ per year.   .   Seriously what have you done for the World. ? Except lie, and slander a solid project ? 
0	1523247217	4	Pillar project is doing exactly what you are describing. Designing UI that will make it easy for a grandma to understand. They are even calling it the grandma wallet.

1	1523248622	0	Pillar is great. Would like to see them pushing out more code though.
2	1523283060	1	They are at least constantly producing content that shows what they are doing unlike most projects 
0	1523255696	2	exactly what I thought. I've been into programming and building computers for 20yrs and I thought wtf?! how's anyone normal supposed to use this shit. wallet UI is rediculous, blockchain explorers are huh?!, sending to these 'addresses' like how about something that looks like an IP address at least? everything about crypto is fucked cause its made by some no getting laid no sunlight ass fuck.
1	1523278611	1	The look of the address makes a difference to you? Characters are characters. 
2	1523282435	2	Facebook.com vs. hebenskhf6784sjdn688.com makes a difference. Especially when mistyping the latter could have grave consequences. Maybe a small one depending on the product, but I think it’s a question of small conveniences that come together to improve ease of use.
3	1523282480	2	That's not the same as an IP address. 
4	1523282645	1	Lol sorry misread the posters comment, now I don’t know what the fuck they’re talking about. Though maybe just in terms of the fact that we’re used to “sets” of numbers, like in an IP or telephone number, the long undifferentiated chain of numbers/letters in a key can be pretty daunting. Wasn’t ethereum trying to do something similar to making keys look more like urls? 
5	1523286896	1	yea, you got it. basically the public address never has to be seen. (your addr being videodhara.btc would work just fine), but they want to pretend its more private or 733t haxxor shit to have things complicated.I will never write down or hand type an address, which leaves me vulnerable to copy/paste attacks. there are so many high tech aspects to crypto which should remain unseen to the casual user, aka 99% of the population.
0	1523262733	1	Your general gist is correct, user friendly usability = adoption.This is why the sensible cryptos (*cough*NANO*cough*) are working hard on mobile wallets, integrated payments from mobile, desktop wallets which 'hide' most of the hard thinking and make themsleves foolproof.Nobody is adopting a crypto where you can lose all your money just by accidentally sending money in the 'wrong' way. We're looking at you, IOTA.
0	1523272103	2	> where is the simple stupid marketplace? it doesn't exist.This is exactly what the people working on Dash keep saying we need both security and ease of use and they are working on that.
1	1523277863	2	Agreed. Dash has been saying it for years and they have been developing toward a simple payment platform that leverages the advantages of blockchain to give dash a small competitive edge over paypal/venmo.  This board is now just realizing how insanely difficult adoption is. 
2	1523278523	2	I do hope they realize it. Centralized systems will otherwise beat decentralized crypto systems (centralized systems might partially use crypto to do it).
2	1523280776	1	I have plenty of concerns about Dash, but they certainly do have a great wallet UI. 
3	1523281792	0	Please do ask all you concerns, I be happy to take them away. The current Dash UI, is not where we are talking about do, we are talking about Dash evolution, which is still being build.    .    Is see your a member of Monero, they tell an insanely amount of lies, slander, fud about Dash, seeing their reddit is 5x larger, it's not strange at all that you have probably a wrong image about Dash. I am 100% certain all these concerns can be effectively take away. But I must warn you if you open it you may start to dislike Monero's dev team and community behavior.

2	1523286171	0	Dash would be one of the most long running scams in history, right ?Anyway... they are creating technology that other crypto currencies pick up and use. Be it X11, masternodes, etc.Based on that it would be a very elaborate scam if it is.
3	1523286310	1	Ok, "SilentLennie".   While Dash does have some merits, it does have shady past.    People should be free to learn about it.    Plus I'm still not sure about how things like this will work out in the future:    https://steemit.com/dash/@supernimity/dash-and-corruption-to-the-core
4	1523286452	1	Yes, I'm shutting up on this topic. I suggest people form their own opinion on this topic.
0	1523251040	1	good points  .. but this is the beginning for adoption and it will evolve eventually to something where it can be widely use.
1	1523281554	1	That not necessarily true, once project/coins take certain design decisons, this are impossible to change, back.  For example TCP/IP has no build in privacy, if we would rebuild the internet communication protocals again from the ground up, that would be added, furthermore we would not have started on IP4 but much more likely on something like IP6.  . If you not a software coder this my be hard to understand, but think of it like this, building a house without piles into the ground, if you want to add piles later on you'll have to completely break down the house, and start all over again, and once people start living/using that house your not going to do that. 
0	1523253364	1	Bingo 
0	1523253629	1	It's hard to find good design on the cryptoverse other than webpages made all with the same bootstrap layout.Coinbase has done a great job, and that's why it's so popular. On desktop, Exodus Wallet is the best one I've seen so far.But you are right, there's a long way ahead
1	1523272272	3	Glad I am not the only one who noticed that just about every project's site has the same layout. Different background colors, but the same damned layout. It's like they are buying a prepackaged site and just tweaking a little.

I don't think people realize how early on this is. This wouldn't even be qualified as a project to release to the public yet. It'd be more of an mp3 device that was still in R&D at this point if you were going to try to use that comparison.

1	1523268912	1	Because we are the majority in any given field. If you cater only to the faithful few you are cutting a humongous user base. Which, of course, is a very legit thing to do.
2	1523276875	1	promoting something with a learning curve isn’t a big deal. there’s 14 year olds in this space that understand the concept of blockchain.

0	1523269741	1	I'd probably agree with you on that too. I  see a general trend that  systems  ( computer science and living organisms) tend towards centralization as they become more complex. Centralization has advantages in that it can reduce replication and be more efficient.  There will be exceptions which proof the rule, successful crypto  might share their characteristics.
0	1523271683	1	Decentralization is everything. You are wrong in your estimation as stated here. Saying that, I understand your sentiment. It is just focused in the wrong area as an end goal. Crypto currency is just a small piece in a larger scale of societal development that will hopefully lead to a full scaled decentralized society.

0	1523272769	1	If this were true, Coinbase should be the platform of the future right?Wrong, it’s shitty and underdeveloped *so* the masses can use it.In your MP3 example, you say that the product which ultimately won out was the simple/stupid large storage device. That’s not false, but it’s also not really that Apple won out so much as the tech literacy of your average user grew to the point something like Apple products became possible. First you get early adopters on the most basic, unrefined software, then you get more mainstream people on only marginally better stuff, and after they have struggled through learning how to use that for ages, someone comes up with a simplified version for the rest of the world. The early adopters and first mainstreamers who used the crappy first versions are essential to the process, as they become promoters and teachers for everyone else.We don’t just get to jump to crypto being a mature industry with widespread adoption. We have to get through the CD player phase first.
0	1523272806	1	Exactly my thoughts a few days ago. I can't buy crypto without giving ID card, and 5 different id proofs.... Wtf? Just check it out how much easier it is to sign up and use paypal.

0	1523273524	1	I understand what you're trying to say but >the idea of wallets and private keys are bullshitThat's just silly... it's a necessary part of crypto.  That's like telling a car company they don't need to be focusing on wheels.  Or to stick with the music metaphor--"the idea of audio codecs and compression is bullshit"If you want to abstract it away to the user through UX that's fine, but you can't just dump the idea of private keys to "simplify" it.  What you're talking about is ultimately more complicated from a process standpoint, not less.The issue is that people who got rich got greedy and spent all the profits on lambos and stripper poles rather than reinvesting the returns in good ideas. I agree they should have been hiring designers and trying to bring a real product to market, but they brought in a bunch of dumbass finance bros who only know how to suck the value out of things, not create it.

This is exactly how I feel when I try to remember where all my wallets and keys are and how I can access my dozen different coins.

0	1523276013	1	Steve Jobs focused on having the best technology as well. The Apple II, Next, IPhone. All had tech well ahead of the competition.Yes, UI is important. I absolutely agree Crypto is too difficult for the lay person to use. It needs to be as universal and simple as sending an email. It’s getting there. Crypto is just 9 years old. It’s a revolutionary concept. It’s a digital commodity and money that exists solely digitally.

0	1523279506	1	When it comes to the topic of adoption... I think there is a difficulty in comparing cryptocurrency to things like WWW or MP3 players, in that security is a key aspect.Look at the public adoption of PGP/GPG email encryption as an example. Next-to-zero adoption because it's still a UX nightmare for the general public. But the general public, *does* use encrypted messaging, on Facebook where Zuckerberg holds the keys, mines your data and send it to the NSA. And likewise, the general public *will* broadly adopt BTC transacting on the Coinbase/GDAX private ledger while us nerds use on-chain transactions.That's just my 2 satoshi from what I've seen and my newbie understanding. Feel free to ignore.Full disclosure: I am a pessimist.
0	1523279777	1	These are the type of problems we're trying to fix at BlockIDE.comWe believe that UI is the experience.  
0	1523280239	1	We are in that stage, you're trying to go move to fast.
0	1523281352	1	Stabilize the market. It’s a currency as risky as the stock market. With nothing of value backing it. All it takes is for countries to start outlawing it and businesses to stop taking it for it to fade into obscurity. Yea. Accessibility and UI will help with adoption but nobody with a brain wants to invest long term in a pump and dump playground.

0	1523284163	1	> I still feel like I have to power up a hamster wheel in the back of my mind even if there is a bitcoin checkout [Remember these?](https://i.imgur.com/5prIR2C.png)Credit cards used to be a pain in the ass to use everywhere. They still are in many use cases.Paying with a check is still a pain in the ass.If the tool is useful, people will use it even if the UI is ugly.If you really think "the user interface is the product", then make a wallet that's just a shiny GUI with no code behind it and see what reception it gets.Apple's success is based on copied features and deceitful marketing / scare tactics like "What's a computer?" (it's what Apple is charging too much for) and "Macs don't get viruses!" (just like they don't get games.)The goal of crypto is to be sound money, not snake oil, so Apple's model is the opposite of what anyone in the sector should be going for.
0	1523284263	1	Hi there, I made a computer game and I'm making a website where you can pay in Ethereum through a Metamask wallet & receive a download key in seconds. I made a nice looking interface and it's easy to run the game once you download it. I believe these kinds of stores will be a significant part of crypto commerce.
0	1523284448	1	When moon? 
0	1523284744	1	On a serious note I think ease of use is actually limited to how cryptocurrency works in the first place and is a byproduct of the technology itself. Not sure how we get to ease of use with blockchain. 
0	1523284753	1	And what the fuck is the product then?
0	1523284797	1	Buying crypto is no harder than buying stocks, yet that’s a multi trillion dollar thing.  Using some coins is as easy as scanning a QR code.  The only thing that needs fixing is UI, and there are many wallets who now have an easy to use UI
0	1523285330	1	A project called [Nimiq](https://nimiq-testnet.com/) is trying to solve that by allowing people to directly generate wallets and mine through you web browser without downloading any software/extension.It should be released before the end of the month, hopefully it will be able to lower significantly the barrier for the average user.That said there will always be some trade-off between security, control over your fund and accessibility, if you want something very easy to use and secure you will most likely have to outsource the control and if you want total control over very secured fund you will have to put some effort.
0	1523285545	1	I've been involved in crypto for a long time, but I think there is a common trope circulating crypto these days that far overstates the usefulness of cryptocurrencies.This post for example likens a product that was a huge and obvious improvement to existing consumer devices that was a product that masses actually saw the value in and wanted.  The general population is not seething for bitcoin, crypto or a new form of currency.  The general population doesn't even understand the usefulness of bitcoin or crypto, whereas the usefulness of mp3 players were pretty obvious, even if many people didnt know how they worked.Crypto currencies may pan out to be an important technology and may gain a high level of adoption, but even if they do it's not because the masses wanted it.  The only reason the masses want crypto right now (or at least did before the bear market) is because of speculation and FOMO.  I've seen multiple polls on twitter on pages in the crypto space and 75% of people are interested in crypto because of the potential windfall profits, not so much because of the tech or because of any usefulness in their daily lives.  >Mainstream adoption starts when it stops requiring an explanation*and has a use-case that the mainstream actually finds attractive
0	1523285856	1	10000TPS is not a product but a product feature. What will differentiate a coin from other is adoption. ETH is ETH today because of its adoption. How will the adoption come?- From power-packed features- From affordability (coins which pumps 10x from ICO are less affordable)- From robust marketing - From Technical enablement (again linked to features) Check out coins like TAU and DRGN which have everything and now all depends on their marketing. I HODL both. So far the ride is good, their teams are doing a great job.
0	1523285888	1	Glad someone finally said this.  
0	1523286083	1	I believe you are 100% correct in this. I didn't bother with crypto when I thought it was only an anonymous way to pay. It was to complicated for me to want to bother. So I missed buying bitcoin at 5 bucks. It wasn't until I heard you can make money that I bothered to wrap my head around it. Now I see its more than just a car cow. Though, I'm someone who is willing to jump through hoops with stuff like this, if I am interested. If u was the average Joe, I still probably wouldn't have bothered. So, I definitely agree 100%
0	1523286240	1	You have to understand why this is though--it's because blockchains absolutely need to prioritize security waaaay above everything else, including UI. This is why private keys and some systems are as complicated as they are. And with out this security Bitcoin would have never have gotten to 20k, because it would have been hacked long before that.Far too often in the history of software development security has been an after thought to customer facing features and general user experience. Satoshi was a visionary in part because he flipped this on his head and said fuck the user experience, we need to make this decentralized and secure first. Say what you will about bitcoin and it's flaws, if nothing else the core blockchain itself has proven to be extremely secure over the years--it's only the centralized exchanges that have been hacked. While I agree that modern blockchains need better user facing features, we still need security to be number 1. Besides, if we had good UI we still don't have a solution for scaling on truly decentralized infrastructure yet. No point in having a good UI to attract users if the systems can't even handle them anyway.
0	1523286640	1	Well as people will earn ENJIN coins while playing they will get into cryptocurrency without them knowing. One day hey will find out these ENJIN coins can be exchanged for other coins for buying products or services. Even sending coins by email exists already.
0	1523287045	1	Of course, out of 1400 odd cryptos, only a handful lead the market. ETH has a few cents last year, it has taken quantum leaps. BTC was a few hundred dollars. We need to find the next ETH. Many says its NEO, ICX, ADA or TAU. Luckily, I have all 4. They are equally solid and have the capability to be in the Top 10.
0	1523287743	1	Best post in a long time. Totally and completely agree. It was the thing I noticed from day 1 as to why this wouldn't catch on the way things are. It's fucking terrifying. 
0	1523288440	1	Crypto definitely has a lot of growing to do. I personally find it irritating that there are so many wallets with some coins needing their own proprietary wallet that managing everything becomes one big headache. We need a much better and more user friendly solution to private keys and wallets.
0	1523288509	1	*"think about how scary the crypto user experience is to a normal person"*The normal person doesn't deal with wallets or keys. They send money to an exchange like Coinbase and buy and sell tokens. That's the total user experience.
0	1523289097	1	The technology is there but even with a nice UI, people still need a reason to use crypto over fiat and their banks.
0	1523289381	1	This is correct, crypto space is still too technical for an average Joe. People talk about global adoption when a lot of people don't know the basis of a PC, or in general, are lacking that "nerdy spirit". When crypto becomes as easy as using Facebook, which as you can see even old people can (until a point, even though mess-ups happen), that's when we can start dreaming about global adoption.
0	1523289530	1	It’s not the same. Many MP3 players all did the same thing, they played mp3s. Different cryptocurrencies have different use cases.
0	1523290280	1	I think CoinText somewhat describes what you're talking about.It allows anyone with a phone (it doesn't have to be "smart") to receive money instantly, and it's simple! A phone number can send and receive without having to worry about derivation paths or wallet service URLs, and if someone really has to, the person can request the private key by texting *PRIVATEKEY* to their CoinText number, but it's never required!Honestly, that's the best one could ask out of a cryprocurrency service, the bare necessities: the balance, sending, and receiving. All of which are commands an individual can do. CoinText automatically sorts the fees, so the user only has to worry about sending how much, and to whom.

Canou app for nano has addressbook and QR codes.IMO your biggest issue right now is that the on/off ramp is very difficult. On off ramps should be in an app just as simple as normal bank apps.
0	1523251823	1	That is NANO's aim. 
0	1523248767	2	This is a terrible argument. What about enterprise solutions that save tons of time/money for corporations? Or smart contracts? It doesn't matter if some mouth breather can understand it or not. 
1	1523250231	7	I don't think your argument and OP's are mutually exclusive. Enterprise solutions are great, even though I believe that pertains more to blockchain technology rather than cryptocurrencies. OP is addressing adoption from the general public. 
1	1523251354	3	People in corporations need to be able to use the enterprise solutions. People need to be able to write and use smart contracts. Great tech is truly great when it's easy to learn, use, and benefit from. UI is the gateway for users to be able to connect with and leverage technology.
1	1523253442	1	Enterprise solutions are better solved with hashgraphs rather then blockchain because they don't need anything to be public.
0	1523245691	1	You are right but I think many people already know this. The problem is: Which of all these cryptocurrency ideas and companies is the next Google, Amazon, Uber, etc.?
0	1523250345	1	New US based exchange CoinStocks.io is focused on user friendly UI. No difficult graphs. Just easy pairing and trade. That's the way to reach new investors. Check demo on there website and feel free to give feedback here.
0	1523254216	1	Unfortunate, but I believe we are eventually going to store cryptos in bank accounts and banks will provide payment services working as a lightning network hub.
1	1523266432	1	Yeah that's a good point.  Do you think it's just a stage of adoption.? The internet used to be mostly available in libraries and universities and cars used to run on cobbled roads made for horses.
2	1523268911	2	I think we are addicted to convenience. Once we taste it we can never live without it.  Crypto currencies gives us the convenience to create digital tradable programmable assets. No matter how many times we get hacked or scamed we will never go back. However, nobody cares about Privacy, Security or Decentralization.  We have ways to communicate privately through P2P but we (the crypto community) choose to use Reddit, Slack, Telegram, Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Github etc.  I don't know if the end game will be a centralized digital currency like XRP or just a centralized entity managing are bitcoins but I believe centralization will be involved.
1	1523272646	1	That would be sad and unnecessary, we can solve it and we still have time to do it.
0	1523259978	1	lol  
0	1523286257	1	***EOS is the product.***
0	1523253346	0	You are wrong, because we 're not talking about music but money, and especially about a protocol that will move one day the equivalent of trillions dollars.THE PRODUCT IS AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN SECURITY WITH NO NEED OF TRUST.It seems you didn't understand the importance of the invention of Satoshi Nakamoto.The first layer is not for the public, it is the protocol.Speed and ergonomics are important, but it needs to be built on second or third layers. See how internet was built.
1	1523272741	1	You need both security and ease of use.
2	1523277403	1	Of course, it is the final goal. But if you need to prioritize your development, security is much more important.
3	1523278155	1	Are you saying currently there are blockchain users somewhere in the world who are loosing money right now because the blockchain systems are not safe ? I think if we adhere to cryptographic agility we aren't doing all that bad in the security space.
4	1523281549	1	You have not heard of the attack on Verge 4 days ago ?
5	1523284063	1	Missed that sorry, I was doing other things than following crypto every day. :-(But Verge is basically the first right at this level ? At least of the more traditional PoW crypto.
6	1523285762	1	No.Search Ethereum dao hack for example. Bitcoin has been hacked at the begining and  is attacked everyday since his creation. You can't tell if your coin car survive a major attack if it never happened.
7	1523285939	1	I would consider DAO hack to be the result a non-traditional crypto failing. But I now understand what you mean.
1	1523270183	0	Or just get it right on the primary layer the first time. C.f. Nano.
0	1523258808	0	REQ is what you are looking for.  Doesn’t require anyone to use private keys or addresses or know anything complicated at all.  Just a wallet and pay by request button on a website that they authorize. People can use crypto and not even know they are using crypto.  Read more about it and see.
0	1523246924	-3	the kin app is going to propel cryptocurrency into the next stage of adoption. check it out:[1](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*lvvmDZHA56mVv9nf7qpj1g.gif)[2](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*RImX5qQ3ANb_iJea0WFTyQ.gif)[3](https://i.imgur.com/OqJY6P8.png)[4](https://i.imgur.com/IYENRrh.png)[5](https://i.imgur.com/x36a9Kj.png)[6](https://i.imgur.com/B0RQxfi.png)
1	1523262698	1	I don't see the appeal to be honest.
0	1523251222	0	Syscoin's blockmarket web may be be a first step. It's not been released yet though so it doesn't really matter. Just thought I'd mention it.  
0	1523264050	0	WAVESPLATFORM = A PRODUCT!It has  multiple use cases.Very well designed product.IncentivesUser friendly "blockchain for the people"I suggest to check it out. The only actual useful platform i started to use within the crypto sphere.check it out for yourself.
0	1523251752	-1	Sooo....Buy verge??? /s
0	1523249380	-1	But but cardano
0	1523254379	0	This should be upvoted into the thousands
0	1523254534	0	Great post. Crypto won’t see widespread adoption until I can pay with it on major platforms like eBay and Amazon. Right now I can pay for things online with credit, PayPal, Apple Pay, etc. but when I can with bitcoin or nano or litecoin, only then will we see widespread adoption. 
1	1523285210	1	Not likely, unless you're willing to use centralized wallet services for these coins. Please take a long at the wavesplatform and Dash is upcoming Dash evolution, does are decentralized platforms 
0	1523257966	0	That needed to be said
0	1523258193	0	Oh there‘s already Neblio which aims to do exactly that. They try to do everything as easy as possible so people who want to create their own token(for example for use in their firm) do not have to get some crypto specalists anymore.
0	1523259645	0	Nimiq is brining apple-level UX to blockchain, mainnet launching shortly, try out their testnet briefly:https://nimiq.com/
0	1523264063	0	This.
1	1523264067	1	That.
0	1523268977	0	Easy to say, but we are shifting from a philosophy where a 3rd party controls our money, to us having control.  If people want freedom from corrupt rule, then responsibility is necessary
0	1523270539	0	Trust is the product?
0	1523272057	0	Heh. This just shows how little people know about OMG.
0	1523273985	0	Binance has really good UI as well. 
0	1523275565	0	# Lisk is hiring designers! Whoever feels he has the necessary skills, wants to move to the super creative city Berlin and wants to work within the space on a cryptocurrency project. Apply at careers @ [lisk.io](https://lisk.io)!
0	1523282716	0	Uh... you should stick to fiat then?
0	1523284376	0	The "simple stupid marketplace" will exist when Syscoin launches version 3.0. They have been around for almost 4 years, and were the first decentralized marketplace in the game. I'm personally a huge fan, and think more people should know about Syscoin. (ICO platform, decentralized marketplace, soon-to-be dAPP platform.)
0	1523251766	-1	Right but by the time that happens btc won't be 7k
0	1523253443	-1	i think this guy missed the train
