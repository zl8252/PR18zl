Submission title: Since Monero hard forked the other day, its network hash rate has been significantly reduced, going from over 1 GH/s to ~157 MH/s. This is proof that Monero's network has been comprised of mostly ASICs silently running in the background, and not botnets.

0	1523224743	267	This Monero development team needs to start getting the respect they deserve.  Shit coins be shit coining and meanwhile Monero keeps developing, delivering and staying true.  A private, untraceable, community funded,  decentralized, open source asic resistant, no nonsense currency for everybody.  Privacy is not a crime.
1	1523240659	50	Literally the only coin that is worth anything right now.
2	1523246512	33	Literally, Monero is the only real money we have right now.
2	1523240966	19	I only give 3 coins any credit BTC, ETH, maybe XMR.Good to see XMR continue to perform
3	1523286672	2	The crypto trifecta
3	1523243665	-12	BTC is a standard, but kind of stinks. Eth hasn't really done anything (cryptokitties doesn't count) , but XMR is private and is used.
4	1523245225	4	God I cringe at this sub because of people like you. Very convincing argument, “is used”.
5	1523248652	-1	Well then go back to r/bitcoin where you are safe from negativity 
6	1523249998	5	There is a difference between negativity and stupidity. I am still waiting for a definition of “is used”. Please oblige me.
7	1523250110	0	People actually pay things with it.
8	1523250868	4	Oh really, Monero must be the only one. My mistake.
9	1523257308	-1	The most widely used? Yeah.
5	1523259422	-1	Hahaha that is the point of a crypto why so salty ?
4	1523262144	1	BNB is an erc20 token.
4	1523255136	1	youre right about bitcoin. but people here don't generally know much about crypto.
4	1523253833	-5	Electroneum had several times the numbers of transactions of XMR in only few months. A lot of people are holders of this .. what can you say about that ?
5	1523264326	2	ETN-devs did some stupid changes in the fee-system and kinda broke their own blockchain... so no thanks
6	1523274087	2	What are the stupid changes in the fee-system ? If there is something wrong I am sure it is going to be fixed.
7	1523274361	2	more info here: https://np.reddit.com/r/Electroneum/comments/88wbkv/electroneum_is_probably_under_a_51_attack_right/and here: https://np.reddit.com/r/Electroneum/comments/88wbkv/electroneum_is_probably_under_a_51_attack_right/dwnysio/Anyway, wouldn't trust any crypto that has more marketeers than developers and does fake mining... good luck!

9	1523277417	1	Lol, fudsters... It's fine now but it was pretty f-ed up if you ask me... Nothing against airdrops per se, but if you engage in fake mining, no wonder your blockchain can be easily attacked... They didn't choose to ALSO market it, they chose to copy monero, slap on another name and ONLY market it. ETN is a crappy shitcoin and their devs don't know what they're doing.anyway, to each his own opinion, best regards,
1	1523261087	-4	Lets not forget what happened last spring. Monero trolled all their investors by pumping the price due to hyping news, then when the day came they said it was a joke, causing the price to fall 50%. Probably a lot of insider shorting was done that day. Many people bought monero because they believed in the project then they see it going down 50% due to what they did.
2	1523261740	17	The dev didn't hype anything. He said "don't buy monero as an investment" and it crashed the price. But Monero isn't trying to make people rich. Its trying to actually be a currency. Which no public blockchain can be. You can't have a currency without fungibility. At least that was my understanding. Feel free to correct me if im wrong. 
3	1523264206	-3	But it was still a pretty stupid move imo. This happened about when everything else was starting to go up, and it took Monero significantly longer to recover from those shenanigans than it should have. Coming from the dev that tweet was absolutely unnecessary Regardless I kept holding through the fluffyapocalypse. 
4	1523279379	1	It kicked few speculators out of holding Monero. That is all. A quite positive move. It was announced , that- markets are fickle- dont trust what some guy says on twitter.  It dont mean aynthing- you dont need to like people that work on Monero code hat you like Monero.- Monero is not your personal pump vehicle. It is an currency, not an ICO.- It is not in culture of Monero contributors to preanounce big news, since that is unethical.Fluffy announcement back then could not be more bullish.   I guess some just took it wrong way.
4	1523269639	0	I was happy with it. I got in shortly after that happened. It's all about timing. 
5	1523273053	4	Well sure, it benefited some. But it was a financial kick to the balls for me at that time. 
6	1523273991	5	The whole point Fluffy Pony was making was how absurd it was to make pre-announcements and how people just jump aboard with no details and just think they are going to be rich buying xyz. I wasn't a fan of how he did it then but after what happened at the end of 2017 with the giant dump, it was obvious how irrational people were back then (and really to this day). edit: typo
7	1523275291	2	I mean, I do understand the reasons, his opinion is valid. But his opinion also carries a lot of weight as people see him as de-facto code maintainer of Monero. I don't dislike Fluffy, quite on the contrary. I just think that something with the potential to cause a short crash in price should be approached with more foresight. Especially when it is also expected that investors in XMR donate to voluntary project funding.
2	1523269123	3	This is old FUD just taking out of context what really happened. It was merely a joke on all those scam ICOs of which now are mostly 99% already dead. The !Monero Enterprise Alliance! was a clear troll and a hint, but the stupid market was too dumb to understand that. The same market which bought Dogecoin and brought it to 1 billion market cap.
2	1523267349	1	So that's what Verge has been copying from Monero then? xD
1	1523256239	-1	bullish
1	1523242889	-2	[deleted]
2	1523243592	1	Get out of here with that shill
0	1523218157	91	In fairness there will be a good few miners or rigs that just haven't had a chance to update their miners, plus botnet operators will need updated coinhive miners released before their drone miners can be put to work.That said, yes there was apparently a significant portion of the hashrate being done by ASICs, Monero dev team have done a fantastic thing prioritising the PoW tweak over developing more flashy upgrades like bulletproofs. Any self respecting project should follow Moneros lead to get away from ASICs judging by the recent spate of 51% attacks.Well done Monero.
1	1523243426	10	You seem to understand it, so if you don't mind I have a question for you. How exactly do the botnets work?
2	1523246694	11	Botnets are a fleet on computers that usually un-knowingly are using their computing power the controller of the virus they are infected with. So in the instance I believe he means the computers who have been infected with a stealth miner that need to be updated by the virus controller
3	1523255515	2	What is ASIC? I keep seeing it, friend google, just looks like a mining kit. What is it?
4	1523256615	9	An ASIC means: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit. It is basically an algorithm that is implemented directly on hardware. A normal computer has a set of operations it can perform, and a computer program is simply like a recipe that says 'do this, do that, add this to that, etc'. This is very flexible and convenient, but also relatively slow because a computer can only do relatively generic things.An ASIC otoh can be 'baked' to implement those specific operations in hardware, on-chip. So it takes your input, feeds it into specific circuits that do all the dedicated computations, and then writes it in the output field. This is extremely fast, but also extremely specific. An ASIC can do only 1 thing, forever. If the algorithm changes, like monero now did, Those ASIC's all become worthless.ASIC solutions are also relatively expensive to create so they are generally used only for operations that are always the same, such as for example MP4 encoding, Bitcoin mining, etc.
4	1523257875	5	Rather than a general purpose integrated circuit (which could run an operating system, video games, a web browser, *anything*), it's an Application Specific Integrated Circuit. It can only run one application. A Cryptonote ASIC can only mine cryptonote coins and do nothing else. A SHA2 ASIC can only mine bitcoin and other coins with the same algo. They are much more efficient in terms of electricity consumed vs work done than a typical CPU or GPU.
4	1523256600	3	It’s a machine that’s hard coded to do one type of calculation really fast and efficiently. For example cryptonight ASICs mine cryptonight really fast. But the downside is they are hardwired so when the algorithm changes they are useless. 
4	1523256449	0	It's just a very efficient machine that mines and that's the only thing it can do. 
4	1523255773	-1	really powerful mining rig.
3	1523255492	1	Thank you for the help, it seems like an effective way of getting hash power from other unknowing computers.
1	1523273603	6	reminds me of party pokerthey change the code, their servers are empty for a day or two and then all the russian bots are back in action..  Monero will be back to what it was in a few days.. the only way to win is to change something daily.
2	1523285246	1	TIL Russians fab ASICs to play poker.
1	1523259421	4	Something to keep in mind : all of the biggest Monero mining pools are working their asses off to detect and ban any suspected bot nets on the spot. All Monero miners genuinely appreciate the effort made, some pools though, just really don't give a shit, as long as they're getting their fees from them, which sucks but hey, it's something !Monero has a lot of people from all sides, devs and pool admins alike, I love this coin !
1	1523273608	1	I agree with the principle of what you're saying here and not to nitpick, but most Monero botnet nodes I've personally killed seem to be based on xmrig or ccminer, not coinhive.I don't doubt that coinhive-based malware exists, but it's interesting to see how cosmopolitan and diverse the malware portion of Monero's network infrastructure is.
1	1523296320	1	Why are ASICs miners a problem ?
0	1523215413	24	I expect the hashrate to increase a bit from this bottom though, as Monero has become profitable for many miners now.
1	1523224842	15	I had just switched off of SUMO, an XMR fork, a few weeks before the hard fork (XMR and SUMO both hard forked around the same time). ETH was three times more profitable when I switched. After the fork, SUMO became 3 times more profitable than my ETH returns. Back to SUMO :-D
1	1523224756	19	I expect to see a lot of ETH miners move to Monero too.
2	1523285476	2	They already are.  Which concentrates the ASIC problem that ETH currently has and apparently isn't going to deal with.
2	1523241244	3	Shhhhhh no we won’t ;)
0	1523241868	7	What's also fascinating about this is now that more people have moved to monero to mine profitabily, the other alts have become more profitable to mine as well.
1	1523243865	9	Yes ,stopping ASICs help all as community. Now if ETH is smart they will to 
2	1523278893	4	Apparently they won't... They sold out to bitmain...  And Bitmain increased the e3 price now that vitalik Said no to the hardfork 
0	1523264259	8	Still, people will call you nutty for saying bitmain runs unseen asics weeks/months before releasing them. Usually the same people who say asics are good for crypto overall....Something Something decentralization and giving power to individuals instead of big players.
1	1523265586	3	This is how they operate (I would too), since they have a monopoly.
2	1523266092	3	As would I. People shouldn't expect a company to operate "fair" in this regard, but rather understand a company will behave in a way to maximize their profits. If we really want change, we simply have to stop buying their products and dump support for the coins they mine. Easier said than done.
2	1523285538	1	If you've got a monopoly, buying astroturfers and shills is chump change.
3	1523286253	3	It's a huge concern since Bitmain 2017 profit was more than Nvidias. They can literally buy entire Reddit if they want to.
4	1523287349	3	Yeah, something feels off in the r/ethereum and even r/ethermining subreddits.  Feels like the 2016 election/Bitcoin discussion, which is where I learned to spot shilling in the first place.  It's not that bad yet but it may be soon... some of the strategies appear to be taking form.Look for lots of quick aggressive quips all pointed in one direction, derision rather than engagement, and repetition of simple weak talking points without addressing counterpoints.  The last one usually comes in waves as though all the shills/bots got their marching orders in the morning and they keep up with that strategy until the next go-round.  Also sort of counter-intuitively, they will go back and forth one on one with you until you decide to stop, but they'll never actually address your point... so all outsiders see is confusing contention.Basically, all of a sudden there's a weird 'sense of consensus' on a point that the community has never really addressed before, and they implement it through coordination, by forcing their posts to the top, attacking people/their motives rather than actually discussing, and attempting to inoculate everyone with a smug sense of superiority that appeals to emotions.  The most obvious part is the 'waves of consensus'.
0	1523252596	3	Would GPU mining be profitable at the moment then? 
1	1523259526	4	Absolutely ! I had been mining other coins but since then I'm back on XMR. Check us out on /r/MoneroMining !
0	1523231596	10	I understand everybody hates ASICs but doesn't this mean that if someone creates an ASIC they can take over 80% of the hash rate for a couple of months?  
1	1523231985	10	I would think a few months would not justify the overhead. Making custom silicone is expensive
2	1523251959	9	You're thinking in block rewards when you should be thinking in network security.  80% hashrate is a critical vulnerability and has already happened.  It was worth manufacturing once with this outcome on the table, it will likely happen again 
3	1523285985	1	Fair point
1	1523237327	6	Phhhtt  and then after two months they have paperweights there is limited money to be made in this for Bitmain,,,, they need bagholders that buy their used machines.--I think the interesting game will be how they try to get adoption of their fake monero coins
2	1523240459	10	There were a bunch of announcements about "monero classic" type forks that would keep the old algorithm. Not to hard to figure out that the only people benefitting from such a maneuver would be the ASIC miners and manufacturers. Hopefully the market will see through that and ignore them.
3	1523243517	7	They'll probably pump it hard to try and get the FOMO people in, not sure what percentage that represents, but they'll try and milk it hard.There likely will be so much butthurt/loss of face over in Bitmain over this as I think in the medium term those coins will go on to the shitcoin grave yard.
1	1523256026	2	It could be a lot longer than a couple months.  I don't think it is known when the next algorithm change will be.  If they create the ASICs in secret, like they did once already, and ramp up the hashrate slowly then the community might not know they exist and it could be extremely profitable for the ASIC miners again.  Although the current ASICs just became obsolete, I suspect that Bitmain already made their profits from them and if they did then they'll likely do it again.
2	1523257769	3	I don't know how long it takes to create an ASIC but this means somebody could possibly take over the network for 6 months.  My concern is not about mining profits, it more about network security.  bitmain and other manufacturers, as I see it, have good intent. I highly doubt that they will attack the network because the purpose for them to use ASICs are to make profit.  But the problem is what if someone with bad intent creates an ASIC? If they could control 80% of the hashrate, can't they undo most transactions? I am not sure of what kind of attacks are possible but I don't understand why nobody is concerned. If the counter argument is "51% attacks can't do much harm" then why do we need PoW in the first place?  * This reply is not an argument against you, I just wanted to put my thoughts out.
3	1523288285	1	I understand and that is a good point for other potential ASIC manufacturers.  For Bitmain, I don't think they would do a 51% attack, however, I think people are dismissing the potential profitability and control over the coin that it would give them.  It gives them power to steer the future of BTC like it did in the segwit 2x fork.  Yes an ASIC does take a while to develop but the reason I say it could be a lot longer than a couple months is that:1. even though Monero hard forks every 6 months, the algroithm doesn't aways change every 6 months2. How will you know when the ASICs exist? I don't think you would.Businesses are about profitability. If I were Bitmain, I would already be working on the next Monero ASIC right now.  Since they've already done it once, I'll bet they can do it even faster and cheaper this time.P.S. I like Monero and I hold some but I think their approach to ASICs is flawed.
0	1523236564	5	The reported hashrate went that low not the actual, it’s going back up now and will oscillate until it settles into reporting the correct hash rate, probably at 500Mh/s or so with the folks coming over from eth.
1	1523239273	5	there is a possibility that FGPA have already adapted to the new algorithm. the hash rate has almost doubled since fork, implying that there are now more than twice the no of gpu's mining since the fork which i don't see as possible. even though people mining ETH might have jumped to Monero. but all the evidence shows otherwise. the no of miner connected on pools has not doubled, suggesting FGPA have updated and are now mining XMR. edit: go to the xmr TG chat. someone posted a minig hash of 20KH/s  as proof of FGPAEdit 2: https://imgur.com/a/QglP5
2	1523256302	3	Don't forget the GPU miners who are now on it who weren't previously. I've pointed my AMD rigs at Monero since it's most profitable at the moment. I am sure others have done the same. So people like myself are picking up the slack left by ASICs that got booted out.
2	1523288365	1	Tons of GPU miners have switched to Monero.
2	1523240566	1	What does FPGA stand for?
3	1523241773	3	Field Programmable Gate Array
4	1523241841	1	Thanks
5	1523243378	1	NP
3	1523241464	1	http://lmgtfy.com/?q=FPGA
1	1523251368	2	Not true. The hashrate corrects itself down to the actual hashrate until the median of 2 minute blocks are found. It will of course now go up again since it is highly profitable.The sideffect: ASICs killed at Monero raise the profitability of other coins as well.
0	1523256484	2	Are you saying I can mine monero on my 1060 now? Also does this not mean the network is 10 times less secure now? Can you really make a chain Asic resistant forever? 
1	1523275371	4	1. You can mine Monero profitably now.2. It is a common misconception that a higher hash rate means the network is more secure. The important factor is the distribution of the network hash rate.3. The answer is likely "No", however we can create a situation where it is not profitable for Bitmain and other ASIC miners to create an ASIC for Monero. We do this by slightly changing the POW to brick ASIC every 6 months. Additionally, we can research and implement new algorithms that are more difficult to make an ASIC of.
0	1523266471	2	Does this mean that the "little guys" will earn about 8 times as much as they did like 2 weeks ago?And that the ASIC's can be thrown into the trash?
1	1523268453	1	they forked XMR so they can keep mining it.
2	1523286493	1	the asics can mine the 'old' xmr while the rest has switched for xmr2? How does this work exactly? There are 2 monero's now? Thats what a fork is
3	1523286911	1	There are 4 Moneros, it forked into 4 lop
3	1523288472	1	A hard fork simply means the new code is incompatible with old code.  Monero regularly hard forks every 6 months as part of planned network upgrades.  The old chain has no activity and simply dies off.In this case, Bitmain is artificially* keeping the old chain alive.  They've rebranded it to Monero Classic and are keeping it around to give ASICs something to do.*I say artificially as there's no real community support
4	1523288690	1	interesting
0	1523274193	2	This is not true. Fluffy himself said that any malware would likely have to update itself, which could expose itself. https://youtu.be/hZ_0nLL3z-M?t=3104You have to consider that the botnets were disrupted too. for how long? I have no idea but the change broke both ASICs and malware.
0	1523258314	1	justr curious : any impact on the speed / load of the network with Hashpower reducing like this ?
0	1523270343	1	Oh god, back to mining monero. :)
0	1523281243	1	i dont get it.... are you implying that botnet will automatically change their hashing algo ???  i think botnet will need more time to infect computer etc compared to asic or gpu that ppl will just buy upgrade or change the sofware algo.

0	1523235898	1	Now imagine how much of [this](https://etherscan.io/chart/hashrate) is ASICs and [the effect](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHBTC/) ruthlessly selling all of that ETH obtained would have...right at the time Bitcoin was faltering, to prevent a flippening.  The ETH ratio didn't start falling until Feb. 1.  Bitcoin had been dying a whole month at that time, so the ratio fall can't be from that.

2	1523236246	9	Not any more.https://www.coindesk.com/bitmain-confirms-release-first-ever-ethereum-asic-miners/And Bitmain always mines with the miners first and sells them used once they are past peak profitability, pointing to the rise starting in January (even though GPUs still can't be found) as almost certainly their ASICs being turned on.

4	1523251236	1	Yeah and for bitcoin 14 million GPUs. Scale matters
4	1523271500	1	It's a hell of a lot cheaper than  6x RX 480s.
5	1523272845	1	1800$ + shipping + PSU
6	1523275556	1	800, https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020180403174908564M8dMJKtz06B7
7	1523280950	1	Only batch 1 was 800$, batch 2 and forward are 1800$.
