1	1523286007	8	Shilling is good for everyone. Without shilling new people would not see what is req, get interested and buy in. 
2	1523296878	-4	Nobody buys in because they know REQ is a shitty ERC-20 token. 
3	1523297771	5	Edgy. 
4	1523297854	-2	Delusional. 
5	1523297937	3	Oh ya master crypto investor whats your hot take on what us mere mortals should be throwing our schmeckles at 
6	1523298238	1	Nothing at all. Exit all crypto. 
1	1523287568	-5	REQ has gotta be the most shilled low market cap coin 
0	1523286335	17	REQ is a great project
1	1523296857	-6	Stop trying to make REQ happen, paid shills. It's not going to happen. 
0	1523285674	4	Curious to see if REQ can get a foothold into the business world. I see a lot of applications being built on top of REQ and replace existing ones, see XERO.
1	1523292155	4	Partnership with PwC France is a great start and should help a lot on the accounting/finance side of things. 
0	1523291876	2	Interesting to see, REQ is getting quite a lot of attention around Reddit this week.
0	1523281246	7	2 hours old, 46 upvotes, 2nd place on the front page and no comments? It is either a very slow day in crypto news or something is fishy
1	1523282083	23	People are simple, they see "Request Network" and they upvote lol
2	1523284582	11	I'm not going to lie, I'm doing that. But there are still probably upvote bots around.
3	1523284946	16	Can confirm.  Certified REQ upvoter here.  I do it for free.
3	1523295227	1	Me too, I don't have anything of substance to add but I like what Request are doing.
4	1523296155	1	No I’m Sparticus!  I saw REQ and upvoted!
2	1523295091	1	Can confirm, saw REQ, upvoted.
2	1523291550	0	Pretty much."Oh shit, look, a post about 'x,' yeah I've got their bags. Hope this is good news. I better upvote so more people see it. Maybe they FOMO in and I can get back some of what I've lost."
3	1523297839	1	You're not wrong, youre just an asshole
2	1523284261	-1	THAT MUST be it
1	1523298185	1	You think that's bad? Look at any positive nano post. It'll be on the front page within minutes, full of generic "great team, love this project, great buy right now" comments. 
1	1523283625	1	I think there's something wrong with the reddit algo. Been noticing random new posts on the front page this morning.
2	1523283800	0	Same, that's why I posted, maybe others think the same
0	1523291639	1	The payment requests and transfer of value are done here including other basic payment services options you would expect such as basic addition and subtraction.
