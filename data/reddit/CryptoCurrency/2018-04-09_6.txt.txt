0	1523253999	22	>"Since Bitcoin launched, there have been two groups of supporters"This is incorrect. The division between big blockers and small blockers really only emerged around 2014 and became super prominent in late 2015 through censorship and social media manipulation efforts.Transaction fees on the BTC chain are only down because so is usage, not because anything was fixed on the BTC chain. If/when more people start using BTC again, the transaction fee & mempool problem will rear its ugly head again. I don't think two million merchants *can* accept Bitcoin payments. Jeff Garzik was talking about this a couple of years ago in what he dubbed [The Fidelity Problem](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3kytd0/jeff_garzik_on_the_fidelity_problem_fidelity/). Basically, even if a large company like Fidelity wanted to use Bitcoin, they wouldn't be able to due to the low block size limit on the BTC chain. Currently, the BTC chain can only process around 400k transactions per day at maximum. Even if *no one else* used the BTC chain, having 2 million merchants accept Bitcoin would mean that each merchant could accept only one BTC transaction every five days before completely maxing out the capacity of the network. Of course, this is unrealistic, because after the merchant receives a transaction, they probably need to make another transaction to move the coins where they need to go, and how are the customers paying with BTC acquiring it if not by creating even more transactions?The Lightning Network isn't a silver bullet that will solve these issues. LN has some serious drawbacks, like the fact that all users need to either be online 24/7 or hire multiple paid "watchtower" services to avoid having your funds stolen. You need to hire multiple watchtowers for redundancy, because if you rely on just one watchtower and that service goes offline for whatever reason, then your funds can still be stolen. There's also the problem that with LN you can only receive payments up to the amount of money that you've already locked up inside a channel. If I'm a Lamborghini dealership and I want to sell a single Lambo, that means I need to have lambo money locked up inside my channel, just waiting for someone to come along and maybe buy a car from me. This just isn't tenable for a business. (A lambo is an extreme example, but the same concept applies for all businesses wanting to accept payment with LN)This is why the BCH/BTC fissure exists, and why having enough on-chain capacity to handle demand is so important. 
1	1523293597	1	No that's when it became PROMINENT. Those supporters have been around for ages. Satoshi himself has comments talking about making the blocks bigger back in 2010. The debate has been around since the beginning, it didn't become a HUGE divide until the point you're talking about
1	1523270397	-2	Here I'll save the trolls the trouble:Bcash is a scam by Roger Ver, Jihan and other btrashers!!
2	1523280262	2	I know Roger Ver isn't an angel himself either, but the smear against him is just unreal, anyone would snap at some point with that amount of hate, especially a guy as emotional as Ver.
0	1523280184	5	Why is he talking so much about bitcoin, and ignoring all the advancements we have made in the past few years?      Oh, it was a post from /r/bitcoin, he's stuck in the past.Also, lol at the vaporware lightning mention.
0	1523239865	17	It's only a matter of time before legacy businesses start seeing the light here. Cryptocurrency payments will become mainstream within 5 years.....no doubt about it!!!
1	1523253465	6	agree. once everyone start adopting crypto and see it as a secure payment option it will be mainstream for sure.
2	1523270631	1	Yes, but they need to understand it first. A lot of people don't know how this works. With wallets etc. 
3	1523283765	4	The masses aren't going to adapt their ways for crypo wallets. Wallets need to adapt for the masses.
4	1523286109	1	Couldn't agree more. Crypto is still in its infancy. The ability to transfer crypto needs to be as seamless as paying with a credit card before we see mass adoption. It will happen, but like all good things, it will take time.
3	1523296794	1	They dont know how combustion engines work. We'll just show them where to put the gas and how to check the oil. And slap them on the butt and send them on their merry way. 
2	1523275358	0	> agree. once everyone start adopting crypto and see it as a secure payment option it will be mainstream for sure.that is hilarious logic. cuz once i grow wings i'll be able to fly like a bird, if you think about it.
1	1523258409	2	> legacy businessesFiat hasn't been deprecated yet, but this is an amusing way to put it.
1	1523287665	1	Bitcoin won't be the mainstream payment though. The title is just clickbait. 
0	1523274161	3	From what I read, Lightening Network is unreliable and fraught with potential legal problems.  Im all for crypto, but LN does not look like the answer for some time yet.The quick route is to just enable hundreds of coin wallets for each merchant, plenty of capacity, super low fees.
0	1523258286	9	So if I go to a store and buy a pizza for 0.01 btc, and the next day btc pumps 10%, I lose and the store wins.if I buy a pizza for 0.01 btc and the next day btc dumps 10%, i win and the store loses.seems like a great currency to use 
1	1523264798	4	It’s a problem that needs to be solved and it certainly will be. But it’s also a paradigm shift that needs to happen. If you buy something in dollars and it loses value vs the Euro you don’t think of it as a loss because for most of us it doesn’t matter. So what will need to happen with crypto as it lives in conjunction with fiat currencies? The dollar isn’t going away anytime soon, so a good solution to this problem will be highly valuable. 
2	1523287659	1	Dollar and euro are both very stable, so that doesn't happen to the same degree as it does with bitcoin.  If you hold currencies of emerging markets that's more likely to happen, but that's one of the reasons holding dollars is safer.
1	1523297287	1	This is an early days problem. Bitcoin still has a very small Valuation.  When Bitcoin absorbs Trillions of dollars in Valuation, the dips and raises wont be noticeable to the average person. Most people have less than 2000 dollars in their bank account at any given time. When Bitcoin is $350k and it swings up or down $5k-$10k, most people wont even notice the difference. And if you are worried about Spending Bitcoin and it going up the next day. As soon as you spend it, go buy some more so you don't miss out on the Volatility. 
1	1523273990	1	If people start spending crypto, and stop using it as a (fiat) get rich quick investment, this wont happen anymore.  It is explicitly because crypto is overwhelmed by traders, just trading for the sake of trading, that its so volatile.USD, GBP, EUR etc. are all actively traded, but most trading is for conversion, and the overwhelming use is actually to buy things.
2	1523288452	1	Can the bitcoin network handle mass trading and mass adoption as a functional currency?
3	1523288673	1	Bitcoin on its own, not at the moment, crypto-currency as a whole, potenitally yes.
1	1523275700	1	If everyone uses bitcoin the volatility will not be much higher than the US dollar 
2	1523298207	1	But the primary reason people "use" bitcoin is to make money. So less people would probably hold it if it stopped doing that.
0	1523241511	6	>What if you could allow millions of businesses around the world to accept Bitcoin with the click of a button? I actually don't think we're very far off from making that a reality. Bitpay. Its not a possibility, its the reality. Sure its great that Square is going to be another payment processor but it's absolutely not the first to offer Bitcoin. 
1	1523241569	5	I agree Bitpay will be a big player, but a majority of businesses still don't accept crypto.  I think that will change very soon.
2	1523243340	2	I totally agree, but the guy in this video is insinuating that businesses currently can't accept Bitcoin with the click of a button. Which is false.. 
3	1523243475	1	I think he meant millions of businesses at the same time with one click of a button (Square pushing out a BTC acceptance feature)
4	1523243630	5	Yeah I think that is what he meant, but Bitpay is already doing this. EDIT: https://bitpay.com/get-started
0	1523252308	3	So many other currencies, coins and tokens yet bitcoin has liquidity, has been here for ten years, is the longest, most secure Blockchain on the planet + on chain fees are now mere cents, lighting network is coming. I love it. Bitcoin ftw. I will see the bch downvotes now 
1	1523281258	2	[deleted]
2	1523291503	0	Please post links when making inaccurate claims. Bitcoin is processing around 150-200k tx per day, which is the same as October of last year. All coins tx numbers have significantly decreased in the bear market. Bitcoin tx have decreased the least out of any coin. Bch for example is processing about 11k tx, per day - less than dogeClaiming fees will be $30 when tx increase further describe your lack of understanding to the matter. Batched / segwit tx have more than doubled since December. This adoption + bear market = cheap fees. Block weight can be nearly 4mb with segwit. This is w/o lightning. https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-eth-bch-doge.html
3	1523297601	1	Regular Bitcoin transactions for regular people and LN transactions for high traffic big business.  I'm convinced the LN is being built for Wall Street by Wall Street. And I welcome it. I want that money to pour in. Buy up those coins and make em scarce!

0	1523256015	1	...not until the price levels out. Everyone "remembers" the 4 Bitcoin pizza.
0	1523265464	1	But who would want to use crypto to buy goods? 
1	1523274022	2	I have.
0	1523267556	1	But why would you use crypto to buy goods/services with the crazy high fees  and the long transaction time some crypto have ?
1	1523274041	1	Dont use those ones :)
0	1523275265	1	This is great for adoption I would love to accept other cryptos like EOS,ETH,LTC and NANO along with BTC.
0	1523281243	1	I would as a business owner.  Is it a gamble?  Sure...but also it could mean more than just accepting payment and calculate profit; even though yes, bookkeeping will be another learning curve (or at least understand how the tax works), if the BTC climbs that alone could be worth offsetting a rather low profit margin (for the industry I'm in at least).
0	1523282360	1	The interledger protocol and applications like Apple Pay will be at the forefront of bringing cryptocurrencies to businesses.
0	1523283629	1	I wish Bitcoin would sort their shit out and get a fast network so all these amazing opportunities could be realized. I feel they have zero leadership and its really hurting. BTC is the ideal digital currency. We don't need any more. Well we do, because Bitcoin is so slow and messed up.
0	1523291928	1	Moon is getting closer. South America will be a major market to watch, several large ideas going on there.﻿
0	1523295466	1	Hige
0	1523296215	1	This is great, but if rather a different crypto be accepted for payment. I don't,and won't use bitcoin too buy things. Only store of value, and or trying to increase financial gain. 
0	1523297438	1	Someone please enlighten me, what exactly is the value proposition for a consumer from a reasonably well ran country to use crypto instead of regular cash & credit cards?With my credit card, I get the following advantages:- security: I'm not responsible for any fraudulent purchases. So I don't really worry about my card getting stolen, account getting compromised etc. The same is true for the bank accounts, I'm not responsible or liable for any losses due to account getting hacked or compromised.- perks: with my credit card I get 90 days price protection (already got back $1,000 so far this year due to this), 90 days loss & accident protection, 1 extra year of warranty (used this perk twice so far), travel protection insurance, car rental insurance, lost baggage reimbursement, 1.5%-5% cashback etcI don't really forsee large # of merchants offering discounts for crypto because such a discount can be easily replicated by their competitors. That's why you don't see discounts for cash or discounts for lower fee credit cards in the vast majority of merchants.
0	1523270003	1	Crypto isn't for buying things. It's for buying and hoarding, like dragons in fantasy books do with gold.
0	1523245392	-13	They're going to need to begin accepting Bitcoin (BCH). The damage done by Bitcoin Core left a sour taste in a lot of businesses mouths. The risk of high fees again makes it a pointless payment method to take. Best to just go with the chain that's aiming for global scalability today over a failed experiment using sidechains (not to mention they haven't solved the routing problem). Jack and Square are going to get REKT is they don't wisen up.
