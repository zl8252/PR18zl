0	1523278570	29	There is a danger this may be positive news
1	1523288600	6	lol, shhh...let the terds sell
0	1523284084	24	VeChain, Neo!
0	1523286333	19	Haters gonna downvote - but this is exactly what Walton were talking about in the following article:https://medium.com/@Waltonchain_EN/smart-city-founders-alibaba-cloud-waltonchain-subsidiary-zhongchuan-iot-sign-strategic-97ccc27ce7bfIt;s exciting for China - so i agree with the "Vechain, Neo!" comment by soul5tice - but the most linked project to this city is Waltonchain without a doubt.And to the fudders that are gonna fud - their tweet stated that they were holding back on announcements via twitter to align future tweets with china blockchain policy announcements. By no means did they redact the strategic partnership in the city mentioned in OPs post (Xiong'an).
1	1523287492	9	It's true. This is incredibly bullish for Chinese coins in general, but there are some seriously obvious connections that anybody can make between this news and Waltonchain. I'd also consider a few others like Matrix or Neo. I'm not so sure about VEN considering it's based in Singapore if I'm not mistaken, but we will see. They were also working on the new Gui'an Smart Town project so we may see some developments from that. 
2	1523291597	5	This news definitely points to WTC imo. Vechain is working on Gui'an which is a special economic zone as designated by the central Chinese government. Bullish on both, but lean heavier towards VEN because of Jim Breyer. PwC, and DNV. 
1	1523289708	4	I agree. This has Waltonchain written all over it.
2	1523290824	0	Keep up the good work team! 
0	1523294150	2	lol eos does this (with 1 bln I might add) and haters hate
0	1523284296	2	WaltonChain!
0	1523285114	3	Vechain will double its BTC value in April.
1	1523294728	-1	Is that when they release their whitepaper?  lmao
0	1523291760	1	The new fund marks the latest effort from Chinese government entities in taking the lead on blockchain development initiatives in the country
0	1523286104	0	China will launch its own blockchain coin or back NEO. That absolutely doesn't mean it will be successful. Coins which share global outlook will rule the crypto-market. Coins like ADA, TAU OR ICX have those genes in them. They can go ballistic once they get higher adoptions. Remember coins that are global will be big. Regional coins won't matter.
1	1523288556	3	China will rule cryptosphere the way they are planning. They are against crypto but happy till all the development happens on Chinese companies/blockchains. They see the future and they are building strong foundations. 
0	1523291991	-2	In this post, lots of coordinated posts from WaltonChain. They have done shady marketing in the past, I watched it when they first came on the scene months ago. To their merrit, it would have been a great time to buy, but they also shill like crazy and it is absolutely not beneath them to take advantage of this positive news for a currently unnamed crypto. Tread carefully because if it turns out to be NEO WTC could dump heavy from those buying up in order to ride the rocket ship should there actually be one at all.
1	1523296091	0	Lol. 5 of the 24 comments mention WaltonChain, the rest mention Ven and Neo.  Super coordinated. 
0	1523285625	0	True if huge!
0	1523279189	-5	doubt it - all these “chinese government” news are such BS 
1	1523281351	7	i don't think so, two of my legit chinese coins are really happy about this news and sharing it!
2	1523282077	1	Which two?
3	1523283141	2	INT tweet obviously with a picture and text and VET indirecly per cck :)
4	1523283272	2	Oh that’s cool. Thx. 
0	1523295666	0	Unfortunately this is good for blockchain but means nothing for crypto . 
0	1523295800	-3	China is going to make there own national crypto ... Walton and vechain will be out of business the world will go on .
