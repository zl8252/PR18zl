If enough people switch to that one then other banks will have no choiceEdit: I'm aware there's 5 big banks since I'm Canadian. Only 2 banks are doing this so you have THREE to choose from. Time to switch now or the other 3 won't have a reason to NOT follow.
1	1523376146	10	I'm with BMO so I just use Coinsquare to get around their policies.  You can fund the account with an etransfer.
2	1523380388	6	Ah this is great!, I'm also with BMO and was hoping someone had a loop hole. Thanks! 
1	1523372127	23	Unfortunately here in Canada we have what is called the big 5 and they basically own banking in this country. I've heard that pretty much all of them are giving people trouble but there are one or two (RBC particularly it sounds like) who are not being as strict.
2	1523373037	35	RBC no longer allows crypto purchases through their credit card, but I was told by the rep that you can work around it through their virtual Visa debit card (which just pulls from your debit account).  I'll know in a day or two when I receive mine.  
3	1523373777	11	I've used my RBC visa debit and visa credit for crypto purchase without issue.
4	1523377869	4	Used my TD card like 3 days ago. No problem.
5	1523378085	7	The article is just clickbait. It's specifically BMO.
6	1523379504	1	Agreed
6	1523384502	1	No, it's TD and RBC. Tangerine has been reported to as well, which is owned by Scotia. I haven't heard anything about CIBC yet.
7	1523384671	1	Scotiabank too
4	1523374267	2	How long ago?  My credit card stopped working for crypto last week, and that's what they told me.
5	1523377690	1	A few weeks ago I guess this is a recent change then.
3	1523377914	3	I talked to someone at RBC last week and while credit cards do not work, I got a basic chequeing account (16 number card) and I am waiting on my deposit with Quadriga. I specifically asked about crypto and she said it should work. 
4	1523383454	1	Good luck with Quadriga.  Major problems last couple months.  Research the sub.
5	1523383621	1	Yeah I have been looking at the sub/using the service a little bit, really sucks with some of their recent changes. I understand they gotta combat fraud, but adding very restrictive funding rules (30 day wait to send more than 200$, but fee's are still constant at 5) makes it harder to use. Really hope they can fix it up. 
3	1523377421	1	I bank with RBC and i'm able to make transfers to canadianbitcoins and quadrigacx. This could change though.
3	1523377498	1	Now isn't that excellent banker logic at display. Clearly against some kind of law, but here's a little tweak to do this and that, and then you're all set to fire up the world. 
3	1523384656	1	I literally just did an RBC interac transfer. I think its fine if they want to stop crypto purchases on credit prior to legislation, but money transfer all seem fine.
2	1523374233	6	I purchased more crypto through Scotia Bank debit Visa using coinbase.. No issue 
3	1523376690	2	Same 
2	1523377166	6	In Europe, banks are called: “legalized Mafia” by many, and I think, I as an individual, will have the right to decide WHAT and HOW I want to invest with my OWN money. Thát, my fellow investors, is exactly why Bitcoin was created: to escape the strangulation by banks and governments. Fight those miserable mafia bank guys! 
3	1523385145	2	Credit is not your money. 
4	1523385272	1	Cash or deposit in a bank is your own. Not the bank’s money although they act as IF its theirs. That why the banking system is like a patient, dying. 
5	1523385635	1	Yes but a credit card is credit. Not your money. 
6	1523386029	1	I’m not talking credit card. Never use one unless for airlines or hotels. That’s why Americans are so much in debt, holding 6, 7 or more cc’s and consume, spend and pay absurd interest rates. In Europe most people use Debit cards. If I need to buy crypto funds I transfer cash from a bank to a platform/exchange to buy crypto. That also means my bank has nothing to say or want what and how I use my own money. 
7	1523386702	1	Well good news because they are not telling you how to spend your money. Your a nut. 
8	1523387693	1	😂..why you call me a nut if I want to be free to decide how to spend my own money? 
6	1523386185	1	True, but banks in Europe started trying to stop you from buying with your own money. Example: Santander blocked transfers to Coinbase. So if you want to get money from your savings account there, you couldn't. People complained and closed accounts, which of course made them fix it.
2	1523374881	2	> I've heard that pretty much all of them are giving people troubleOnly for credit, no? I can see why they would do this considering how easy is for new traders to get carried away in an unregulated market. But, besides BNO, it's not the case that banks ban debit, right?
2	1523375777	1	Online banking? Can you use US BASED online banking?
1	1523378409	2	they didn't react like this for paypal
1	1523373185	5	There are only 5 banks in Canada and they often collude with each other on these kinds of things. Capitalism in banking isn't really a thing here.
2	1523374452	4	There are 5 major banks, but dozens of smaller banks and even more credit unions.  Do you live in backwater nowhereville?
3	1523377632	7	99% of canada is backwater nowhereville. 
4	1523378274	12	But 70% of Canadians live in urban areas
5	1523378410	-9	"urban" in Canada is still backwater nowheresville :/but yeah people living in the city have choices, but is it really worth living in one of those just to have credit unions?
6	1523378619	1	No, but the overwhelming majority of Canadians have access to far more than just the big 5. If someone wants to live out in the sticks they can't complain when there's a lack of choice. 
7	1523378878	-2	Canada isn't just 'woods' or 'city'I live in an urban area in Canada. I think there's a credit union about 3 hours away, outside of toronto, followed by many more in there. Most of Canada still has the "big 5" to choose from :(
8	1523379099	3	Where do you live? Even when I lived in suburbia I had plenty of choices outside the big 5. I'd easily wager my life's saving the majority if the population lives within 10 minutes of a non big 5 bank or credit union. 
9	1523379173	1	a town of less than 50k people. the closest credit union I know of is in a town of a little over 500k
8	1523382648	1	>  I think there's a credit union about 3 hours away, outside of toronto,There's 2 credit unions around Scarborough IIRC
9	1523382718	1	The one I was referring to was Ajax, but yeah
1	1523366918	2	Unfortunately, not all countries have as many banks as the U.S., so they don't have as many options.
2	1523380086	1	OP is canadian lol
1	1523385816	1	Santander tried to pull something like this in Portugal, with card buys and other transfers (Coinbase, etc). People complained to consumer associations that their money is theirs to decide where to spend it and starting closing accounts and moving to other banks (there are always a few as you said). Problem solved, didn't take long for them to reverse it.
1	1523387155	1	You need to switch and then tell them both the banks why you're leaving and why are you coming.
1	1523387496	1	Not to mention credit unions seem to love the business these days. But I'm a wire guy, I literally wire everything. But 9/10 i see it the next day arrive at its destination.
1	1523378302	1	Only a matter of time before this is extended to all banks - banking is effectively a cartel after all.Particularly concerning that debit card transactions are blocked - credit card transactions are in some way understandable (but still a bullshit reason as most banks allow gambling / casino transactions on credit cards).To be fair, this is what crypto was designed to overcome - the banks becoming a law onto themselves in giving themselves authority as to who, when and for what reason people can transfer their money to others, as well as how much commission they should take. Combine this with the continuous push by governments and banks for a "cashless society" (i.e. a society where every financial transaction has to pass through a bank and/or government for audit and approval) and you can start to see why people will turn to crypto as a solution.
1	1523379997	1	> other banks will have no choiceHahaha. Wait, you were serious?
1	1523381598	1	All the banks that i called claim that they will freeze and cancel any transactions (both debit and credit) relating to crypto purchases. I was pretty pissed off about this because they are telling me what i can and cant do with my money. Later on I ended up purchasing some on Coinbase using my TD debit card. They told me it would be frozen and cancelled but it went through perfectly and haven't had an issue since. Only downside is Coinbase only lets you purchase $250 CAD worth of crypto per week. 
0	1523366581	158	It's funny the banks are banning it because of risk, when there are people pulling out thousands of dollar with their credit card at casino atm and they don't care about it
1	1523366813	105	You see, they’re not worried about risk to the public. They’re worried about risk to people owning their own wealth and banks going the way of the do-do. They never specified who the risk was for!
2	1523373422	12	it's true. these Idiots are driving us TO CRYPTO..where we can trade with and trust IN each other without themthis is the solution folks! Trust in your neighbor again and in the free market thru a trustless mechanism to find priceI'm so sick of pathetic banks and credit card companies
2	1523370564	4	Exactly!It's about the risk for their business >:)
2	1523383929	1	I read what you said as “going the way of the doo-doo.” Still valid though right?
1	1523381041	1	Ya. I asked my banker to explain how me moving my own money to a Canadian exchange was in any way a risk to them.  She didn't have much of an answer for me. 
1	1523373170	1	The risk argument makes zero sense. You can gamble by playing the stock market and have just as high of a risk to lose all your money.
0	1523371113	35	TD with debit is still allowed.  Just get a Debit Visa card. 
1	1523376430	7	Can confirm.
1	1523379701	6	Same with pretty much every bank. Wire transfers still work... etc. it's just credit purchases which i honestly can't blame them for.
1	1523380104	1	I've had no issues with cibc or td, but am also not doing many big transfers, and more often selling than buying
1	1523384097	1	Double confirm on TD Visa Debit. But my CC hasnt worked for about 6 weeks on coinbase.
0	1523364847	226	These banks are retarded. They can’t stop us. This is exactly why cryptos were created and it is working flawlessly. The revolution has begun folks 
1	1523368712	70	It's funny that I can take my credit card and go get a $10,000 cash advance to do who knows what. But I use it to buy $10,000 in Bitcoin and they throw a shit fit.
2	1523368742	40	This is why it’s so completely obvious why they are banning it 
2	1523381651	3	Some of the Canadian banks allow you to buy crypto still with your credit card.
2	1523377836	1	Cause when you buy BTC they aren't getting that sweet, sweet instant cash advance interest. It's all about their own profit line, it's disgusting. 
3	1523382097	6	Banks only want one thing, and it's fucking disgusting.
2	1523376650	1	you could do this, however it may be against your credit card TOS. some CCs have limits on taking cash advances for the intended purpose of an investment. 
3	1523376996	4	It's exchanging currency, it is an investment in the literary sense, but not like holding on to stocks and bonds. The sooner people realize that the crypto market isn't supposed to be an investment platform the sooner price will rise.
4	1523377748	2	they don't care about that though. they want to treat it as a volatile investment for their own benefit, so that they can control you using their lent money toward crypto.
5	1523385230	0	You're not wrong! I just think that misinformation and mislabeling by big banks and (((media))) is damaging to crypto
5	1523385245	0	You're not wrong! I just think that misinformation and mislabeling by big banks and (((media))) is damaging to crypto
3	1523379237	1	just tell them you blew it at the casino
1	1523367273	21	Well, the ones that take this route anyways. Remember when the US Gov't wanted to run a government based email system that was slower and people had to pay for, just so they could retain full control?How did that pan out?The same thing will happen if banks take this approach. The only ones that will be relevant in 30+ years are the ones that get online with adoption.That doesn't only go for banking, it goes for countries and tax laws/regulation.What happens if a country like China actually makes crypto illegal? Wealthy people will crypto will start to flee, and governments will try to close their borders. Other countries will be more than happy to accept these massive accounts. I can see, in the not too distant future, economical wars being fought over countries trying to keep millionaires in their country, or prevent them from leaving their country.What happens if somewhere like China or Japan ban crypto and lose massive amounts of rich people, and they all land somewhere like Korea? I can see wars to siege these people's financial accounts happening, and other countries popping up acting as safe havens. Then anti-crypto countries threatening war and sanctions against the havens.TBH global adoption is very exciting, but the years JUUUUUST before it are kinda terrifying. Or at least their *could* be.
2	1523380910	3	See also music industry vs. the internet. When was the last time you bought a physical CD?  
3	1523386724	2	bout three days ago.And I bought a Tape as well.
1	1523383900	2	Jesus man.  What do you know.  Everyone understands that the get people tos top doing things is simple.  Just ban it.  It worked with alcohol, gambling, books, movies.... oh wait...
1	1523374103	1	totally agree
1	1523378854	1	and yet prices continue to plummet, the banks are currently winning if only for now. 
1	1523373347	0	its true. these morons are just driving us to crypto!!!! it's our fucking money not theres
2	1523373757	18	Well, the credit is their money. Banning debit purchases crosses a line though.
3	1523374404	-1	absolutely,  you give a little they will take it allif its your money they have no right banning everything. Also if you have good credit they are also fucking you by removing your choice
4	1523380764	5	"Good credit" does not entitle you to anything.
5	1523381366	0	besides better interest rates, lower insurance premiums and less financial red tape?
6	1523382574	3	Banks give that to you because of "good credit", but you are in no way entitled to it. They can give this stuff to whoever they please at whichever rates they choose.
1	1523369026	-1	Maybe they only want to create a superficial shortage to increase value, then allow purchases and let it drop
1	1523377367	0	I saw a local store in Cambridge Ontario with a sign that said "accepting crytocurrency"
0	1523365698	13	Which Canadians banks have or are banning crypto purchases and withdrawals?
1	1523365826	17	BMO and TD
2	1523366422	16	I'm with TD and don't have any issues
3	1523367319	7	Same. The very second they do, I'm closing all my accounts with them. 
4	1523369616	7	Me too! 
5	1523375156	5	Me three!
4	1523375985	1	Same
3	1523370696	3	Wrong, TD doesn't allow crypto purchases via CC
4	1523377498	2	But they do via debit, which is understandable
2	1523371571	4	TD is a POS bank anyway.  Their products are so horrible.  Then again there's even worse like Bank of America.  They can go straight to hell.
2	1523365973	1	Interesting. Just purchases with CC or even money deposits? Have they blocked any withdrawals?
3	1523366102	2	CC and Debit, they have closed bank accounts for suspicious activity when trying to withdraw money from exchanges.  Not my own first hand experience but what im been reading on the subs. BMO also issued a statement last week that they will have nothing to do with crypto.
4	1523366419	5	TD still allows crypto buys with debit, just not credit. BMO banned both credit and debit.
4	1523367819	2	BMO banned crypto purchases, but I think they are very interested in decentralized financial services. They announced this right after the ban. [https://www.tmx.com/newsroom?id=650&lang=en](https://www.tmx.com/newsroom?id=650&lang=en)
4	1523376261	1	BMO is only your debit and credit cards. Your bank account can still be used. 
2	1523368058	1	TD allows debit and wire transfer buys just not credit. 
0	1523368586	11	Kinda scitzophrenic. BMO just announced Shorcan, their very own cryptobrokerage. And let you pay/settle that with BMO $$$ [edit: I realized I misspoke before. It's the TSX who owns Shorecan, arguably cooler than bmo, TSX runs Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges. ....but TSX in their announcement also said BMO will handle the payment and settling. So it's like the bank wants to work with the stock exchange people's crypto, but fuck the seven million customers who aren't gonna invest with a TSX broker]
1	1523376529	2	Makes sense for BMO, stop people from investing with the current exchanges. Once the TSX crypto-exchange is up and running, open the gates only for their own partner venture.
0	1523368937	14	Opinion: the real reason banks are banning these transactions is to stall their customers until the banks themselves can introduce a trading platform from which they will directly profit.
1	1523377411	-2	I have no problem as long as it's reasonable fees and you're allowed to actually withdraw the coins 
2	1523377544	6	You don't have a problem with banks controlling other people's money and how they choose to invest, in order to prop up their own moneymaking scheme?
3	1523378650	1	You expect banks to work for free while protecting your assets? Get your head out of the sand. There is a use purpose for both crypto and banks. 
4	1523378745	0	>You expect banks to work for free while protecting your assets?what are you talking about? (jk, I'm not coming back)
0	1523374037	9	Remember you dont have to just buy crypto, you can earn it too.
1	1523374525	1	can we? ah ok
2	1523380824	12	Actually yes you can. My team recently released [Crypico](https://www.crypico.com/) where you can post gigs (similar to Fiverr)  and get paid in any crypto you want. Let me know if you have any feedback.
2	1523378942	2	Ya with faucets. If you are lucky maybe $5/month of BTC for many hours work!
0	1523364881	11	Great! Canada Cannot Be Stopped  
0	1523369369	4	Works fine on CIBC. 
1	1523373301	1	I've been blocked from depositing crypto funds from QuadrigaCX into my CIBC accounts. They cite "consumer protection" as the reason.
2	1523373828	1	I've done literally exactly that with no problems
3	1523374177	1	Lucky you.
1	1523372504	0	Not for me, at least with a CIBC credit card
2	1523382508	1	CIBC visa debit works fine on Coinbase 
0	1523372160	5	Does this include CIBC? 
1	1523373324	2	Yes. They're blocking deposits from QuadrigaCX at least.
1	1523382539	1	CIBC deposits work on Coinbase 
0	1523366362	14	RBC just blocked crypto purchases with credit cards, not sure if they'll try blocking debit purchases too. Fuck them. Its hilarious that they think they can stop this.
1	1523367258	22	Credit is totally understandable, not my money it's the banks. People are borrowing credit to buy crypto and then losing big leaving the bank with nothing. 
2	1523372664	9	Yet you are allowed to take thousands of $$ in cash advance from your creditcard and spend it in a casino or on hookers and blow or whatever you want. Please tell me again how it's to protect people from losing money on their investments?
3	1523373357	6	Exactly. Why are they trying to protect me from myself when it comes to crypto but nothing else? Could it be because crypto is so disruptive to their business model that they're trying to protect themselves from me? Seems more likely. 
3	1523374018	3	Most credit cards have a limit to how much you can take as a cash advance. For example, I can only have $1500 out as a cash advance with $10k in credit. They don’t want people putting the full $10k in credit on crypto because they’d rather have $1500 at risk than the full $10k on something so volatile.
4	1523375136	0	I haven't owned a single CC like that.  My limit is my limit and I can spend or pull out as much money as I want towards that limit.
5	1523380096	3	Something tells me if you tried to cash advance the full amount you’ll have an issue doing that. I have yet to see a credit card lately that lets you cash advance the full limit. There’s a purchase limit and cash advance limit.
3	1523376604	1	Sure go to an atm and withdraw cash from your credit card and then go to the bank and deposit it and buy crypto with it. You will have a higher interest rate charged and a limit on that. Dont blame the bank, its their money their rules. I dont think they care much about one or two customers compared to people defaulting on there payments which could affect the banks position. They didnt block crypto as well! I use BMO but i use my own money and they dont give a damn what I do. Take risks with your own money. 
3	1523378490	1	None of these things you listed are assets. Nobody goes to the casino to strike it rich, nobody gets hookers for financial reward, coke is all about self gratification. People are buying crypto on credit with the hopes of doubling their money because they are being mislead by other people when in all reality there is more of a chance they'll lose it all. The climate in crypto can be toxic and many people are falling for the hype. Banks can't collect credit payments from people who blew it all & are now defaulting on their loan. 
3	1523375300	0	You could take a cash advance and spend all of it on crypto. This is such a dumb argument
4	1523375443	1	Yet you can't buy crypto directly. Why? It has nothing to do with protecting customers.
5	1523376721	0	You have not demonstrated it doesn't have anything to do with protecting consumers from blowing all their money. Cash advances have higher interest rates which is why they allow you to make riskier buys. It would make total sense for banks to not allow you to make risky purchases directly with a credit card but allow you to with a cash advance. 
2	1523377867	0	Not saying you're wrong but when you get a credit loan, you're borrowing someone else's money, not the banks. If you borrow say, $10,000, you're really borrowing $1000 from some random fucker, and then $9000 "fake dollars" that the bank gives you on top of that. The bank doesn't actually *have* the money you borrow, until you give it back to them. They put the $1000 back in the guy you took it from's account, and then pocket the $9k they made from his $1k.
3	1523378633	0	That's the worst description of credit I have ever seen. 
4	1523378977	1	I didn't word it the best way but it's not wrong. I made it sound like the other guy actually loses his money (the $1k) though, which obviously doesn't happen, he'll never even know it was lent out.
1	1523372156	3	I've heard RBC is good other than the credit card issue. Someone on /r/bitcoinca even said they're running a crypto business through RBC and they are having no issues.
2	1523376394	2	Yea, I only do Interac Online over Quadriga with RBC and it’s been great.
2	1523372638	1	Let's see what happens! If they eventually try to block debit purchases, i'll switch banks. 
2	1523373126	1	I'm running a crypto business with rbc I literally just opened the accounts at rbc last month and they gave me a 5k credit card to use for trading lol. now I have to call them to bitch about being disallowed from doing business its really weird
2	1523378927	1	Someone on /r/bitcoinca just reported they did a large withdrawal from an exchange to RBC and their account was closed.
3	1523384733	1	Yeah there must be something that triggers it. I have no idea what.
1	1523371133	1	Where did you see that? I didn't get any mail or something
2	1523371352	1	I received an alert after logging into my online banking:"Important Information regarding cryptocurrency transactionsEffective immediately, RBC will no longer be allowing the use of RBC credit cards for transactions involving cryptocurrency. We regret any inconvenience this may cause."
3	1523372630	1	Got that as well.  As long as it is only credit I couldn't care less.  
0	1523368787	3	i guess buying is a bit tougher then tho, butCan’t you still withdraw via bank transfer from kraken?Or are they gunna ban wire transfers from exchanges to your accounts too?
1	1523376621	1	Some people have reported account closures due to suspicious activity after doing a regular fiat withdrawal from an exchange.
2	1523378300	1	Really? That is extreme. I can’t see how they can block you from incoming money like that
3	1523386495	1	Agreed, I would at least expect the bank to give you a warning before doing something so drastic but that's what I read here. I'm not sure if there would be a point in people lying about it.
0	1523373131	3	THIS is what cryptos are for.
1	1523373661	7	So true. The fact that banks are telling us what we can and cannot buy with our money is only proving how important cryptocurrency really is. 
0	1523375278	3	RBC has no intentions of banning crypto as far as I know. I told them I want 2months notice if they do lol
0	1523382978	3	This is largely clickbait. There have been new rules pertaining to credit card purchases and Interac Online (with BMO specifically), just like there have been by most US banks. However, debit card and Intertac E-transfer still work perfectly fine.
0	1523365277	5	India to follow soon
1	1523372824	4	India already did. Bank gave 3 months duration to pull out money.
2	1523377647	1	Not sure if that is for debit card? 
3	1523378588	1	Its for all transcations. Debit card, Credit card, netbanking, UPI, Wallets, everything.
0	1523372896	2	Why, Canada?
1	1523374488	1	why not
0	1523376098	2	I can understand them not allowing it with credit cards, that's using **their** money. But debit cards involve **our** money. What fucking right do they have to tell us we can't spend our money in any legal way we choose? Go ahead and have your opinion about crypto being legitimate or not. But keep your fucking hands off my money!
0	1523379877	2	Fuck you OP for this clickbait. Not all the banks banned 
0	1523380251	2	anyone who thinks localeth or local btc is the future, is sorely, sorely, sorely mistaken lolyes in person meetups are DEF THE FUTURE!!!my god.
0	1523385627	2	This is a shitty title. Yes, canadian banks are banning it - but only "some" canadian banks. Pretty disingenuous phrasing. 
0	1523387007	2	HI-larious that institutional banking powers think they can control crypto.You can’t. I mean that’s not today a bunch of banks are holding crypto as we speak. But the idea that they can “control” it” is laughable. Pretty much the same way core devs think they can control the entire crypto space XD. Core devs are the same as banks guys!!!!
0	1523366748	6	And soon, Indians will join.
1	1523368124	1	amen
0	1523366985	3	In related news car manufacturers just announced that they will ban electric engines from their plants. 
0	1523376297	3	Things arent as bad as you might think...The banks arent necessarily against crypto per say, theyre against the massive headaches created by customers using credit to fund their crypto accounts and this is a measure to push for regulation. Look at it from their perspective - thousands of their customers put their money into the market at an all time high, and then the market crashed 75% in many cases.. some worse. Many of these people racked up their credit cards at 20ish% interest because a friend told them they couldnt lose... The banks had to take action now, rather than a year from now when its many times the ammount of $ where real damage could be done.. and in my opinion as soon as its in place we will begin to see growth in this market beyond what most think. 2-3trillion m.cap is just the beginning...Im in no way on their side, and its our money to do with what we like but its actually a good thing because whats needed is just enough regulation and education to ensure the crypto market can grow and establish itself for years to come.Cryptocurrency is in the growing pains stage right now, but there are a lot of good people working to legitimize it and in the very near future onboarding fiat will be easy, as will withdrawing into fiat. Big & great changes are coming! Exciting times ahead..
1	1523379267	1	This is an underrated comment. I agree 100%.
0	1523366808	3	Check out payfair it’s a new escrow platform set to release this month 
0	1523365876	2	This might cause more sites that avoid traditional banking to develop.
0	1523371762	1	Yeah, they want to ban it so they can accumulate. World wide scheme
0	1523372333	1	You can't ban crypto, you can only ban yourself com using crypto
0	1523372851	1	The banks are trying to play a giant game of whac-a-mole, except everytime they whack one, 2 more pop up wearing a helmet.
0	1523374592	1	Wait, I know TD did stuff regarding using their credit cards to buy cryptocurrency, but did they also block debit purchases (eg. using their Visa Debit branded bank cards)?  I still have them linked to Coinbase, but I haven't bought anything in a while through them.
0	1523374595	1	Anarchy !! Free the people !
0	1523374655	1	Ok I understand Credit Cards since its a buying on their dime, but I'll be dammed if you try and tell me how I should spend my money.
0	1523375239	1	These banks are catalyzing the accelerated growth of crypto with this ridiculous Streisand effect move.
0	1523375815	1	I've been using a Scotiabank debit and have had no issues.
0	1523375829	1	Both Debit and Credit purchases have been BLOCKED by TD & BMO. I decided to send my cash via money order, you can send $1000 per and it only took 2 days. 
0	1523375873	1	I'm confused, is there some reason you can't just do an ACH transfer in Canada?
0	1523376389	1	Same is gonna happen in India. They've got 3 months time period from RBI to stop all deals with virtual currency.
0	1523377135	1	I like coinsquare. Just e-transfer.
0	1523377368	1	Isn't this just credit cards? I really don't see a problem with this. I've been annoyed as all hell about it because of the ease of using a cc vs setting up a PAD but I get why... Even discount brokerages take an arm and a leg to setup, crypto should have similar checks and balances. They aren't making profit off it other than following securities laws (and in crypto that's very few)
0	1523377773	1	How are banks even allowed to ban this?
0	1523379888	1	I been with TD bank since November and been using interact   Instant transfer with no hold time with Quadrigacx with no problem. Also my account with Quadrigacx is verified. Hope TD don’t stop it. 
0	1523380063	1	I was under the impression Canada is crypto-friendly and they only banned transactions from *credit* cards i.e taking on debt to buy. Can anyone confirm?
1	1523380265	1	A few banks have banned debit and credit purchases.
0	1523381544	1	What about credit unions?
0	1523381965	1	Call your bank and threaten to leave. They always cave
0	1523382030	1	What is the best way to from localbitcoins without getting duped?
0	1523382318	1	Credit unions, my dudes
0	1523383470	1	Not just banks, there is no good reputation exchange in Canada. Even you bought the Cryptocurrency you want, it is hard to cash out when you wanna sell them.[‘I just want my money back.’ Couple had $100K wire stuck for months after trying to buy Bitcoin](https://globalnews.ca/news/4090875/100k-wire-transfer-bitcoin-canada-quadriga-cx/)
0	1523383607	1	Yay Canada bans crypto is the new fud! No one cares about India so let's try this lol. 
0	1523383704	1	Except my bank hasn't stopped me nor ever will from buying btc with wires, and no I never minded buying with wires, I think it's actually wiser then touching crypto with credit. But all these FUD articles got to stop, cuz this one's horse shit.
0	1523384296	1	what about wire transfers??
0	1523385255	1	Just got off the phone with BMO, and the explanation I got was that credit and debit cards **with credit card functionality** (e.g. cards that can be loaded up with funds and used like a typical debit/Interac card) cannot be used for crypto purchases. Interac transfers, wire transfers etc. are still fine. The rep attributed this issue to MasterCard (which all BMO credit cards are). I specifically asked if there was any issue with an Interac deposit to a crypto exchange, and I was told no, this is fine. Given her (initially) frustrated tone, I suspect there’s been a lot of calls about this in the last couple of days. 
0	1523385424	1	Get right fucked, Canadian big 5.
0	1523385917	1	Seems weird to me. Quite frankly, currently anyone investing into cryptocurrencies is a person that actually goes an effort to achieve something. Meaning if someone buys cryptocurrencies, that person as well will most likely be willing to switch the bank if necessary. As long as there are banks that allow cryptotrading, it seems those banks banning it will be missing out. Also it's a very shit statement to make. 
0	1523368098	1	Switching banks really isn't that difficult, FYI. Vote with your wallet.
1	1523373231	2	This is Canada. There are only 5 banks. Three of them are currently banning crypto with the other two likely following soon.
0	1523370091	0	I'm no longer able purchase crypto with my HSBC credit card.
1	1523374517	1	good because you should not use credit card for this
2	1523379169	1	I easily have enough cash on hand to cover anything. This is more convenient.
0	1523382921	0	Most of the Canadians are leftists.

The shops part of it is already out in beta (shops allows you to find shops in your area that accept crypto). Here is a chart comparing Dether with localbitcoins and others: https://imgur.com/a/lkI2D
