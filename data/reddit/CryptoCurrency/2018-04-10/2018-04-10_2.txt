No political or socioeconomic factors have yet done anything to effect the price.>Bitcoins are still going to be used but I don't think you'll ever see it over 10$ again.LOL
1	1523338956	126	lol, I wonder what comments in reddit will be this hilarious in a couple of years 
2	1523342695	140	This one will still be good:"Why does Dr. Pepper come in bottles?Because his wife died."
3	1523370195	5	It's been 7 hours and I still don't get it.
4	1523372493	12	sex joke
5	1523386831	1	Still don't get it..
4	1523373040	3	Cum. 
2	1523353204	26	Last three month's comments of this sub will outdo anything we have seen in the last ten years combined. 
3	1523356435	12	Or the time when everyone was zealously saying every coin was going to moon. 
4	1523363946	0	Yeah sure but that won't be better than these guys getting rekt from btc making its moves and making them buy higher (which they absolutely will coz they still think they genius traderbois)....yet again, just like trend. Imagine how dumb do you have to be to make the mistake everywhere warns you about not making everywhere they see. 
2	1523347456	50	Pretty much fucking all of them.  People didn't know back then and you can bet your ass they were using TA to support their statement  that BTC will never be $100 because look at this Bart Simpson Loreal Head and Shoulders Knee's and Toes section of the chart, it's so similar to X stock and Y company!
3	1523353239	12	TA traders, the george bushes of this sub
4	1523361562	3	Technical analysis analysts?
5	1523364403	3	fine i edited you jerk :p
6	1523365593	2	I thought it was funny. Like RIP in peace or VIN number.
4	1523361073	0	Don't insult George Bush like that
2	1523361562	3	The current verge situation?
2	1523371896	2	Link 1000 eoy
2	1523356228	1	All of them
2	1523373362	1	Most of the comments are already hilarious because people over react
2	1523380296	1	"buy verge"
2	1523381284	1	RemindMe! 2 years "That was easy!"
2	1523385781	1	"this is still early stages we will double ath in a year"
2	1523357126	1	This one, when it is revealed that you are, in fact, satoshi nakamoto himself.
2	1523361792	0	RemindMe! 3years
2	1523371103	0	The comments like “I’ll buy back into BTC when it hits 2k”....those will be hilarious in a few years...but frustrating to see such pessimism and non-belief at these current times. 😤
1	1523352408	6	/u/polost
2	1523369043	2	Lol RIP 
1	1523351017	4	That guy must really feel like an idiot.
2	1523353650	5	I guess we will too if we complain about the price.
3	1523369843	1	I have a feeling he is stilling on a couple of hundred BTCs though
1	1523386166	1	lol, I had to double check that wasn't an old alt of mine.I've been not buying bitcoin since it was around a dollar, I don't regret a thing.
0	1523336494	107	Had a friend who was early in the Bitcoin game, he had a site where you could buy btc with fiat. This was something like 6 years ago. At a party he was going on and on about how he wanted me to invest, "just buy a couple of bitcoins, they will be worth atleast double your money in a couple of years!".. I was stupid, didnt buy any, just laughed at him..
1	1523364381	10	I read about Ethereum's amazing new technology on some tech blog when it was 0.3 $. Needless to say i didnt buy shit :) 
2	1523365774	4	I remember when it was crowd funding and everyone was excited about it. I had trouble wrapping my head around what it did and so I just ignored it.
2	1523386890	1	I bought dogecoin instead of investing in the ehtereum ICO.
2	1523373792	-1	Don't let the same thing happen to you with REQ. 
2	1523364626	0	If i would have bought 1k worth of ETH and sold at peak thats 4.6million$$
1	1523343434	38	Same with me, my brother told me about it in 2013 when it was $80 (and when I was 18). He insisted and I was like "lol no you're nuts, I'm not gonna buy something like this".I could've bought about 90 with the savings I had. Needless to say I'm salty af.
2	1523346045	37	I think I’ve got you guys beat.  I had a friend who was telling me to buy when it was under $.10 many years ago.  At the time he believed it would change the world and make a ton of money in the process....He had over 7k bitcoins to which he lost his private key to when his stash was worth about $20k...you can do the math regarding how much that would be worth now... lol, depressing to say the least as if he had held till now he could be incredibly wealthy, even more so if he had picked some winner alts along the way....one of his close friends  who got in even earlier is nearly a billionaire based on his btc and alt holdings.   He also had a another friend who had mined since the very beginning at one point amassing roughly 100k btc.  After the mount gox collapse, he sold everything at the absolute low of a dollar or two... lol, hindsight is 20/20.
3	1523347099	14	I wonder if BTC would be rank 1 if lost coins were not counted in the market cap.
4	1523354687	7	It would definitely still be #1, but with less max supply, making each coin worth far more.  Remember, the value of your coin doesn't effect the market cap; the market cap effects the value of your coin.  1000 btc purchased at 50 cents a pop is just $500 in the pot, regardless of price fluctuations, but since they'll never cash out, the value of those coins would be evenly distributed among the remaining coins had they ceased to exist.  Imagine if 1 bil coins were lost forever.  That would majorly increase the value of the remaining supply.  However, since these values are unknown, we just assume they're still part of the max supply.
5	1523361518	5	Each coin wouldn't be worth "far more." The assumption of burned coins is already built into the price
6	1523385125	1	This is partially true.  The price is based on the current circulating supply not the overall supply, but there is a psychological effect on demand if the max supply drops; however, it isn't readily quantifiable.  I simplified for the sake of ease.
5	1523359546	4	Well these coins are never going to be sold so even if we remove them the market doesn't change, only the misleading market cap number.
6	1523385197	1	Supply goes down, demand goes up, and the current value per coin far exceeds the input value at time of perchase.
7	1523386026	1	Supply means things that are actually for sale or could potentially be sold in... ever. These coins are already lost forever, they are not supply anymore, their removal would only have a psychological effect because people look at the market cap number and think woooow that is high.There is no market force behind destroyed supply and removing the dead corpses doesn't change supply and demand since they already got removed from that equation. 
8	1523387239	1	I said as such in response to another comment above.  The psychological effect of lowering overall supply is still relevant, as it effects perceived value of an asset when lost asset quantities are unknown; however, this is not easily quantifiable. 
4	1523353372	-2	Good luck with that dream mate lol I guess you're not clearly reading literally the OP of this thread. 
3	1523380612	1	This makes me wonder how many super early adopters lost their private keys in a similar fashion.  The end final circulating supply is probably going to be closer to 15-18M than 21Million
3	1523386268	1	Wow I cant even believe losing 7k bitcoins. Holy shhhhhhiat!
1	1523341109	17	You weren't stupid. This is why I don't kick myself for buying BTC 5-6 years ago or even 3 years ago whatever.At that time _it was a stupid decision_ to buy btc. Extremely risky with extremely high chance of dying before becoming anything meaningful. If I had the chance to go back in time to that same situation with same facts at hand I would again make the same decision to **NOT** buy bitcoin.Doesn't mean that a stupid decision couldn't end up being one of the absolute highest ROI you could ever achieve. Because it did.
2	1523345716	20	To be fair it was only a stupid decision if you spent any meaningful amount of money on it. 
3	1523361242	4	it was not stupid at all, the guy you responded to is just coping with his lack of foresight, something being risky doesn't translate to something being stupid, stupid would be putting all your lifesavings into something risky
2	1523353609	10	Those upvotes from people whove turned from investors into memes over the years and still dont learn lulz.If you think people bought btc in 2013 to hold youre deluded or didn't DYOR. it was an immutable online currency with hundreds of thousands of online merchants readily accepting it. Silk road going down was probably the biggest passing of the test for btc, as its security or immutability was never once compromised even during the heights of the silk road chase by govts across the wolrd literally. Thats why it has tuirned into a reliable store of value now. Every old btc hodler spent a lot of btc as money and they all have these regrets, even though it's only hindsight and nothing else. 
3	1523365671	2	I kick myself thinking how much my dining room chairs are “worth”, since I bought them with bitcoin years ago.Also kills me to look through my *phone’s* wallet history and see me casually sending and receiving a few bitcoins at a time.Everyone assumed they would have bought low and sold at the peak, not realizing they would have probably sold far far lower for good profit. The folks that got really wealthy lost or forgot about their tons of coins and then found them again much later.
4	1523367527	1	Not for profit, a lot of people would have spent them on shit they dont need like games and stuff when its price went up. it was genuinely a currency man, i do not remember knowing the crypto anarchist side of it. everyone knew it as currency till 2013ish then it became this thing that can also maybe take over money. Even satioshi wasnt sure about its end game, he just wanted a safe, peer to peer cash system which it was for a long time
2	1523361017	6	since when risky = stupid?
2	1523345609	2	You’re telling me if you had the chance for the lambo dream and you wouldn’t take it? Yeah right...
2	1523386960	1	lol no. it was stone cold dumb
2	1523376581	0	This is just getting upvoted by everyone that is salty they didn't get in earlier to make them feel better about themselves.
2	1523354937	-8	Agreed.  Loads of us looked at BTC years ago.  The absolute only things it was used for were child porn and drugs - that pizza purchase was an anomaly.   Oh and for drugs, you were better off sticking with fiat currency and ordering off craigslist anyway.  Then there were the ridiculous charges and laughable exchange rates for BTC to fiat.  That was if you could even find somewhere to exchange them.  Oh and even back then, downloading the wallet meant downloading the whole fucking blockchain along with it.  It really was a total non-starter back then.  Great if you were into extremely dodgy porn, but for everything else - including murder, you were better off sticking with fiat.Regardless.  If you did buy back then, you'd have sold out the moment it hit $10 or $20 and if you didn't sell out when it hit $100 you'd have been an idiot.  Always keep in mind that the only thing you could use it for was child porn.  There was really no other use for it.
3	1523387071	1	Not true. I used it to buy takeaway curries.Now it's one of the most expensive takeaway food in my life.
1	1523362825	-1	I lost $3,000 in 2013 playing poker. If I had put that into BTC instead..... Live and learn I guess... :(
0	1523342057	59	These comments are pretty entertaining to look back on:>I feel like a moron. I bought $1000 worth at $12.50 / BTC thinking it was a great investment. Gunna hang in there and not sell though.Which was followed by this reply:>Gonna go for "fully burned" instead of "recovered half of what I foolishly sunk into this nonsense", huh?>That's dedication.Some things never change.
1	1523370918	8	my favourite from the threads posted when it dropped 90% in value;>Its not dead, its just getting over the phase of people looking for a quick buck. Its moving towards the stability phase. The trick to keeping it alive is to use it some more, the way it was originally intended. As long as its not volatile, it can be worth 100 times less what it now in "real" currency and still be useful.
0	1523333777	95	 > I'm going to say something that is unpopular:> This article is spot on. Bitcoin will be basically dead in a about 6 months. Post from 6 years ago on the 90% drop. I loled.
1	1523342312	36	To be fair I can't blame them. Experiencing something like that would be crazy. If we grinded down to $2k from here that would be the equivalent.
2	1523346960	16	Despair is when you buy.  That's now.
3	1523351319	25	Do you really think this is despair? The sentiment around here seems to positive to be labeled as despair. Restless and impatient maybe.  
4	1523359359	8	I think that time can lead to despair just as much as price drops can. Imagine if we stagnated in the $6k range for nearly all of 2018 and dropped to high $5k for most of 2019! Could be just as bad.
5	1523374292	2	I wouldn’t be surprised if that actually happened. Bitcoin stagnated like that once before for about just as long.
4	1523372275	1	You can find dispair on r/BitcoinMarkets.
4	1523373410	1	Better wording: accumulation phase
3	1523350317	9	>Despair is when you buy. That's now.!remindme 30 days Will this be true dispair? Can things get worse?

4	1523371389	1	!remindme 30 days
3	1523374003	3	Nah mate, too risky to buy now. Buy at $15k, panic sell at $13k then rebuy at $17k for mad profit.
3	1523352948	5	This is nowhere near despair I think
4	1523369402	1	For me personally, I think it's a touch past despair. A few weeks ago, I was checking prices a few times per day. I went to the Reddit crypto subs multiple times per day. I was thinking I'm going to lose my whole bag.Now, I've come to terms that I will lose everything. I'm checking in here maybe once or twice a week. I just don't care as much anymore.I do have a feeling that things will come back up, but I think it's an off chance. I'm in an acceptance stage.Still, I'm only about 30% down in total. If I were down 90%, it would still be the same though. The trend is the cause for my loss of faith.
5	1523374431	2	I’m down 53%. I’ve decided to not worry about it and just check back every once in a while. I used to check prices a few times a day, now maybe once a week or less. It’ll be fine. Plus all the money I invested was disposable. 
3	1523367773	1	When it hits 2k I'm borrowing from my 401K
3	1523383806	1	Only if you're lucky and buy the right thing. more often then not, they go the way of millions of legitimate and profitable companies that have gone bankrupt.
3	1523365600	-1	[deleted]
4	1523371299	1	Nope, 2011 here.
2	1523371528	3	> If we grinded down to $2k from here that would be the equivalent.What's crazy is that I don't think anyone here imagines the price going back to $1,189. And that's where it was just 1 year ago.The stock market can lose years of returns in a bad year.
0	1523334212	116	Wow this is incredible. The similarities to the Reddit posts we see today are striking. Just wow! The market cycles/sentiment are literally identical. 
1	1523343240	36	Basic human psychology didn't change much in the past 10 years.
2	1523348989	3	totally agreed!
1	1523341802	12	Yeah, emboldens me and puts things in perspective. 
2	1523344535	16	It may embolden people, but overall it embiggens the crypto economy. 
3	1523349969	10	Keep in mind the crypto community is not cromulent enough in its current state. 
4	1523362942	5	I've never heard that word before I moved to Reddit...
5	1523365586	2	Watch more Simpsons.
5	1523382570	1	It’s more of a Utica phrase 
3	1523362139	3	emboldening if true
3	1523366262	0	it will only embiggen the most cromulant of investors though
2	1523348381	5	It embiggens me
0	1523333344	38	Dam that first post, a $50 btc is what they wanted
1	1523334189	15	I want $50 BTC, and I need it now! - JG Wentworth 
2	1523335004	5	“I want $50 BTC, and I need it now!” - HODLLLLLLLLLL, Reddit
3	1523339387	4	I wonder if any of them sold out before this bull run
4	1523367209	1	Most of them likely did. The thing about this market is it's easy to look back and say "wow, imagine if I'd just bought bitcoin in 2010 and held all this time!" but the reality is much more difficult than that.Imagine buying/mining some bitcoin in 2010 (worth fractions of a cent at the time) and watching it slowly climb up and up. One day it goes on the mother of all bull runs. It passes 5c. Then 10c. Then 50c. You're on cloud nine. Holy shit, it just reached $1! This magic internet money I bought is going to make me rich!But suddenly, it crashes from $1 all the way down to 30c. "What was I thinking?! I got greedy. I should've sold at the top. That money could've bought me a new PC!". You browse your favourite bitcoin discussion forum and suddenly all these threads are popping up mocking "bagholders who bought at the top for $1".There have been plenty of times in the history of this market when things have looked very, very bleak. Even just last year there was a crash around July which I'm sure many people thought was the end of Ethereum. [I stumbled across this video the other day from just July last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiXS_jjJYY8). This was right after Ethereum crashed from its all time high of ~$400 all the way down to sub-$150. It's literally making fun of holders. "Mum, it's going to recover, right?" etc. Of course, as we know it did recover and went all the way to $1400 in early January.Everything always seems so bleak in the moment. This market is a wild ride.
5	1523367215	2	 > 1!1! = 1
6	1523373448	1	Good bot.
0	1523338113	28	/u/Arro, still got any of those 80 bitcoin?
1	1523349125	60	Nah, sold in 2013.  Whoops.
2	1523362215	8	You're not fooling anyone... 
2	1523350319	8	Ouch!
2	1523350559	4	u still around, you bought back in?
3	1523385386	1	Looking in his comment history, looks like he's not much into crypto anymore so might infer that he hasn't bought back in. But who knows
2	1523350467	2	Are you hodling now?
2	1523354101	2	:(
2	1523365961	2	I bet he's married
3	1523373122	-1	Yet still cums in bottles. 
2	1523384534	1	Haha just read it and was going to ask the same question.
0	1523337555	24	> Now, that same $50 8th of weed costs 21.28 BTCMy heart! 
1	1523350516	13	that better had to be some dank stuff
2	1523357090	20	imagine buying weed off someone in real life with 21 bitcoin. the dealer is just like. i dont know what to do with this man. ill just put it where i know i wont lose it (behind a picture frame or in a bible), then he comes back years later and sees you on the street corner. he is in his lambo. he asks you how that eighth was, and spins his tires until they are burning rubber and he peels off into the sunset
3	1523357485	10	LMFAO" how dat eighth pleighboi"
1	1523354178	3	This is nothing. I remember grams of ecstacy for like 10btc on silk road back in 2011. To imagine this was a time most of us remember and yet most didn't take the plunge lol
2	1523383220	1	I used to order shit like this through a mutual friend. We would give him fiat and he would buy bitcoin and do the transaction. He would obviously keep a lot of the money but hey I was looking to roll with my friends not make financial decisions that could have changed my life. Im pretty sure the kid had a few hundred bitcoin in 2015 or so from doing this. Im not sure what ever happened to him but would not be surprised if he was a millionaire rn. Now I work in blockchain and I kick myself for not learning how to buy and sell bitcoin back then.
0	1523335298	45	I remember years ago. The surprising thing is that even though I knew this could be “the big” thing, you were skeptical. When it peaked 250, there was no way I thought it could go to 1,000.When it peaked to 1,000. It was a new paradigm, the biggest bubble, greatest pump and dump, the modern tulip and it seemed impossible to even make it past 1100 again.When it exploded to 6,000, things were out of control. “Insanity” was the definition I gave to whoever even invested.When it peaked to 19k , I didnt even know what to think now. Just pure greed.Trying not to have the same regrets is believing bitcoins will rise now from 6k to 50k. Do you believe this? It’s the same struggle we all made before it mooned before.
1	1523343813	17	I think we’re on an S-curve to $5 - $10 trillion. It’s merely a function of time and development. 
2	1523376724	1	> It’s merely a function of time and developmentExacto. Networks grow exponentially 
2	1523385446	1	This is why buying now is such a great opportunity 
1	1523343743	12	During many years I thought than Bitcoin had 50 percent chances to value 1 million or zero in 15 years.Today, I think the chances are 70% (for 1 million) versus 30% (for zero).
2	1523371050	-1	I too would love to believe this but it seems to me Bitcoin has been hijacked and is being manipulated into something originally unintended. I really hope I'm wrong. Perhaps the FUD has just gotten to me.
3	1523374767	2	"hijacked" ?Bitcoin is still the same, but better (segwit + LN + all the future développements) . It is what I see.
4	1523376307	1	What are your thoughts on this post from Feb 2016:https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/47zfzt/blockstream_is_now_controlled_by_the_bilderberg/
0	1523350381	21	This was my favorite part of the discussion:"I feel like a moron. I bought $1000 worth at $12.50 / BTC thinking it was a great investment. Gunna hang in there and not sell though"
1	1523369178	4	Hope that dude held and cashed out that 1.6 million.
0	1523347273	16	This is certainly interesting given all the recent sentiment.What I would say though is we should not look at a past situation that is similar to a current one and point to it as evidence of where the market will actually go.  No one really knows and just because what we see now is very similar to what we saw before is no evidence that what happened then will repeat.Right that's my bit done for when someone trawls posts in six years time when Bitcoin is $500,000
0	1523333471	40	In the bitcoin 90% decrease article, the top rated comment is that bitcoin will be dead in 6 months. That was 6 years ago lol. There is a lot of FUD and I understand the differences from then until now, but we will go back up and we will see adoption. These current views are very short sided. Edit: also thanks op for this. Good to put things in perspective 
1	1523337458	23	Also 6 years ago the odds of bitcoin dying were still pretty high.  
2	1523338566	8	Yeah, I had never really given this much thought before, but there were a *LOT* of factors that had to go just right in order for Bitcoin to get to where it is now.Then again, that same idea applies to literally the entire universe, so it's no surprise I guess.
3	1523347027	8	I think it's safe to say without the silk road and other darknet markets bitcoin might actually have died
4	1523354044	6	Not really, bitcoin was being used across the internet in 2013.  Silk road proved its immutability and resistance from censorship sure, but i dont think it was even 10% of the whole btc adoption across the web.
1	1523353966	3	whats the difference between then till now? literally look like the same aituation to everyone whose held through all these years. this is a cycle
2	1523374450	0	Government and banks were not involved
3	1523374649	2	Wow dude. how old are you? you seriously have no idea how many attacks govts have tried to stop silk road. Do you even know what amount of drugs was being cuirculated through silk road back then? read up, those articles are still online. Interpol FBI the Australlian intelligence; it was a mindfuck for them.Govts are friendly towards it now. You got it the opposite friend. 2010-2016 was full on govt attack and noone even knew if they wont just succeed.
1	1523366502	1	short sighted
0	1523356122	24	I looked at the history of a couple of the very negative comments there ~  people who were saying "bitcoin is dead its never going to reach 50$ its a tulip all over again."  ~ some of those people are now frequent posters on the buttcoin reddit...I think they are actually so butt hurt that they did not buy and missed out on being rich so now they spend their time railing against crypto on that thread....Hilarious losers.
1	1523365736	3	SODLers remorse 
2	1523365802	2	That would be very intense remorse indeed!
1	1523371368	2	Buttcoin is the r/iamverysmart of cryptocurrency. Some of them even have degrees in the emperor's new clothes, and have been buttcoining for longer than most of us have been hodling. 
1	1523385597	1	LMFAO good find. You are so right! Butt Hurt!
0	1523334783	10	The more things change, the more they stay the same lol
0	1523341644	10	So...hodl?
0	1523347914	7	So many of those redditors are now millionaires!
1	1523385639	1	And so many of them would have been millionaires. Crazy to read all the comments
0	1523355033	7	/u/tcpip4lyfe well shit,it seems like bitcoin didn't die in 6 months
1	1523360965	5	Yep I was wrong.  I used to have 20 btc sitting in dropbox.  Forgot about it, and dropbox deleted my account.  Also, It's pretty fucking weird that at least twice a year someone makes a thread about a comment I made 6 years ago. I see the BTC community is just as toxic as it was when it started.   The majority of you guys weren't even aware bitcoin existed 6 years ago,
2	1523361143	6	I don't think it's about toxicity,the market is down right now, so people are trying to find comfort.  BTW it is possible the dropbox account still exists,i suggest trying to contact dropbox about it.
3	1523361463	11	Nah they are gone.  I've been down that road.  I've made peace with it.   
4	1523361620	3	Sorry,good luck.
5	1523361684	7	Thanks.  Same. 
2	1523371922	1	TBF they quote some really _good_ predictions from 6 years ago too. You just hear from Bitcoiners when they're looking for examples of people being wrong, so it's biased towards toxic threads.
2	1523374244	0	How is it pretty fucking weird? BTC is still around, and you weren't just wrong ... you were dead wrong.Of course you're going to keep getting called out 
3	1523385745	2	Easy man. Lets not kick him when he's down. He already admitted he was wrong plus lost 20 btc. Let it go
0	1523355287	6	I like this one. he was trying to be funny/Sarcastic. now who is laughing.http://i.imgur.com/W1JCW.png
1	1523356614	7	Omg the chart looks like now!
2	1523371565	6	Who would have guessed, if you're trying to buy low, then the chart will always look like shit when you buy!
1	1523371670	5	That chart looks awfully similar to the one we have now,  so after summer moon right?
2	1523373132	1	It's a repeating cycle, So ya. from $5 it hit a price of $50 bucks in 2012 then 2013 it was about 1.3k. So think about now after this low what will the price be by summer and how high will it be in 2019.  hmm
3	1523374986	1	Well, alot of projects will be complete by 2019.  The implementation of Gifto into UpLive, APPC in the Aptoide store. Hubii Network etc etc.   If the market goes down after this happens, then I will offically give up trying to figure out everything.   Whatever I have in is there to stay.  Fuck it at this point.  If it does reach a new ATH... I'm practically gonna be rich.  If it doesn't oh well, but at least I know when it does happen, in not gonna miss it .   HODL
0	1523355411	7	wow the hate on blockchain from /u/wharpudding conflating it somehow the libertarianism and Ayn Rand :) @ https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ka3mo/its_the_perfect_time_to_buy_bitcoins/?st=JFT4A1II&sh=c9e29545
1	1523365682	8	The guy was sitting there laughing his ass off at people and mocking them for thinking they can get rich. Laughing at people as their "tulips are wilting". By the way, Bitcoin was $5 at the time.>I'm here to laugh my ass off at the frauds who think they can get rich by getting in on the ground-floor of this fairy-dust factory. People with visions of rolling around in piles of bitcoins as they fork over the cash for 16 high-end video cards. "I'll be rich! With no real work involved!A full 6-7 years later, he's *still* posting on r/buttcoin after all this time, *still* mocking cryptocurrency.Some people are just too stubborn for their own good.
2	1523373400	3	> no real work involved!Earning the initial investment capital, learning technical details, setting up hardware, and taking a huge risk repeatedly for years were the easy parts. Putting up with these idiots for 6 years was hard work. The worst haters aren't the old people who don't get the technical stuff, never learned any economics, and just heard something bad on TV. The worst are guys like this who were educated enough to know better, but are too in love with themselves to admit they were wrong. "lol have you even _read_ Keynes?"
1	1523372685	3	> conflating it somehow tih libertarianism[To be fair...](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/12/)> It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I'm better with code than with words though.
2	1523372953	2	Fair point indeed.
0	1523340420	6	Thank you for compiling this. I love dipping into the archives to put things into historical perspective. With so much fixation on day to day events in the crypto space, I find it useful every once in a while to take a big step back and look at the bigger picture!

0	1523356535	3	Amazing comments. Thanks OP for posting. 
0	1523343790	11	For all that is said about bitcoin, eth changed the game and gave cryptocurrency actual meaning and usecases besides being a store of value. Bitcoin would be nowhere without eth and the same the other way round.
1	1523354292	-12	> Bitcoin would be nowhere without ethLOL whut?Eth is a baby altcoin that only came into relevance last year and is on its way out again when everyone realized na it is a shitcoin after all. It was like $10 in 2016 dec. Your opinion matters nothing to the cold hard facts of history. 
2	1523356357	2	Yeah I'm sure blockchain technology would be as pronounced without eth.
3	1523364125	-7	Lol what does eth even do. Half it's shit ICOs are scams, the other half are just cash grabs people are now realizing could always be implemented on btc, and dumping it. 0x whut? Ever heard of Ark or stablecoins? You want smart contracts? Yeah welcome to btc again bitch lulz. You can already build smart contracts on the secure and decentralized btc chain through Omni if you really really want, and a lot of those coins do very well for research purposes. Eth's supply isn't even set yet, double spends on it are a matter of conviction and who they piss off and not protocol, and it's pretty centralized as far as consensus goes. Vitalik is basically Eth's CEO, even though I respect him for doing what he does for blockchain. I would certainly say that some eth ICOs may just end up surviging the shit that is eth, like enj ven omg etc. Evgen then, theyre on very shaky grounds. BTC has to irrevocably prove it can't do what these coins do, otherwise whales and og's (people who matter) will keep buying altcoins including eth to increase their btc and nothing else. 
4	1523372742	1	You are quite delusional, ark's VM is built on solidity and is a port from eth. So what if half the icos are cash grabs? That's what happens when the ecosystem is great and people are greedy. Have a nice day.
2	1523368197	1	ETH and it's ICO mania kick started the 2017 bull run. 
0	1523346928	2	How easy was it to purchase BTC back then?
1	1523368185	2	Bitinstant was pretty easy. 
0	1523351598	2	More than 70% all marketcap is with Asia people... the ocident people, like me, are introducing to cryptos recently... I can read all day in USA news, and blogs, too much new investors still will join.In 2018 the world talk about regulamentation like never before. We are in progress and in maturation. All we need is patience to wait the grow.I follow blog, news and analyzes of experts in Brazil and the United States and I am verifying that in these last days they are all arriving at the consensus that the end of the falls is next, for several different reasons. I believe in these analyzes because they are professionals who have made the predictions and past analyzes that I follow. I'm optimistic for 2018
0	1523363081	2	It wasn’t the easiest to buy bitcoin years ago, depending on your country, I bought in 2013 on the site btc-e (now called wex) - it was dodgey and I felt like I was going into something underground, all the options I had to turn my fiat from aud to usd then buy crypto were shit. I still did it, glad I did due to the massive returns I got, but yeah it was high risk. Never lost anything from the btc-e take down, but wow that was a stressful time since I still had some coins left there, wasn’t sure I’d ever get my money back lol I read extensively before investing, to try and really understand what blockchain is, DYOR so important! I didn’t even use reddit much back then, only regret 😄
0	1523364943	2	/u/polost did you sell or hold from that comment you made? https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ka3mo/its_the_perfect_time_to_buy_bitcoins/c2ixnef/

2	1523387154	1	I realized that was his only comment in a crypto forum.   He most likely wasn't an investor but fuck him.  His loss lol 
0	1523354424	4	One thing that I noticed is that a lot of the older accounts that are still active in cryptocurrency post in r/BTC.  This is something that I've always been told but I guess this really makes it apparent the number of old time Bitcoiner's that support BCH.  The second thing lately that had a similar effect on me is when Roger Ver (yeah I know) was in a debate with Samson and stated that he would be willing to adopt 2nd layer solutions  such as the lightning network, after they had been fully vetted/tested.  DYOR I guess.
1	1523375326	2	On the other hand, I noticed a lot of new or clearly "reactivated" accounts on /r/btc that were posting like crazy before I unsubscribed. The second thing that had a similar effect on me was Roger whining about what people called BCH in an interview and giving out the middle finger generously.So I guess impact depends on what you were exposed to. As an aside, it doesn't matter what Roger says he's willing to adopt because he is not a developer for Bitcoin ABC. Actually, pretty sure he's not a coder at all. That said, LN is workable on a chain without segwit but will suffer from a lot of slowdowns and drawbacks. 
0	1523352973	2	Look at the top post>Yeah predictions are great and all, but do you know what else you can use to determine where a price may be in the future? Trends! Trends even have the advantage of being based on ACTUAL DATA rather than MAGIC and WISHES.>Let's see what the trend over the past few months has to say:>http://i.imgur.com/W1JCW.png>Huh, whaddaya know, you were right all along. Carry on.How many of these TA trade noobs do you see in this sub everyday these days, smug because they tethered last night and now think theyre smarter than HODLers who have 10000xed their investments just by not doing what they did; trying to apply market analysis to something they will never, ever make a single penny off. This market is simply not for traders or investors. Whoever looking at this and cares even 1 bit about prices and graphs, just remember that you will turn into memes in some years.Thanks for this OP, even though most of us remember these traderbois losing all through last ten years, seeing it for ourselves gives us a whole new perspective and regain the hope we have lost due to all these idiots entering in last 4 months. Also notice how market has never gone up when even one 'investor' has hopes it will go up. Look at the despair points, theyre absolute despair through and through, and people were still buying then. Dont do the same mistake you did then, buy during despair. The world thinks btc is over. there is never a better time to buy tbh

0	1523373676	1	I remember when I first heard of Bitcoin in November 2015. Was looking at an alternate way to fund for my sportsbook. That same month I discovered Ethereum. ETH was at like $.90. Wife and I had about 15k that we ended up tying up in a down payment on something that didn't go through. Even putting a portion of that towards ETH would have been great. But again, hindsight = 20/20.

0	1523383518	1	I remember being offered somewhere in the ballpark of 75BTC for my steam account in mid to late 2011. It was at that time a pretty impressive list of games and the guy was buying and selling steam accounts with games for bitcoin through voice chat on Counter Strike Source and DoDS.At that time I thought he was ripping me off. He told me he would transfer these coins into my wallet and that I could use them to trade for things on the internet. Hindsight is 20/20

0	1523353305	-3	It's just so obvious than when a product less than 1% of the population heard about, and the few merchants that hear about it are willing to adopt it, when 100% hear about it they'll also be willing to accept it!It's like making stats. Take random people, they're willing to accept a vague virtual currency as payment, so when the thing goes public and isn't vague anymore you really think it won't get accepted???These dumb fucks are probably the same people that bought in at 10k+ and are now holding waiting for a million.History will always repeat itself.
