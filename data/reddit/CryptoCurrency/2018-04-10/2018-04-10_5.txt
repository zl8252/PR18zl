0	1523315247	314	I'm honestly interested in finding out why Verge holders seem blatantly retarded. 
1	1523320784	88	The answer is always 'money'
2	1523327214	40	i joined their facebook group back in November, all of them were talking about how much money they would have if verge hit 1k per coin.it was blatantly obvious people don't understand dilution, # of coins in circulation, and especially not the tech although most were touting "wraith!!11!"
3	1523327543	16	the thing that bothers me is its not a difficult concept to understand.
4	1523332540	2	everyone can be blinded by facts and fundamentals when all they see is $_$
3	1523339394	12	That sounds like TRON and Electroneum holders also.  
4	1523351511	9	I have never ever ever seen a discussion about technology by a Verge or Tron holder.
4	1523344802	4	I don't even give a shit about Verge, but I have a special dislike for Justin Sun of Tron.. that guy just comes off like such a pretentious, air headed, buffoon. It may be because he's way more successful than I am at my age or the fact that he tries comparing his pipe dreams to be better than Ethereum which exists and already has a large infrastructure being developed by thousands of people.
5	1523367545	2	He annoys the shit out of me as well.  Yes hes supremely successful and young and richer than Ill ever be so call me salty if you'd like, IDGAF.  That youtube ama was the last straw for me in terms of giving him and/or TRX a chance.  He just threw the word "decentralized" into every answer as if the repetition of that word would lull everyone into a pliable blockchain induced coma....
3	1523371413	1	I once heard a guy saying if Amazon starts using bitcoin the supply would be double of what it is, like 22m coins, as if coins were created indefinitely.Dumb people all around.
3	1523375720	1	Agreed. I had made it clear that even $15 per coin was near impossible with the amount in circulation and the purpose of the coin. People banned me from Telegram, Discord, Reddit, etc... No one wants to listen. My guess is: there are a small handful of people making A LOT of money on Verge, by keeping people glued in and "filling their bags" with more XVG. These hodlers are making some really scammy people really rich.
3	1523344981	-25	Your speaking out of your arse dude. There are over 51k people in verges sub so show me where all of them were saying 1k, or show me where a significant portion of that group whether it be on facebook or the sub were saying it. Your Just another sad circle jerker jumping on the anti verge bandwagon.
4	1523346730	7	let me get in my time machine, go back to circa december and grab the posts out of my ass.verge is a shit coin. if you want to talk about good tech, look at nano, bch, btc, ethereum, and neo..
5	1523347577	-10	Yea grab the posts out of your ass because your talking out of your ass.
6	1523375621	2	speaking of which, i just took a large shit. 
6	1523357856	2	Assdamaged verge bag holder detected wee woo
7	1523359521	-4	Bag holder? What's your basis for this statement? Or are you just like the rest of the anti verge circle jerk group. That just posts absolute shyte.  Monero fan boy, ha ha ha
8	1523362322	-6	Down vote away... you sad fucks. 
6	1523367600	1	No, the posts will be in his ass because verge is a shitcoin...
1	1523327974	34	They bought it with the intention of making money, selling for loss is much like severing a deeply emotional connection to the idea of becoming rich
2	1523347474	9	> They bought it with the intention of making moneySo literally just like any other crypto out there? Don't be delusional and think that people have any other reason to participate in crypto.
3	1523357355	7	There is a difference between buying x crypto while believing in its technology because you did research about it and think it could make a nice profit, rather than blatantly investing in some scamcoin you obviously did no research about because you joined the hype. if you would do research reading it‚Äôs white paper or articles, any sane person would know it‚Äôs a scamcoin.
1	1523322162	20	Current education systems are putting 100s of 1000s of the, out into the real world every year.
2	1523322832	18	Am an educator; can confirm. 
1	1523333514	7	90% of their subreddit is pump oriented. They only want to get rich quick...it's going to be a sad ending
1	1523330125	6	maybe because they are up close to 300% since announcement of a partnership. Price rules everything
1	1523334450	8	They don't just seem blatantly retarded. They ARE blatantly retarded.Nobody who knows what they're doing owns any XVG. Anybody at all knowledgeable about the crypto-sphere will have jumped ship long ago.  
1	1523322365	4	Overinvested
2	1523322814	10	thats honestly what it seems like.  it reminds me of new investors that put too much money in a penny stock and drink the kool aid.  everything the company is doing is "revolutionary," in reality its their emotions getting in the way of seeing whats painfully obvious to everyone around them.
1	1523338293	2	they make money, +66% in less than a week. Hypothetical money, since they cant sell or move, or do anything with it. But, it is making a killing, Hypothetical 
1	1523331814	2	Their sub is an echo chamber of alt accounts praising verge, anything negative gets banned and verge holders are probably retarded. 
1	1523337191	2	The amount of stupid money in this market **>** the amount of smart money in this market
1	1523333418	2	It was once said that Nano is to Rick & Morty as Verge is to Walmart. And of course, Doge is to Doge as Doge is to Doge üêï 
2	1523350749	4	Verge is more likely going the way of kmart
1	1523350020	1	Cause verge holders have no experience , they are all sheep.
1	1523360459	1	Greater fool theory. They see a coin doing something fishy and they bet they can get in on that ride and get off before the core plays their trick.  
1	1523368655	1	The smart ones are scrambling to get out while encouraging everyone else to HODL to keep the market from crashing before they get theirs.See: every other shitcoin sub out there.
1	1523379498	1	Well when I first got in end of November the team was claiming to be getting organized and it sorta seemed that way to me so I bought in and it was 50% of my portfolio(it isn't that big). I had such high hopes for "Wraith Protocol" and was actually following each commit made by Sunerok. To be honest it seemed he knew as much about coding Blockchain as I did so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and waited... And waited... Once it came out and was STILL broken is when I sold. I never was 100% sure but it was a low buy-in with high potential and I thought they'd expand their development team. Nothing had changed though. This is still some Senior Project that is trying to be a Viable Coin. I sold all of mine back in January luckily after I realized the incompetence/misleading.
1	1523381334	1	I noticed for many of them English is not their first language. Maybe there is no translation for scam. 
1	1523326126	1	Hard to reason with people so far down in money from ATH as well as seeing green leading up to the event.It's sad.
2	1523337972	2	Im in no way a verge believer but for as many idiots that bought in at $0.20 there were plenty that had it at under $0.01. People just like to point out the bad in things. 
1	1523345010	0	And I'm honestly interested in finding out how you can generalize a whole group of people, without coming up with arguments regardless of how insulting it might be. 
2	1523350923	4	There are SO MANY RED FLAGS at Verge. Of course some folks will make money now, but many many other folks won't.A red flag? Someone mined 50 millions of XVG which everyone can see and follow through the public blockchain. With a coin which claims to be private, or have privacy features, why doesn't the attacker use Verges privacy to let his funds vanish? Simple answer: he just can not. Verge is NOT private.
1	1523349189	-3	Well, if you think that the partner could be PayPal. Then it is not so messed up buying in.
1	1523338196	-17	I think they like the gains, tbh. Verge is up 25% in the last 24 hours while most other coins are crapping out. XVG might be the next Bitcoin. With gainz like this it's definitely an alpha currency.
2	1523349565	4	Wow. Alpha currency. That's next level cringe dude. 
3	1523370421	1	"gainz"gag me with a spoon
3	1523356196	-2	I believe that phrase was coined by one of the #vergefam elders. He's a whale who helps guide the community. If you wonder how the verge-ins keep their positive attitude in spite of so the fud and hate, watch [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlmtJJvYKk).
2	1523338725	6	HahahahahahahahaYeah... No
2	1523370986	2	Only true alphas can handle verge's alphaness.  When you hold for a while and become true vergefam your body slowly begins to undergo a subtle changes which become more and more apparent over time.  You'll find muscles where before you found flab.  You'll be the life of the party whereas you cowered in the corner like a pathetic neckbeard previously.  You'll notice you begin to emit an alpha pheromone.  All of a sudden women will be begging for your vergecock to be inside them.  To shoot your gainz inside to make more baby vergefam alphas.  It's pure blockchain, decentralized tribalism.  Its rumored that all the most powerful alphas hold stashed of verge:  Trump, Duterte, Musk, Nicolas Maduro, Kim Jong Un, Zuckerberg, Seacrest, Bezos, Iger, Dimon, and all the Bushs (aside from Jeb)
3	1523382482	1	I couldn't have said it better myself.  Have an upvote!
0	1523310586	84	Sell? Apparently, after 17th** verge will become a top 3 coin with biggest partnership to ever happen in 21st century. You are sitting on a pile of gold. Jokes aside, his wallets are complete shite, I pointed that out and got insta banned. I mined some coins back in the day and was not able to get them out, verge sub wasn't helpful, they only talk about price.
1	1523313857	8	I couldn't even get the electrum wallet to work. I just mined directly to Binance (yes it's bad practice but no other choice). Luckily I've never dealt with any issues when getting my Verge out. I have a decent amount invested into Verge. If Verge hits top 3 or even top 10 I'll be happy. I got in when it was under a cent and luckily sold at 24 cents. I bought back in with about 40% of my profits when it dipped to 3 cents. Idk if it was a smart move or not but I'm already up 100% from where I started. There's a lot of bad talk about Verge but the most prominent victory is when a product becomes successful being surrounded in negativity. I'm not getting my hopes up that I'll "moon". If it fails then it fails, I'll just have made a bad investment. If it turns out to be a scam then I'll be a loser, if not than a winner. Same with any investment. 
2	1523317791	11	Verge seems awfully risky at the moment. My opinion about the project aside, I don't really see how you're in a position to lose. If verge fails I'm sure you'll have time to get out without taking a loss. Those are pretty impressive gains given the market, I'm envious. Good for you.
3	1523319096	-4	Yes that's true. I'm currently playing with profits. However if it does fail and it goes down, a drop from say 7 cents to 6 cents would still be a couple grand for me. It still hurts knowing I could've had more lol. I felt the same way when it went past 24 cents close to 30 but luckily I didn't buy back in at that point.But yes, overall for those that got in on a low price have less to fear, there are still plenty of investors who got in around ATH. Although all coins have taken major hits from ATH since December. We can only see what the future holds when the time comes. 
4	1523354212	5	Do you want advice? Sell the day of the news. It WILL dump. No matter what the news is. Don't be greedy. Most everyone will lose a lot of money to this shitcoin, you get out while you can with a profit. That's a win. 
2	1523347385	1	I never could get the desktop wallet to work, but the mobile app works...well it did a month ago.
2	1523368712	1	Thank you! I don't get all the 'verge holders are retards'. I know its a shitcoin, I know its overhyped, but as a very short term investment its great.I just need to control my greed and sell at a reasonable price. The majority are here for profits, myself included.
2	1523372024	1	If you're on binance set stop losses.  I traded eth for my xvg and I'm well above my break even, but don't want to sell yet.  So I'm just moving up my stop losses as the xvg/eth ratio increases.  
1	1523340540	2	There was literally a post last week saying it will be a household name after the 17th and anyone saying that's bit too crazy of an expectation was downvoted.Also there was some absurd post during the hack about how everyone is fuding verge and the hack is no big deal and sunerok even commented in the thread agreeing with the guy. Keep in mind this was when they didn't have a fix yet, and sunerok was on Reddit encouraging his dumbest posters to keep being blind essentially
0	1523314595	59	very scam, much danger , a dogecoiner would say
1	1523316173	22	Such popcorn!
1	1523323893	8	Such wow !
1	1523328026	5	I was hoping there would be a doge reference for dogecoin dark. Thanks.
2	1523337329	5	Hilariously most these people dont realise its a fake doge fork haha
1	1523363156	2	am dogecoiner, can confirm
1	1523346209	0	Many confirm, wow!
0	1523362890	9	So you're claiming to hold 70% xvg in your portfolio and want everyone else to sell to while you can't get your own out? Classic r/cryptocurrency garbage. You guys are something else. 
0	1523354625	7	just sold all my XVG at breakeven last night and got into NEO at least i will sleep peacefully all that drama from the fundraising to the hack had me scared shitless 
0	1523324035	12	All your verge is locked (your 70% portfolio) which you can‚Äôt sell high and you are asking everyone to sell? You‚Äôd be shooting in your own foot... Or ?
1	1523344163	2	:.-)))
0	1523309907	12	I'm not really deep into verge and blockchain. But shouldn't it be decentralized ? How can one man have so much power over all your coins. Sounds even worse than the banks. 
1	1523311192	4	The wallet is out, not compiled for Windows however, one could argue that since he hasn't compiled it for him as of yet he is holding them "hostage". The blockchain is public and anyone with the knowledge can do it, this guy's problem seem to be that nobody has done it and he doesn't know how to. Probably stressed out because he wants to sell in the wake of recent news and are getting anxious that there will be no wallet release before price turns red again. Hopefully this answers you're question :)
2	1523315088	20	>The blockchain is public and anyone with the knowledge can do itNo one holding Verge knows how
2	1523316040	11	> The blockchain is public and anyone with the knowledge can do it, this guy's problem seem to be that nobody has done itHonestly if you spending your coins means that you have to program your own tools, then this guy is very right to be angry at his 'problem'.
3	1523316278	0	Im not making any judgements, the question was how there would be less trust here than in a bank and I tried to basically explain this, while a lot is on devs shoulders there is nothing to stop anyone else from creating these tools since the beauty of the blockchain is nobody owns it (a little ironic to say in the wake of a 51% hack but u get the point), that's what I at least had in mind to say. Additionally the wallet for Windows will be released by the looks of things it just haven't happened yet
4	1523316469	7	>  there is nothing to stop anyone else from creatingThere is. Good programmers are attracted to projects with a solid idea and team behind it. This is what stopping them from creating those tools.
5	1523316610	1	That doesn't stop them from making tools for verge, you could make the case that they don't want to devlope because of that but there is certainly nothing that stops them. This is the whole idea and beauty of the blockchain, certainly didn't think this would be the place I would have to argue about that
6	1523337623	4	> Good programmers are attracted to projects with a solid idea and team behind it.> That doesn't stop them from making tools for verge.Actually, that is exactly what it does. I mean naturally they are allowed to, but no decent programmer is going to work on a scam-coin pump & dump like Verge, why would they dirty their name? That is why Verge only has one programmer who is a random stoner and an extremely incompetent coder.I do understand your point but honestly, the way I see it, no respectable dev is going to work on that level of shitcoin. After that you can never work on anything other than a shitcoin without people calling you out.Sure one could argue that a respectable dev could do it anonymously but then again, why would he/she waste his/her time trying to save a coin that does absolutely nothing and was created as a scam from the start?
7	1523341239	2	This is just getting silly, the fact that people don't want to develop does not disprove the fact that they can. The question was how this required less trust than a bank was raised, that's all I tried to answer
8	1523358447	1	Ok, I missed a big bit of the thread, regarding that, sure, decentralized development is possible. I thought you were just plain asking "why isn't anyone else helping with the development.
2	1523339653	2	Wait a second: the new wallet is currently not precompiled and all the people on the Verge sub talk about is the coin mooning? Haha, makes this shitshow even better :D
2	1523311391	1	Haha, it indeed does. Thanks (:
1	1523318470	0	> But shouldn't it be decentralized ?Don't assume that Altcoins are decentralized. You can argue Litecoin, Bitcoin and Monero to be decentralized, the rest is definitely not.
2	1523323304	4	And BITCONNEEEEECTTTT. 
2	1523331901	2	Litecoin is bitcoin X4.I like monero, but it's not bitcoin big yet.
3	1523343553	3	Hint: your moment to make a sound investment. XMR surely has one of the best value propositions. It works, continually worked on and most importantly it is actually used.
2	1523337912	1	Vertcoin as well, that is their largest focus.
3	1523349892	1	Vertcoin is a shitcoin. It may be their focus and goal, but they're not there yet.
4	1523358144	1	Sure but if you categorize btc and ltc as decentralized, then Vertcoin should be mentioned imo. Its not perfect but still more decentralized than both btc and ltc
5	1523359983	2	> but still more decentralized than both btc and ltcSo I have my distribution of Coins and I have pool alignments ready to share. Do I have to google myself and see how Vertcoin is distributed/decentralized? Will you show it to me? Becuase I do not believe that some lowcap shitcoin is more decentralized, than the bigger player when it comes to decentralization, which is Bitcoin. https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-vertcoin-addresses.htmlE : Now I heard good things about Vertcoin, but the distribution looks really solid. No superpower player with the mass majority of coins it seems. Bigger accounts are exchanges/devs, which is fine. Devs don't seem to hold too much, which is also a great plus. Being ASIC resistant helps with being decentralized too. Let's hope nobody shadowmines like they did with Monero. Seems like I actually found a shitcoin that's not terrible. Good mention I guess. Also have to factor in that *it is still* a shitcoin, which makes this all even more impressive actually. 84 million is the current marketcap and to me it does seem like it's a relatively well spread out coin. How much exactly do the devs own, you happen to know if that's public? Will definitely look at the coin in more detail. Again, always heard the good stuff, never really took it all too serious, becausse of its shitcoin nature. Looks promising indeed.Wouldn't go as far and say it's more decentralized than Bitcoin is. 
6	1523361983	2	I'm not sure about how much the dev/team owns but as far as I'm aware, there was no premine or anything like that. I'm not here to shill Vertcoin, I don't even own any at this time (though I have in the past), I just honestly consider it one of the more open/transparent, decentralized and honest coins out there (albeit a shitcoin per definition since all it has is asic resistance really). I guess one could just as well categorize LTC as a shitcoin too as it doesn't really do anything technically better than BTC, or atleast too little to be of much use.The asic restistance in the social contract and the community centered development is what makes me like Vert. The main dev seems intelligent and altruistic. More decentralized than Bitcoin might be relative, perhaps the distribution is worse, I havn't looked at it but since mining is less centralized (because of no asics) chances are that the distribution is better as well but don't quote me on that.
7	1523362789	1	>  I havn't looked at it but since mining is less centralized (because of no asics)I'm anti-Reddit here. I saw what happened with Segwit, how it was first denied, because it caused miners to get less in fees and it still pushed through, because of pool re-alignment. Bitmain is also no longer the sole producer of ASICs, though still the most popular one. Another thing to always keep in mind is that they sell these things and don't just produce ASICs to use them for themselves to eventually take over Crypto entirely. I think people are overly paranoid and forget that we're still in infant stage. So are ASICs. To me, eventually ASICs will not hinder decentralization at all, so that all you're left with is stronger software for the chain. Bcash with blocksize increase to infinity will have centralization problems eventually, because nobody will find  harddrive that can store their  chain. > I guess one could just as well categorize LTCLTC is better for transactions, whilst still being decentralized. It's real cheap to send LTC and they also have the potential of LN enhancements and they might add crosschain swaps with BTC, so that LTC will remain relevant and sort of act like Bitcoin Cash, only that it works and is not a scam. I don't love LTC, but I don't mind it either. They have their niche. > I'm not sure about how much the dev/team owns but as far as I'm aware, there was no premine or anything like that. I'm not here to shill Vertcoin, I don't even own any at this time (though I have in the past), I just honestly consider it one of the more open/transparent, decentralized and honest coins out thereI'm on their page already and studying. It does seem like a real great coin to me too. Will definitely look into it more. And to potentially avoid confusion. I don't mind ASICs in Bitcoin. I do mind ASICs in Alt/Shitcoin. We saw how much power they had in Monero, when they claimed to be ASIC resistant. Almost 80% of power was gone, just like that. I think small market cap alt/shits alike, need ASIC resistance, at least for the first time being - so they spread better. Bitcoin too started with CPUs, then eventually GPU mining became popular and then came ASICS. BTC could spread without ASIC in it's absolute beginning.I really don't see it as much of an issue within Bitcoin. 
8	1523363736	2	Interesting, I havn't really thought about it from that perspective. I'm anti asic from the start & I do have a hard time seeing asics becoming as decentralized as CPU/GPU mining, since they are single purpose. However that might not be needed, as long as it is "decentralized enough" so to say (for the really big coins). Time will tell I guess and competition will hopefully arrive for the creators of asics.I don't mind LTC either, it does server a purpose and doesn't really claim to be anything it isn't. Tech wise it is a bit unimpressive but I have come to acceppt LTC as one of the originals that is here to stay.I'm glad to have been a factor in changing your mind on VTC, like LTC it is not super impressive in tech but it does have something to offer IMO and the intensions are as pure as you will find in the space of cryptocurrencies.Thx for an interesting perspective & discussion!
9	1523370624	1	> I'm anti asic from the start & I do have a hard time seeing asics becoming as decentralized as CPU/GPUWith all due respect, Radeon is way more efficient than NVIDIA it seems, at least that's the case for Monero. So in theory Radeon is also the only proper producer for GPU mining. You assiociate it less with decentralization, because everybody has a GPU in their computer. The thing is, most GPUs are not profitable and if you want to mine, you better get something high-end'ish and google the efficiency rates of the different cars/different coins. NVIDIA is hardly useable for Monero, because of low H/s, and then you have to ask yourself which gaming people, also mine? And which miners that buy a Radeon, also use it for gaming? See where I'm going? You're more cautious of Bitmain, because they're a monopoly and AMD isn't. But AMD/NVIDIA are also the only two big players in GPU ecospehere. Another thing is of course you know that Bitmain controls some pools and uses some miners for themselves, that's what you're scared off, compared to GPUs. But anyone can purchase 1000 cards and destroy a shitcoin, if they wanted to, you know? Actually these "shits and giggles 51% attacks" on shitcoins are not a rare thing at all - although in fairness they usually target non-ASIC resistant coins.>  Tech wise it is a bit unimpressiveI honestly have somewhat of a problem with this mindset. By this definition Bitcoin is also unimpressive. Why does it have to be impressive anyways? It has to work, that's the key part. Cardano, which I bought aswell and invested in, they may be great in the future, but right now they're really nothing special. They're also not decentralized, pretty much a company working on a product, similar to how ETH started out and now tries to move away from that - to become decentralized. Why does it have to be flashy all the time? Bitcoin works. Transaction fees, we will find out how Segwit can handle high volume times, in the next bullrun. We will also see what impact LN is going to have. The tech is definitely not unimpressive, it just so happens that they're a currency, more than some kind of ... let's say they don't offer additional utility, like ETH, NEO, NEM, ADA, IOTA does. I honestly Bitcoin is highly underrated. Goes back to our original discussion. Most Alts/Shits are *not* decentralized, which is the *main innovation* behind crypto to begin with. The main innovation is not smart contracts, nor is it low transaction fees. It's decentralization and money working free and being unkillable. That's the innovation and I honestly think the vast majority of people here in rcrypto forgot that. To clarify, I am invested in ADA. I also believe in their work and I think they can do something great. I also have no hate for other projects like ETH or IOTA, honestly. But give credit where it's due. Bitcoin *is* decentralized, much more than these coins are. > I'm glad to have been a factor in changing your mind on VTCYou defintitely were. I would have never bothered looking at a shitcoin like this, without this discussion. But could you name another one? I really like I'm what I'm reading so far about Vertcoin to be honest. > Thx for an interesting perspective & discussion!Originally wanted to just say agree and move on. But that unimpressive line really struck me, sorry if it came off rude. Just because other Alts claim to do next level shit, left and right, proven theory is almost none of that. Bitcoin is stable and works. It's boring, because it doesn't change as quickly. But it cannot change as quickly. That is why a *soft-fork* took ages to implement, because consensus couldn't agree. That's a good thing. It means nobody can randomly fuck over Bitcoin and apply changes out of thin air. If updates are pushed through, it means it's almost guaranteed to be a success for the overall platform. Also Bitcoin is already running. ETH has that problem right now too. It's much easier for EOS/ADA to implement Proof-of-Stake, because their chains are not yet fully running. ETH is, and stil plans on making that change, but the transition is really difficult to pull off. Props to them and cross my fingers that they can do it, but you see what I'm saying. Bitcoin/arguably LTC are stiff, because they have to be. 
1	1523336021	-1	Let me tell you about ripple...
0	1523343186	3	There are two things I am looking forward to in April. The release of Ghost's new album and the reveal of Verge's "partner". I actually don't know what I look forward to most. Both will be very nice happenings. 
0	1523332236	7	I do find highly suspicious that the "hack" happened after the announcement, followed by an "Accidental" hard fork, followed by screwing vergers from dumping coins because transactions from wallets were "locked" its now April 10th and still no sign of Windows wallet. last I heard its "Being compiled" however ONLY MAC wallets(who the fuck has a Wallet on a MAC?) is released. Sunerok is either a 100% Scam genius or 100% total idiot. I have Verge, only after hearing its insane rise. I'm here to ride the FUMO train and bail at near high-point or take decent gains.
1	1523332828	5	compiling only takes 20 minutes. its not being worked on.
1	1523340553	1	I absolutely believe that the dev was too incompetent to realize he hardforked it as can be seen in the bitcointalk thread
0	1523316530	10	Great, now you attracted all the vergins again like flies to a pile of shit.
1	1523322599	2	I'm pooping right now... SHIT!
2	1523373641	1	thanks
0	1523339305	5	This is what I keep saying:  There is no way the price is real.  Everyone I have talked to (In a place not dominated by sockpuppets) has said they sold all or most of their Verge.  Yet the price is going up?Something is going on with the devs, pumpers, and likely still the initial hacker.  Not quite sure what is happening, but I imagine all 3 of those groups are manipulating the shit out of the market.
1	1523345781	-4	Everyone that you talked too said they had sold their verge. It wasn't the people in r/Cryptocurrency was it?Think about it...  Massive Hype....Massive FOMO... and 2 weeks for it all to reach a crescendo.Sunerok is a geniousSo go for a lie down in a dark room and just reflect on your stupidity...
2	1523377259	1	LOL even people on the Verge subreddit said they sold (before their accounts were banned).Only someone profoundly stupid would continue to bag-hold a useless coin that is also apparently using broken code...
2	1523351192	1	Verge DarkDoge people are getting fomo over something of the likes.I just visited their subreddit, I would bet they are days before a crash or more specific when they will have operating wallets.
3	1523352188	-3	Yea, dude i have no interest in your attempts at trying to bait a response. You are a FOOL!
4	1523354298	2	I am buing into crypto for years now. I ve seen this shit going in more than a couple of those community sub-reddits. Not saying that /r/btc is any better mind you. The universal truth for me is that POW projects are doomed to be centralized. I didn't sign up in crypto for that (bitmain can suck my ass) I converted my portfolio to current POS and DPOS and future POS projects. Never to touch a POW coin ever again. "Those that are into crypto to make bank, they will be eaten up by the banks. Those that will support and invest against them they will get them most of the spoils." Evident for the last 3 months DPOS and POS projects suffered way less losses than the rest of crypto, I can only guess that old dogs like me figure this out during december ATH and started moving out Bitmains scams.Fintechs are not about Pumps and Dumps. Those are just simpletons getting victimized by sub-reddit community hive mind shillers. I am sorry for your losses.
1	1523353110	-1	so because of the 3 people you talked to sold their verge, verge price isn't real... ok buddy LOL
0	1523364626	7	I'm going to ignore all the circle jerking about which coin is what... but saying "you are being held hostage" only speaks to your lack of understanding of how to properly secure your crypto.  This applies to any coin you own:If you have a private wallet - you should have the secret/private key, you can restore that key into literally any other XVG wallet (android/electrum/etc) Yes, the (latest) windows build isn't out yet, even with the standard electrum acting flaky I'm able to move coins around via XVG Tor-electrum without a problem.  Not every coin has that ultra smooth point and click ease of use like coinbase or other more refined wallets. Your coins are available to you this instant if you like as long as you have a proper backup of your private key/restore phrase/etc.   What is interesting to me is that you are absolutely losing your mind and being quite a nasty person just because you don't care to understand/learn about how your funds are secured or available via other methods.   This knowledge isn't specific to XVG or any coin, it's just how securing your stuff via blockchain works. Edit: just for fun I did a test on a spare laptop, from scratch downloaded the latest (available) windows wallet from here: https://verge-blockchain.com/downAlong with the latest blockchain data to get synced in a few minutes, I was able to restore a long old standing wallet address, and successfully moved 100 XVG out as a test to Binance it arrived in about 30 seconds and started confirming.  So while the absolute latest wallet isn't compiled, it's not 100% needed at this point if basic access is needed to move your coins to an exchange. 
1	1523373421	2	This guy got it right.
2	1523375679	1	Thank you kind internet stranger :) 
0	1523320586	6	anyone can check the status of the builds. I'm guessing vergins don't even know what that means though.https://travis-ci.org/vergecurrency
1	1523330831	1	Wallet builds?
2	1523333077	7	it takes 20 min to compile. usually when its being worked on youll make multiple attempts to see where it fails. there have been no attempts in over a day.
0	1523320449	4	ELI5: Why can't users access their money anymore?
1	1523333842	9	Please correct me where I'm wrong but I think they accidentally hard forked Verge to stop a hacking attack.  Old wallets don't sync up with the new fork therefore they can't access their money.  Verge hasn't acted fast enough to fix this.  Since peoples wallets are locked up people can't dump their shares which is why in my opinion Verge price is going up.   
2	1523337871	1	The verge price is going up bc of the insane volume they are having. Pure fomo
2	1523340692	-2	They updated the wallets to the new fork though, they should absolutely be able to access their money I don't see any proof of OP being correct, maybe he hasn't properly updated his wallet.Don't get me wrong I hate verge but even vergins aren't dumb enough to know not being able to access the money in their wallet is bad. Keep in mind op bought verge, he's probably dumb enough to not update his wallet
1	1523360423	1	They rolled out I think mac wallet updated after hardfork but haven't yet for windows ?  I think.    (they were hacked by some professional "TEAM IDC" hack group..Iranian hackers or something that might have also hacked HBO for an attempted 6 million...)   They survived the hack surprisingly well, and hard forked to fix the issue, they just need to finish rolling out the other updated versions over the next few days.  Its honestly not a big deal.So..its not that most people cannot get their money.  The electrum wallet which is faster and easiest to use has been updated and I think probably like half use that.  And mac one is out..so only for the 25% or so who might be waiting on the windows one, might have issue.  and even there if you have some on an exchange not a problem.   And..the dev said the rest would be out very soon, probably in the next few days  Dude is going a bit over-board.  The vast majority of people are using their coins just fine, and the rest should have the updated version well before the 16th.   (but of course on this forum it gets like 200 upvotes lol..proclaiming everyones coins are "held hostage"...)  Very accurate as usual on here. 
0	1523325311	4	I was naive to get into the craze in December. Saw a rare window of opportunity to get rid of my bags during the pump right before the big announcement.
0	1523345642	3	Stop drinking lead and you will be able to sell your xvg. YES you can transfer your XVG with a Windows wallet. Just transfer your XVG to bittrex and you ll be fine. You are just another fudder 
1	1523373065	1	Naive? It did like 20X in a month. It was awesome.
0	1523378903	2	Humans are so stupid. It's not just this subreddit or that other subreddit, no it's just humans being stupid. These Verge investors probably is making 5x their investment since the global cypto market dip and laughing at your frightened greedy asses with your shiny cool whatever the fuck crypto it is hoping it will go up from -100% shit tiny portfolio of yours. People are so desperate for money it's fucking hilarious. I mean, the suicide hotline is literally one of the most upvoted posts here. LOL
0	1523333794	4	Verge the biggest shitcoin since Tron.
1	1523333881	5	Agreed but starting last week it was a great opportunity to make a lottttt of money. 
0	1523339287	2	Forgive my ignorance, but i‚Äôm using electrum wallet which has about only 500 xvg coins (dual-mining). After the attack and the mining pool (nlpool) are back at business again with xvg, i continued mining and saw that my wallet is still syncing.Am i missing something? I haven‚Äôt tried to take out or send xvg though.
1	1523340820	1	Working fine. 
0	1523350701	2	And it pumped again... :'(
1	1523350793	-2	Get on or be left behind 
2	1523351095	6	sold my verge at all time low for TRUMP coins as they seemed to be a project i believe in more than XVG
0	1523363322	2	Brilliant... all of the verge smack talk, all of the anti verge bullshit and all the while i am sitting here watching my investment grow by 50% in the last week.   It is so so sad but so so funny at the same time. Hows Monero doing just now by the way?
1	1523376388	4	That's exactly what the Bitconnect people were saying.
2	1523378117	1	Yawn....................... Sup monero fanboy........ .. Yawn
3	1523383321	3	I mean, you can look through my entire history if you want. Haven't posted literally one thing about Monero so yeah...What I said still stands.
0	1523308961	2	I mean, I don't think XVG is the best project in the world, but what does this have to do with "holding anyone hostage"?Can you not sell it?
1	1523309209	37	Justin Erik Valo "accidentally" hard forked...  This means he needs to create new working wallets for people to move their coin around. 
2	1523312114	0	The fork that happened on block 204200 was planned and I am pretty sure that is the chain OP is frustrated about not having a wallet for. The wallet is however realesed although not yet compiled for Windows but supposedly they're working on it, not to into it all but have some verge and follow the news so pretty sure that's what's happening.The accedental fork, although probably very embarrassing for the devs, was rolled back almost immediately and the chain is dead... Just FYI you know :)
3	1523315206	16	Yes, basically everything I stated is accurate.  Dev didn't know he was hard forking and not everyone has a working wallet to move coin.
4	1523315465	-8	The fact that there is no current windows wallet has nothing to do with the accidental fork as that was rolled back. The normal wallet worked for another 2 days or so (it was however a problem that binance and other exhanges didn't choose to go with this). The current problems are due to an intentional fork, that was all I tried to convey with my admittedly a little bit of a rambling response. 
5	1523316117	7	So it's an epic mess because the lead ( unique ? ) dev is an amateur.
6	1523316397	-4	You are free to make that conclusion, I like my karma way to much to argue any of that on this sub, additionally I agree that this situation could have been handled a lot better
5	1523315967	5	The two points I've made may be somewhat separate, but they both stand true, regardless of the second hard fork being intentional.Also important to note are the other flaws that will soon be exploited, as they were not addressed in this fork.
6	1523317040	1	You made it seem like that these events were connected that's all. Any good read on the other exploits you are referring to you can link me?
7	1523317162	3	They are connected to the flaw that was exploited and reported by the miner.You'll have to wait and see about the others.
8	1523317315	-4	Yes but cmon dude your first comment made it seem like the wallet issue was caused by the fork, it obvious, I'm not holding it against you I get it, it's a common misconception.It'll be interesting to see if anything turnes up
9	1523317595	7	It was caused by the fork...  Without the fork, there was no need for a new wallet.  Let's just leave this at this - Justin Erik Valo is utterly incompetent.
6	1523327136	-3	What flaws? Ive been keeping up with Verge but haven't heard anything about other flaws.
7	1523338371	5	The blockchain was hacked, dev doesn't know what he is doing and forked it by accident. He then rolled that back and made another fork to try and fix it and now it turns out that there are other flaws in the code that the dev does not understand, that will be exploited in the near future.You don't hear about it in the Verge subreddit because they censor anyone that mentions it. Say one bad thing about Verge and get banned, even if it is about legit technical flaws. 
8	1523339100	1	[deleted]
9	1523339990	1	I'm on mobile during the day, I'll try to find the links when I get home later. Meanwhile search /r/cryptocurrency for threads about Verge, many of them have links showing what is happening on github & how Sune is fking up.
8	1523339993	1	What flaws? Anything we need to know about? what forum can you point me to that discusses this.
9	1523341086	1	There you go, check ifaqs link.

1	1523309117	7	not all wallets are updated yet.  can't move the coins
0	1523337227	2	I wish I could **SHORT** altcoins like VergeEasy money
1	1523354713	1	Can't profit of off shorting a coin if holders can't panic sell, because they are being held hostage by it. Top kek.
0	1523352928	1	OP is a gronk, you know you have to redownload the blockchain because verge FORKED right?  You can even download the blockchain so you don't have to wait.  I have windows, I did that and it works fine.  You CC guys will believe ANYTHING.  You think verge holders are a cult, but look at you guys lol
0	1523350905	3	Vergins are complete retards. Wraith protocol, if you didn't learn from that fiasco or bought after that fiasco you deserve your lot. 
0	1523314789	3	I heard that verge currency steals snacks
0	1523327063	1	What I hear is "GUYS I am like 70% verge right now, I knew it was a pump and dump shitcoin and now I don't think I'll be able to get rid of it before the dump"
1	1523333928	4	Thats why i kept my 120,000 on binance. So i can dump right after the announcement 
2	1523336123	-1	>keeping money on exchange >thinking you did the smart thing
3	1523340592	1	In this case he probably did, has more control over his coins there than in a wallet thats been hardforked out of existence
4	1523341716	-1	broken clockAlso LOL at having less control of your coins in the verge wallet than on an exchange. 
5	1523351524	1	Probably the majority of those that can't transfer their funds will think otherwise.
0	1523348013	-1	Coins all being held hostage?Verge has the 4th highest daily volume of any coin today - that would suggest that you sir are a talker of the finest guano.
1	1523356971	2	Volume means nothing. You could just trade back and forth while only losing trading fees
0	1523336356	1	I sold mine at 3.5 cents cause the crowdfund seemed sketchy. Now its somehow at 8.(I still doubled up but ccoommeee oonnnn) still happy to be out of that sh*t show. Watch their marketing video if you want a good laugh. 7 minutes of the cringiest advertising ever released.
0	1523339523	1	Electrum wallet is working fine \(tested with 2.4.1.0\)
0	1523360022	1	Lol. A million people saying verge is a scam. Literally everyone besides Verge holders said it was a scam. People made profit and still didn't listen, they actually WILLINGLY gave money back to Verge. Now shit is starting to hit the fan.Some people need a carer.
0	1523360236	1	This would make a decent copypasta.

0	1523364757	1	it is amazing how much hype Verge managed to accumulate, I really admire their marketing team
0	1523378641	1	Why is this shit project still talked about, we should boycott it and put it in the CMC submarine.
0	1523379668	1	verge holders really are retarded

0	1523339790	0	Oh look, its the daily "lets gather and circlejerk while bashing on verge" -post from r/ccHi monero fanbois, how you holding up? 
0	1523314706	1	You can transfer your coins to an exchange. What are you talking about? 
1	1523320167	4	not all of the wallets have been updated after the fork. if you have coins in a windows wallet, you cant move them.
2	1523321282	2	They can't export and import the private keys into a different wallet?
3	1523338647	5	I expect that 90% XVG holders would have no clue how to do that, or even what it means. They most likely think that there are actual coins in their wallet that somehow lives inside their computer, sent via the ethernet cable.
3	1523321531	3	if they have a mac to import them to, yes
3	1523332704	2	Only MACs, which seems to me that Sunerok/Dev's are intinally holding tons of coins hostage in order to drive price up further and create an artificial price increase. 
4	1523335015	5	That would suggest the dev is smart enough to have planned it. Which i think he is not. The more likely scenerio is it was unintentional he locked things up. 
2	1523345514	-1	That's not true dude. You can. I have a win wallet and I just transfer some of my XVG to bittrex in order to sell for some profit. Don't fall for the FUD

0	1523311618	-8	Come to Burst. I've been seeing this shit about Verge in my newsfeed all day and I feel bad for you guys (not kidding I truly do). TBH I don't even care if you buy Burst. Just come to the subreddit and hang out and if you wanna buy some buy some. It's a good community and I feel like shit for the Verge community. We have meme competitions and stuff. It's fun.edit: I expected the downvotes but it still makes me sad. Just trying to help people. I know the community behind a coin matters to a lot of people and that's why I'm recommending Burst. Not the coin. Just the community. If that makes any sense....
1	1523314275	11	‚ÄúWe have meme competitions‚ÄùThat‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm buying 100k.

1	1523312193	2	Burst straight reminds me of xvg, but with shittier people running/endorsing it.
2	1523312375	2	It was but no longer. Was really bad. Your description is spot on however for about 7 months ago (Which is why I feel a weird kinship to the XVG people)
3	1523314039	2	It's very fun to follow project with strong communities behind them, undervalued aspect of any coin
1	1523312305	3	Nice shilling... I'll stop by for that meme competition though
2	1523312532	3	:)
1	1523313272	1	I second this. I'm in Lisk as well as Verge but the Burst community is my fav. Got to love an underdog! :)

1	1523353315	2	That it is exactly how they want to make you feel at this point with that big annoucement. The dev saying it will be a top coin you better buy it now. To me it is very fishy and i am better safe then sorry personally.
