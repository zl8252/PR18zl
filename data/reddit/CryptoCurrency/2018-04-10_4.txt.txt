1	1523352181	-19	Imagine if the DOW took on Crypto...

2	1523353832	30	My friend, did you honestly think that's the dow jones market cap...? You have to multiply that number by a million. Literally.
3	1523356833	6	Got confused by his calculations as well.
3	1523357331	-5	I just grabbed the digits from Google. I was unaware you had to multiple the numbers by a million. My mistake. But you get the point somewhat correct? 
4	1523360516	7	Looks like you used ask Jeeves to find that fucked calculation 
5	1523367365	1	Here sir, take an upvote for nostalgia 
4	1523363412	6	Your point is completely invalidated by your autism with numbers. 
4	1523362786	2	....meh
0	1523324093	29	It’s weird to finally see so much talk of cyrpto currency as a society, but it would just be nice if the price reflected the influx of mentions in the media
1	1523324719	7	I think once it's easier to buy and keep secure it'll take off. Along with regulatory clarity. Last but not least then unf**king the horrendous tax situation...
2	1523369614	1	What do you mean horrendous? It's the same capital gains as it would be stocks. If you don't realize any gains then you don't pay any taxes.
3	1523369900	1	Not exactly... you can't buy something with stocks. If you make a purchase with your crypto you have to pay tax on it lol. You can't buy ford and trade it for Tesla stock... you'd have to sell to buy the other. The tax on all trades is stupid. On my stocks I only pay money on the trades I made money from. It's just another headache trying to record all of that from multiple exchanges.
4	1523370740	1	I guess the situation is complex. Some tokens aren't meant to be used as currency but rather utility.
1	1523355955	5	Careful what you wish for. When the herd comes we'll all wish we had more time to buy low and fill our bags.
2	1523361738	3	It's been a pleasant year so far of collecting bitcoin. 
1	1523347585	2	We’re going to see a quiet period for a while (could be months or years, who knows) after which another cycle will start.It will be supported by new exchanges and new infrastructure and new vendor adoption, but I also more legitimate support in the public eye from companies and individuals (business and politics) who speak favourably of it.I think this will lead to another big hype cycle where new, less tech savvy, investors get in on the action. People who were curious in November/December last year but would have bought in if they heard people like this talking about it in a positive light. It adds legitimacy. TLDR: Wait a while and then back to the moon!
2	1523353009	1	“I THINK we might see a .....”
1	1523353862	1	after 15th april we will see a bouncea lot of americans had to pay taxes which they didnt set funds aside for
2	1523366934	0	Can’t Americans just request an extension? If I had mad gains that were taxable but got caught holding bags I’d just extend and then sell and pay taxes in September 
2	1523368091	0	Many Americans pay taxes well before the due date. I filed late (in relation to most people I know) and I filed a week ago. Most people file in early February. I don't think April 15th means much of anything.
1	1523330984	-8	We are the early adoptors. Trust BTC only
2	1523341056	0	Why the hate here 
0	1523363525	3	i would imagine NYSE wouldnt pick up crypto till it is regulated a bit more? maybe?
0	1523379055	1	I wouldn't consider it a trend. It's more of a movement. 
0	1523331008	3	Will one of you rich elitist assholes who keep talking about MUH CRYPTO IS IMPORTANT just fucking buy in already and pump my bags? Fucking tired of hearing all this bullshit.
1	1523331457	10	Can I get this on a bumpersticker?*#*FOMO PUMP MUH BAGS BRO
2	1523358170	4	#WHERE MUH LAMBO WTF LOO
1	1523361806	3	Dude these inexperienced traders are going to get rekted by wall street skills. Be warned. 
0	1523366548	0	Why does this headline sound like a crypto trade is a problem or an unpleasant feeling that should be ignored? For example: "you can ignore toothache, but only as long as it is weak. Same with crypto trading"
0	1523349556	-3	More upvotes than comments. Seems fishy AF.
0	1523328909	-2	nice lol
