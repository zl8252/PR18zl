1	1523323915	1	Is it similar to The Big Short?
2	1523347802	5	Big short is better
3	1523349206	1	Well, that is a movie and it is not as factual as Inside Job. Despite based on real facts, it did not include the actual explanations of both the people who were trying to warn about the incoming crisis and the people who contributed to its manifestation.
2	1523356068	2	I just saw this movie and it blew my fucking mind.
0	1523346767	41	To be honest, I stopped caring about "power to the people" aspect of crypto when it become obvious power always consolidates in the hands of the few, and those few take from the many. 95% of investors don't care at all about the libertarian aspects of it, and the leaders take advantage of the other 5% to push their narrative.Blockstream and the mining pools basically control BTC, Vitalik and Co forked ETH to recover their investors funds and wield massive influence, Charlie Lee is jumping on whatever train he wants, Roger Ver is literally referred to as "Crypto Jesus" due to the influence he has, Coinbase and the exchanges facilitate insider trading and destroy people with fees, the whole Bitfinex/Tether situation etc. The list goes on.BTC is no longer a trustless peer to peer currency system, it's now claimed as a store of value. If the BTC community leaders don't even follow Satoshis vision or care about decentralization why should I?I've transitioned into caring about the money. I don't believe the traditional banking system is going anywhere any time soon, and even if it does the crypto billionaires will just take their place and begin the cycle of exploitation all over again. Exchanges act like banks with absurd fees and price manipulation is rampant all over the space by early investors. The new cryptorich and exchanges already manipulate us and take advantage of us as much as the traditional banking system does, with none of the safeguardsWhat would happen if the banks closed all fiat gateways? Sure, there are ways around it but realistically it would be a huge blow. If it's truly that big of a threat, they can lobby for regulation as well.I know decentralization is also about security, making sure no trust is involved, that networks are secure from attack. By BTC maximalists own admission the network can be spammed into uselessness, they claim spam drove the tx fees up to $50 and times into hours/days. That's not a traditional attack, but it makes it practically useless. So now we have to trust people not to make the network useless, and even then it's now a store of value somehow, despite being wildly volatile? Not only that, all it would take is 2 or 3 large mining pools to team up for a 51% attack before anyone knew what was happening.How is any of that a trustless peer to peer digital currency? 95% of crypto investors have become a community of lambo chasing moon bois, NEO is controlled by a handful of Chinese nodes, btc.com has 33% of the hash rate, many ICOs are holding back 20-50% for adoption incentives and funding, and basically every ERC20 was essentially premined and 100% owned and sold by a company, just like XRP. If you think the movers and shakers of the other cryptocurrencies aren't massively profiting off of them then people are delusional, I care if it makes me money. If you are all honest with yourselves, that's why you are here too. If cryptocurrency did not have the potential to make money would you be involved? You can say "Well, it can be both", but realistically for 95% of you it's all about the gains. Cryptocurrency has developed into a parody of what it once was, the original vision is basically irrelevant at this point, so why not invest in something with real potential?It's every man for himself these day,./rant
1	1523354627	5	Much of your rant strikes true, but the traditional financial world is not a safe place either. You can still be tricked into 'investing' your money into ponzi schemes and other scams. You can lose money by government intervention, and you are being taxed indirectly via forced inflation.That does not reduce the fact that cryptocurrencies have the potential to become the new standard. New and innovative projects are popping up everywhere, more than just variants of the same ERC20 token coins, or forks of Bitcoin/Monero/whatever. A good example is Nano, which has a different structure (block lattice) and requires no miners due to working with dPoS. There is still lots of potential. Monero's recent fork showed that even coins among the big 10 can fork successfully and mitigate existing problems. 
2	1523354911	2	The difference is that the existing financial world is regulated. You can sue, you can win if a wrong is done to you. You cannot do insider trading, pump and dumps etc.Have you watched the graphs these days? Prices going up and plummeting in seconds. This is an unregulated playfield for experienced millionaire traders. No laws, no punishments.What do you think happens when millionaires trade against 14 year olds lambo moon bois?
3	1523360070	3	> The difference is that the existing financial world is regulated. You can sue, you can win if a wrong is done to you. You cannot do insider trading, pump and dumps etc.Even if something is done wrong, that doesn't mean you will win. The people with more money are the ones that win. Sure there are times when things do reach justice, but the ones that can put the most cash in lawyers are the ones that win most of the time.Banks get fines, but that is pennies for them (this was discussed on reddit during the SEC and CFTC talk a few months back. Their track record was discussed about how many violations they had done during the past year and that the SEC and CFTC are aware of this). Recently (years time) have things gotten more regulated. Before brokers would do these things like what crypto exchanges do. (i have searched for forex brokers myself because i am a trader. Some have bad histories, you can check yourself).And you know only the tip of the iceberg about insider trading. Yes there are people that have been caught, but i can ask you a question that relates to this: *"How well is the airport security doing at catching illegal contraband or in general catching people carrying illegal items?"*You don't know that. You can't possible know that, you just don't know how many people actually pass with illegal items so you can't do a statistic about it, you don't know **how many people carry illegal items overall**, because of that you can't make a percentage.Same goes for insider trading, you don't know how many people do it and how well it is regulated, because you don't know how many do it overall. Insider trading is done in secrecy and what classifies insider trading is when you have information that is not open to the public, which you can gain financial advantage of. That's what a lot of big companies can do.By that definition, if Donald Trumps son knows about an upcoming fathers tweet which will affect a certain companies stocks to go down, the son can short it and gain money. That already is insider trading and tracing it isn't always simple, because the example i give here is very primitive (this is why when doing a KYC they ask you whether or not you have a family member taking part in political activity).TL;DR: The market isn't as fair as it seems.^^^i ^^^gotta ^^^start ^^^a ^^^steemit ^^^account ^^^or ^^^something ^^^to ^^^get ^^^paid ^^^for ^^^this.
3	1523358197	1	Moonbois are gonna get rekt so hard this year. Wait for it. Wait for the millionaires bot driven pump to 25-30k and x10 ROI on any premined shitcoin with no usecase or intrinsic value and watch it all burn down in unregulated shorts + media fud by the end of the year. 
4	1523371634	1	Where were you in dec
5	1523371755	1	Selling the top of my June buys lel.
4	1523383966	1	The ones who will get wrecked the hardest are the ones who have a false sense of superiority over the moonbois (now turned hodlers).  The "oh those guys suck, they will get wrecked, but not me!" kinds.  The ones who will win are the ones with pre-set and conservative profit taking rules.  Selling on feeling can make you money and feel like a guru at times, but you're really not special.  
1	1523355477	3	"Banking the unbanked" isn't a meme. If we can replace the current system with one that is exactly the same except everyone has fair access, then that would be an achievement.There are other advantages too, related to the nature of decentralised deflationary assets as compared to the current inflationary model. 
1	1523355900	2	Profit is definitely great,but it doesn't have to prevent us from changing the world.
2	1523358331	-2	Crypto ain't changing the world. At best it gives some lucky fuckers a lambo. 
3	1523360183	2	Haha people were saying that about the Internet.       RemindMe! 5 years "did crypto change the world?"

4	1523360242	-1	no
1	1523378201	2	If you haven't, watch 'Reqieum for the American Dream'. It's an hour and a bit of Noam Chomsky talking about the 10 principles of consolidating power with wealth. 
1	1523347825	3	I see your points and in a lot of ways agree, but I think the inevitable centralisation of PoW is a failure that has been fixed by PoS.  In many PoS  coins there isn't the centralisation to between 1 and 3 major mining pools like you see on PoW.I think celebrities will always occur, if people are stupid enough to hand them power, then there isn't much we can do about that.Also there are coins focussed on altruistic/humanitarian goals, yes you can make money on them too, but you do so in a way that provides a positive outcome.
1	1523375181	1	Decred?
1	1523383612	1	I got called out for "being in it for the money" and my response was basically this: Crypto's success and a "crypto investor's" success go hand in hand. If you believe in the fundementals, you also believe in the fact that it will make you financially independent. People didn't invest in Amazon for the sole fact that they wanted to shop online and that online shopping would benefit certain facets of commerce. They invested because they thought it was a good business model that would make them a lot of fucking money that they could then use to shop online. 
0	1523340833	5	The current issue is that there isn't anyone to trust. Crypto is full of scammers and con artists as well. 
1	1523373298	2	That's always been the issue with ... everything, ever. We dealt with this as a society by enabling governments to regulate us all, mete out scary punishments for those that didn't follow the rules.*By design* cryptocurrency takes away any ability to regulate it ... so you're left with an ecosystem that incentivizes criminals. The only end-states I can see to this are governmental regulation, cryptocurrencies becoming illegal to use or a fundamental change in human psychology. Not holding my breath for the last one ;)
2	1523376898	1	> We dealt with this as a society by enabling governments to regulate us allThis is such a historically recent phenomenon that it remains to be seen if it's a good idea.If we can't properly research the investments which have a significant personal impact on us, then we sure as hell won't properly research which candidates will appoint good regulators for everyone else. We'll just get scammed by crony capitalists who tell us that Enron and Bear Stearns are safe investments while restricting their competitors.I like the middle ground we've got right now; if you want you can opt in to their protection with the stock market, but if you don't like it you can invest elsewhere and accept the risks. Right now everyone in cryptocurrency is either fully aware of the increased homework burden, or a complete fucking idiot that we shouldn't be restricting ourselves to protect. ICOs are a great example; if the only part that's decentralized is their accountability, then it's almost certainly a scam.
3	1523378819	1	> This is such a historically recent phenomenon that it remains to be seen if it's a good idea.Nah, this is fundamentally how just about all societies throughout all of human history have *worked* - freely given (or not!) control of everyone in that society by an empowered elite in order to gain the tribe safety, stability.As for 'doing your homework' ... I think it's important to recognize that almost nobody 'investing' in this space has the skills to truly do that. I've been writing code for decades, I understand cryptography, I have a CS degree, I worked for hedge funds and financial companies for a decade ... and I know I'm in no way qualified to truly vet any cryptocurrency. For essentially everyone involved in the space it's about hype for what might be and trust in a handful of individuals who claim to be a part of that tiny minority actually qualified to voice opinions. You might well be part of that privileged group but it's not very likely, most people who think they are completely delusional. 
4	1523381430	1	>NahAre we talking about the same history that brought us patent medicine and the roaring 20's? Who was protecting us from being allowed to make bad investments in 1850?>As for 'doing your homework' ... I think it's important to recognize that almost nobody 'investing' in this space has the skills to truly do that. Recognized. I think we should have big warnings all over this sub.>I've been writing code for decades, I understand cryptography, I have a CS degree, I worked for hedge funds and financial companies for a decade ... and I know I'm in no way qualified to truly vet any cryptocurrency. But you're qualified to vote for the guy who appoints regulators for cryptocurrency? Since you're a CS guy you understand "garbage in, garbage out". And that's assuming regulators are honestly representing their ignorant electorate, not just selling them out.
5	1523382580	1	> Are we talking about the same history that brought us patent medicine and the roaring 20's? Who was protecting us from being allowed to make bad investments in 1850?You're just proving my point ... the government now protects us from sham medicines and sham investments in many ways. Year over year, throughout human history, scams get invented then regulated. > But you're qualified to vote for the guy who appoints regulators for cryptocurrency?More so than most ;) In seriousness - we exist in a world with many terrible politicians / regulators but their indiscretions are getting ever-more visible, it's getting ever easier to assess whether someone is acting in our best interests or not because of the *transparency* of the modern world twinned with the freedom of the press. All your email, all your phone conversations, your bank records etc. all potentially monitored. We can now understand why people do what they do better than ever because of complex grids of relationships we can prove they're involved in. Crypto(currency) sets that back a huge way - we gain freedom from scrutiny but so does every bad actor. I suspect the world will happily give up personal privacy in return for increased accountability of the elte. 
6	1523383776	1	Which is it? Either this is fundamentally how just about all societies throughout _all of human history_ have worked, or the government _now_ protects us from sham medicines and sham investments.> In seriousness - we exist in a world with many terrible politicians / regulators but their indiscretions are getting ever-more visibleLike I said, even when we assume perfectly honest regulators, we're still using garbage inputs and getting garbage outputs. If you ask someone to make a decision that impacts either themselves, or that impacts mostly other people, they'll do more research and give you a better answer with the former.> I suspect the world will happily give up personal privacy in return for increased accountability of the elte."Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." It's a false dichotomy, and in the last 30 years we've seen an erosion of commoner privacy with little to no improvements in accountability. What percent of the people responsible for the 2008 financial crisis were held accountable?
7	1523384923	1	> Which is it?Uh, both. It's a cycle - scam invented, population realizes, empowers elite to regulate it, new scam gets invented, repeat. End state is more regulation, more control, less freedom, more safety. > "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." I knew you'd quote this :) Hate to break it to you but it's bogus when applied to all forms of control. Any system of laws is more about restricting freedoms 'thou shalt NOT do this' than it is granting them.Want a recent example? Flying drones in populated / crowded environments. Turns out flying a fast object around people's heads is kinda dangerous, so now it's mostly illegal to do.> in the last 30 years we've seen an erosion of commoner privacy with little to no improvements in accountabilityThis isn't true. Examples would be the incredible number of politicians who've been shamed into resigning recently. In past centuries, decades even, the masses wouldn't have been either *aware* of any scandals (he slept with a man behind his wife's back!!!) or able to leverage that awareness to cause change. > What percent of the people responsible for the 2008 financial crisis were held accountable?Welp, this is a really complex question to answer. A huge part of the blame goes to the average joe who was taking loans that were extremely dangerous for them to take on. A huge part of it goes to the rating agencies who got their math wrong. A huge part goes to predatory middle men lenders who would fudge numbers to get commission $s. A huge part of it goes to the government that had allowed the banks to run up incredible risks. And a huge part goes to the banks themselves for taking massive risks in search of profits. There's plenty of blame to go around ... not like there's any single person you could lock up or entity you could shut down. This does help illustrate how modern transparency has helped though. The average joe is now largely aware of the reasons for the crash, at least some of the contributing factors. Again, in decades past, this would have been mysterious market forces that the guy on the street would have zero comprehension of. It also shows how we enact positive regulation after the event - more on banks, more on the public in terms of qualifying for loans etc. That some of these are now being rolled back makes no sense ... will inevitably lead to another cycle of the same but this time around it'll be even more apparent, to everyone, that this was caused by bad governance.
1	1523376003	1	The whole point of cryptocurrency is not having to trust any specific party. Anyone can review the code, the economics, and the status of the network.If we're promoting cryptocurrency then we have a moral obligation to inform newbies about scams and con artists, since there's nothing stopping scammers but our own skepticism and common sense.
0	1523325319	8	Is a simplistic and superficial view that the banks were the culprits. I think after watching it you need to consider the incentives they were at work. 
0	1523335825	3	Pretty weird that itâ€™s been 10 years already
1	1523354474	1	Yeah, and look, the world is operating perfectly fine with those same banks and their fiat. Weird huh.
1	1523349695	0	Time flys
0	1523333663	6	The Big Short, although based on facts, is a dramatized version of what happened in Inside Job.
0	1523349617	2	Never heard of this documentary but I'll check it out. Thanks for the recommendation!
0	1523358119	2	If anyone is fascinated with the crisis (like me) one of the best books to read is "Stress Test" by Geithner. It's a pragmatic no-nonsense view from the inside as the whole thing unfolded. We came ridiculously close to a full on systemic collapse, "soup lines and shanty towns" as one analyst put it
0	1523342658	3	This isn't just about banks and governments, you can't trust **any** entity free of regulations and/or oversight. Pick an industry or business and I'll show you comparable corruption. This is why I laugh at the libertarian and anarcho-capitalist ideology. They think removing regulations will bring about some utopia when time and time again has shown it will be severally abused.
1	1523350611	5	> you can't trust any entity free of regulations and/or oversightincluding crypto
2	1523376998	1	You can't get any more oversight than having every participant verify every other participant's transactions!
1	1523347434	1	Agreed, they hark on about crypto, but let's be honest, crypto has the rules built in and it has oversight from the network.It's an improvement on current models, but as an individual you are still constrained by rules.
1	1523354858	0	Uber is the shining example of this. Consumer: "Cab rides are expensive!"Cab company: "We need to pay our drivers union wages."Uber: "Come ride in our non-union, unregulated cabs."Consumer: "This is much cheaper. Let me flock to Uber."Uber Driver: "I'm barely scraping by. I want more pay."Uber Exec: "No thanks, prices must be kept low."Uber Driver: "I want to have better working conditions. I want to be part of a union."Consumer: "Cab rides are expensive!"
0	1523360634	1	It's a good thing Crypto is filled with oversight and regulation to prevent such market manipulation that would hurt the average consumer! 
0	1523363867	1	Ppl have a short memory, it is useful to refresh it from time to time
0	1523367756	1	Sooner or later the same people will be behind blockchain technology... 
0	1523373644	1	2008 proved that banks can't be trusted to self-regulate. Government regulation is needed. We also learned that lesson in the 1930s, which Republicans undid in the modern era with their deregulation push.The problem is Republican voters.
0	1523339196	1	I got a lot of material to facilitate getting angry at the system and buying crypto. After this, watch Capitalism a love story, Four Horsemen, and Fahrenheit 9/11. Can confirm will move half fiat in crypto immediately after getting done with four horsemen. 
0	1523327214	1	People need a reminder not to trust banks? Huh..
