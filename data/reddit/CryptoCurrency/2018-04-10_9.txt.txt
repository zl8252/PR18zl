0	1523305091	225	Price action has been so boring lately I enjoy this sort of fan fiction 
1	1523313534	36	Heh, fan fiction. I like that. One thing I learned with economics and in taking economics courses is that you can create any kind of narrative to fit data.As a big fan of dystopian sci-fi, my preference would be to any kind of blood sport in the desert.
1	1523317246	6	Yeah, I'm gonna run with it. I'm emotionally numb to price drops at this point anyway ^^
1	1523338774	7	Soros, Rockerfeller, Rothschilds, whales, FUD, banks, Goldman/JP Morgan, this post has it all.If we were on a different sub I'd call satire
2	1523365521	1	Oldman Sucks is the company name brother you most have misspelled them.Other than that I totally agree!
1	1523359092	1	Lol. Fan fiction.
0	1523304497	68	Is this, dare I say it, the beginning of the [fabled bull run](https://i.imgur.com/5j00omn.jpg)?
1	1523306171	67	I happen to know for a *FACT*, that the bull run starts July 6. You can take that date to the bank.http://www.bullrunpamplona.com
2	1523349037	-4	That's too funny. /s
1	1523305983	10	Sounds like someone was exhausted of buying the dip and went short ;)
1	1523346042	1	This reminds me of those preachers who insist the end of the world is happening on X date. And then when it doesn't happen - oh just a misinterpretation, it's actually *Y date*, yessirree
0	1523309818	107	End of december: People want to take a rest before new year. Bull run soon!Janury: January is red every year! Market recovered in february 1, 2 and 3 years ago. Bull run soon!February: Whales spreading FUD to accumulate. Bull run soon!March: Price fell down because of GOX and they ain't dumping anymore. Bull run soon!April: People sell to pay taxes! Bull run soon!May: ...
1	1523311466	61	If you were complaining about crypto in Dec then you werent doing it right
1	1523328579	7	January was "Wall Street bonuses come in on the 15th"I can remember if it was Jan or Feb for "Once Chinese New Year is over"May will be "People cashing out for Mother's Day presents."
2	1523331982	5	The third Friday of May is National Pizza Party Day in the United States. Expect a 25% dip as all the U.S crypto holders sell big!
1	1523331300	6	April Showers bring May Flowers
1	1523324966	16	My mothers period will end 3rd week. Bull run soon. 
2	1523329765	26	you know there are kids in here when their mother is still getting their periods
3	1523349240	4	You know there's 20 somethings in here acting like they know it all with comments like that.  Some ladies don't go into menopause until their 60s, the avg age is early 50s. 
4	1523357992	1	my momma didnt stop getting periods into her 80's, she said that the last time it dripped out of her it was like she cracked an ancient egytpian vase. all you white girls with your fur babies, dont worry you can have a real child in your 60s
5	1523365607	5	wtf did i just read
2	1523341582	7	Why are you tracking your mother's period? That's a bit unsettling. Not to mention your obsession with posting about it multiple times in this discussion alone. The one thing your mom can't do on her period is have sex...hmmm.
3	1523355093	3	She cant?
3	1523366429	0	It's a joke. You know why the price of crypto is not rising. I thought it was funny. Also if you Knew my age you'd know that my mother is either dead or the oldest living human.,either way she certainly isn't really having anymore periods. Oh one more thing : lighten up 
2	1523333157	1	Underrated comment
1	1523341411	3	May: my birthday is the 25th, people will sell to organize a suprise for me, bull run due 26th!
1	1523351908	2	I remember people saying, it's Chinese new year, Chinese people are cashing out...
1	1523317015	-6	[deleted]
2	1523318511	13	People selling to buy cervezas for Cinco. June gloom, so bear month. 4th of July, sell for fireworks. August vacations obviously. Labor Day parties are pricey. Halloween candy, gotta cash some out. Thanksgiving the family finally gets their revenge for your crypto investment recommendation the year prior. Then you need to cash out for Christmas and tax reasons. Gonna be a long year. 
3	1523324182	2	This guy gets it :D
2	1523317290	10	I'm sure we'll think of something!

4	1523323409	5	U.S. holders are a tiny proportion of the market. And only a tiny proportion of U.S. holders waited until the last minute to do their taxes.
5	1523347362	1	You've won! 
0	1523302842	76	For the love of god please stop posting things like this whether or not it's true. I've literally been waiting to open up bigger positions on a few projects and they're slowly approaching the mark and It'll be helpful if you stop trying to put hope in the market. Do us all a favor and just stop hyping the market up.  
1	1523324136	24	so u must b the smart money everyone is talkin bout
1	1523329945	8	"Screw truth and/or the greater good, I want money"
0	1523347905	7	Crash in 5 days to 4600 then golden bull run starts.
0	1523305849	15	wrong it won't happen until end of the month paychecks and after the memorial day weekend when US customers get back to work but before next chinese new year and wall street bonuses
1	1523325001	-11	And after my moms period 
2	1523367084	2	Second underrated comment 
0	1523306676	20	wow ur definitely the first person to be completely right in his bullshit bullrun prediction /s
0	1523336549	3	I keep saying, support is very strong at $6000, as every time we reached it (at least 3 times now) we go back up. Honestly I wouldn't panic unless we break $6000, then the floor drops out.
0	1523310740	14	We’re going lower. Brace yourself 
1	1523334901	7	i thought you called the bottom 3 days ago.
1	1523328282	6	Its become the alex jones of predictions, eventually someone will be right.
2	1523341184	2	A stopped clock is right twice a day
1	1523318346	-1	No we aren’t. Stop spreading bullshit. We just bottomed out the final time at $6620. Get ready boys that buy wall is getting HUGE
2	1523332764	-4	if we had bottomed out we would be at 9.1k already. The reversal will be so fast we wont be at the bottom for very long
3	1523339402	3	By the way. I have my own reasons to believe that the market has already TRIED to reverse. It was just held back. On MORE than one occasion. The whales are creating the bear trap of the century. 
4	1523371306	1	I agree with you. This is why we short it
3	1523338099	1	Normally, I’d be thinking this way too. Things are different man. Idk. Something feels off. I’m betting we hit $6,420 again, to confirm it as support. Then by tomorrow it’s off to the raves. 
4	1523346272	2	Rofl. First rule in crypto is there are no rules in crypto. There is literally no reason for it to bull run before tax day. 
5	1523363600	1	Second rule of crypto?Always expect the unexpected.
3	1523363662	1	I forgot, you're right.$6,400 and then nearly instantly, $12k+.;D
0	1523305916	3	I agree with ya mate 
0	1523338948	3	you are a legend of our times
0	1523304279	4	Tl;dr
1	1523304484	31	Blah blah blah. Pseudo analysis. Blah blah blah. 10x,50x, 100x. Blah blah blah.
2	1523305048	29	tnx just bought 100k.

1	1523318306	1	delusion
0	1523306000	6	Is tax season really from january till end of this week?
1	1523308817	18	In USA yes. Its basically 24/7 365 according to this sub
1	1523308482	7	Well technically, yes. People have been filing taxes since mid-Jan right up to now, and the IRS processing since mid-Feb.
1	1523315497	2	Next Tuesday is tax day / deadline this year because of the weekend and Emancipation Day.
1	1523318716	2	tax season has very little to do with any of it, OP is US centric thinking.   besides taxes only come into play if you have cashed out to USD in the US.   Big whales are moving their funds either in cryptos or nonUSD fiat.
2	1523326896	2	Any sale of crypto, even crypto to crypto or using it to make a purchase, is a taxable event in the US. I'm guessing some people are planning to try to use the like-kind loop hole but I doubt wealthy people will. That's just asking to be audited. No guarantee that you will win that fight against the IRS. 
1	1523315738	0	ikr. it's such a big spectacle. three months of everyone talking about the government stealing their money. at least we have no state income tax in my state
0	1523311365	4	Smart money checking in, everyone crying but me and the boys are buying. 
0	1523308725	9	Again, someone who has a big imagination and is spreading his own thoughts with arguments based on nothing. "The big wealthy families are coming to help them against the downfall of the dollar". Come on man, these kind of people have become rich by making thoughtfull decisions and are not going in full on crypto. You are mistaken wealthy with billipns of dollars into crypto. Maybe they will only invest 1 million for very high risk management. Don't bet the world on this crypto space
1	1523320303	3	Based on nothing? I linked you with 16 pieces of evidence. I am not saying people should go all in. I am just providing evidence that here is likely where the big players are about to enter. The Rothschilds aren't the type to put in just a $1 million investment lmao
2	1523350858	3	You think the rothchilds, the richest family in the world who own all the banks will buy bitcoin at 6k lol, if they believe its the future they will crash every market in the world then bring on another recession. They will start buying bitcoin at about 1k. 
2	1523323521	6	You linked 16 articles about a variety of things, some of them pure speculation. None of them amount to a guarantee of a new bull run right now.
3	1523323858	2	His last link though
3	1523345570	1	Exactly. He quoted something here and there but the critical points are completely pulled out of thin air. 
2	1523344238	1	'Evidence' uh...
2	1523323780	1	How do u know the rothschilds are buying and not selling?
0	1523305146	6	While posts like this are always a gamble, i do feel we bottomed out, kinda sucks that every time there is a small uptrend we get justed hard by a big whale sell\-off tho.
1	1523318374	-1	>kinda sucks that every time there is a small uptrend we get justed hard by a big whale sell-off tho  read my other reply, that is exactly what is going to happen.
0	1523315740	3	I agree with you mate, don't listen to the panic sellers who now just hang out on this sub to drag everyone else down to their level. 
1	1523316720	3	This. So many of these people popped up recently its crazy
0	1523330069	2	Speaking for myself, after paying absurd amount of taxes on my crypto gains, I'm going to invest more wisely and make sure to take profit when I hit my target. Also many people saw their profits evaporate so many will probably get out as soon as they hit their break even point. A bull run will definitely come back at some point but I don't expect it to be as parabolic as the last one.
0	1523359161	2	The first rule of crypto is that anyone who says they think they know where the price is going is full of BS.
1	1523375370	1	This should be the top comment.
0	1523361902	2	Your permabull is showing 
0	1523311013	5	I agree 100% except for the fact that I dont think "tax" season is the reason for the drop. The reality is that very few ppl will pay their crypto taxes to w/e terrorist regime they happen to be born under. The correction is most likely to due with the fact that we went up hundreds of percents and nothing can go up forever without a correction. Q2/3 we will see a bull run
0	1523315702	2	Saying the next "bull run" is going to happen every single day will eventually make you guess the right date u know
0	1523340601	2	Everyday i read posts like this. But it never happens. Anyway I hope you're right. 
1	1523355914	0	Same here. Many people expect the bull run to start in Q2 (due to Q1 being historically bad quarter for crypto), which probably means that the opposite will happen and we are going down. This is exactly how rich people make more money from the poor ones. Make something obvious and manipulate the price the other way....

4	1523318553	-2	I agree. I called $6,420 since mid March. Then yesterday called a reversal at $6,620 and what do ya know...people bout to be pissed for being trained so easy. 😂
0	1523319784	3	Please shut up
0	1523341455	1	I'm not sure you're right. I do believe, however, we'll see one or the other - a return to a more bullish attitude, or a turn considerably further downwards that would presage an extended bearish market at least over summer. On the one hand, I'd like to see my portfolio recover some, but honestly a bearish phase where I can average in fiat before the rise wouldn't be bad either. As long as you're ready to deal with either, you'll be good no matter what.

0	1523367321	1	Post like this one makes me think we still have a long way down to go. Maybe back to 1k

0	1523309188	1	Nice you had a speculation on Nov 4th and lo and behold crypto pumped later that month into early january. Who could've expected that there would be a bull run aftet BTC recognition was at an all time high and youtubers, grandma's everyone was investing in it. there was even a fucking snapchat story labeled "buying bitcoin" in december. Who could've predicted that the time of year that people spend the most money and buy the most things that that moment is when everything pumps.
0	1523309429	1	Just look what's happening to Streamr...
0	1523309976	1	I'm sure they already got in before they annouce right?
0	1523315879	1	I don't agree at all with the taxes thing because if they bought crypto but didn't exchange it, they wouldn't have to pay taxes on it. Selling out is what would cause taxes. Honestly there was a hype in January, then the hype died down, some whales sold off, now we're waiting for the next hype. Of course I can't predict the future and know for sure when it is, but my own guess is a BTC/ETH flippening sometime after July this year.

0	1523356233	1	I see one of these optomistic posts at least once per day.
0	1523322805	0	Lmao anyone who is considered "smart money" will take one look at the chart and will vomit at the very thought of being bullish right now, the charts are so fucking bearish...we will be lucky to be above 6k by sunday at this rate.
0	1523302818	-2	Nice fud satan 
0	1523318226	-4	This entire post is delusional fantasy at best.   The whales who pumped at the end of last year did not get to dump all of their holdings because the price went down too fast (even they understimated just how top heavy the crypto market is with inexperienced weak hands.)     That is the only reason prices are still at current levels (hence the side movement), whales are trying to create another pump so they can get rid of the last of their holdings.   You have to be completely delusional to think any crypto is undervalued right now. They are all overvalued still. If the market were to move organically it would slowly move down to about 60% of its current value, but people are going to game it to create pumps on the way down.   None of the cryptos are going to reach anywhere near the ATHs, not in the near future and perhaps never.  Reason is because there simply is not enough new capital (the order volumes are simply too low to even contemplate it).   The capital that drove prices up previously can not be taken into account because most of it has been cashed out at a loss, and 90%  of the remainder it is people holding to their dear lives, they are not going to sell or buy anything until they get close where they entered the market, so essentially all that capital is frozen.   All you need to do is the math, see the current price (of any coin), take the current total in circulation, then calculate how much capital would be needed to get that one coin back near to the ATH... yeah it is not going to happen.  Now multiply that by the number of coins in the market. There simply is not enough new money that will come in required to get there.   People need to wake up.
1	1523327551	4	Not that I’m arguing that there’s a bull run about to start immediately, but saying there isn’t enough capital to start a bull run is hilariously wrong... even at ATHs the crypto bubble was just a tiny blip on the scale of global financial markets. They were also incredibly illiquid during the last bull run. You need the proper infrastructure for both institutional and less tech literate retail investors to get into place before the money can flow in, but if crypto becomes useful and scalable there’s way more than enough money out there to make this last bubble look like child’s play. 
2	1523328659	-2	I should qualify what I mean by "capital", I'm not talking about global capital.  I'm talking about capital that is earmarked for crypto "investments" either by institutions or retail potential investors.    Current order volumes show a very low and diminishing interest in crypto markets.   Just looking at BTC we would need 200B to get it back near the ATH that is without taking into account all the other coins.    Sure 200B is a blip compared to the world's entire marketcap but it is almost 90% of the entire crypto market cap, I just don't see that much new money coming in.
3	1523330813	6	You don't need 200B new capital to pump up the marketcap by 200B.
4	1523362134	1	Ouch, that kind of destroyed his entire argument. It's interesting that so many people on these crypto subreddits have no idea how market capital is calculated and yet use it so confidently in their arguments.I've seen estimates before that a total of $8 billion was invested in the crypto market. That is far from the ~$750 billion market cap we had at the peak.
3	1523330218	2	Interest in crypto has just diminished because the gold rush mentality of something going straight up for a year straight died down. It’s still an incredibly early phase market with real use cases, none of the non speculative or trading value has been made yet. As I mentioned before the infrastructure, knowledge base, and regulatory clarity simply wasn’t present in Dec/ Jan when we people were predicting institutional buying to make this possible, and still probably isn’t if we’re talking about really big players. For instance coin base’s announcement that they’re setting up custody services is a huge hurdle, are major pension funds going to step in and buy crypto without having a truly secure place to hold it? Most capital managers wouldn’t know if they’re legally allowed to invest client money in crypto, ignoring other regulatory constraints, so you’re kind of left with really advanced super wealthy investors who can put up their own capital. That’s kind of a small club, and they’re also not likely to be the kind of people to catch a falling knife. But give it time and the possible investor base could massively expand.
4	1523331971	1	I certainly agree with you the potential there, however what I'm trying to get at is majority of people in this sub and in the crypto space who consider themselves "investors" only feed on hype.   Hype is what got coins to the previous ATH, however that is not going to work anymore.   Jumping onto a new coin or ICO token is not the answer. Real value and application of the tech needs to happen before we can reach enough interest to get there. However that will not happen for all coins, 90% of the coins are going to be worthless, but people who are HODLING blindly think a bull run will fix that.    Even then it will take a while. Realization of actual products with infrastructure built along with actual adoption by the general public is a long way away.   OP's notion that simply big whales (i.e. Soros and Rockerfeller) getting in is going to fix everything is just delusional.

0	1523322099	-1	Except that you only have to pay capital gains taxes if you cashed to fiat. 
1	1523323613	2	If you are in the U.S., exchanging one crypto for another is considered the same as cashing out to fiat for tax purposes.
2	1523333413	1	Why though?
