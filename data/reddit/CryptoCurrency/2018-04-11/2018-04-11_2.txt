"This one is really going to move," the broker said. "It's only a $1 a share." "Buy me 1000 shares," said the client.>>The following day, the stock was at $2. Seeing this, the client called the broker and told him to buy him 5000 more shares.>>The next day the client checked in the newspaper and the stock was now at $4. Running to the phone, he called the broker and told him to get him 10,000 more shares.>>Checking the paper the following day the client now saw that the stock was at $9. Thinking what a great profit he had made in just a few days, the client raced to the phone and called the broker. "Sell all my shares," he instructed.>>"To whom?" the broker replied. "You were the only one buying that stock!".That needs to be taken into account for your alt-coin analysis on which are 'alive' and how much they are worth. If we treat 'alive' as 24hr vol greater than holding, only 'dotcoin' is alive according to your analysis, which leaves 19/20 dead, or 95% dead, much more like the "99% dead".
1	1523399363	27	Very true. if you look at the vast majority of coins that go 70%+ in 24hrs are only because it's one dude who put in a 1000$. lol I've seen and wonder if they're trying to create fomo and lure ignorant buyers in. More likely they're just morons tho
2	1523414467	6	The other side effect people don't take into account is that kind of activity skews the real value of the marketcap thus when the market falls it will require almost twice as much actual capital to bring it back up to those levels.
2	1523452052	1	When you really like a coin a K isnt much money knowing you will hold on for a long time.
1	1523402305	34	This criticism is absolutely fair, and is something I'll try to address in my next post. Specifically, based on the feedback I've received today, I'm going to be looking at how the bottom 20 coins at the beginning of the fall 2013 bull run fared in both the subsequent bear market and where they're at today. Finally I'd like to ask, what would you say is the maximum a person could unload in one day without completely tanking a coin's price? 25% of the daily volume? 10%? Something lower? If you could point me to any sources on that issue, I'd very much appreciate it!
2	1523405169	12	I'd be more curious to know the fate of the mid-20 coins from that period. Few people would consider buying the bottom, but many of us daydream about buying tokens in the #500-600 range, ie low market cap tokens that have at least made it out of the depths!
2	1523414801	3	Novice weighing in. If I’m not mistaken, in statistics, standard deviation is around 3%. So I’d wager that much more than that on a given chart will spook TA traders and trigger a sell off.
3	1523418439	1	Thanks. Since I posted that, I had started thinking something similar. I'm curious to see if anyone else wants to weigh in on that. 
3	1523463657	1	SD isn't a set percentage, it's a function of whatever you're trying to obtain the SD of. So if I want the daily price within 1 SD of Bitcoin, I put all the price movements of BTC on a bell curve, and assuming it's a normal distribution, the amount of movement that falls within 34% in either direction from the mean is 1 SD. That could be an 80% move for something really volatile or a 1% move for something that really doesn't move at all in general.
2	1523414740	1	>Finally I'd like to ask, what would you say is the maximum a person could unload in one day without completely tanking a coin's price? 25% of the daily volume? 10%? Something lower? If you could point me to any sources on that issue, I'd very much appreciate it!   This would have to be a case by case analysis, there is no single formula to cover all coins.    You would have to take into account status of the coin, age of the coin, actual products or not, size of holders and size of community, sentiment of the coin, and what are in the works for the coin.   If a coin has nothing but a vague generic whitepaper then almost any negative movement could wipe it out.
1	1523405901	3	but what if you sell at a profit for each low cap coin? that has to be taken into consideration. 
1	1523436931	3	I would generally agree but:Tigercoin had a peak volume of over 20k in January;Trickycoin had around 3kCNO had over 30kSo yeah not the best projects to be invested in but before the bear market you could sell a big chunk of what you had if you really wanted to. 
1	1523406098	4	The best joke on wall street is "this time it's different"
1	1523450016	2	Reason to stick to main crypto currencies..Especially those with which you can in worst case use to pay for your coffee or lambo. :D
1	1523444905	1	Nailed it. This analysis should not be taken seriously 
2	1523457294	2	What criteria would you need to see met before you took it seriously?
3	1523457762	1	The thesis is incorrect. Buying the bottom 20 my market cap is a bad idea. 99% of alts are shit. Or if the thesis is to gamble on alts, I still disagree. 
0	1523396955	31	You're right, you would theoretically have made more money on the bottom coins, but if volume is $5k/24hrs then you will absolutely not be able to sell your entire stack at market price, you dumping your bags would drive the price down and lower overall profits significantly. It easier to sell Bitcoin at or close to market price due to the much, much higher volume.
1	1523397184	5	Good point. 
0	1523398543	17	I think the point was that most alts die during the bear market, not after it? (not saying it's true or not). IMHO you should take a set of alts from a ranking in late 2013/early 2014 and see which survived 2015, instead of taking those that survived the crash and then checking which survived the climbing back up.
1	1523400700	10	Interesting! I may do this in a future post. Thanks for the suggestion!
0	1523391600	21	Interesting read, thanks.
1	1523391702	4	:-)
0	1523395899	23	The second section is invalid. The comment "99% of the altcoins will die" is based on the incredible amount of shitprojects out there who will fail to deliver their product and actually build up a user base. Think 5-10 years. We are currently still very much in the whitepaper hype phase where testnets get valued at billions of dollars without even a single user using the platform (hi Trx, hi ONT, hi EOS, hi almost every other platform out there).
1	1523397569	7	So, it's invalid based on a prediction of future performance? I mean, sure that could be true, but what's the evidence right now? Also, you're talking about a window of time that's potentially longer than the market has been in existence. Absolutely anything could happen in that long of a window. Crypto could boom, or crypto could have the worst crash in modern history. Personally, I think it'll come back, but it'll never be more than a niche investment. 
2	1523397695	0	It is very simple. There are too many idiots in this market throwing their money at new coins. You realize that 90% of the startups fail? The same will happen with coins not delivering. Furthermore, as we are in a bubble (which happens with every tech so its fine), this effect is amplified.Blockchain is definitely here to stay though. Just a lot less coins :)
0	1523397471	41	Those coins are dead, trying to mount an argument that a coin with trading volume of $46 and $4 is alive lol? hell I'd even argue $24k volume is dead, given you would not be able to exit your $11,400 sell order with out crashing the price and receiving far less. Which means the failure rate is 95% to 100%.
1	1523399905	17	If you spread that 11k over a 1-3 week period you'd easily unload it without crashing the market. Only a fool would unload it at once. 
2	1523427028	6	A lot of that volume is likely nonsense wash sales to give the impression of any volume at all. You'd likely have a hard time offloading even 11k.It's hard enough offloading large amounts of even a 20-40 position coin.
3	1523457371	1	Based on your experience, what percentage of a coin's daily volume can be sold before there's a serious effect on the price?
2	1523402411	11	Yup, I hate how little people realize this
2	1523408717	5	The problem with such a strategy is that the coin (especially a shit coin with minimal trading volume) could be worth substantially less or even effectively zero in one to three weeks time.
1	1523410031	3	+1
1	1523397651	8	You'd have to exit in stages, certainly. 
0	1523398144	5	Thank you for your analysis !
0	1523403136	5	Interesting idea, I think I could sprinkle a few 20’s around and forget about them for a few years.
1	1523404005	2	Thanks. I'm currently working on a couple of ideas based on the feedback that I received here. One is exactly what you're suggesting--buying $20 each of the current bottom 20, but I'll probably add the caveats that daily volume needs to be at least $1,000, and the market cap has to be a known dollar amount--meaning that I would have to start at rank 950, rather than 1500. The other is two analyses of the bottom 20 taken at both the beginning and peak of the fall 2013 bull run, which I'll then show where they were at the end of the 2013-2015 bear market and today. I've done a preliminary analysis already, but the detailed will have to wait, as I have work & stuff. The preliminary analysis shows that the bottom 20 as of Sept. 30, 2013, are mostly still in existence and have appreciated in price. Keep in mind, however, that there were only 36 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap at that time. One day after the peak of the bull run, on December 1, 2013, there were 40 total currencies. I haven't done the math yet, but eyeballing it, it looks like about half of the bottom 20 on that date have since disappeared, and the remaining portion have mostly decreased in price--which is to say, don't buy at the peak of the market. 
1	1523439562	1	This is not reinventing the wheel: That's pretty much how ETF worksAnd yeah, it's from far the best investing strategy
2	1523457406	1	What would you say the best strategy is?
3	1523458582	2	Replicating a ETF with crypto I.E put 20$ in the top 20 crypto rather then 400$ in one crypto (this is an example, you can also put 10$ in the top 100 crypto or whatever)
4	1523459022	1	Ideally, what I'd like to do is create an experiment where I put $400 into the top ten, $400 into the middle (ranks 500-519), and $400 into the bottom 20 (with the caveat that the bottom coins have to have a daily volume of $1000 to be included. I probably won't have the spare cash for that kind of undertaking until July or August, though. That said, I'll post about it if/when I do it!
0	1523429437	5	I think your leaving out one critical aspect when trying to build a projection of this downturn as it relates to the 2013-2015 bear market.and that is speed.If you look at BTC price action back then and see how long it took it to get to the current 67% from ATH,then you'll realise this current correction is moving close to 3.5x faster.you left your time frame constant,which distorts your analysis.with taking this information into account,BTC should bottom out by the end of this month and return to ATH by late october into november.
0	1523393295	14	99% (or close to it) of altcoins dying is a good thing for the market. As long as shitcoinX, with no minimum viable product and a team of eastern european ex-chop shop brokers, maintains a multi-million dollar marketcap, the facade is still in place and we are nowhere close to reality. And FYI, a token with $100 24hr volume is, for all intents and purposes, dead. There is no regulatory body going around de-listing coins, and there will always be delusional actors... 
1	1523439705	2	Why is it 99%. So far, only 10% of all the 10,000 altcoins have died. It would mean that out of th top 100, only 1 coins will survive. That seems unlikely.
2	1523454022	1	You've picked an awfully unlikely method of having every 100 ranked coins as standard deviation. What percentage of internet endeavors, do you believe, have turned profit and lasted the test of time?
0	1523407889	4	I'm never going to make my money back and I deserve this.
0	1523391681	22	So, I see this is getting downvoted a bit. Do people just disagree with me, or is it because there are things I need to improve on going forward? Please let me know!
1	1523392868	48	Nice post, and good point.  People are downvoting you because this sub is full of orangutans.
2	1523397627	16	ooo aaaaa aaaaa oooo
3	1523400690	3	[they're not all bad](https://media.giphy.com/media/wtNOUuCzFKcaA/giphy.gif)
1	1523394701	12	lmao this was 92% upvoted at the time of this comment. hold off a second before whining about downvotes
2	1523394725	6	Lol fair. It was 67% when I said that. 
1	1523455255	3	20 coins is ridiculously small sample size. The next 20 above  them could all have gone bust or 50% of them could still be alive which would completely skew your stats if you included bottom 40 instead of bottom 20 or just those 20 above bottom 20. How about picking 100 or 200 or 500 of them and then declaring whether most of them went into the garbage or not?
2	1523457485	1	Ideally, I'd like to do the analysis that you've proposed. That said, it would be a massive undertaking, and I don't have enough time right now. 
3	1523457850	1	So you produced shoddy analysis with anecdotal evidence instead. Sorry but your analysis about why ""99% of alts die" is misleading"...is misleading. The irony.Also in order to save time you just wasted a small amount of time on pointless endeavour... Irony^2
4	1523458765	1	A sample of 40/542 is completely sufficient to test a hypothesis that "99% of alts die." Approximately half of the sample is still alive (i.e., 17-20 coins, depending on how you define "alive"). This means that the "99%" hypothesis is incorrect *even if every other coin that was listed that day died* (and, obviously, a large number of those coins are still with us). 
5	1523461962	2	Well even if only 17 coins from the top were alive out of the whole 522 of them then it would invalidate the 99% claim I guess because they alone are 3% of the entire 522 pool. But the point is not about being technically correct, the point is that most of them will fail and how much of them really do fail, way too much honestly.From those bottom ones you mentioned three of remaining 4 are worthless piles of dogshit with no liquidity and the last one could be wash traded, pumped and dumped garbage for all we know. You get the idea. This excercise was enough to invalidate the exact 99% myth but then again who cares about small details, a more comprehensive analysis would be much more useful. There was an analysis recently how many ICOs are exit scams, fade into obscurity or simply waste away till they fail. The numbers were staggering.
6	1523467294	1	> There was an analysis recently how many ICOs are exit scams, fade into obscurity or simply waste away till they fail. The numbers were staggering.Interesting! Do you have a link? Thanks,

8	1523467743	1	Thanks!
1	1523393680	5	I think part of the reason for potential disagreement is also that the market is a LOT more saturated now.  Both in terms of "shitcoin listings" that are generally near the back half of the 1500 (or so) listed coins, but also in terms of consolidation of projects at the top.  Example:  There are a LOT of "platform plays", but the reality is that the market has somewhat decided what the current winners are (ETH, NEO, Stellar, Cardano, EOS, etc) and these projects have a really, REALLY big first-mover advantage.  Now of course, this can all change, but I think it is less likely to fundamentally change as much as it did in 2014. 
2	1523396687	0	How is this different than the absolute shit coins he mentioned?
3	1523397037	6	Just that there are SOOO many more now, so it would be significantly harder to treat the bottom half of the market like an ETF, and just "ride the wave" like you potentially could before.Also, since there are now multiple projects all trying to solve the same problem, there is a lower percentage chance of guessing which project "wins" in it's own market segmentation.
1	1523414849	2	I don't entirely agree with your post, but you have put a lot of effort into it, so upvoted.
2	1523417931	1	Thanks! Do you have any specific criticisms? 
1	1523441491	2	Relax, it's just typical herd behavior. 
1	1523399643	3	I thought this was a pretty informative post all-in-all. A lot of people dont like things that contradict their reaonsing or beliefs. Many think that when shitcoins "die" that money will move into real projects that the masses have already invested. While that's very likely, you have to understand that many of those people who invest in complete shitcoins in an attempt to make a quick buck are likely to just move their money to another shitcoin, instead of a legit project with a decent future. Additionally, just cause a project has a very bright future that doesn't mean the success will translate to price appreciation. One would hope, but there's no guarantee. hell, look at things right now. Verge just went thru what would normally be a coin-killer of a situation, but they're still pumping. Then you see coins with legit use-cases like REQ and VEN and they've been steadily shitting the bed for a while now despite many successes and milestones for the teams.
1	1523392242	1	Thank you for the analysis, this was certainly useful. Downvotes are probably due to general sentiment in the market, don't fret :)
1	1523394390	-1	It's because the general sentiment around here is "BTC is the only thing that matters. All else is shit".Your analysis crushes this soundly and these cumsocks don't like to be proven wrong, so per r/cryptocurrency requirements you receive an avalanche of downvotes.
1	1523393718	-1	Don't worry about the downvotes. This sub (and reddit in general I guess maybe) literally downvotes each and every single possible thing they can for absolutely no reason.Edit: Case in point
1	1523393859	0	I think a lot of people agree with you because what you wrote makes sense, and they're mad about it so they downvote you. I thought it was a good read, thanks.
1	1523416043	0	I think your reasoning is specious, more or less.  You mark your gains from the bottom of the trough that can only be identified in hindsight, as there's no way to know where the bottom is, and on the way down (for any security, not just cryptos) there will be a lot of bumps that look like bottoms that are actually the dead cat that got shoved off the roof bouncing off successively lower awnings and clotheslines as it approaches the pavement.  You also make the faulty assumption that patterns will continue indefinitely.&nbsp;With regards to the first issue, look at a bitcoin price chart during and after the bear market period you mentioned - there were a series of bull traps between the $500 to $700 level between the November 2013 peak and July of 2014, while the overall trend was a fall from $1150 to $250 in January of 2015 followed by another eight or nine months of sideways trading before the next bull run started.  If someone thought the market bottomed out during the weeks of sideways trading at the beginning of May 2014 when BTC/USD was down 61% from the then-ATH, they would have been underwater for two years.  Same deal for a portfolio of altcoins that aren't picked in hindsight.&nbsp;With regards to the second and more serious issue, we cannot assume that a pattern will continue indefinitely even if it has repeated several times.  To illustrate this, take a look at the pattern of cpu speed doubling roughly every 18 months (referred to as Moore's Law in common parlance, though this is a misnomer - Moore was talking about transistor density rather than clock rate), which held for decades.  There were continuous naysayers saying that the end of the pattern was nigh for years and years, and they kept being wrong and  Intel kept laughing them off.  They introduced the NetBurst architecture in 2000, with an initial clock speed of 1.3 GHz, assuming they'd be able to scale it up to 10 GHz.  They got less than half that far before the decades-old pattern suddenly ended (for a technical explanation why this happened, google "cpu power wall" and "Dennard scaling").  CPU clock speeds have been more or less stagnant since 2005, with increases in computing power coming from other directions.  The fact that microprocessors are a fundamentally sound, useful and valuable technology didn't mean that past trends would continue forever, just like the fundamental utility of distributed ledgers built on blockchain tech (or DAGs or consensus algorithms or whatever) doesn't mean the price of securities linked to those technologies will continue to undergo cyclical bubbles and crashes like they have since 2009.
2	1523418329	5	First, thanks for your comment. I appreciate the feedback.Second, I do specifically state that I don't believe that this market will precisely mirror the 2013-2015 market. That's just the jumping-off point for this analysis. It's stated in practically every stock-related analysis that "past performance does not guarantee future returns." I had kinda assumed that was a given here. I guess my question is what do you think the analysis should have been based on?Third, although I did not select the May 3, 2015 date (it was selected by someone with whom I was arguing), you're absolutely correct that it's extremely convenient for maximizing gains. I'm currently planning to do a future analysis (probably in the next week or so) of both the bottom 20 alt coins 8 weeks before the 2013 peak, and within one day of the 2013 peak. Although a surprising number are still around, people who bought them at the peak would mostly still be underwater. Do you have any suggestions for that analysis? Have a great night! 
0	1523413456	3	Nice post!First, I am curious what your gains would look like if you put $400 into the top 20 coins during that same time.  Sadly, this post also makes me wonder if it really matters if you invest your money into a good project or not.  Once BTC starts pumping, pretty much all of the Alts do too, even the scam and shitcoins.  So in reality instead of all the research and believing in certain projects, I could have put the name of all 1500 coins in a hat and drew out 10 and invested in them and my gains would be the same at the height of the next bull run.  
1	1523420330	1	Thanks! I'm probably going to address a top-10 investment in a future post, so look for that in the next week or so.Second, I wouldn't recommend investing at random without first doing a more comprehensive analysis of survival rates. I also think that there's still ample room for market research. Specifically, it's possible that effective market research would have been eliminated one or more of the bottom of 20 coins from my analysis before any money could have been invested and lost. Unfortunately, I'm not really in a position to spend my days using the Wayback machine for historical crypto market research. It would be an interesting project, though!
0	1523421921	3	It’s hard for me to see posts like this and hear anything other than “buy the coins I haven’t had a chance to sell yet”. Everyone here is still looking for a reason to believe that BTC will eventually make its way north of 20K and stay there long enough to take profits. Posts like these stoke that desire, but they don’t change the fact the crypto hasn’t done anything useful yet for ordinary people. And as it does find uses, what makes you think any of the coins will still have value? I want to believe because I hold coins, not because I had good reason to buy them in the first place. 
1	1523457845	1	I think this is a fair criticism, but I would point out that I have never held any of the coins that I discuss in this post (including BTC). If I did, I would disclose it. I also only got into the market this February, so I'm not too worried that I've lost money thus far. As far as what makes me believe that coins will continue to have value, I don't think there are any concrete reasons for most cryptocoins (including BTC) to have much, if any, value right now. That said, I think the value they currently have is based on market expectations of future performance and usage--expectations which could be wrong. I consider the current crypto market to be somewhere between scratch-off lottery tickets and the stock market, meaning that it's not suitable as the primary vehicle for a person's investments. That said, I think it could still make some serious money in the long term. 
2	1523458621	2	I think some expected value calculations are in order. The trouble is, I am not completely sure what to base the probabilities on. By 2025 crypto might be completely forgotten, and the crypto craze a foot note in the history of block chain technologies and whatever variations on that technology demonstrate utility for ordinary people. Or, by 2025, the collective market cap of crypto currencies could be several trillion dollars. Nobody knows and nobody knows how likely one outcome is over the other. There is nothing to do but wait and see. Believers will buy, holders will hold, and r/buttcoin will continue mocking all of us. 
3	1523458855	1	Lol. Well-said.
0	1523407089	9	You're absolutely right OP. Every single coin is going to rise massively in the upcoming bull run, even pure garbage like TRX, DOGE, and BCC. Just don't throw you're money in something that's a blatantly obvious exit scam with non-existent volume, and you'll make an easy 3x or 4x as long as you hold. Whales pump everything in bull markets.
1	1523435241	3	Doge is not garbage. Doge is a working currency without much tech. People use it everyday.
1	1523420893	2	Lol I never said that everything is going to rise massively, and I don't believe it. I'm just looking at historical what-if scenarios. Also, preliminary research for my next piece shows that if you bought alts at the 2013 ATH, then you're still underwater today. That said, past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Crypto could be the next stock market or the next tulip bubble. Time will tell.

0	1523393824	5	**Update:** I stand by the analysis above, but since posting, I have noticed an issue with it. Specifically, the coins ranked 491 and lower on the historical snapshot are ranked as such due to a lack of data. The coins ranked 470-490 on May 3, 2015 (with market caps of $18 to $423) actually have a slightly better survival rate, with 7 out of 20 still in existence. 
0	1523405684	4	64.57 percent of statistics is bullshit
1	1523421063	3	Such cogent. Very analysis. Wow. 
0	1523402394	2	Good write up op!! 
1	1523402962	2	Thanks!
0	1523407842	2	Hey! This is a great post. I really appreciated your perspective on the current bear market. Short-term I'm of the mindset we're a bit on the oversold side, but I do think we're likely to see prices dip lower than we're currently at.
0	1523408455	2	Don't forget the stock/coin 'splits' in some cases like ETH/ETC and BCH/BTC
1	1523420517	1	Do you know of any good source for a comprehensive list of those? 
0	1523417044	2	“but I probably don't have the cash right now.”Definitely the most revealing part of this entire post. Had me going for a minute though! 
1	1523417741	1	Lol. I'm not asking for donations if that's what you're thinking. :-P
0	1523418124	2	Great post.  This space needs more facts and less generalizations and repeated garbage and opinions.
1	1523421288	1	Thanks! I'm hoping to do some more posts along these lines in the coming weeks. 
0	1523429250	2	We should probably say most alts that aren't tokens, and that actually gain traded volume don't die.
0	1523429766	2	Very interesting article. Even if you just take the one coin with a decent volume as being alive, you would have made almost the same profit as with bitcoin. Consider the following fact: in 2013, almost noone traded alts as it was questionable and complicated enough to trade bitcoin. Therefore to buy the lowest ranked coins of all would be a crazy move. would you invest in all those cmc 1400 ranked coins if you look at them?I guess not and therefore one can expect even better results when doing research about alts, although I don't want to play the hindsight game.
0	1523432066	2	Nice post, i definately am diversifying my crypto assets, i believe what i have will go up sooner or later, if anything. Im hodling.  Obviously some coins may tank but i generally invest what i am willing to lose

2	1523434957	2	lol yes, sorry
0	1523432470	2	Another metric that will be increasingly important on the dashboard in the coming years: Coins that generate income, such as NEO>GAS and VET>THOR, and other passive income generation behavior like MTL's gamefication, etc.Assuming one or more of these mechanics takes off in a meaningful way, calculating the "real return" of any given asset over time will be a lot more interesting and complicated in the future.
1	1523434982	1	NEO is the BTC for china, i just got some more! NEO also gives ONT i believe
2	1523440203	2	NEO and ONT are seperate things. Owning NEO unlocks GAS (1 NEO generates 1 GAS over 22 years, NEO holders also get Smart contract fees). Same with ONT when main net launches (date TBA). NEO holders also got small airdrop of ONT some time ago.
0	1523432963	2	Nothing invalidates overreaching statistics (99%) like quantitative research and well presented, on point results. If only more posts such as these existed on reddit, this community would be all the wiser (and possibly richer).     Nice contribution, and if it hasn't already been said several times, thank you.
1	1523450611	1	Thanks! 
0	1523434315	2	I think every savvy crypto-investor knows that alts hold better risk/reward ratio (sharpe ratio) than bitcoin itself. The problem is identifying some good coins so you minimize risk even more and also having the mental ability not to panic sell when inevitably alts bleed more during bear moves. Altcoins are like playing with leverege + a positive advantage. 
1	1523458223	1	Agreed. This is why I got into crypto after the crash started this year. My retirement funds are in stocks. I'm just putting in a few hundred in extra cash that would otherwise go to student loans. The jury's still out on whether that was a responsible decision, but I recognize that it's something of a gamble...
0	1523451835	2	-$400 in the bottom 20 alt-coins (by market cap)-Bottom of what list? CMC? Of the whole shebang or the bottom 20 of the top 100?
1	1523457214	1	The CoinMarketCap list from the day I linked in the post--May 3, 2013. 
0	1523394332	3	Interesting post, quite worthy to read. But if I can't just note that market is different now and a lot of money is in play.
0	1523391930	4	I upvoted cause I find it creating something to think about.
0	1523414279	2	Using analytics and trends is one thing and I'm not challenging that. However one needs to take into account fundamentals as well as market sentiment.   Up until the crypto market reached ATH there was still a lot of hype and positive blind sentiment.   So the cycles and trends prior to that all make sense.   But the market has changed now, there is no longer the blind hype that was there before. People coming into this market are scrutinizing what/where/how/why they should be investing in cryptos in the first place.    Sure there is still going to be some people who act on FOMO but they are a very minute part of the equation now. Which is what most alt coins rely on.   A very high percentage much more than 90% of coins are going to never recover.   Telling people anything other than that is at best delusional at worst down right immoral.    What majority of people don't ask is "why were coins that high" in the first place.   Can you or anyone justify why coins got that high? Other than pure hype, there is no valid reason coins to be valued that high. Even now majority of the market is very over priced, as your analysis points out we still need to fall, I don't think it will take as long as you have calculated but it will fall, and majority of coins will not recover. 
1	1523419999	2	Thank you for the feedback! A few things in response:First, I am not recommending that anyone take my post as financial advice. I'll make this even clearer next time I post something. When people ask for advice on The Daily thread, one of the first things I usually say is not to invest any more than you can afford to lose. For most people, including me, that's not much at all. Second, I think it's totally fair to believe that most alts will never reach their all-time highs again. I've been asking the same question that you raise here when I think about Bitcoin: why is the price so high? My conclusion for both Bitcoin and the alts is that there is little to nothing concrete at this point to justify their prices. Rather, current market prices represent market expectations concerning the future adoption and usage of cryptocurrency. That doesn't mean the market's right, though. Much smarter people than me have observed that cryptocurrency as a whole appears to be speed-running 500 years of bad economics. I've only started buying crypto since February of this year because I was angry at myself for several previous missed opportunities, including when Litecoin was only about $10. That is, AOMO (anger, instead of fear).
2	1523435812	1	> speed-running 500 years of bad economicsHuh?
1	1523458071	1	One follow-up question: Would you mind talking about this a little more?> However one needs to take into account fundamentals as well as market sentiment.How do you operationalize that suggestion when looking at historical market performance? Other than looking at anecdotal information from old reddit posts, I really have no way of knowing what overall market sentiment was in 2013-2015. To be perfectly honest, I don't think I have a good way of knowing what it is today, either. At least with stocks, you can see what people are saying on CNBC. There's no cable channel for crypto (yet), though. Similarly, are there fundamentals I should have been looking at here that I failed to observe? Thanks!
0	1523403198	1	yup...
0	1523411720	1	thanks, loading up 100k of big boobs coin now.  let the FOMO begin!
1	1523420428	1	Rofl! Don't do that! 
0	1523415506	1	All these people getting boners over perfect fractals are so retarded.. it's like these goddamn idiots at the poker table that fold AK or QQ cause they "lost so much with them a few times"
0	1523434069	1	How do I promote my ICO for BucatkeCoin, bukkake a cat to the EU?
0	1523465714	1	wow, super cool experiment !Would have upvoted if the option was there. The vote arrows are really random on my account, only in some threads do they appear...
0	1523399545	1	I don’t think the time where the alts die has already passed. Once they have to face usability, and what do they do that others do not, that will be the day of the 99%
0	1523406385	1	What happened after the last crash doesn't mean anything for the future. The only reason they reached this value was because of people using crypto as a get rich quick scheme.
1	1523421033	1	I definitely agree with your first point. I think the jury's still out on your second point, but if you're right, then by the time we've confirmed that it'll all already be over except for the crying. I'm personally a little more optimistic that that, but it's certainly a valid point of view. 
0	1523411225	1	The "invested a week after the crash" in the title is a little click baity, kinda buzzfeedish...I don't disagree overall. I think there are teams of cryptographers and buisiness oriented people out there that will ultimately succeed in making crypto currency, in some form, a part of every day life. The big question mark in the room is what will be the catalyst? If you can answer that, you'll be living easy into the next decade.
1	1523420468	2	Well said.
