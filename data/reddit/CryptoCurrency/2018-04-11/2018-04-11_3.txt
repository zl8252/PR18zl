0	1523390719	50	Ah, the infamous 40 dollar eth, i remember that.
1	1523395905	33	$40 ETH was my introduction to buying crypto. Had nooo idea what I was doing. It's been a wild year. 
2	1523420615	17	Do you know what you're doing now?
3	1523420763	33	Do any of us? 
4	1523438992	-7	Does any of us (really sorry)
3	1523425059	16	Yeah I put the coins in the machine and pull the lever right?
2	1523450574	2	Same, by the time it went through (bank transfer) it was up to $50, then I bought another after a week and it was up to $90.
1	1523395479	20	Lol that was after the first boom, $4.5 eth squad. Remember mining an ethereum a day. Sold it all when it reached $300 and no regrets I'd be stupid to not take that profit 
2	1523401837	2	Why did you stop mining?
3	1523404743	6	Moved houses, sold whatever I didn't need or want anymore. And it was summer of last year so it was hot and didn't want it running in the house 
1	1523398410	4	even in hindsight 40 bucks felt high as hell. That said, I wished I purchased more back then. 
2	1523435855	1	dont we all man lol
1	1523415207	4	In a couple of years, you'll be looking back on today and marveling at how cheap$400 ETH was.
2	1523458684	1	hopefully!
1	1523435830	1	I saw it around 225 when i first downloaded coinbase i remember lol
1	1523463872	1	I can say I got quite early, at around 80$, but still had the chance to get in earlier.
1	1523407790	1	Ah, the infamous 0.7 dollar eth, i remember that.
0	1523385538	105	I've never gotten so mad, yet so hopeful with just one picture.
1	1523413755	30	MAID looking like a solid investment
2	1523420465	14	Well... it is up like 30% since this screen cap.  That beats a savings bond. 
2	1523430551	9	Maid is the long bet. Lots of potential, but also a lot of work to deliver. It could change the crypto landscape if it launches, as SAFENetwork would be far more powerful than a blockchain.
2	1523416143	7	Amazing buy at the moment. I can easily see it back in the top ten once it has been launched. It's been tough for the followers as there has been many delays but apparently they will be coming out with some better timelines of how much work is left in the next few weeks, and the forum/community has never been so strong. Also they have a Safenet conference coming up soon. So much happening with this one, and they have been ramping up their marketing recently. One of the first places I heard of them was on a letstalkbitcoin podcast, but they have been on the Kaiser report, BBC radio and The Guardian newspaper. Close to launch this project will be getting a lot of attention.
3	1523416840	8	People said the same thing about Golem over the last year.
4	1523456914	1	and look at it this week with the news
5	1523457588	1	My point was that it went a year over their proposed launch date. 
2	1523438909	2	it very likely is
2	1523459281	1	I was gonna say the opposite, it used to be so close to the top, now not in top 100...
1	1523458705	1	y u mad bro
2	1523459334	2	Bc I was dicking around this time last year and didn't get into crypto till 6 months later
3	1523461332	1	Ah gotcha~ we gotta accept the things we cannot change, my friend!
0	1523386286	175	Tether was a steal back then!
1	1523405263	8	It's still holding its place in the top 20...Thought it'd be bumped down by now.
2	1523420658	11	Tether no. 1 crypto by 2020
3	1523424122	7	LOLTether Gang Where you AT ??Oh under the Brooklyn bridge...OK that's where we sleeping tonight, cool.
1	1523406606	-1	Everything was a steal a year ago compared to now. People are so fast to forget. They're always expecting massive returns in days. 
2	1523457088	1	Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough
3	1523458578	3	Patience is a virtue. 
4	1523460692	1	Patience is one of the most overrated of virtues.
5	1523460859	1	Could u explain why u think that? Patience has always paid of for me. 
3	1523461491	1	And its not 10000days in the fire... The crash happend in december-january... Before that, all coins were thriving. So its been only about 120 days of "in the fire". Not sure what you're talking about 
4	1523462176	1	He said "massive returns in days" and I'm joking that any long period of time can be measured in days. Also it's a Tool song lyric.
0	1523393257	13	Lol, I remember Eth at 7 bucks and ltc at 4 bucks. 
1	1523408925	18	Pepperidge Farm remembers 
1	1523413908	5	I do too. Too bad I was busy chasing my tail.
1	1523405126	9	Bought my first Eth at 50 cents, I still can‚Äôt believe how lucky I got sometimes.
0	1523390856	23	Wow! How many Doge was 1 Doge worth back then? 
1	1523391223	39	According to traditional knowledge 1 Doge has and will always equal 1 Doge
2	1523394295	27	Good Bot
3	1523442477	1	>good boy!ftfy
0	1523393492	11	Majority of those coins look like a currency. There are so many interesting projects out there right now. Isn't this exciting?
1	1523404992	4	Pretty exciting three major original Eth dapps have just gone live, Golem, Digix & Maker.Going to be fun to see it all come together and gain traction.
0	1523403526	19	<super original joke about tether being worth a dollar>
0	1523386806	29	Tether, I've been in all year, moon soon. Even my 500 btc Tether pump and dump had little effect 
1	1523388534	13	Hodl son
1	1523404893	4	As much as I hate tether I‚Äôm still impressed by how well it‚Äôs held it‚Äôs value over the years.It‚Äôs a good sign for how well DAI will do, considering it‚Äôs actually backed by something apart from phony audits and hot air.
2	1523424334	5	Impressed by how we ALL know it's NOT backed by anything yet we pretend it's a rock of trust and stability.
3	1523426612	6	And those mofos at Bitfinex who came up with this idea to just print money out of thin air deserve some serious credit, it‚Äôs next level genius.A legal way to create 2 billion dollars of worthless tokens with zero legal ramifications, it‚Äôs mind boggling.
4	1523436368	2	Im still amazed at the success those twitter scammers get from "SEND ETH ILL SEND 2x BACK!"
5	1523438272	4	It's unfair to say that everyone of these guys is a scammer, send me 1 eth and I will send you 2 eth back to proof it to you. 
0	1523436760	8	About a year ago is when I decided to buy 1 BTC then realised I‚Äôd have to find my passport and send it to the exchange along with my photo and payment details and then got lazy and went back to playing Nintendo Switch and didn‚Äôt buy any crypto at all.About December was when I regretted that.
0	1523391402	15	When moon 
1	1523394097	13	Moon rises 50 minutes late everyday.
0	1523391767	26	Tether is so shit...almost no gains....
0	1523395963	16	Haha, tether was still a dollar.   What a shitty crypto.     Never does anything lol 
0	1523385206	26	Yet people still complain that we are down :(
1	1523387650	33	Those are the people who bought ATHüòÇ
2	1523398483	21	Hi, November and December 1st time buyer checking in.
3	1523405037	4	How are the hodling skills coming along?They‚Äôre vital if you ever want to make some money in crypto.
4	1523405523	19	Their pair well with my already mastered Self loathing and resentment, I just wake up everyday, see how much money I lost, and laugh maniacally in the elevator going up to my work as everyone else wonders ‚Äúwtf is wrong with this guy and why is he always whispering hodl to himself‚Äù hahahahaüò≠
5	1523420890	5	Sounds like you need a good dose of depression and a pinch of anxiety and you'll be ready for the world of crypto
5	1523436431	1	remember, no emotions ! ;) 
4	1523406184	3	My initial investment during those 2 months was about $2k.I've put in more than $20k since January. I only sold about $500 to test out Coinbase. Everything worked out like butter.My personal strategy is to withdraw 10% for every 50% of gains, so for the short term, I'll be holding! I never understood the whole "hodl hodl hodl" hivemind circlejerk. What's the point of holding if you're not going to take regular profits, you know?
5	1523406872	1	I‚Äôm with you, I cashed out 75% of my holdings in mid Jan.When I saw things like Cardano hit 25 bil marketcap, I knew it was time.
6	1523406956	1	I hope it was profits, lot losses!
7	1523407287	4	All profit, i put about 5k into crypto in 2013/2014 and took out millions at the start of this year.I noticed I also stopped obsessing over the price which is nice, it‚Äôs all fun and games now.
8	1523407542	1	Ayyyyy! Wishing you a great 2018.
9	1523408634	1	You too friend! 
8	1523423541	1	[deleted]
9	1523423721	1	It‚Äôs not an uncommon story, just not many people talk about it.
8	1523436475	1	yup..cant get greedy, wish i sold all my btc around 19k lol
5	1523413983	0	Because when its time to sell your coins...you wont need to. Or thats the diehard hodler theory anyways. Relevant meme: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/gE8hDnY
3	1523416071	-1	You obviously bought the wrong things then. 
2	1523393902	21	Not really, we‚Äôve fallen pretty far from the ATH of all coins. A lot of people lost money. 
3	1523399462	-21	A lot of plebs
4	1523401471	10	Easy there, Buffet leave some money for rest of us lol
2	1523394544	-34	I love those people, they bought all my coins (and paid the premiums) and now I am rich as fuck. I might just buy in again a couple of years from now, I am sure eventually there will again be people that want to buy my coins and pay a nice premium. edit: I am getting downvoted by the people that bought my coins, I can understand they are upset but hey it's a free unregulated market. 
3	1523403274	16	I down voted you and i didn't buy any of your coins, you're just an arse
4	1523403883	-9	Well don't buy any crypto in the future, you might be buying my coins and never even know it! 
3	1523401369	1	Your coins are gonna be extinct 
4	1523401783	-6	Well I have no coins anymore, just a lot of money but when the market is done crashing I might buy some more coins to go for a third round in like 5 years.  
0	1523399070	5	Maidsafe coin?
1	1523411079	13	It's the most ambitious project in the space and if you don't know it you are missing a very good one there. Check their forum it is buzzing with activity and weekly development updates every Thursday. They also have one of the biggest teams in the space which is constantly growing with staff in Scotland and Indian. The community are very strong and very well informed technically. If they pull off what they are trying to achieve which is a fully decentralised internet that pays farmers / miners and devolpers that create apps and websites on the platform, this coin will be back in the top 10 for sure. I'd say the top 3 if it works as intended. https://safenetforum.org/latest
1	1523417398	10	Do you watch Silicon Valley?  SAFE network is what Pied Piper is based on.  Some of the team are listed as tech advisors in the credits.
1	1523401234	1	Apparently that was a big coin back in the day. It was for renting out hard drive space iirc.I wish I was involved in the market back then, but then so do we all I guess.
2	1523407296	-1	Maidsaif is more than decent storage. It‚Äôs an Internet, well at least it could be someday if they‚Äôd quit their day jobs. 
3	1523417167	7	Quit their day jobs?  They have a team of about 30 working full time
3	1523412342	1	I had this back in Jan, up to about Oct of last year.   By the time they actually get out of the alpha phases, a competitor will beat them to the punch.  Too ambitious, considering the scale of what they want to achieve vs their resources. 
4	1523413442	8	They have a lot of it worked out already. And there really isn't anyone that can compete with what they are doing at the moment. If you know any decent examples please let me know... Please don't say substratum because they really do not have the skills to pull off what maidsafe are doing. These guys are creating something that is really going to shake the crypto world up. 
5	1523414627	2	While my example only addresses a part of what maidsafe wants to accomplish, Shift uses IPFS to host decentralized websites, and their web page is a working example. I'll come back to maidsafe if they can show a working project is within reach.  That 'beyond' note on their road map is what made me bail. 
6	1523447538	2	IPFS has many limitations when dealing with data persistence and privacy. Filecoin may help to resolve some of them, but you cannot achieve what Maidsafe are attempting on top of IPFS or Freenet, etc, otherwise they would have done so.
7	1523456659	1	True, maidsafe is a rebuild of how the internet works.  I could see a group with a better focus coming along, that could get more done before maidsafe releases their beta.  In any case, I would come back to them when they show the alpha stage is nearly complete 
8	1523464971	2	They seem highly focussed on developing quality over quantity. Considering the complexity of the project, this is probably very sensible. Very much tortoise vs hare, IMO!
8	1523470872	1	The maidsafe team work crazy hours and constantly looking to add the best new engineers. If you look at how the team has grown in the last 12 months you can see a huge difference and also how far they have come with testing. Keep up with the updates every Thursday and try out the alpha network and you will start to realise how much they have already achieved.  Also the community is the best: they run their own test nets, find bugs, create documentation..... I honestly haven't seen a more well informed and helpful community in the whole crypto space and every week you see new people coming to the forum. The guardian article helped a lot. Here it is: https://www.google.com.co/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/01/punk-rock-internet-diy-rebels-working-replace-tech-giants-snoopers-charter
0	1523410654	5	Y'all got any more of that $10 litecoin?
0	1523390303	10	Why you post this screenshot, making so many people feel bad. I'm crying since I remember Dash and Litecoin being few cents :/
1	1523390905	7	Don't feel bad. This is just a reminder on how much things can change in just one year. I have high hopes that this time next year, everything will be looking even better! 
2	1523391156	1	A bit sarcastic. But yes, money is not everything to me so this does not concern me as much as the lost opportunity, the small balls in other words xD
3	1523393449	9	one Year is like 10 normal years in crypto
1	1523393455	4	Now remember that the market is just at the beginning,only now in 2018 big money will start flowing into the market.
0	1523411370	12	I honestly thing these gains were a one time phenomenon. The higher the overall market cap grows, the less exponential the growth. I think the days of getting 15,000-20,000% growth in a few months are done.  Exponential growth gets difficult the higher the price gets.I think the next bull run will be more along the lines of +200-300% gain in market cap rather than +5,000% market cap.
1	1523430900	12	You really have no clue how small this market still is compared to what it will be some day.
2	1523441047	3	Dude the total marketcap is larger than some countries GDP at this point, we aren't a tiny market anymore. We can still grow a TON but not by the thousands. 
3	1523445200	4	Market cap doesnt equal money invested.
2	1523452960	1	You are right. It could be much larger some day. It could be much smaller some day.A 10,000% rise from current prices would give crypto about 10% of total wealth on the planet. It's ridiculous to expect crypto to have such a market cap when very few projects even have a working product -- and most probably never will. 
2	1523450920	1	And neither do you
1	1523433629	1	Well, just 4 months ago we saw two coins have 15,000% growth in approx *one month* (Nano and TRX), so who knows. I know recency bias makes things look pretty bleak right now, but in the grand scheme of things that was not long ago at all and I see no reason to think it couldn't happen again at some point in future, even if it's not tomorrow.
0	1523437759	4	tether still not mooned...
0	1523389267	7	It‚Äôs hard to imagine what it‚Äôs going to look like this time *NEXT* year. Hopefully good projects only. 
0	1523407668	9	Can't believe Tether was only $1 back then
1	1523413074	1	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAHAHAH
0	1523402808	3	I bought a lot of ETH around this time last year. Best purchase to date.
1	1523436597	1	buy of the century
0	1523406727	3	MAID hasn't changed much
1	1523411164	5	Still in development but is a huge project. If they pull it off it's going to shock a lot of the crypto world imo 
1	1523444933	2	The potential is and was always there, which is why it was top 10 in the first place. They have been kicking through the gears for a while now and the finish line is getting closer. If/when they get there, it will be ground breaking, imo.
0	1523393256	5	Ripples 1-year run to $3 was unprecedented (for the amount of time) and something like that will never be seen again.  
1	1523396296	3	Just wait :) 
1	1523401134	1	You mean its 100x? Lol  100x seems like child's play to some other gains within a year.Neo did 1000x in the same amount of time.Neo was around 16 Cent this time last year, from that to its ath was over 1000x. I do however sadly feel like the days of getting those gains easily might be over. I do suspect there will be some that do insane gains similar again once we hit a bull market but picking them out will be much more difficult that it used to be. 
0	1523397838	2	This is what dreams are made of.
0	1523402546	2	Ripple :( ohwell I put 50 bucks in and made 1200...somehow...with ripple? its mostly gone now but I can HOPE!
0	1523422010	2	Wow, just look how far Tether has gone üëèüôåüëèüôåüëè
0	1523424313	2	Wish i would've bought then at those prices 
0	1523450203	2	We've come so far in a single year 
0	1523400372	2	Just goes to show how much lower we could go. 
1	1523403460	0	Just goes to show how much higher we might be in a year 
2	1523403951	2	True. Its just funny that if you mention the posibility that the price could go down, they get scared and downvote you.
3	1523414286	2	In a crypto sub that tends to happen....because most people here are optimistic on crypto, otherwise they wouldnt spend much time here. If you go to r/personalfinance youd get upvoted to hell for the same thing.
0	1523389428	2	Who will replace ETH?  
1	1523389807	14	Tether ofc. Good team, great project, mind blowing white paper,...
2	1523396545	3	Catchy name, solid devs, not too volatileSure betHave been hodling since ico, very bullish :-)
1	1523393053	5	Out of the loop, why would anything replace ETH? 
2	1523395669	2	Not replace ETH.  There has to be another blockchain pairing and another big platform for ICOs.  Could IOST, ZIL, XLR grow to the level of ETH?  Of all the "3.0" blockchain's one of the new ones should be a shocker for 2018.
1	1523393662	6	I don't think any coin can replace Vitalik right now. He will solve the scalability problem. Charles Hoskinson is a great public speaker though.
1	1523401330	4	Neblio pos already, ico increasing day by day.
1	1523414111	0	Vechain or NEO
0	1523406612	1	jeezz.
0	1523424340	1	Huh, didn't know that golem was so far up there. Their mainnet launched recently too. I might pick some up at this price :P 
0	1523430529	1	wow tether seems to be so stable going all in boiz
0	1523437213	1	Even those time I was thinking about selling. Fortunatelly I've bought CS just after their ICO, and ETH. by 39$
0	1523437275	1	I bought ripple in June 2017 I think, for 0.34. Aaaaah :-)
0	1523440943	1	All these years 1 coin that didn't change much is USDT, poor bagholders 
0	1523441026	1	I remember when Bitcoin was in the $300 range I started getting interested in how to invest in some. It sounded too complicated at the time, I didnt really understand it all so I left it. Finally got in last year but the regrets are always there.
1	1523449374	1	I bought a quarter of a bitcoin off some guy on ebay for $20 way back... something needed payment in crypto.
0	1523445961	1	So much has changed but has also remained the same. Its not on the list but even then 1 Doge was worth 1 Doge
0	1523451086	1	Eth and LTC still 10x while BTC only 7x
0	1523451156	1	too bad i put all my money on tether
0	1523455289	1	Miss those times when there was no Bcash.
0	1523455866	1	wow thats pretty amazing lol 
0	1523456770	1	fuk im whet
0	1523456882	1	Yep went all in on MaidSafe last March - up 25% over the year, just barely beat out the DOW
0	1523463384	1	Tether at 1$ O_O
0	1523463840	1	This just shows how many opportunities we missed, well at least I did sort of.
0	1523464750	1	I got in in 2013 and kind of forgot about it. bought litecoin for more than it was last year, lol :/. good thing it went to 300+
0	1523467223	1	Dang! I joined too late. bwaa,waa,waa
