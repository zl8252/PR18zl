0	1523453555	21	Time to get Rekt. But in a good way. 
1	1523456488	17	Reqt
2	1523456648	19	Man, how did i fuck that up?  Must be the Verge brainwashing going to my head. 
0	1523450849	24	great news
1	1523467691	7	Hijacking this because I'm seeing some very low quality comments in here, but to summarise why this is great news :#You can now send and receive crypto via Request and be immune to market volatility.I'll explain;DGX Tokens will now be available as an option for invoicing on the Request Network. This allows anyone in the world to digitally send and receive invoices which can be paid with gold.DGX are backed by 99.99% gold cast bars from London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)-approved refiners on a 1:1 basis, where 1 token is backed by 1 gram of gold.A gold-backed token available as an invoicing option allows anyone to receive and send payments in a true stablecoin. That will mean the value will never be subject to the volatile cryptocurrency market or even foreign exchange fluctuations. Not even Tether can do that.
2	1523468822	2	Lol, and here we go again, falling back on fiat and precious metal for valuation.
3	1523469374	2	Well for the time being, its kind of needed. Due to the limited supply of cryptocurrencies in general, we will see volatility for awhile. This will no longer be needed when cryptos are stable,
3	1523470367	1	MakerDAO's stablecoin is supposed to be free floating over some index in the future making it independent on USD. And what's so bad about gold? :) 
3	1523471228	1	Yes but still circumventing 3rd parties (banks)
1	1523461345	1	great post
2	1523463790	2	great comment

0	1523455572	20	I think I will probably buy REQ whilst it is fairly cheap
0	1523454218	8	Surprising partnership, I didn't see this coming.  Very cool.
0	1523456411	24	underpromise & overdeliver

0	1523463841	5	I love the passive-aggressiveness of this post, have an upvote
0	1523458865	3	this is amazing....but I do not hold any of those :(
0	1523454193	8	Great team. Good project. 
0	1523456381	8	Why this coin is not hyped? 
1	1523456684	6	its on the front page of r/cryptocurrency every day - it's OVERhyped, the price just doesn't reflect it's PR teams grind
2	1523462757	3	it gets a lot of attention in this sub for sure, but the team themselves don't hype the shit out of it like tron/verge and get the dummies excited about it.  I consider that a good thing, seeing as until a couple weeks ago it didn't have a working product to look at. price action is boring on this coin, if not downright depressing recently, but I think if they can achieve what they set out to, this will be huge in the coming years. (but to be fair, anyone who believes in what they invest in could probably say similar shit about their own coins/tokens)
2	1523464050	3	PR teams grind? The people posting threads on this subreddit are just community members trying to share info about their coin..
2	1523462802	5	It's part of what I like to call this subreddit's "Shill 4"- VeChain- ICON- Request Network- Nano
3	1523464579	5	This is true, however req is still bar far the smallest in market cap out of these projects. 
4	1523465648	-6	rightfully so at this point
3	1523464995	-5	Agree with this.. I would even wager Nano, possibly even ven is out of favor with shillers, req is the new one.. just a matter of when the shills dump their bags on the shillees
1	1523461170	-4	Because making payment requests isn't much to get hyped about.  Their homepage tells you the what but not the WHY.  Their partnerships are all in the cryptospace, aside from PWC.Have not done much research beyond that, Ycombinator backed is a huge plus but the whole thing just seems meh.
0	1523468358	2	REQ is truly a long term hold. Especially bc of the PWC partnership
1	1523470042	-2	Also because it's practically useless until adoption of cryptocurrency as actual currencies happens.  Which might not ever happen.
2	1523471401	1	You should do research. Not true at all. The value of crypto is how much friction you can take out of the network. This news is literally the opposite of what you postulate. Now people can trade and pay in gold over the Internet. 
0	1523462001	1	 Tuesday, including BitoEX and MaiCoin, in an effort to understand their existing self-regulatory measures including AML and know-your-customer process.
0	1523462075	1	He also indicated that the institution would propose regulating cryptocurrencies under current AML rules to the Ministry of Justice.
0	1523456633	-6	How does every REQ posting make it to the front page? - dont get me wrong, i've held a little since last November, but its always fishy to me to see a new REQ post on the front page of r/cryptocurrency everyday with its not even in the top 90 MC.  Good PR team?  Reddit mods big Hodlers? 
1	1523457067	12	Large number of small cap holders probably.  REQ is a long-shot for astronomical growth and lots of people seem to have a little just in case it ends up doing an x100-x1000.  
2	1523461547	-1	Of course, i'm one of those people - but the same goes for the other 100 coins between 50-150 MC and you just dont see those on front page.  The proportion to market cap ratio fro REQ shills is extremely alarming to me and a huge red flag.  They hired a PR team recently that may have dished out some money to Reddit to boost it's posts
3	1523464157	1	This is not true at all.. Request posts have been popular on this sub for a long time now, ever since the market had a large influx of new buyers - ever stopped to think that something that people consider as "Paypal 2.0 like" would be popular among investors looking for relatable projects?
1	1523461378	4	Honestly I am not sure. I just posted this because I saw it on the Request network subreddit and thought I would post it over here considering it had been confirmed on both sides (The new sub rule)I think there are just that many on the cryptocurrency sub who are lurkers, holders and whenever they see REQ they upvote?
1	1523462575	1	I hold some REQ and I think it's just because everyone that holds pieces of REQ upvote it immediately (I do too when I see it). I rarely post in them other than reading them however...
1	1523460442	-5	And of course your downvoted for speaking the truth. Every day we get a new generic req article posted with generic comments like “solid team, always deliver”...
2	1523461463	1	Yeah I honestly don't know where the downvotes are coming from as it is a good question to ask. As I said above I saw it on the Request network subreddit and thought I would post it over here considering it had been confirmed on both sides (The new sub rule)I think there are just that many on the cryptocurrency sub who are lurkers, holders and whenever they see REQ they upvote?
