1	1523430630	6	If you cant beat them...join them
2	1523437840	7	Do I need a hedge ?

1	1523446918	-2	So are you saying you would not like to see a rise in the market? 
2	1523448130	5	No, I would not.

1	1523402799	45	as long as we can get back to a bull market, im happy
2	1523413774	32	If you are happy then I am happy

1	1523456639	2	Yes, this guy with his $20M is surely manipulating the crypto market.
0	1523405170	12	People still pretending they know when it'll go up and down ? That's cute

1	1523438786	-3	It’s tied to tax season.
2	1523441394	14	No, Chinese Easter is April 23rd, the bull run starts shortly after 
3	1523448576	12	No. Cambodian Hanukkah is April 45th, the bull run starts then.
4	1523470684	1	Hope Haitian Moses is there
0	1523402544	13	I mean, yeah I obviously hope. But I’ve heard this so many times since January 
0	1523400126	9	Here's to hoping

0	1523409885	3	He's just talking his book. There's nothing solid here.> It remains unclear what exactly the SEC is looking for, though an official confirmed "dozens" of investigations were underway.They're looking for securities violations to enforce against?
0	1523405281	5	It's not over until it is actually over...

0	1523444404	2	Damn, I thought the market was finally done correcting. But after this statement, I fear we might see another down turn /s
0	1523449151	2	I asked Mr. Enneking what he thought were the chances of a new plunge below 6K on his last CAF conference call a few weeks ago. He gave a similar answer to what we see here. However - the price was over $8500 at the time, and he said that while he though it likely Bitcoin would see the 7000's again, he didn't think it would go deep into the 7000's. FWIW.
0	1523408408	3	We are on the beginning of an overall downtrend in the cycle (for stocks and other markets)...I think it's a longer bear market unfortunately. People will not have discretionary money to throw at crypto or the enthusiasm for a new asset class

0	1523413362	2	Denial much?
0	1523429172	1	Since Feb I am hearing the same news but from different sources. I hope this is last
0	1523430262	1	Oh look it's this post again.
0	1523443184	1	We've been saying that shit for more than two months now
0	1523449489	1	I would not be investing in that fund... 
0	1523455877	1	I hope so.. tired of the bears.. i need some bulls man
0	1523457322	1	I think that might be true, we already had a really bad sentiment ratio between bulls/bears and at this point literally, everybody who was inclined to sell, already sold, now the majority are long holders and people who made tons of profit since may 2017. They not gonna sell easily. Right now sentiment is on the rise, and the ratio between bulls/bears looks optimistic. The volume is still thin, but that's mainly because of the end of the tax year. 
0	1523457419	1	Invsestors are also likely wary due to recent regulatory actions.Author doesn't even do a spelling check..
0	1523457630	1	nnooo it isssnntttttttt
0	1523464197	1	Lol
0	1523466900	1	What do you guys expect to see after tax returns?
0	1523470889	1	I suppose it would be nice to get a few more paychecks into crypto before it goes more bullish but on the other hand watching the portfolio value grow doesn't suck.
0	1523423263	1	My portfolio looks on in agony. 
0	1523440567	0	The big bear is just starting. Bitcoin and other major cryptos are not GDPR compatible. Which means they cannot be used in EU after 25th of May. Let’s see what that does to the rates. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-22/is-your-blockchain-business-doomed
1	1523440816	3	Care to elaborate?I don't see how any cryptocurency that doesn't store personal information would be affected, i.e. virtually all of them
2	1523441045	0	Under GDPR, the definition of personal data is deliberately a very broad one. In principle, it covers any information that relates to an identifiable, living individual, such as a person’s name or social security number. But it could also include any type of data that could directly or indirectly identify an individual.“Some of the most important areas of guidance have been issued in the last two, three, four months,” says Jules Polonetsky, chief executive officer of the Future of Privacy Forum, a privacy think tank that works with chief privacy officers, academics, and policymakers. “There’s a lot of detail, but still a lot of subjective interpretation.”It’s possible that even an individual’s public Bitcoin address—a string of letters and numbers used to send and receive the digital currency—could be considered personal information. “Encrypted data will often qualify as personal data and not as anonymous data,” the law firm Hogan Lovells said in a recent note. “This means that in most instances the privacy rules will be applicable to at least some of the data involved in blockchain systems.”https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-22/is-your-blockchain-business-doomed
3	1523441633	3	 Yeah, sensationalist title as was the OP. They even say in this article that the legislation is flexible and may allow for blockchain projects. But most importantly this only affects projects that intend to collect personal information. So largely irrelevant outside of certain ethereum dapps that intend to manage databases such as healthcare records etc. 
4	1523443489	-4	Actually not that sensationalist, unless you want to stay in denial. In which case just say so and I will not waste my time.Even just IP addresses are PII in many cases, and Bitcoin, etc addresses are a lot more permanent and identifying than IP address.
5	1523446258	2	bitcoin address does not identify a person
6	1523446591	2	Neither does an IP address, but still IP address is categorized as PII (Personally Identifying Information).For arguments sake, explain why bitcoin address does not specifiy a person when you have bitcoin address and time as parameters? To make it equal for IP address case.
7	1523450095	1	> explain why bitcoin address does not specifiy a person when you have bitcoin address and time as parameters? Are you serious..? Not everyone uses a bitcoin address attached to their bank account / identity. 
8	1523450311	1	I am dead serious.Just some people using bitcoin address attached with identity is enough.Also even if you do not attach account, still using the same address for multiple transactions makes it personally identifying information.This is the problem of blockchain. Outside of public notary, and similar applications, it is in fact a bloody stupid idea.
9	1523451727	1	If I buy BTC using cash then there’s no way to know who I am. With that said, are you saying crypto falls into this category because many wallet address can be traced to a users identity? It doesn’t matter that anonymity is achievable if proper OPSEC is followed? > Outside of public notary, and similar applications, it is in fact a bloody stupid idea.I don’t completely disagree with you here. I’m skeptical of everything in crypto until proven otherwise. Not really sure what this has to do with your argument though. 
5	1523453546	2	It's completely sensationalist because nobody knows how it's going to work yet. Even in the article you linked they are essentially saying, nobody knows how it's going to work yet. Outright calling the big bear based on this is absoloutely sensationalist.Just look at the second top post on r/cc right now...http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-2902_en.htm
6	1523454570	1	You are confusing blockchain in general and lost causes like bitcoin. Blockchain can be GDPR compliant when implementation is designed from ground up to match that. Bitcoin and Ethereum folks are just plain arrogant and will soon get a nasty wake up. Also one conference does not match to legislation that has been prepared for years. 
7	1523454940	1	 Yeah I agree with you to some extent don't get me wrong. I'm not bullish on eth or BTC as it stands, but i dont agree that all cryptocurency is about to fall off a cliff because of this legislation.
8	1523459653	1	Maybe it is question of perspective, for me dead in EU is as good as dead. As transferring money in and out of EU is a hassle, and crypto sales related transfers easily trigger anti money laundering investigations.Also losing market size of EU, will most definitely impact Bitcoin and other large currencies.
1	1523448061	1	Asia is where like 80 % of crypto is Europe and the US don't really control the market. 
2	1523449362	1	Still EU is a big market, so losing access to that will have an impact. 
3	1523454953	1	You're not wrong by any means, just saying I'm not sure it's going to have a large impact. Anyway I'm loving this stable Market, allowing me to stock up on the cheap. 
4	1523459838	1	Just make sure you have an exit plan when exchanges are forbidden to deal with EU citizens.Which may well happen, as GDPR concerns EU citizens data and forces entities to operate within EU borders when PII is concerned.Which is by all Google, Amazon and others have nowadays EU data centers.
5	1523466340	1	Luckily im in the US 
6	1523466829	1	Then you are ok. 
0	1523469102	0	Ok.
0	1523399912	-5	hopefully not.
