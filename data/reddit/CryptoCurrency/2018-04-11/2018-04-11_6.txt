0	1523452417	25	I sense a theme developing on the front page of Reddit today. AMB seems to be fitting in nicely with the European movement towards block chain integration. Hope to see some more attention drawn to this project in the near-term, word is that there are some serious partnerships soon to be announced.

0	1523460031	9	And today at LogiPharma, Ambrosus CPO Vlad Trifa is speaking alongside Deloitte Managing Director
0	1523451043	21	great news!I think that AMB will be one of the biggest gainers in the upcoming bull market
1	1523452355	7	Yep same, been getting into position in recent weeks.
2	1523456669	5	how many AMB's to make it?
3	1523466443	0	I've seen 10K been thrown around as the node minimum, but it's not known. Arguably "the best supply chain" and CMC rank 187 is all you need to know! 
4	1523467221	2	>Arguably "the best supply chain" and CMC rank 187 is all you need to know!yeah, some random redditor thinking it's the "best" (far from it, i'm sorry, but you can't just pretend things like this), and the ranking on CMC is all you need to know. Go all in asap.
5	1523468147	1	Even though my words could have been chosen better, I did do my DD and compared most supply chains, I overall preferred AMB for the combination of a number of reasonsSo i'm curious why you say "far from it" ?
6	1523470494	2	Modum, SmartContainers, VeChain, Walton, WaBi. these are the projects targeting AMB's market as well. Of the 5, Modum and Smartcontainers are in Switzerland as well, and full tied/compliant with Swiss law. They have taken the eyes of the majority of the EU pharma market from AMB. Smartcontainers is moving into the food shipping industry, with tech better than any rival on earth, and a method that can actually speed up the supply chain. **AMB is behind these two companies alone.** Now take in VeChain, Walton, and Wabi, who are also further ahead in adoption and R&D.  So out of 6 companies, AMB is arguably "in last". They've tried for months to secure a partnership that a small underdog startup (EVE) managed to secure first with the UN. That's why I say "far from it".If AMB could secure a partnership with Smartcontainers for the food-chain, then I could see much more potential for AMB
7	1523471679	0	Totally agree. Would Said partnership happen if MOD plans to enter the food industry? If they did, it’d be through smarc
1	1523461649	2	AKA I hold AMB so I hope it goes up soon.
2	1523462293	7	AKA I did my own research and AMB is one of the best projects out there
3	1523464482	4	I would very much like to hear why you feel the AMB is one of the best projects out there. Please, for the love of god, do not just say "the team is good and they have many partnerships"
4	1523466487	2	The "better" sensors and them being in europe did it for me (and their current CMC rank :p )
5	1523467300	3	"better"? How are their sensors "better"? If you're here for the CMC rank, why AMB and not ARY or EVE, which are like 1/10th the market cap, and one already has the UN partnership AMB's been after for months?
6	1523467938	1	I do actually have ARY and EVE.  Just less than AMB. Better probably wasn't the right word; I like how they build them from scratch and tailored to the pharma and food industry.  Especially ARY seems a bit more niche.
7	1523468786	2	They're tailored for pharma, but all the big clients AMB could target have already chosen another way MOD/SMARC/Centralized solutions), and food is following. AMB is competing with 2 other projects in their home country alone, that are further along in adoption. and working together. They've got a lot to overcome imo.
8	1523471879	1	Is there a token associated with Smart Containers, where can I find info on this project? thanks :)
2	1523462512	0	I've been hearing "AMB will be huge in a couple months" since November. It's the exact same $ price as it was back in November.edit: points something out, gets downvoted
3	1523462849	2	Yeah but they're actually releasing tech now... beta mainnet this month as well as an iOS SDK. Token economics & masternode details will be coming out at EDCON. They've stated they're doing a GAS type of model.
4	1523463070	-1	I'm not bashing the project at all, been with it since the start, just pointing something out. I don't own my AMB myself atm, but if it dropped another 10 cents I'd consider holding some short term. My issue with AMB is they've yet to actually provide any reasoning for one to actually buy the token over other competition in the space, other than "hoping they get big"edit: has an opinion, gets downvoted. I have no idea why i actually come to this sub anymore, everyone who actually knows what they're talking about stays away from here now...
5	1523471865	2	Can we quit downvoting people that have opposing opinions? I mean this guy created /r/RFIDBlockchain, he openly loves all these projects, he’s not just bashing it, he’s got more legit points than anyone else i’m seeing here.
5	1523465798	-1	> has an opinion, gets downvoted. I have no idea why i actually come to this sub anymore, everyone who actually knows what they're talking about stays away from here now...To claim that Ambrosus doesn't provide any reasoning for why they offer a superior solution is extremely disingenuous, DYOR. You're getting downvote because the following isn't an opinion, please source where a team member has said the only reason to purchase AMB is "hoping they get big".> My issue with AMB is they've yet to actually provide any reasoning for one to actually buy the token over other competition in the space, other than "hoping they get big"
6	1523465962	3	Yeah, they've yet to provide a reason for one to buy this token over say VET or WTC, who are further along. Did you really think that I meant a team member specifically said not to buy AMB unless you "hope they get big"?. 
7	1523467196	1	You explicitly implied that the only substance the team has offered as for why to buy AMB is "hoping they get big". Which is disingenuous.https://ambrosus.com/assets/Ambrosus-White-Paper-V8-1.pdf https://ambrosus.com/assets/5-1_Operations_and_ApplicationsNEW.pdfhttps://ambrosus.com/assets/2-1_Statement_and_Business_opportunitiesNew.pdfhttps://ambrosus.com/assets/4-2_Food_Sensors_and_TracersNEW.pdfhttps://ambrosus.com/assets/Ambrosus-Pharmacy-v2.pdfhttps://ambrosus.com/assets/Ambrosus-Vision-Paper-V.2.3.2-EN.pdfI can also cherry pick some comments from the CEO:> Ambrosus is specifically tailored to the needs of the supply chain and adds elements for seamless sensors/hardware integration. Thus to companies we offer a full package.>  Ambrosus, conversely, has a utility token that is inherently used in the network for data processing and storage and access to services (ethereum/NEO-style). Given the fixed limited number of tokens, greater growth of network usage appears to directly lead to greater demand for tokens.> Our recent engagements with a large British pharmaceutical company, a large German quality assurance firm, a large Swiss food retailer and a range of other diverse stakeholders has allowed us to get a deep practical understanding on what the expectations and needs are on their side vis-a-vis a system such as Ambrosus, and this likewise adds another dimension to our cryptoeconomic model.> We are interacting with the government authorities and associations responsible for policies of standards/safety in several countries including among others the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, France, Singapore, as well as the EU and United Nations. In due time, we plan to make the outcome of these discussions public.
8	1523467792	1	I think I just need to word what i'm saying in a much simpler way. There's no reason to buy this token over VEN/WTC if you're looking to profit as much as possible, other than the fact that they're much lower in market cap (for a reason)
9	1523469152	1	> I think I just need to word what i'm saying in a much simpler way.I don't really appreciate the condescension, especially since I'm trying to provide actual substance as opposed to the total lack thereof on your part.> There's no reason to buy this token over VEN/WTC if you're looking to profit as much as possibleI want to preface by saying that I think VEN and WTC are both strong projects, but I'd argue the exact opposite. If you're 'looking to profit as much as possible', AMB has a significantly higher upside than VEN/WTC at the moment. If you could, please provide me with any sort of substance that justifies your belief that that VEN and WTC are superior projects than Ambrosus? Because I really can't find anything that separates the projects of VEN/WTC from that of AMB.So given this, we can look at current valuation to judge which project offers the best chance for profit.VEN market cap- ~$1.4 billionWTC market cap- ~$244 millionAMB market cap- ~$42 millionAgain I think all the above projects are very promising and will likely find success. Ambrosus has just as much, if not more so, going for it than does VeChain or Waltonchain. The only (major) difference is the current valuation of the projects. Do you honestly believe that Vechain deserves to be valued at 33x's more than Ambrosus? If you DYOR, there truly isn't that much separation between fundamentals- the discrepancy in market cap is irrational and presents an opportunity for investors. Given the current valuations, as well as fundamentals, I think AMB is the clear choice for those seeking to 'profit as much as possible'. 
7	1523466099	1	Don't worry about it. People with a brain are still going to read your comments, and they'll see you're the only logical one in this thread. Who cares if AMB shills are downvoting you? I mean that's all they can do, they can't come up with any actual response defending AMB... They completely ignore that their CEO even said that AMB is not an investment, and they have no plans to ever market AMB to the crypto world. It's a utility. Not an investment. Angel has said this many times.
5	1523467291	0	Like I said, they're releasing token economics soon which will might answer your questions as to why you should buy their token/masternode.But using your logic, why would anyone buy utility tokens then if not to get a masternode? We buy them to sell at a higher price... pretty simple.
6	1523467719	2	All I'm saying is from an investment standpoint, one would only buy AMB with blind faith that they will one day be bigger than VET/WTC, IBM/Maersk, hell they're even competing (and losing) with MOD/SMARC for pharma in the EU. I am not saying AMB is a bad investment, just not as promising at this moment for us in this space. I've held AMB since out of the ICO, I've even helped them secure a smaller partnership, but I just have no interest in the token at this moment, when it seems there are better options
7	1523468835	0	Yeah, you have to buy ANY investment with a blind faith that people will do what they say, and in the hope that you get a return... Success doesn't mean "the best". Why does Ambrosus have to be bigger than their competition for them to be successful or profitable for their token holders? The market is big enough for many solution providers.I think they've done a pretty good job as outlining their potential success... what else can they do? You have to take a risk with any investment, or you can buy once they're already successful and the price is higher (lower risk)
8	1523469001	1	>Why does Ambrosus have to be bigger than their competition for them to be successful or profitable for their token holders? They don't. Investors go where the profit is thought. If AMB isn't nearly as profitable, that will reflect in it's value. It's current ow market cap is that very action taking place.
3	1523466328	2	The first organic comment in this whole thread.
3	1523466249	1	But it's misleading. Since November 20: AMB current price is up by 53%, while the overall market is up 11.6%.
4	1523466729	1	I said $ value. It's doubled in BTC value since november, but in $ value it's currently like...2 cents more than it was on this day in november 
5	1523468146	1	I was looking at $ as well, just at a different date in November.On November 11 AMB was at ~$0.27 (which happened to be the monthlong high). However for the overall month of November, the average price of AMB was ~$0.20. Current price for AMB is ~$0.29. So AMB is ~7% higher than it was on November 11 and ~45% higher than it was on average for the month of November.The overall cryptocurrency market cap during the month of November was ~$250 billion. Current market cap is ~$270 billion. Which is only 8% higher.Ultimately this is a meaningless parameter, which is exactly what I'm pointing out. There's no reason for you to throw shade at AMB because of the tokens price movement since November, especially given the context of the overall market.
6	1523468344	2	i've not "thrown shade" at anything, i was just talking about how for the past 6 months i've heard "Last chance to buy AMB before moon" and it's near the price it started out at. I found it funny.
7	1523469535	1	You can find the same rhetoric for holders of literally any coin over the past 6 months. Unfortunately, the market has been extremely bearish over the past few, making it nearly impossible for any coin to 'moon'.
8	1523469732	1	Coins can "moon" in the bear market still, they're just usually small cap. EVE doubled last week upon the UN/Food tracking partnership. CXO doubled upon some logistics company deal the other day. These coins of course are much easier to pump than AMB.
3	1523464281	1	Now what you said is completely true, but your comment doesn't imply that AMB will go to the moon. DOWNVOTE FOR YOU SIR

0	1523454624	8	My body is ready
0	1523457633	5	My bags are ready
0	1523459400	4	Looks promising and absolutely massive team , but we need to see  proper partnerships coming out of NDA!
0	1523452818	5	Delete this.
1	1523462375	1	why?
2	1523463295	-2	We don't really care for "these guys will speak to a room full of people near the end of the month".just post the video of the actual conference when they speak.I'm assuming that's the reason
3	1523463362	2	well with that logic no news or information EVER should be posted ..until said event takes place. I don't get that. 
4	1523463491	2	You're right, I have no issue with it myself, although I do question the point of this post. AMB sub has the same post in it, with 15 upvotes and no comments. meanwhile this is front page with a bunch of shilly "loading my bags" or "big things coming" comments.People don't like announcing that something will be announced
5	1523466113	2	fair point, I don't like announcements of announcements either
0	1523465996	1	a lot of really cool things in the pipeline for ambrosus! a word of caution, though, that some of that pipeline is overdue. 2 things stand out that were to be delivered in March:1) several expiring NDAs that were to be announced2) progress update on the selection process for the UN proposal (CEO of AMB recently stated that this is late due to bureaucracy at the UN)very promising project, but so far it hasn't moved from the potential to actual, and the radio silence on NDA is especially concerning because apparently something delayed every single project that was to be shared last month (except the coffee alliance announcement, which is an MOU)
1	1523466405	1	Also, the new website was also promised in March. Still waiting. 
1	1523466621	1	>progress update on the selection process for the UN proposal (CEO of AMB recently stated that this is late due to bureaucracy at the UN)Any idea about maybe AMB working with EVE? EVE's been working with the UN for a little now.
1	1523466232	1	1) several expiring NDAs that were to be announcedTo be honest, I think that if you look at this from a business perspective, you should be very encouraged by the team's restraint. It takes some business acumen to know that it would've been an awful idea to release big partnerships in the middle of a bear market. To me, it suggests that the team is thinking strategically.
2	1523466579	2	That's not the reason. I have a little AMB, but the company does not care in the slightest what the value of AMB is. CEO has stated countless times that he's not here to market some shitcoin for fomo, and you shouldn't be investing your life savings in a utility coin.
3	1523468205	1	>the company does not care in the slightest what the value of AMB is.I'm really not sure how you think that can be true. Look at how their tokens are vested in the team. There is a very strong economic incentive for them to see the price rise.
0	1523470843	1	How does Ambrosus compete against something like the IBM supply chain blockchain? I love the idea of AMB... but don't know how the two will compete against one another.- ignorant redditor
