0	1523450956	1	wow this looks awesome if they can pull it off, the only thing i dont like is i didnt see a whitepaper or pictures of the team 
0	1523450778	-1	Golem is developed in country I live and I happen to came across the CEO and the team. Trust me, nothing good will come out of this.Downvoters: do understand the Golem isn't a fucking web app project. They attempt to colonize the Mars. That level of complexity. Elon Musk is **not** on the team though.
1	1523452460	2	care to expand?
2	1523453856	-1	There is no expertise in the team develop anything close to what they attempt to do ("colonizing the Mars" level of complexity).The CEO and founder is a regular business guy. He graduated in "International Politics and Economics".They are simply incapable of researching and developing cutting edge decentralized cryptosystems.This is the "unintentional scam" group of things.
3	1523457953	2	How could you have gleaned all this from "coming across" the CEO and team?  I mean, they did just release to mainnet, so in what capacity are they incapable?On a side note, just because a CEO isn't technical means nothing.  If he knows how to get the right people that *can* do the work, that is perfectly acceptable.

3	1523459421	1	Considering they just released their product, I’d say your assessment is pretty off.Also why the hate in his major? Lots of successful people didn’t even graduate college.
4	1523459591	0	1) No, they didn't. What they released has nothing to do with what they promised.2) "Successful guy" - of course he is. For one, he raised a good money for his ICO project. It's just that it has nothing to do with capacity to colonize the Mars.
1	1523452674	2	elaborate?
1	1523471556	1	You personally verified the abilities of each team member? Can you explain what methods you used?
