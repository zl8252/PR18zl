0	1523446849	21	Yea loaded for me too. Good article thanks. 
0	1523448579	21	Mainstream media attention to crypto is mostly good, seems like a bit of a copy and paste article, but the facts are right.
0	1523450810	36	It's nice to see a legit article with VeChain in the title that wasn't deleted from this sub.
1	1523455910	13	Not yet, anyway.

0	1523451332	27	Awful article in an awful paper about a decent crypto.
1	1523452293	22	Yup Express probably one of the worse papers in the UK
1	1523463390	4	this isn't meant for you or me who understands vechain. This is meant for rightwing - 60 year olds in the UK
0	1523447032	11	It's a horribly written article. But the exposure is nice. 
1	1523466667	3	It's a horrible news paper to be fair
0	1523450912	9	I'm a big fan of Vechain but this isn't an accurate article."THIS currency has SOARED in 2018"? Vechain started the year at $2.30, went up to $9+ and today is sat at $2.70
1	1523451324	16	Given that most other cryptos lost 50% or more in that time frame 17% gain feels pretty good.
0	1523464180	3	A mod needs to delete this right now! Vechain was mentioned.
0	1523449506	7	Other breaking news on the newspaper for people over 80.Bitcoin cash: CEO says he's 'incredibly bullish' and long-run trend is for bitcoin BOUNCEIt's really really really a bollocks newspaper. No-one under 80 in this country touches it.
1	1523451608	5	I second that, I was hoping someone would mention that this paper is only good for getting your fire started at home. 
0	1523465691	2	Daily Express, what a coup! /sNB This comment is more of a criticism of the publication than the crypto.
0	1523454818	4	it is kind of kool here to say VEN is bad but I like the project
0	1523463840	3	It's a crap paper.
0	1523455837	3	Exposure is exposure. Will be nice seeing Vechain top 5 this year :). 
0	1523465362	1	But what about the partnerships?
0	1523456661	0	I like VeChain and think it is a great project like Credits and Eos!
