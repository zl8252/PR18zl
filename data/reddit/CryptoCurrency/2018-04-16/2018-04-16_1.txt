0	1523839173	93	The rumor in the hood says the partner is Enron Corporation
1	1523842148	17	It's a supplement store: https://anutra.com/verge/And it only took Verge 2 million dollars to do it!Guess what Monero did with only 1 million dollars: https://www.projectcoralreef.com/
2	1523844257	22	Nope it's not Anutra. That's old news from January 10.Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfRZz2zbkQ (check posting date)It remains to be seen if the upcoming "reveal" will be any better though.
3	1523844835	1	My mistake, thanks.
4	1523899243	2	delete your comment then?
2	1523884115	1	>Did you know on January 1st, 2016 the FDA prohibited sellers of any food or supplements, including fish, fish oil, krill and algae from making any claim about DHA and EPA (Omega 3‚Äôs) because health benefits are unproven. Proceeds to make health benefit claims anyway. Such crap shouldn't be used as any great sign of currency use.
1	1523886122	1	100B company?!  Wow!  And in 2000 no less, I wonder what that is in today's dollars?
1	1523860505	-2	Thanks

1	1523855550	31	At this point if you're looking for porn I feel like Verge is slightly out-doing spankchain in that market. I mean we're about to see hundreds of thousands of vergens getting fucked just by watching this disaster unfold. Spankchain needs to up their game.
2	1523894203	1	That was great! 
2	1523860204	-34	Slightly out-doing us? In what, bullshit marketing shills. Do they have a product that runs on the main net? No. Reputable team? No. They have a PR machine and it‚Äôs misleading and dangerous. I‚Äôm listening... What areas would you like to see us step our game up in? (I‚Äôm one of the co-founders of SpankChain)
3	1523866713	21	He was making a joke about the verge scam being akin to them being fucked, hence why he included spank chain, it was a joke... 
3	1523861776	21	Woooosh
4	1523861897	-14	Holy shit... they have a team of fucking cartoon people that don‚Äôt exist. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
5	1523883748	9	Dude I'm afraid to say you've missed a joke here!
5	1523893001	1	Is English your first language?
3	1523864108	6	It was a joke, and your project actually seems promising imho. 
4	1523866766	2	My b üòé
3	1523877385	2	LOL
1	1523847122	17	Hahaha well done, caught me off guard there
1	1523881233	-8	It is good you all speak shit about verge, I will buy cheaper!
2	1523883954	5	I sincerely wish you luck buddy.
3	1523885110	-2	I thought people in this sub understand trolling :D
4	1523887906	3	Since people here actually mean it, it's pretty hard to notice trolls. /s would help.
0	1523832070	171	Scam? ProbablyBitconnect? No, unless their partner is Carlos 
1	1523840076	251	carlos did nothing wrong and all he gave us were quality memes of the dankest kind
2	1523855236	57	I think it's funny because there are some people that legit like partially blame Carlos. Honestly Carlos probably helped more people avoid the scam than any single watchdog. Just because, when you put someone that crazy on your own stage... I think he probably made at least SOME people reconsider investing in bitconnect. Just off of insanity alone.Imagine if instead of him they did the same vague bullshit presentations that crypto noobs fall for today. Just talking techno babble and finding numerical ways that they can sell people on bitconnect. I feel like more people would have fallen for a reasoned / professional presentation, even if it was still scammy. Where as a guy screaming and talking about how his wife says it's a scam raises red flags even to people that were dumb enough to get caught up in bitconnect.
3	1523856489	18	Someone sent me a video of Carlos and after watching it I instantly knew that connect was a scam lol. 
4	1523879999	11	Those bitconnect presentations looked like some Scientology shit. Way too shady to not see the red flags.
5	1523890524	6	Yeah, it was like Amway 2.0 on that stage
3	1523892858	1	People who are going to invest in bitconnect are absolutely going to be taken in by someone like Matos. The target isn‚Äôt someone who looks for red flags or analyzes critically, it‚Äôs someone who sees people projecting success and energy and thinks ‚ÄúI want that.‚Äù  It‚Äôs why all ponzis and MLMs they have presentations like that. A professional presentation will make rational thinkers look into it more, a hype convention will make emotional actors buy right away. 
3	1523894230	1	Never thought of it this way, but you're exactly right.
3	1523900362	1	You're a genius hahaha
2	1523840513	77	This is the only 100% correct comment in this entire thread. Well done
2	1523850550	14	Kinda wish he was my dad 
3	1523859159	12	Your mom would be so happy if he started to put ten thousand dollars a day on her, right on her, y‚Äôknow on her table...
4	1523897665	1	I remember being a small child, he would yell "bitconnnneecttttt" from the other bedroom and I never knew why.  Now I understand how I came to exist
3	1523851418	17	wasawasawasa!?
3	1523871192	5	So, you are telling me you wished Carlos Matos had fucked your mother? Absolute lad.
2	1523894178	1	so shilling a scam is ok?i get that his awkward screams are funny and stuff but this does not change the fact that he promoted a criminal entity. what if he shot some people on stage while making funny sounds? is that going to be fine as well?
1	1523844531	37	Don't speak ill of Based Carlos Matos from New York
2	1523844723	18	Sunrock is flying to New York to meet his partner ü§î
3	1523848481	16	He's probably actually flying out of the country to get ready for this exit. 
3	1523855420	6	That would be a HUGE partnership for sure... It would meet all the things sunrock claimed about the 'mystery partnership'. And it's about the only partner I can possibly imagine that would ever only cost 75m xvg (chump change to any actual big company) to get on-board / secure as a partner.
2	1523845430	2	üòÇ 
1	1523854707	18	WASU WASU WASU WASU WASU Financially independently ,  verge make me 100 and... 1,500 dollars a day. 
1	1523876403	3	Haha poor Carlos will be sadly forgotten after Sunerok tries to pull this off with everyone watching in anticipation. You will always have a place in my heart Carlos!
2	1523876577	4	‚ÄúThe world is no longer the way it used to be, nonono‚Äù -Carlos Matos

1	1523840560	0	[deleted]
2	1523848290	8	Mmh, No no no
0	1523838136	34	I don't think it is the next Bitconnect, but what they've been doing is suspicious. I would not invest anything personally.
1	1523854067	20	Anyone that's been in the last month should probably just get out anyway. 160% gain in a month is good enough for me lol. Taking my winnings and getting the fuck out.
2	1523858138	14	I agree it‚Äôs just another shit coin that pumped and it dumped
0	1523833753	52	... wait a minute. What exactly is the privacy this XVG is supposed to deliver? Presumably it doesn't cover people tracing the payments out of the fundraising wallet and into binance? 
1	1523838574	-35	The privacy is optional. They weren't trying to hide the fact they were moving the funds... probably cuz they're using for it's intended purpose
2	1523839219	49	Yeah, their intent to exit scam a bit easier
2	1523855651	24	The privacy doesn't exist. Like... it's not actual privacy... There's no protocol for it yet. The fact that every transaction can still be traced makes it inherently, not a privacy coin.
2	1523839401	31	If it's optional then it's not true privacy and all transactions can be traced.
3	1523839903	22	Verge didn't even implement actually private optional privacy. A real example of working opt-in privacy would be PIVX (I heard they planned to transition to opt-out privacy, or privacy by default). Last I heard, all Verge did was route your IP through TOR or something and used  the Wraith Protocol (fancy name for stealth addresses).
4	1523840741	19	XMR has had stealth addresses (disposable addresses that send to your original wallet) for years.
5	1523840844	15	That's what made this project stink of a scam long before this. They haven't really ever done an original thing. Vertcoin even had this functionality until they had to take it out and never got to implementing it again (although they don't focus on privacy so I can see why it isn't a priority).
3	1523847403	3	Why can all tx be traced if some aren't private?
3	1523843853	6	Zcash is built similarly with optional privacy. It could work but if you want your transactions private, why be on a traceable network?
4	1523850467	9	Stealth addresses and zksnarks can't really be compared. Zero knowledge proofs allow you to hide the sending and receiving addresses as well as the transaction amount, so it's basically impossible to trace a transaction using them. Stealth addresses on the other hand only hide the receiver's address so you need something like mandatory ringct to hide transaction amounts and make it virtually untraceable. 
3	1523843446	-6	I think u should look up the definition of optional
4	1523846677	2	Right

1	1523834417	20	/r/vergeconnect
2	1523891143	4	My wife still doesn‚Äôt believe this subreddit exists
1	1523833698	1	came here to post this
0	1523834168	25	Not an outright scam, but definitely hyped and pumped
1	1523855104	17	The dev is clearly not clever enough for an exit scam.
1	1523886615	7	No it is an outright scam. There is no announcement lol. NO REPUTABLE company would partner with a shitcoin and developer who has already been arrested 8 times. Clearly scamming for donations. Even ledger posted on Twitter that they are NOT working with verge. Get your head out of your asses.
0	1523873536	27	**We had to cancel the pre-announced partnersip because of the following reasons:*** The continuous bad press on reddit has made community members uneasy and created a lack of confidence in Verge currency.* We have received two letters from Mc Donald and KFC. They say the partnership was just some sort of a bad joke.* Outside forces have performed DDos attacks on platform several times and have made it clear that these will continue. These interruptions in service have made the platform unstable and have created more panic inside the community.
0	1523857362	18	[removed]
1	1523858962	9	It would be much smarter to just under-deliver or lie. The price might retrace heavily and then the same people will pump it next cycle. 
1	1523882366	1	This. It totally reminds me of the vaporware BS from Litecoin earlier this year. Two payment processors (LitePal/LitePay) that were supposed to be game-changers but were DOA, and Charlie Lee‚Äôs super-hyped ‚Äúhuge unexpected surprise‚Äù being a complete letdown.
0	1523851342	7	That famous quote about all news story titles being answered with "no", just found an exception to the rule. 
0	1523855651	16	lol all the devs have sold their coins ... turned all you guys into bagholders .... this has bitconnect exit scam written all over it.
1	1523886385	10	Then they asked for the coins back, so they could dump them again lol 
0	1523869986	3	Even after that was written and should at the very least make people rethink their affiliation with Verge, the comment section just says, "Meh meh FUD, meh."Ledger doesn't even charge for integration anymore apparently so why the hell was there a fundraiser to pay for something that no longer costs anything? Why was all that verge moved to a binance account if it never needed to be raised in the first place? These are questions that holders need to ask themselves. If you just go along with what everyone else is saying/thinking, you're probably going to assume the same fate as them. And once the founders are out, confidence in the project is gone.
1	1523878610	2	Even IF they could pay Ledger, over 1 Mio. ‚Ç¨ are way more than the 150 000 Ledger wanted before
2	1523879534	2	Lol, yes just a tad. 
0	1523893617	3	I don't have a dog in this fight but for the sake of crypto I hope this doesn't end up being a scam. 
0	1523847959	6	Quick TLDR the main issues surrounding Verge? Thanks!
1	1523856306	34	- Copyright breaking- promising privacy while being completely traceable- dev amateur who downplays heavy exploits, needs to be pointed to an accidentally hardfork he did, gets angry at those publishing the exploit- almost no github activity, single dev, 50% of Wraith protocol as the last main feature plagiarism while claiming having invented it...And more. there is always more ;D
2	1523856968	14	Not to mention that not even a few weeks back their github was a broken uncompliling mess, got banned from verge sub when I tried to ask what was happening with it. 
3	1523860234	10	Even if there is a partnership the next big shit show will be RingCT implementation. There is another crypto who actually did implement a RingCT version onto Bitcoins codebase, which is currently under auditing by professionals. sunerok is not able to develop this on his own, the cryptonote implementations should not work, the other crypto had the first raw implementation for testing a year ago. Since from the first look the other crypto looks WAY MORE professional developed in no way we will see secure RingCT on Verge in the next year.Edit: coin I am talking about: Particl. Just compare the githubs to see what actual development looks like (see "Insights" for code quantity etc.).
4	1523877482	3	It's Particl, why would you remove the name? There's a difference from DYOR and actual references.
5	1523877886	2	It was a bit more text than only source. But you are right. I will edit it again into the comment.
2	1523884458	3	Wraith protocol isn't actually even a protocol, it's basically stealth addresses and indeed mostly plagerized. Funny thing even, is that their bug fix to latest attack was also copied from other coins. Supernova pool closed it's Verge mining because the devs are too incompetent, even they choose integrity over money since Verge was their most profitable pool.
2	1523856332	2	Thank you! :)
2	1523886504	2	Wait, am i mistaken but isn't there tons of activity on their Github? vergecurrency.com Updated 13 hours ago electrum-xvg-tor Updated a day ago VERGE Updated 2 days ago
3	1523888084	2	You have to look what is being updated there. And compared to actively developed cryptocurrency this activity is a joke. This is maintenance mode while you would expect thousands of lines of code, because RingCT and smart contracts and stuff are announced.For example the electrum-xvg-tor activity was an update to the readme file ;)
1	1523856826	7	TLDR would be paragraphs in itself
1	1523853037	3	TLDR: too many things to list... i'll just say they are shit
0	1523872479	6	Please say the partnership is Carlos I would buy if that happens
0	1523873902	6	Enough is enough, this is like what? The 10th thread 
0	1523887760	2	I doubt they are that of a scam, but the project is not advancing at all.
0	1523891234	2	I don't know why people still believe in this shitcoin after all the stuff that has happened lately. It's really alarming the number of inconsistencies they are having.
0	1523892576	2	Anyone else think that 30BTC buy wall at 1000 sats might just disappear in...oh...say 22 hours 30 minutes?
0	1523882262	3	I am really looking forward to see the comments in this sub tomorrow :D
0	1523860242	2	Do they have Carlos?
1	1523862665	6	Thats the partnership being announced tomorrow!
1	1523892287	1	Hey hey HEYYY!!!
0	1523860250	2	MMM... MMM.. NO NO NO
0	1523861099	2	Well bitconnect is amazing soooooooooo
0	1523832351	3	It's BitConnect 2.0
0	1523878974	2	No of course not. Verge is going to get into a solid partnership in the next 24 hours. The leasest what you could do is respect the fact that they have upon that time to announce it.
1	1523886559	0	There is no announcement lol. NO REPUTABLE company would partner with a shitcoin and developer who has already been arrested 8 times. Clearly scamming for donations. Even ledger posted on Twitter that they are NOT working with verge. Get your head out of your asses.
0	1523881124	0	Dude I can't stop popping into that sub just to see the luncacy and denial.  There are rare moments when I almost stop being amused and take pity.  Then I remember how stupid you have to be to have been duped by Verge for this long after all the shit that's happened.    Verge is a cult, not a coin and I have no sympathy for them. 
1	1523883613	3	I'm banned, but still like to read their incredible delusion. They really believe this is it, and no amount of logic or reason could dissuade them.
0	1523856552	1	Yes

0	1523886717	1	Lol @ the verge cultist comments on the article
0	1523887562	1	It can't be the next BitConnect. I don't see any Carlos Matos on their side.
0	1523888108	1	So excited for the partnership announcement with bitconnect tmw!!
0	1523888303	1	we will know for sure tomorrow!!
0	1523889181	1	Why is it so hard for people to not buy something suspicious? There are red flags everywhere yet people can‚Äôt leave verge alone... amazing 
0	1523895601	1	Well only one more day to see if they actually live up to this hype. I've been doubtful from the start 
0	1523864055	2	Does anyone knows a place to short XVG?
0	1523854539	1	Verge would be Bit Connect 6.0 There's been other bitconnects so far lol. 
0	1523858752	1	It is already proved many times that it is worser than bitconnect. People should have escaped this long ago. There are many red flags
0	1523881524	1	Keep buying that Dogecoin Dark aka Verge and Tron  dummies.
0	1523841801	-4	I don't think the ppl in verge ment to mess this up.  I don't think scamming was their intention.  It's just a coin that sucks and got pumped WAY higher than it should be.  
0	1523859858	0	Verge looks and acts like a scam at the moment. But the community is huge! So what happens when the verge dev exit scams? Looks like he sold his donation funds, so the coins are still in circulation. Another dev could pick this coin up and proceed. Probably a massive dip, but the project, and the community can continue this coin or am I missing something?
0	1523865697	0	Verge is a shitcoin because they never deliver to time. I'm invested in verge but am out as soon as the announcement is made (I don't even care if it is with Facebook. It isn't!!!). I just don't trust them with managing anything properly. Keeping my eyes close to the market as if it isn't a monumental partnership tomorrow it's dumping hard!! 
1	1523886542	2	There is no announcement lol. NO REPUTABLE company would partner with a shitcoin and developer who has already been arrested 8 times. Clearly scamming for donations. Even ledger posted on Twitter that they are NOT working with verge. Get your head out of your asses.
2	1523886861	2	8 times in one county, over 30 times in total. Seems like a guy I would want to trust with my money. 
3	1523897676	1	To be fair you could be arrested a million times but still have a great mind (not saying Justin has one by any means) There will be a partnership it will just be shit as no reputable brand will touch verge when there are better non privacy coins available. I have a few thousand XVG so taking profits tomorrow 
4	1523902337	1	Hey as long as you are in the green, I ain't knocking. But yeah, I think even calling XVG a privacy coin at all is a big stretch. Way better options out there. 
3	1523887577	1	Lol! I didn't see the other records.
0	1523859239	-4	its most likely gonna be a fake "partnership" like we saw with vechain/bmw. People who rode the pump will dump and bagholders will be left with tears.Its ridiculous to create such a hype about an announcement in the first place.
1	1523860459	2	Lol what? Vechain‚Äôs partnership is not fake, BMW confirmed it from their end..
2	1523873897	5	These are not "partnerships" in legitimate handshake business deal sense. Its kind of like saying you are doing a partnership with youtube when all you have is a youtube channel with ads enabled. If you had a YT channel with ads enabled, then congratulations! you are in a YouTube Partner Program(YPP)!
2	1523865852	4	Not really a partnership, just buying data off them.
2	1523860649	4	https://twitter.com/BMWUSA/status/976149675861458944confirmed i guess
0	1523832039	-3	Does a bear ish in the woods?
0	1523845149	-2	Let's move to http://Bytecoin.org
1	1523847888	4	 Boy, bytecoin is just as much a scam as verge, just in the shady and manipulative sense instead of the hyped exit scam sense
2	1523852321	0	Didn't monero fork off of bytecoin?
3	1523874442	2	It did not. Bitmonero was a fork of the CryptoNote Codebase which later was taken away from the guy that run it "thankful_for_today" and taken over by the community to the thing we call "Monero" now
3	1523857352	2	Yes it did, because the tech was legit but the Bytecoin people premined 80% of the supply. It was forked in to several projects in the time between then and now. The most known and serious one being Monero, which is pretty much the only project with actual development of the tech. There was a lot of flaws in the Bytecoin code that Monero fixed and they also added new features like RingCT and a bunch of other stuff. Most of the cryptonote coins just copied these features off of Monero. Bytecoin still didn't fix any flaws or add any new features and is only used as a pump and dump. Monero is also one of the very few CN coins with zero premine.

0	1523862485	0	Craig write isn't a Bitcoin core developer! You need to actually commit in the Bitcoin core GitHub to be one. He's not even a real developer. Read Satoshi's writings and you can tell he knew his shit, didn't plagarize, and didn't indulge in an iota of technobable.
1	1523867032	0	You know... Before Elon musk landed those rockets even NASA probably thought it was dumb idea that was going to fail.The problem with people like you is: you jump on the hype train when it's already too late. If you had met Satoshi on a forum somewhere back in 2009 you would have laughed at him just as you laugh at iota üòÇ."People who say it cannot be done should not interrupt those who are doing it." 
0	1523883698	0	i will be not surprised if there is a shitty announcement and the prise will rise like crazy nonetheless
0	1523865341	-5	I mean people seem mad they didn't get on the verge pump..the whole game here is to accmulate BTC.
1	1523884664	1	Soooo basically it isn't shit because it makes me money?
2	1523884978	0	Yes, that's the whole point.Suprised coming from you since u have a trader role.I guess u get emotionally invested into coins i don't. I sell at pumps and look for the next coin suckers get invested into.
3	1523887846	-1	What a mentality, you where in Bitconnect too than I assume? Always a bigger sucker yes?
4	1523888771	2	Nah take a look at my history i was in Stellite at 1 sats sold at 20-25 sats and made 60kSold 4 million raven at 700-900 sats and made 160k in the past 2 months mining.and you? How's ur Ethereum and Monero doing? lolI guess ur the H-h-h-odler type.. lolHave fun believing in the "tech" while i make the gains.
5	1523891438	1	Lol, I'm a trader yes. Point being enough to be make in decent projects as well. I do believe in the tech, if you don't I feel the crypto space is becoming more of a joke each day. Fyi, those gains don't impress me either, doing the same with decent projects without having to fear one might drop to 0 ;)
1	1523866786	-1	This... But nobody seems to understand this üò£
0	1523832007	-35	No
1	1523832141	21	Ok verge shill, what about all of this doesn‚Äôt at least look suspicious? There‚Äôs been a lot of claims by both sides, but not much proof. What makes you so sure? Even putting aside the scam claims, does none of this make you wonder?I also see /r/vergecurrency has attempted to downvote everything, not working out too well for you guys is it? Good projects can refute criticism, bad projects suppress it
2	1523832425	10	I got one proof why would token pay donate over 80% and get ripped off? Lawsuits will be shooting through the air if it is an exit scam from investors being lied too and Justin scamming people on false claims. It‚Äôs two days left, so grab popcorn and watch the titanic part 2 of charts happen or watch a moon shoot. At this moment Justin is flying to NYC for the partnership and a special announcement is coming on the 16th.
3	1523832982	16	Because the crowdfund was not even close. The "vergefam" investors got up to like 18 mil out of 75 million the day before the dead line date.Justins an advisor or whatever for TP. So the founder of TP and Justin are buddy buddy.  If TP volunteered to donate a good amount (which Justin can just give back to them since they're friends) and make it seem like the 75 million goal was actually achievable, they can get more real "vergefam" to cough up some more.Would you be more likely to donate to something that was 20% close to the main goal a day before a deadline,or something that was 90% to the main goal one day before the deadline?
3	1523838906	10	He can announce any shitty partnership (e.g. TokenPay) and he would be off the hook, from a legal perspective. He could also say that he had a partnership lined up but it just didn't work out because of xyz. It also would be hard to say he was "scamming people" because he's not promising any financial returns on investment like Bitconnect did. He created a software product --> people bought it hoping it would become popular --> it doesn't quite work out the way he hoped (for various business ressons, etc.) --> and Justin closes shop and takes any remaining funds with him, just like any other failed business. He has no obligation to pay anyone back their money or actually create a successful business because most businesses fail anyway. He may not exit right after the crappy announcement on 4/17 (in order to keep up the appearance that he's still "working on Verge"), but he'll be able to leave eventually.  Question is, how will xvg diehards react to this eventual heartbreak?
4	1523849874	4	That is the exit. 
3	1523847403	4	And what kind of relationship does Justin have with Tokenpay?https://medium.com/@TokenPay/verge-lead-developer-is-the-tokenpay-blockchain-auditor-274d82b4f54bTokenpay certainly doesn't seem like a neutral party to me...And no. Neither Justin or Tokenpay would necessarily be subject to lawsuits. You'll still have all your XVGs after a potential exit. It's just that when the wash traders leave there won't be any buyers for you to sell. Wash trading is ofcourse illegal in the real markets, but this is crypto and regulations doesn't exist. Justin isn't obligated to continue the project. He can sell and take all donation funds and move to Mexico or whatever. Verge isn't a ponzi scheme and won't be subject to the same lawsuits as Bitconnect.Verge was basically worthless in early december. Wraith announcement caused the climb. We were promised "seperate private ledger" (which would actually be a worthwhile achievement).  This is STILL a claim in their whitepaper and is STILL a straigth up LIE.What did we get? Ripped off stealthadresses from Opalcoin. Basically no more privacy than the subadresses used in Bitcoin. That is SOOOOO far from the original announcement that it's not even worth to even discuss. 
4	1523848712	1	Agree but again tokenpay is risking their money on this partnership and their projects credibility.I think you miss understand the lawsuits, from my eyes tokenpay and the investors would push lawsuits on verge was an exit scam.How this is gonna play out, is buy the rumor sell the news, but seems like people already sold the fud, so it could turn into a massive pump and dump, or choice C, it just goes up, but I‚Äôm leaning towards pump and dump depending on the partnership, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúbiggest‚Äù one ever is what got me confused.The problem with why fud is so high was first jeliously, then the community acting like kids on their community pages which is causing them to look like a laughing stalk, but hey I give them the benefit of the doubt and will see what sats are tomorrow. I expect low volume till the 16th 10am est on verge 
5	1523851063	5	What I am claiming is that TokenPay and Verge is not necessarily two different entities. It would be like suing yourself. Though I can't prove this claim.But jealosly? For why and what? Verge is not some exclusive club, Anyone can sell their current bags and buy XVG if they believe in the project. What's there to be jealous about?The first major FUD wave (as you call it) came with the announcement of wraith and the promise of "separate private ledger". These "Fudders" made claims that this was not achievable in the time promised. No code was accessable on github and no public testnet was available.You have to understand that a coin with two ledgers is a MASSIVE undertaking and would (if it was true) be worth a solid investment. But it's also something that would have to be tested for months before release.Litterly no one knew what Wraith even was until **AFTER** it was released untested on mainnet. And what did we get? Fucking stealth adresses ripped from opalcoin. Not only was it a copypaste job, but Sunerok didn't even bother changing "Opalcoin" to "Verge" in the code messages. Litterly all of /r/cryptocurrency called it out and got "LOL FUD" as reply. So pointing out ovious and massive **LIES** in a projects whitepaper is FUD?
6	1523851068	3	Hey, ZaiRoX, just a quick heads-up:  **seperate** is actually spelled **separate**. You can remember it by **-par- in the middle**.  Have a nice day!^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
7	1523851630	1	delete
6	1523852556	0	I do agree verge and tokenpay are partners/on some kind of level like that, but it is possible that financial they are separate and if things go south I‚Äôm sure tokenpay can sue Justin since he‚Äôs the face of verge, but we will see how this will play outJealously, as perspective nobody really thought xvg would meet the donations, but they did and price skyrocketed, so the fud attacks began. So money on some but not all investors have people mad.I didn‚Äôt know about that on wraith protocol, all I know it was released, but lack of PR since Justin sucks at it and has gotten better during this run, xvg crashed cause of a bug along with other coins bring better news, it was selling off. Yet during this bear market updates have been made and this ‚Äúpartner‚Äù and tokenpay sees value in verge and the wraith protocol over the other privacy coins.I‚Äôm not saying verge is the best, but it‚Äôs good to point out facts like the tweet ledger posted saying xvg did contact them and they did give pricing but they updated their platform so you don‚Äôt need it. How could you miss it? Well google what it cost to integrate your crypto currency to ledger...it‚Äôs nowhere you have to call them or email them, so simple mistake. Plus the xvg wallet is held by the ‚Äúpartner‚Äù And lol to the bot
3	1523832529	3	Fair enough. Either way, it‚Äôs bound to be interesting. With all the strange things the verge dev has done, I‚Äôd be impressed and amazed if it‚Äôs legit. If it‚Äôs legit he has a weird way of showing itWith crypto around, it‚Äôs never a bad time to long popcorn
4	1523835588	2	I have a feeling the partnership is legit, but poorly handled...  But, how overhyped is it?  I don't think it's going to wow people like they want.
2	1523835672	1	If you want to talk about downvoting.The top post made last night by dev was pretty high in upvotes.I noticed it plummeted in minutes, so I just kept hitting refresh and laughing my ass off thinking how lame /cc is for coming over just to attempt downvoting a post to oblivion.I‚Äôm usually on the fence and just read through the coins I find interesting, but I‚Äôm going to have to sayYou guys sure know how to make fudder fodder
3	1523835811	5	Don‚Äôt look at me, I was asleep.  I might not be positive on verge, but I respect other projects, their subreddit and their posts. That‚Äôs their business. Downvoting verge supporters would make me just as bad as them downvoting those who are negative. If I think that verge shouldn‚Äôt suppress criticism, I have no right to suppress its praise. (Just to clarify, respecting other projects doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt talk shit, just that I won‚Äôt go around downvoting in waves. I also won‚Äôt seek out supporters to attack, but I‚Äôll refute points if i feel something is worth replying to and explaining my view)
