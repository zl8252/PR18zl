0	1523893296	90	This list is complete overkill for anyone with 4, maybe even low 5 figures worth of crypto holdings
1	1523899627	9	Well that's good to know! 
1	1523900090	5	I don't know.    I'm doing everything on this list with the exception of 32 character passwords (most services don't permit one that long).  I'm not doing these things specifically for cryptocurrency security, but for digital/online security in general.  Most of these things are set-and-forget, once you do the initial configuration.  I use LastPass to create and use highly complex unique passwords for all my logins (129 accounts/logins total).  I use two factor authentication on every service that permits it (including LastPass itself, via a physical token I carry).    I do all my browsing from behind VPN.  I have anti keylogging installed on my machine.  My crypto is all on Ledger and my keys are on paper in a safe.    My cell service provider has a pass phrase on file required for porting my number.  The SD Card in my phone is encrypted.  My phone locks immediately and requires retina, fingerprint or a highly complex password to open.  My individual apps are PIN protected.  I have several services configured for "find my phone" with remote wipe capability.  I have credit monitoring, and I have alerts configured for different transaction events.  I added a rider policy for identity theft insurance to my homeowner's policy.
1	1523902263	1	indeed!that list is for bigger amounts of money!
1	1523903702	1	How is it? A 32 word password with random digits is essential and a 10 character one won't do 
1	1523903880	1	It's overkill for 99.9999% of anyone investing in crypto! :>Guns, pepper spray, baseball bats, metal rods, knuckle sandwhiches... whatever it fucking takesFucking roflcopter ... 
0	1523889945	696	This could also be a list of why mass adoption will be nearly impossible.
1	1523890796	191	Exactly what I was thinking. The list makes sense, but I don't see my aunt doing these things. If these are the things you need to do to keep your money safe, the public isn't going to get their money out of the banks and start to use crypto to do all their daily shopping.
2	1523897130	21	Whoever solves this problem and makes DLT's accessible to your aunt is going to become very wealthy.The solution will probably be straightforward (i.e. elegant) and obvious in hindsight.
3	1523902638	3	Kind of hard to solve when there are so many back-doors purposefully built into OS and hardware by state actors that can be easily compromised by them or private actors.  Kind of hard to solve when you hand over all privacy rights to every single app and software agreement that allow access to everything on our devices.Kind of hard to solve when every printer you use to make a paper wallet has a wifi and possibly a memory of everything you've ever printed (for official investigations of course).  You'll have to destroy every printer you use every time you make a new wallet.Kind of hard to solve when the biggest casinos can be hacked through their fish tank temperature monitors.Kind of hard to solve when zero day hacks are sold to the highest bidders in massive worldwide conferences.Yeah I'd say that if there is a solution that can be used on every phone and pc than you'll be super rich.  Otherwise you have to design the hardware and software from the ground up.
2	1523895682	10	I am that aunt and you are 100% correct. Mass adoption won’t happen until aunties everywhere can understand this SH*#
2	1523892397	84	This is exactly what kept me from investing in Bitcoin back when it was at $100. This is the most glaring issue with cryptocurrencies and mass adoption.
3	1523895016	211	Phew, thank god you dodged that bullet 
3	1523894363	39	U fucked up son
3	1523894313	15	Me too sadly 
3	1523897573	8	Me telling my grandma about crypto -> “buy some fucking brass knuckles, grandma, there’s wolves out here.” edit: spelling 
3	1523897501	3	Since its still as issue are you keeping funds on coinbase?
3	1523896172	5	You must be kicking yourself. Could've kept it on blockchain.info at least.
4	1523897610	24	I too had seriously considered it at $230, but I don't really care that much. If you look at the world through a "what if I did/didn't... " perspective, then you'll never be satisfied.   
5	1523898663	9	That's the right attitude. 
5	1523899828	0	Which 230? Before or after the 2nd 2013 bubble?
6	1523900613	2	after it dropped from 1k
7	1523900901	0	So you had seen it could go to 1K. That it was possible. You didn't think it would happen again? Especially after halvings?
8	1523902781	2	Reasons.    Look at my earlier comment and you'll know how I think about it... It has happened, and there's no reason to keep kicking myself over it. 
4	1523898980	3	It doesn't really bother me much. You can't look at it under that light. Investing is like playing poker, just because that 2, 7 hand you folded ended up being the nuts, doesn't mean they were good cards that should have been played. Hindsight is 20/20, and I still stand by my decision at the time. It's the people who invested early and used 1000 bitcoin to buy pizza that I feel bad for...
3	1523902489	2	Same here. It literally seemed like alien technology to me until Coinbase got me going and then I slowly dove deeper and deeper into more complex stuff. But, private keys and blockchain explorers are seriously intimidating when you aren't yet tech savvy. 
3	1523897490	1	>This is exactly what kept me from investing in Bitcoin back when it was at $100You obviously made the right decision. 
3	1523897494	1	hold this L for not taking risks. But hey you cant get hacked without anything to hack for. 
3	1523902567	1	$100 !? I was gonna drop a grand in at $0.80, but would have needed to wire some random dude money over the internet. No thanks. Now I send money to anyone asking for it over the internet, hoping it turns into the next BTC! 
2	1523894665	3	This list does not make sense. Its totally blown out of proportion. Do you do the same with every other security aspect on your live? No? Man... your fucked. /s
3	1523898249	3	No because someone else does it all for you in a regulated market.
4	1523898663	1	What!? Who takes care that I used a strong password to unlock my phone?Who takes care that I dont store my PIN right next to my credit card!? This list is a joke. If that dude would have followed rule Nr1: Hardware Wallet, he would still have his ETH. This fuck up was just pure laziness on his side. Plus him telling everybody every day that it is very much worth it to hack him. 
5	1523899123	1	If your phone is stolen most network providers can lock it and locate it for you, if your pin is stolen you can call your credit card company to reverse the charges.  There is systems in place to help mitigate damages that dont exist in crypto, you are your only line of security.Also from what i was reading earlier the "hack" is looking more like a tax evasion scheme and the guy still has possession of his assets.  This could be wrong of course, its just the current theory. 
6	1523900924	1	I get where you are coming from. And I think I agree with you on the most parts. I also think that crypto has a long way to go for mass adoption, especially on the user friendly side. But I still think the list OP provided is blown out of proportion. It might be a good practice but IMHO not necessary to be a protected crypto investor. Hardware Wallet and you are good to go. About this "hack". If it wasnt a hack, then what are we even talking about? Why this scary scary, be affraid post?
2	1523891501	10	There are still people who won't use email... those people fall behind in life.
3	1523891673	19	Well, sure, but you have to admit this is a long list of things to take care off compared to just storing your money in a bank and it being relatively safe. If the purpose of cryptocurrency is to eventually replace regular currency, this aspect will need some work. How many people would be willing to do all these things or accept that their money is now less safe than when it was in the bank?
4	1523894704	-2	This is like arguing why would anyone go to the hassle of buying a computer, install intenet, download an email client just to send mail when regular post is much more convenient. We are a far way off mass adoption. And when we get there, we will realize that thinking the purpose of crypto currency is to replace regular currency is like thinking the purpose of the internet is to replace post mail.
5	1523895188	4	No, it's not. The internet is used for a lot more that just sending messages, and there is no alternative for the internet. However, crypto isn't the same. You have to create a wallet, buy bitcoin, sell the bitcoin and buy the coin you want on an exchange, then move that money to the wallet. And that's just to get hold of it. Then you've got all the security measures listed above. Look, I'm not saying things wont improve with time. I'm sure they will. But to compare the internet to bitcoin when it comes to being unnecessarily complicated to set up is just overall a bad comparison.
6	1523895631	0	Ok, go back 20 years and see how easy it is for someone to set up the internet. It would be impossible for any normal person, you have to hire an 'internet professional', not to mention buying a computer. When the internet came out, noone had a clue what it was going to be used for. No one could have predicted the level of integration we see today. It is the same with cryptocurrencies right now. People just think it's 'online money'. 
7	1523896976	3	What? I was around for the mass adoption of the internet. 20 years ago. AOL made things plug and play. The first mainstream applications was ordering Pizza Hut. Plenty of people predicted that the internet would readily be adopted into everything... Which is had been. 
8	1523898352	1	No noone knew that kids would be spending their lives on social media, it was a completely unpredictable outcome. Things like streaming tv shows was completely impossible.
9	1523900767	1	What? What future dystopia doesn't have people spending time in the holo deck? It was 1996 when the protocol for 2GB file sharing was formalized. Usenet was (and sadly, only sort of is) the real deal for media consumption. Just like crypto, only a small number of people thought about or predicted these things, but it wasn't anything that was exceptionally difficult. Predicting the future is a straight forward combination of picking the right assumptions and mapping out every consequence of those assumptions. The hard part is doing both.
7	1523897497	1	It's like you didn't read the first sentence of the second paragraph...
7	1523897946	1	You have to go back 25 years for that. 20 years ago, a majority of people in my country in Europe had internet access, and installing it at home had long ceased to be difficult.Adoption of the internet was crazy fast. That is a very bad sign for crypto, actually. It's been around for ten years and the general adoption is still very, very low.
8	1523899347	1	The internet has been around for much longer than 25 years. You’d have to go back to the early 80’s to compare to where we are today with crypto. Adoption takes time. 
7	1523897987	1	That’s not true in the slightest.  I lived through it. It was very easy to get going and everyone knew it would take over the world. It was painfully obvious. 
8	1523899432	1	Yeah! Right. Easy breazy... my grandma was all over plug and play internet. You are in crypto, just like you were into internet. You seam like a tek guy. So how can you tell from your perspective how complicated or easy internet was back then for the average guy.For me crypto is also just as easy as plug and play AOL. So according to your comparison we should be out of the woods with crypto.
9	1523902371	1	Grandmas still struggle with the Internet today I wasn’t a tech guy at age 12 in the mid 90s but I still figured it out. This was before we had AOL too. 
7	1523899143	1	Not sure why you are beeing downvoted. Seems like lots of people dont know what they are investing in.
5	1523897971	1	People didn't mass adopt computers until it was a lot more user friendly. Aka windows 95 and after. So, crypto needs to get to that Windows 95 milestone. Then mass adoption will start,and prices will probably sky rocket. 
4	1523898040	0	Your bank account can be hacked, your credit cards can be stolen in many of the same ways as your crypto can be stolen. The only difference is in crypto its possible to have a more complete control over points of weakness.
5	1523898216	2	This is all covered and insured by your bank so you would get it all back. Crypto has no insurance. 
6	1523903264	1	“All” - Are you sure about that? The amount covered depends on where you are.
4	1523893797	-9	No matter how you look at it, Crypto is way safer then a bank. You hear about a few hacks and you think it’s not safe? Those people are at fault for doing something to make them susceptible. Obviously it needs work but it will happen within the coming years.
5	1523894021	17	But my money is insured at the bank...
6	1523894165	-7	Yea it’s ensured to drop 2% of its value every year it sits there 
7	1523894332	10	First: I get a guaranteed 2% return on my savings.  Really, talking about dropping in value?  If you bought in 6 months ago you're down a lot more than 2% lol.
8	1523895421	3	just curious, which bank gives guaranteed 2% return?
9	1523895632	3	hsbc, one of their savings accounts.  Might only be for advance members tho not sure.(advance is having at least 25k in accounts or invested with them)
8	1523895055	5	If you bought 6 months ago, you are significantly up. If you bought 12 months ago, you are up 600%. Now if you bought 4 months ago, you lost money. 
9	1523895187	6	And in 4 more months I could be down another 90% or up 1000% with cyrpto - its literally a roll of the dice where a small handful of of whales can load the dice anyway they want.Meanwhile I will know exactly how much money I'll have in the bank in 4 months with zero fear of it not being there because I left my bankcard on the bus.
7	1523898046	1	Only if you are an idiot about it 
5	1523894638	6	Once we move towards mass adoption, regulations will allow for companies that will manage and protect your asset for you, much like banks and brokers.
6	1523895309	3	Exactly, that’s not a concern. It will be developed as it’s needed. As it becomes available to use more widely, innovations and efficiencies will pave the way.
6	1523895526	3	 Yep this, it will open up a whole new era of services.
5	1523894024	4	I'm not too concerned myself, just thinking for the average Joe. To the larger public this all still sounds very complicated and not safer than banks (even if you argue that it is). Once things get more accesible, and I believe it will over time, the average Joe's will start thinking about using this stuff.
5	1523894111	5	I tried looking at it. I still don't see it.
6	1523894184	0	Try harder
7	1523896613	1	I know there’s a lot of youngins with tinfoil hats in crypto, but wait until your credit card gets lost, or stolen, or you misstype your account number in a transaction, or there’s an unrecognized recurring payment, and see what happens with your money in a bank vs your crypto wallet.  If banks were like crypto, I would have lost about $25k to theft/banking errors by now.  Meanwhile, in my 5 months in crypto, I’ve already had (or almost had) money stolen due to at least 3 different hacks, which I’ll never get back.
5	1523895604	0	crypto is not safer than a bank.  say you buy something online and someone rips you off and you paid in crypto...how are you going to get your money back?  you arent.  i think you are misusing 'ownership' as 'safer'
6	1523896151	2	Smart contracts. The whole point they exist.  Even if they didn’t exist, mimicking current banking procedures and standards with a crypto backbone would be 100x better and simple
7	1523897642	1	The whole point is that smart contracts don't really exists, if we by that mean "for anything remotely usable in everyday life", which is really the only criteria relevant for mass adoption.If I want to buy a pair of shoes, there are all kinds of safeguards and recourses for me as a consumer. I have never in my life lost a single cent to bank fraud, credit card theft, hacking or anything like that.Out of the three friends I have who are involved in crypto and about whom I know any details, all three have had crypto stolen, lost or hacked. You are free to believe that at some distant point in the future, this wll be safer than the current banking system. But we sure as hell are not there now, not even remotely.
8	1523898379	1	What I’m saying is that those are not hard issues to solve.  They will as adoption increases and regulations are made.Having your crypto stolen, lost, or hacked is 100% avoidable. That’s on them.
7	1523897752	1	im not disagreeing with you in terms of whats possible, im saying that right now, banks are safer.  you would have to be pretty pompous or extremely dumb to say otherwise.  ill give two examples:1) if you buy something and receive something different, your bank will credit your account and investigate for you.  if the same scenario happened with me using a crypto, id be shit out of luck.  yes i know, smart contracts, blah blah blah.  unfortunately, the current state of this technology is not an inherent implementation.  if you go on a website and buy something with bitcoin and get screwed over...bye bye bitcoin.  2) you ever receive a letter from your bank saying your credit card was compromised and they are sending you a new one?  yeah that doesnt happen with crypto.  if someone gets access to your wallet or exchange and empties your account you are FUCKED.  yes there are precautions to make and stuff, but the security is just not up to par yet.Now I want to reiterate that I am talking about the current state of both technologies.  i would greatly hope that crypto surpasses banks in all ways, but imo its just not there yet.
6	1523896410	1	You buy from websites with ratings and escrow. Like bitify. You could still get ripped of though.
2	1523895390	1	your aunt will probably not have 1M in crypto assets
3	1523901938	1	Not if it's this much trouble on TOP of the all-too-real tech threshold. Seriously, I'm reasonably tech savvy and I would like to get into BTC, but to date I haven't done more than play at the periphery. It just takes more time and effort than I've got. I own and run a business and even adding a BTC pay option to my business is a pain in the a$$
2	1523897223	1	I half agree, but seing how much of our lives is in the hands of someone NOT happening to hack us, I think these are steps we should all be taking, regardless of wether you own crypto or not.It won't happen soon, but at some point people will have to wake up to the reality of how vulnerable we are on the internet.
2	1523899249	1	In truth though these are good tips for FIAT currency also. Many, many people get hacked and fucked through bank fraud and banks give no fucks about your mistakes. If anything these tips show how much more secure cryptocurrency can be over a traditional bank. 
2	1523903495	1	Vpn definitely doesn’t make any sense, if anything it could be a bad thing and lock your account if you’re using random servers without picking the same location time and time again. Using a vpn won’t do anything good.
2	1523895934	0	Eh, these articles are a bit overblown for many users. If your aunt wants to buy a few grand worth of crypto, I think it's a much better bet to just keep it on a reputable US based exchange (assuming you're in the US). The worst I think are people who heard somewhere "don't store on an exchange" so they try to do it themselves and screw up. My advice is to store on an exchange until you get to to enough money that you'd feel really nervous about even temporarily losing access to it, then move it to a hardware wallet and put the recovery codes in a safe or safe deposit box. Always do a test transaction will a small amount to verify that stuff works
1	1523891417	10	Patience Patience Patience. How easy was it to send an email before they created a client? How easy was it to browse the web before their was a browser? It took over 20 years to develop the email client and web browser AFTER the internet was developed. 
2	1523893987	17	Internet explorer is doing a great job at developing a browser, they're almost there!
3	1523894052	1	Lol only need a few more years
3	1523902755	1	I laughed out loud at this 
2	1523898404	5	You are confusing several things here. How easy was it to send an email before they created a client? No problem at all for me in 1982, when I first got email.How easy was it to browse the web before there was a browser? It was clearly impossible, but also quite pointless. Why would anyone want to browse this thing that hasn't been invented?It most certainly did not take 20 years to develop the first email client. Try "less than five".And while it did take 22 years from internet (1969) to the web (1991), it took zero years from the invention of the web to the development of the browser. There wouldn't have been much point developing a browser before then, would there?
3	1523898853	1	Lol way too specific for the sake of argument. Spitting out super exact facts doesn’t help the discussion. Yes you may be correct , but it doesn’t change my point. We’re talking about mass adoption.  The point is that it takes time for clients and software to be created in order for it to bridge crypto with existing infrastructure.Mass adoption for email wasn’t really until AOL and mass adoption for web browsing wasn’t until Netscape. BOTH of which were created and made available many years after the “original” clients or methods you speak of
3	1523902032	1	^^This. Precisely this. Mass adoption isn't going to happen until the process is streamlined and better secured.
3	1523902813	1	actually before a browser I was using telnet to dial into bbs - and I bet that communication was FAR more secure for my privacy than today's internet.
3	1523904145	1	Especially since email actually predates the internet. Clients are created as a proof of concept of the protocol.It wasn't "lack of clients" that held back adoption, but "lack of availability" and "cost of computers". The problem of the last mile, etc.
2	1523901335	1	We want to send our crypto telepathically with just a thought, NOW! WTF is taking so long. 
1	1523892783	21	Minus anything relating to private and public keys, the same could be said about internet banking. Passwords, VPNs, malware and virus protection, protecting yourself in public, keeping your money in a bank account instead of on an exchange or in cash (cash being, IMO, more dangerous than keeping money on a crypto exchange especially if travelling).In this sense, keeping crypto safe is no different than keeping fiat money safe in a bank account, the only difference being it is up to you not to lose (or forget) your keys. Steps are being taken to make this more "normie friendly", with hardware wallets being the first step. Crypto "accounts" are a series of letters are numbers. So are fiat bank accounts. It won't take much to make crypto more mainstream, it just needs some window dressing.
2	1523894848	18	There is a critical difference actually. With Crypto, you are your own bank. You lose your private key - there is no centralized authority to retrieve it for you. With a bank, stolen funds from your account can be restored, your password/pin can be resetted if you had forgotten by contacting the bank. Law enforcement can be contacted if someone attempts a hack.As much as we love to go on about decentralization, just how many people are willing to forgo the benefits of centralization, for that marginal increase in privacy and taking a whole extra level of security in protecting your accounts?
3	1523894946	3	Maybe the billions of people who don't have access to safe centralised banks.
4	1523895190	6	While I agree that decentralized cryptocurrencies is able to provide a banking solution for billions in Third World countries, won't it be even harder for these people to understand cryptocurrencies, much less take the steps OP listed in securing them? The majority of these people you're talking about most likely have a very low education level, if any at all.
5	1523898964	1	I agree with this somewhat. In fact, it may be even easier to rip these people off if they don't fully understand the technology or have the resources to protect them / back them up. A Ledger is $100 device. That much money would feed a family for months, and if you ever go out to the provinces of Africa or the PH, some might have cell phones, but they sure as hell have really poor education and absolutely no financial education. Electricity is also iffy in these areas, even with solar. Plus, will they really be the ones who drive Crypto to mass adoption? I don't think so. It's going to be your average joe in Europe, The U.S, China, and Russia who will be the ones. The average Joe likes to do the minimal most amount of work, and educate themselves. It's got a hill to climb.
5	1523896247	0	The steps op listed are only realistic for people who have 1mm in crypto. Sophisticated hackets aren't going after people with $100. The thing about people in third world countries is that they all still use smart phones. I live in 3rd world right now. People living in shanty towns still have iPhones and know how to use them. It isn't far fetched to see these people using an app for crypto currencies. They already have established non monetary payment systems here. Crypto integration is not going to be a huge leap for them.
3	1523896532	1	> There is a critical difference actually. With Crypto, you are your own bank. You lose your private key - there is no centralized authority to retrieve it for you.That's the idea of being your own bank. Keep backups and recovery seeds somewhere safe.
3	1523897132	1	> As much as we love to go on about decentralization, just how many people are willing to forgo the benefits of centralization, for that marginal increase in privacy and taking a whole extra level of security in protecting your accounts?I don't disagree with this issue, I've even said it myself before in fact. I hope we find some kind of solution at some point
3	1523900531	1	>As much as we love to go on about decentralization, just how many people are willing to forgo the benefits of centralization, for that marginal increase in privacy and taking a whole extra level of security in protecting your accounts?I understand this point, but you could literally make this argument for most innovative technology. For ex:As much as we love the idea of having useable light in our homes after dark, just how many people are willing to forgo the use of candlelight for that marginal increase in fire safety to take on a whole extra level of security to protect themselves from electrocution?As much as we love the idea of the automobile, just how many are willing to forgo the use of horse-drawn carriages for that marginal increase in speed to take on a whole extra level of traffic safety rules?
1	1523893840	4	I was just having this conversation this morning. Crypto currency has to become user friendly in order for it to be adopted by the general public. I’m not just referring to the elderly I mean we are so use to pointing and clicking ( and forgetting about it) to take care of business. In its current form there is no way for the average person to be able to make it in the crypto space. I’m new to the community and as I was setting up passwords and everything else I felt like James Bond with all of the different security measures.  It can be overwhelming  i.e. most people won’t see it worth the hassle 😕
2	1523897279	3	Not just user friendly, but user-friendly AND secure.No one is stashing their retirement savings in crypto when one slip-up means it's gone. At least if someone gets into my bank account, I just make a phone call to my bank and they reverse the fraudulent transfers.
2	1523899164	3	I just mentioned this about the "average Joe". The average Joe around the world like's simple things. They like things to work for them. They don't like to spend extra time on education or security. They want to watch T.V, play a game, hang out with their buds and friends. They like quick get rich money. That's what they see Crypto as right now. These are the same people who don't have a 6 months savings, or continue to educate themselves once they have a job. They are the masses and unless they can use a debit card that has some sort of insurance for their crypto money, that requires minimal effort to use, mass adoption is a long ways a way. People completely overestimate the amount of average people using Crypto right now.
2	1523898116	2	The issue is that the open source nature of the Bitcoin and other blockchain projects is a double edged sword. On one hand the open source aspect is critical to everything cryptocurrencies strive to achieve. On the other, it exposes itself to the public before it is ready. I said this somewhere else in this thread, but cryptocurrencies are an alpha-stage world changing technology dressed up like a get rich quick scheme. 
1	1523890405	14	Nah, we already have coinbase who has literal cold storage of coins.This is the first step to having an additional layer of external security.
2	1523894212	6	That's just re-inventing banks ... why not use an actual bank?
3	1523894600	6	Using crypto through a bank is still better than using a fiat currency through a bank. There are benefits to crypto unrelated to "being your own bank", such as inflation rates.
4	1523895695	2	Inflation is gradual, crypto markets are changing 24/7
5	1523903719	1	Scarcity and inflation are not the same thing.
5	1523900334	0	But governments make sure that inflation only ever goes in one direction: the value of your cash goes *down*.  Crypto can go in either direction, and mostly goes up.
4	1523899276	1	The fact that people have seen their Bitcoin wealth wiped out in a matter of weeks is why banks are still a safer bet for the average Joe. Also the fact that using a bank requires minimal mental effort for your average person.
4	1523895277	0	Oh totally, inflation might easily mean your USD could drop to 1/3rd of it's value in a couple of months ... oh ... wait ...
5	1523897902	2	Yes.. it could. Have you seen the handful of countries whose domestic inflation has skyrocketed?I get your point, but you're missing the larger point of cryptocurrencies. I live in the US and am lucky to not live in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, etc, but if the current US administration is a sign of times to come you should be worried. Not liking crypto is like saying "I like my store of value backed up by the trust in the US government and Donald Trump. I do not want something that is cryptographically secure, mathematically fair and free of outside influence".  Cryptocurrency is an alpha-stage world changing technology dressed up like a get rich quick scheme.
3	1523894640	3	My problems with banks has never been security. My interest in cryptocurrency has nothing to do with decentralization. I'm going to guess most people invested in crypto care fuck all about decentralization or anonymity, and just want to make money. I have no illusions that most the value in this market is profit driven, and not about revolutionizing finance.
4	1523895210	4	> I'm going to guess most people invested in crypto care fuck all about decentralization or anonymity, and just want to make money.Totally agree. Anyone wanna guess what happens to a market where the only 'value' in all investments is *profit*?
5	1523899473	1	Ya - definitely pulling profits out when possible assuming the worst. I do think there's a place for the technology in the market - it is still potentially a great platform for purchasing / financial transactions. But I also expect a major existing corporation to enter the game  (like Visa or Amazon or Microsoft), and obliterate the existing market.
4	1523899347	1	Exactly. I think the tech is cool. I'm a tech person. I like the ideas. But I didn't put my money in to "support" the revolution. No, I want to make some quick gambling money in the next couple of years so I can follow my personal passions for awhile.
3	1523894686	1	Cause we want them sick gains bra
3	1523896208	1	USD inflation. Also, this is only one option if you want it.
3	1523895301	0	Its ok to have it regulated. Stop with this hippie "no banks mahnnn" crypto is for the people mahnnn.
1	1523894590	2	well to be fair，front end services that bridge the gap will help remedy that issue，but it does require a certain level of trust and it is not completely distributed. A new technology will always have its barriers to adoption. Thats why it took so long（decades） for most emerging technologies in the past to hit mass adoption too. 
1	1523894905	2	Impossible!!!never invest for what is,but for what could be!.there are many challenges,no doubt and many of these issues of security need to be worked out.with that being said,this is an indication and proof that we are definitly early adopters of this technology.choosing to see the glass as half empty,blinds you to what potential this has in the future.by the time these security issues are worked out,prices will certainly be allot higher than they are now..risk and reward go hand in hand,but impossible is definitly not a word I would use.
1	1523894936	2	Rome was not built in a day. Back in early internet days, not all protocols were invented that are prevalent. We are in very early days of blockchain/cryptocurrency It takes time for better UI/UX and ease of use. Brightest mind in the history are working to solve problem in this domain. Hopefully in near future, we will have safe, secure and easy to use crypto.
1	1523895533	2	Or this creates new jobs.  Crypto Managers.  
1	1523890409	3	In it's current state sure, but the internet was slow and crap before mass adoption too.
2	1523893456	3	crypto is almost 10 years old now, yet we don't even have cool and nice e-wallets. nothing but promises and lots of hyperfuturistic PETS.COM lookalikes.
3	1523896604	1	You develop one. These people are giving the software away.
1	1523894560	1	Thanks! Was about to say that. Lost me at VPN. Even though I use one, its not for crypto.This Bilal dude would have been fine if he would have used a Leder. Case closed. 
1	1523895399	1	Bingo. Mass adoption won't take place until the market stops booking and cryptocurrencies are no longer an investment but rather digital money. You don't worry about the $10 in your wallet or the $100 in your bank, that's what's necessary for mass adoption. Not this list...
1	1523895870	1	This is CURRENTLY why mass adoption will struggle. Solutions will be presented to solve these problems in the future, followed by mass adoption.
1	1523895919	1	Or it could be a checklist for a new market opportunity, i.e. the Coinbase of wallet security.
1	1523896115	1	Nothing intrinsic to crypto that makes it any more difficult to secure. Just needs a better infrastructure.
1	1523897056	1	I don't think it's any more dangerous than online banking. We just need similar secuirity measures automatically in place.
1	1523897161	1	thats not true. it's easy to add nother security layers. there hasn't been a single tech which is not used cause of "security reasons", everything can be abused easily. think about how easy it is to get into someones bank account, or to get rekt by those wireless credit cards. this list goes on and on.
1	1523897243	1	There will be solutions invented which will make owning crypto more convenient. 
1	1523898006	1	Yea
1	1523898115	1	It's almost like we should use some kind of unviversally trusted third party to take care of all of this for us and provide security
1	1523898406	1	Just need a federally insured exchange
1	1523898586	1	I agree. People need to pull their head out of their asses when it comes to adoption. It's still 100x easier and safer to put in and take out cash in my government insured bank account.  Debit card transactions, storage... long ways to go.
1	1523898867	1	To be fair, unlike your SSN in the states  you can at least secure your assets and information. Extremely tedious but far safer than bank assets when done properly. For example most people don't care about their SSN cause they lost the lottery of having it stolen and used for loans etc. Quite frankly no sane person should adopt the SSN as a "private" identity yet pretty much everything does. People don't care about security if the bad things don't effect them, hence why we still haven't changed the SSN identification methodologies in US law despite the stupidly simple identity theft from it.
1	1523899066	1	When flexing goes wrong 🤔 all these are very helpful reasons but maybe it’s best not to tell everyone on the internet how much crypto you have in your portfolio 
1	1523899878	1	Not impossible. Crypto world just needs to catch up with banks. They need to do it for them. Secure websites that hide all the details in the background and make it simple. Click a few buttons and you're done. Any more than that and people won't bother.
1	1523900143	1	Large part of that list is useless bullshit "advice" just to scare people.But I agree that for mass adoption, we will need much better standardized solutions (like Ledger) to keep accounts safe. Turns out, having a bank employee look at larger transactions also helped prevent theft.
1	1523901512	1	Depends on how you look at it. Banks have been robbed, ATMs stollen, and people mugged yet fiat still exist for obvious reasons. Not just fiat but any and everything ever made has been stolen and yet all of those things and their institutions still exist. Adoption is inevitable regardless of currency theft. There are good people and bad people, nothing can change that. Human behavior is the issue. 
1	1523901541	1	Precisely my thoughts. I've thought this all along though. Most people are content with their banking app letting them use their finger print to sign in. Imagine everybody having to deal with huge strings for public keys to send money, most will find it very annoying. The real kicker though is everybody needing to remember their private keys (near impossible) or needing a secure way to store it for easy access to their crypto wallet. Therein lies the problem. Not sure what the solution is really.
1	1523901673	1	the old ppl who think this is hard to do are dying at a rapid rate - to anyone under 35 this shit is easy or you haven't been paying attention your entire adult life.
1	1523902001	1	all its takes is one big tech name like apple to integrate face id + passcode with a exchange, and transaction based payment system for crypto. The app would do all the login processing automatically. nothing to memorize, no elaborate hoops to jump through. these are things that we deal with as early adopters, however it may pay off in the end to be early.the vast majority of the world uses technology daily that they don't understand the back-end of. All it takes in a decent GUI and it could become popular in a few months. assuming one could create an app that has multi crypto wallet integration, and allows for fiat to have direct pair trading with all current crypto names, I could see mass adoption.
1	1523902269	1	I didn’t buy because I believed that Satoshi quit over a logo dispute.... 
1	1523903818	1	Well EOS looks promising. They have active and owner keys. Time delay for transactions. Arbitration. 
1	1523903981	1	Mass adoption will come because this type of security (other than hardware wallets) is how you protect your info as well. The world is going digital and that includes our money. VPNs will be the norm and most phones will have one.A little off topic but VPN is hardly safe when a company gets all the data. If that company is a bad actor or just gets hacked,  all the users of that VPN are still compromised. Check out Mysterium.
1	1523892660	1	I don't understand this way of thinking and the fact that people keep saying its too much of a job to be your own bank. As of now, you are right. However when real adoptation occurs, banks will follow. This is already happening in Liechenstein I think. The banks will secure your crypto, just like they do with FIAT now. Little remark: I don't mean to sound harsh, you have a rightful point. Right now adoption is nearly impossible. However this will change as banks are joining. This might not be popular amongst crypto believers, but that's the only way the average Joe is going to adopt. 
2	1523893554	2	This is how banks survive.
3	1523894149	2	As much as I despice banks, especially american ones (watch inside job and you understand what I mean), they are the key to adoption. 
4	1523898766	1	How do you despice banks? I find that once the spices go in, they sort of mix with everything else and become impossible to remove.
1	1523895255	0	Agree.
0	1523890762	180	whilst I agree with your sentiment some of what you say is overkill and some is too narrow. * You don't need a 32+ character password. 16+ is perfectly secure and will be for some time. You didn't mention 2 factor authentication but you should really use that along with a strong password.* keeping your keys just to yourself and not telling anybody about your assets is dumb because if you die you would want somebody you love to have access.* You don't need AV on Linux which is far more secure than Windows with AV.* There are other methods of cold storage than Trezor/Ledger* You can leave hotels but don't log into exchanges or wallets when on untrusted networks. Preferably don't use a computer with wallets on for regular browsing.* You don't need to carry weapons in most countries. Physical security is important but there is no need for paranoia.
1	1523892253	10	Literally about to make all of these additions. One thing I will say is that although Linux shouldn't need AV, it's still good practice to have something in place when dealing with important information and assets. BitDefender, Sophos, or Comodo are good options for Linux. 
2	1523892465	4	I have looked into av on linux, none of them are particularly good. In 7 years of running Linux I have never had a virus, probably because 1) I don't run as root 2) I install all security updates 3) I don't download random crap from the internet and have in browser protections.
3	1523893834	10	This is like a Mac user saying "Mac never gets viruses! Why do I need AV?". Which we know they do get viruses, you just don't hear about it because only 6% of the OS space is being used by macOS. That's awesome you have good security practices and that practice works for you (for now), but doing security updates and not downloading any crap will not keep you 100% safe no matter who you are. Sometimes we slip up. Or even 100% trusted downloads and installs can be compromised (like CCleaner/Avast 6 months ago) and infect you on the next update or install. It's bad advice to tell the general public they don't need AV on Linux, when that box holds extremely high value to them. Think about it this way: Would you run a Linux box holding 100s of people's investment with no AV, IPS or IDS? If you wouldn't risk that for 100s, why would you for only you?I've been running Linux for about 5 years and Windows for close to 10 years and never had a virus on either. I run AV on both even though it never catches anything. Better safe than sorry. Rather not kick myself in the ass after I've lost thousands simply because I thought Linux would never need AV. Food for thought. 
4	1523898444	1	Just use tor & tails
5	1523899023	1	Good options, love tails. But in regards to assets and valuables it's better to install an AV/IPS/IDS solution on top for prevention and capturing. I would use tor on tails plus an AV or behind an IDS/IPS system when dealing with large investments. I'll take security (piece of mind) over performance. 
6	1523899999	1	What av would you use with tails? And what's ids/ips?
7	1523902420	1	Something that doesn't use a lot of resources since you'll be running tails off a bootable flash of some type. You can try Sophos since that seems to be a lightweight solution compared to other products but not sure if it work with tails. Maybe something like ClamAV would work. *note, I've only made this point because we are talking about valubale assets. If you are using a Linux system as an everyday computer, AV is typically not needed due to the file system privileges, though it is not a bad idea to have something.* IDS: Intrusion Detection SystemIPS: Intrusion Prevention SystemLinux makes some distros that can be used to blacklist, block, detect and prevent/clean unwanted traffic (Suricata, SNORT, Security Onion, etc). An IDS simply monitors the network traffic and detects when a possible malicious intrusion has been detected. It will then warn you to take action. Typically, the AV takes over and controls the outbreak once the IDS sends an alert. An IPS will actually detect, stop/prevent and clean malicious attacks/viruses. Once controlled, some IPS solutions can learn the new attack and prevent it quicker in the future. 
3	1523899611	1	In 10+ years of running Windows I've never had a virus either
1	1523895747	5	> You don't need a 32+ character password. 16+ is perfectly secure and will be for some time.Even that seems excessive. I have an old Eth wallet that has a password that is likely 8-9 characters. I wrote it down somewhere, but didn't put a lot of effort in making sure I kept it safe since I was just toying around with it and only had about $10 worth of Eth on it at the time. Now it's worth a little over $250. I spent a fair amount of time looking around for tools to help me crack it. Tried a few that progmatically added characters to the beginning and end of common passwords I've used in the past. No luck.So I gave in, and started looking at people online who have offered wallet-cracking services in exchange for % of the wallet (at this point, I'm never getting it open myself, so might as well put faith in random internet people, right?). The kicker here is that none of them claim to be able to do squat, regardless of password length, without me handing over all of my previous passwords (that I've likely used for other things). That's clearly not going to happen.So yeah, I have an Eth wallet with a password length of <10. If someone can explain to me how I can realistically get that cracked without previous knowledge of passwords, I'd happily send some Eth their way.
2	1523898664	7	You might have already seen this, but check this out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack#Theoretical_limitsThen scroll down to "Software that performs brute-force attacks"
2	1523901346	1	Try John the Ripper?
2	1523903464	1	Brute forcing all possible combinations for an 8 character password takes about 2 weeks, what gives? 
1	1523893626	2	You only get one life and for many, crypto might be their one chance at being able to retire early and/or live a life of wealth.In my opinion, you can never be too careful, especially when you’ve worked enough blue-collar shit jobs your whole life. I never want to be a garbage man, dishwasher, window washer, fulfillment center worker, or package handler/loader ever again.I’ll remain overly cautious; thank you very much.
2	1523897972	5	Goddamn it’s so sad that for our generation (and the next one, the kids born after 2000) crypto seems like our only chance at equalizing wealth. It might not work out, and the banks and extremely wealthy certainly won’t help it, but it’s sad it’s come down to one idea. I know people are gonna spam me with the just get a good job and save meme. Yeah that works to get through life and have things. Trust me, I’m doing just fine by following that advice. I’m talking serious wealth redistribution though where like the top 1% of wealth is distributed through the bottom 99% so we can all live nicer less stressful lives. It’s not gonna happen, but crypto seems the only path to having a small taste of it. And that’s sad. 
3	1523898843	2	It's also shown just how greedy people can become. Exit scams, p+d groups etc.  
3	1523899294	1	Crypto will never equalize wealth, who do you think owns most of it?  And it’s been like that for all of history, pretty much everywhere.  Just the nature of wealth means that for some people have a lot others have to have a little 
1	1523893866	2	32 is too long - but 16 is too short. ...but since you should be using a password manager, why not just use the max?
2	1523899572	5	16 random alphanumeric characters provides you with an entropy of 95 bits. Not exactly what I would call 'too short'. However, if you want to be on the safe side, choose 20 characters of random printable ascii characters. Increasing password size beyond 20 characters is rather pointless, because your password will be more secure than the blockchain itself.
3	1523899740	3	Probably.  My point was that 16 is too low.  It is still within the breakable range.
4	1523901063	6	how thoI Just went to https://howsecureismypassword.net/ and put in the password I generated from Lastpass:    15t^LnIWlWP!sAZoAt 16 characters and all character types, the output is 1 trillion years of brute-forcing. Let's say high-efficiency techniques and advances in hardware lead to a billion-fold increase from whatever algorithm this site uses - that's still a thousand years.Going to 20 characters (using     nu2Q0@dr&^lfX$FVulX& sourced from lastpass again) gets you in to the realm of the absurd: 43 quintillion years. 32 characters:    Jw^A$f51&gsMOb#2H*AmAMYvz79*Jm1M gets you 2 tredecillion years.I'm a firm believer that overkill is underrated, but eventually, you're going with absurd. Sure, if you have a password manager, then use it with max allowable characters. But, you have to recognize when you're adding unnecessary complexity.
4	1523901666	3	Uhhh really?!There are 62 possibilities for each character, and 16 characters. This translates to 62^16 (47672401706823533450263330816) trials worse case, or half of that on average. If the attacker can do a billion trials per second, that means 47672401706823533450 seconds, which is about 1511681941489 years. I think that's pretty good protection. You could even chop off a few characters and still feel pretty safe.If you are choosing the 16 characters from a pseudo-random generator that is. If you just make it up then I’m significantly less confident. 
1	1523901132	1	> You can leave hotels but don't log into exchanges or wallets when on untrusted networks.You can use any websites on untrusted networks when they are https (most websites nowadays)
1	1523901567	1	> You don't need AV on Linux which is far more secure than Windows with AV.Windows without an AV and a user who doesn't randomly download things is also far more secure than Windows with AV.
1	1523897796	0	> ▪️Is your password for all of your logins complex and greater than 32+ characters including a capital letter, lower case letter, numbers, and special characters?yeah I'm sure that logging in a 5-10 websites that during the day will automatically timeout and push me out therefore forcing me to login 3-4 times a day each website with passwords written on steel and that have therefore to be input manually with 32 characters won't take a lot of time..
2	1523897883	4	I use my password manager's auto type feature. Keepass. 
3	1523898258	1	but is the password manager code publicly audited, and do they provide code you can compile yourself?
4	1523898434	4	Yes and yes
1	1523900884	0	Carrying a weapon is not paranoia. 
2	1523901560	1	That depends on where you live and whether there is actually a legitimate risk of being attacked. If you live in a safe country and have no specific threat then yes feeling like you need a weapon is paranoia.

1	1523895732	7	yea, this is such overkill.
1	1523895508	11	I stopped reading at "get 2 ledgers/trezors". Why in the world would you need 2?
2	1523896439	33	Bury the other one under at LEAST 45 feet of permafrost on the opposite hemispheres pole from you. Sell everything you own. Buy only rations and small weapons. Buy an acre of land in an unknown area of your country. Buy a small shipping container to live in on your acre of land. Spend rest of your days guarding the container + your rations + your first Ledger.
2	1523897913	2	actually of all the things, having two is good because if one gets locked up / broken / lost you can use the other to recover the same wallet with word seed
2	1523898236	2	I mean if you have a non-trivial amount in your ledger and choose not to backup the seed words for it anywhere (most safe) then aren't you worried that the hardware could just die?How long have they been around? Does anyone really know if it'll last 5 years, 10 years with increasing usage? How about if you simply lose it? Maybe it gets stolen? etcBest to have another one already setup with same passphrase that you can use in case of any of the above. Maybe shove it in a safety deposit box etc? It's that or saving the seed so you can restore it but then you have the problem of storing that seed as securely as the ledger device (pretty difficult).
2	1523896713	1	It’s wise to have two already initialised, otherwise you’re relying on only one and a seed.
2	1523897913	1	I remember reading one guy in Bitcoin forum a few months ago, talking about etching down the private key, public address in a metal and burying it underground.
1	1523902914	1	Thought it was a copy pasta tbh.
1	1523894257	0	I suppose it depends how much money you're holding locally in crypto.
2	1523896241	2	My measly few grand isn't going to change my life if it gets stolen. Yeah I'll be pissed, but I'm not going to go through 45 minutes of logging in every time I want to use it.Now, if I had a few million? That might be a different story.

0	1523888689	14	I'd say use Linux over Windows for your coin wallets, and use dedicated devices for each coin wallet that you don't use for any other purpose.Raspberry Pis are great for this and there are a number of additional security measures you can take.  See /r/pinode for more info.
1	1523891489	3	Is there a machine you’d recommend for Linux?
2	1523891559	3	Linux will run on most computers these days.
3	1523898024	1	there are some motherboards that for some reason really don't like linux :(
2	1523893616	1	As I said Raspberry Pi is great, but you can put Linux on pretty much anything fairly modern.  Ubuntu is a good OS for beginners.
3	1523903094	1	But pls don't go with a default raspbian!It is fully open on all sides as it is designed for developers. Takes many steps to secure a Linux from scratch.There are other distros they say..
2	1523903258	1	Any old Pentium standing around will do it. Just make sure to replace the harddisk and never connect to any network.

1	1523896573	5	lmao
0	1523896472	12	Honestly I'm going to disagree with this post.  While those measures will be necessary for anyone with a large bag of crypto, the 99&#37; of us may not need to go through all these hurtles.  I'll start with the subscriptions.  I love nordvpn and bitdefender but the reality is average users have little technical ability to correctly use a vpn anyways. 
1	1523903955	1	A vpn is actually a terrible idea, and could lock you out of your accounts on exchanges. It literally adds nothing and can cause problems for you.
1	1523900679	1	I use TunnelBear and it's literally just pressing the on/off button. How to correctly use a VPN if I may ask?
2	1523904008	1	I think they mean how as in when you should use it. It’s not going to help with crypto and might accidentally lock you out of your exchange accounts for using random geographic locations.
0	1523894805	26	>Whenever you use your computer are you logged in on a reputable VPN service like NordVPN with CyberSec enabled? If NO, stop being cheap and go to www.nordvpn.com and buy a 2 year subscription to protect your internet traffic and make it encrypted.NO NO NO. Do not use a VPN for security unless you have a really good reason to. It does almost nothing to protect you from hackers in general, while giving control over all your traffic to the VPN provider. A single point of failure like this is a severe danger in itself. VPNs are important if you're traveling a lot and must do sensitive stuff on untrustworthy networks. But even then, you should always be using HTTPS and a trustworthy public DNS service. But this mitigates the need for a VPN in most cases.
1	1523896245	7	Yeah, the suggestion to use a VPN was an odd one.  Aside from the fact that everything is HTTPS protected already, if you're on your home computer, it's very unlikely some hacker has access to your IP traffic that's just going straight to your ISP.  But if you have a VPN, it's entirely possible and easy for that VPN to snoop all your traffic. (Hopefully that doesn't matter because you're using HTTPS, but it's still *more* risky, not less.)
2	1523901249	0	Keep in mind that if you have coax, your data theoretically passes everyone elses's modem; at least the WAN port.
1	1523898990	2	Indeedy, more points of attack, KISS principal is appropriate here. 
0	1523892731	10	I also urge people to use 2FA wherever it's possible.
0	1523896368	9	This is insane, a normal person can in my opinion remove 99.99% of risk by -1. Using paper wallets and store copies in a safe at home and a safe deposit box at a bank.2.  Store coins on a reputable exchange like Binance and have 2fa enabled using Google Authenticator on the exchange and on your gmail.3.  Just use a Ledger Nano.Yes, Binance may collapse, if it does so we are all fucked anyway.  If you feel it may collapse, feel free to use option 1 or 3.  The problem with these extreme convoluted schemes like you describe is that more often they end up fucking yourself over.  How many bitcoins were lost due to people storing the wallets in bizarre ways (hidden many new folders deep with a file name of gibberish on a single hard drive they forgot about or died) or not remembering the private keys they committed to memory/buried in the Sahara?  I'd say way more than the bitcoin that were lost to "hackers."  You are your own worst enemy with regard to losing your own crypto.
0	1523895452	16	> if you can get a concealed carry gun permit I highly suggest you do.If you are so concerned about your cryptocurrency that you need to carry a gun all the time, you might want to think about relocating to a safer place or re-evaluate the risks again.
1	1523898291	6	I don’t know if it’s a joke/meme at this point but I do see a lot of people seriously thinking people are going to torture others for their crypto keys. Come on now. Where the fuck do you live to even consider that happening? If someone breaks into my house they’ll steal my pc and laptop and shit not think to torture me for some crypto that they have no idea how much I hold. I guess that’s the best security though. Not telling specific or maybe even general amounts of money you have in anything. Are people afraid of being tortured for their bank account info? Not usually. It seems overly super paranoid. And this is coming from a paranoid person. 
2	1523900602	2	A lot of posts on this sub seem like people are legitimately paranoid that Ted from accounting is going to rob them at gun point for their portfolio.Who’s ever gotten mugged and the nugget yelled ‘PRIVATE KEY, LEDGER, BINANCE 2FA NOW!’?

0	1523894613	10	>buy at least 2 of them IMMEDIATELY>Use this specific VPNThe shilling is becoming much more blatant. I already know OP will subtlely shill them again later on in the post without reading it. These shill/drone posts are almost always textbook advertising. Everything else is common sense. 
1	1523900042	2	I don't think this guy stands to financially benefit from promoting three different companies, two of which are competitors. OP is just recommending products he likes and there is nothing wrong with that.
2	1523904119	1	Nope. It’s clearly advertising or op doesn’t know how VPNs work. A vpn won’t make your crypto more secure, if anything it will probably lock you out of your online exchange accounts for using a vpn/random geographic location every time.
0	1523890795	10	Also use a password manager like open source keepass or commercial lastpass (others are available). That way you can use a long phrase as a master password and get your password manager to generate those random 32 character passwords for your wallets and exchanges.Also check Jackson Palmer's (Doge guy) youtube channel for guides on password managers and other security advice.Another useful piece of software is veracrypt for storing important files on encrypted volumes or in encrypted files.
1	1523892081	7	I am a bit paraoind about these password wallets, seems that I let to keep it for someone I don't even know. 
2	1523892503	7	Not keepass, it's an encrypted file you keep on your machine. Of course you're then responsible for backing up the file.
2	1523895916	2	LastPass, KeePass, and 1Password all store your passwords in a blind encrypted vault where the service has no access to your passwords because they don't have your key (password) to unlock them.  There are ways their software could be compromised to do things like record your password when you enter it, but the same thing could happen with a keylogger on your computer, so they're still as effective as passwords can be.  And there isn't any better way to store passwords, this is as good as it gets.  Anything else you're doing is probably more risky.
2	1523898124	1	> is the code of those password managers publicly audited and can you compile it yourself? because otherwise steel plates are safer
3	1523900464	1	keepass is open source. Not sure if they have the funds for a full code audit like veracrypt.
4	1523900797	1	well even opensource community free look would at least be something.  still, even despite understanding the advantages including bypassing keyloggers, I can't bring myself to trust them
1	1523895554	2	You should be aware that there have been several stories of people losing access to their password managers. You will never be able to guess that random 32 character string. There is some comfort in be able to mentally recall a password.
2	1523900490	1	And there are far more cases of people not using password managers and getting hacked because they used the same or similar password on all their online accounts. It just takes one of those small sites to be hacked for your username and password to be on a password list sold on the dark web. There will be some risk in whatever you do, it's a fallacy to assume that you have to reach 100% in security and then use that as an excuse to do no security.  If you use the password manager/service most days you'll find it very easy to remember the password/phrase you used and you can always right it down somewhere in your home. Your password file is most likely to be stolen from your PC by a piece of malware not someone breaking into your place.  Using the security tools available and doing regular backups including offline will greatly increase your security whilst minimizing accidental loss of info.
1	1523899372	1	I was born in Wales so my password is the house number and street name I grew up in, the street was  Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch(obviously I'm only kidding, using any name that's in public domain is a strict  no-no) 
2	1523900282	1	to be fair that won't be on the lists of common words and passwords used by hackers.
0	1523890975	6	Great advice. One Question:>▪️Is your password for all of your logins complex and greater than 32+ characters including a capital letter, lower case letter, numbers, and special characters?How do you recommend coming up with a 32+ character password?  For something I wouldn't be using all the time I think I would have a hard time remember it, and thus I might create a physical back-up or some such, which would seemingly defeat the point . - or at least make it less secure. 
1	1523891802	5	You have to use a reputable password manager like Dashlane. You can also use Yubikey with Dashlane.
2	1523894199	3	Bingo.  The added benefit of a password manager is that since you're never typing in the passwords, a keylogger won't even record them even if you ARE infected.
3	1523896306	2	Ya but you are typing your master password into the manager. So you should use 2FA with the password manager. And modify the master password regularly.Also you should be reauthorizing when going to your email or exchage. 
4	1523896868	1	Right - 2FA for the manager. 
3	1523898098	1	is the code of those password managers publicly audited and can you compile it yourself? because otherwise steel plates are safer
4	1523899491	1	Keepass is open source.
5	1523900613	2	a few years ago if you googled keypass rather than keepass a scummy commercial password manager would be one of the top results.
6	1523901344	1	oops
4	1523901551	1	You can’t steel plate 100 passwords. This is about overall user security. You can’t expect anyone to create unique, strong, 20 char keywords without a password manager.
2	1523896184	1	Is KeePass 2.35 good enough?
3	1523901471	1	Use dashlane. Industry leading and hasn’t had security issues. 
1	1523891576	2	Physical device can be anything that's not tied to the internet. No phones, tablets, computers. Don't print it. Simply write it down.
1	1523895912	1	Just pick a phrase and add a numberjustpicK4phraseandadda#
1	1523896084	1	You have to have a password manager.  Period.  The password manager generates the random passwords for you.  (Ok, you could also write down your random passwords instead, but that's just a pain in the ass and still won't save you if someone installs a key logger on your computer.  So you might as well just use a password manager and enjoy the safety and *convenience*.)You can use Dashlane, LastPass, KeePass, or 1Password.  They're all pretty good.  Just pick one and start using it.
2	1523902837	1	What if someone hacks my dashlane acct?
0	1523896036	3	A least 2 hardware wallets? Steady on. You can keep a few recovery seeds.

0	1523890263	2	One more comment. 32 character passwords? I mean, more power to you if you do, but ughhhhh. Maybe if I had a ton of money in though.
1	1523892777	2	Long hard to guess but easy to remember sentence passwords?
2	1523898218	2	yeah but if you need to do daily trading you're gonna spend your whole day typing passwords lol
1	1523891831	0	Dashlane. 
2	1523894656	1	is there something I missed about LastPass?  What's Dashlane compared to it?
3	1523901706	1	Dashlane has a better user experience. For example, it auto logs you into websites. If there is a hack, it’ll alert you and with one click, you can change the affected password without having to even go to the site.

0	1523899691	1	>NordVPN with CyberSecYayyy useless buzzwords.Lol this post is mostly a joke, there's some good info like using strong passwords and not using SMS for any kind of 2FA or PW reset, but really most of it is just alarmist bullcrap.It doesn't even mention using an offline password manager like Keepass which is one of the most important things you can do.A paid AV subscription isn't needed either.If Ian Balina (whoever that is) was using MEW to store $1mil+ in currency then I don't know what was expected, the wallet is literally **stored online on someones random servers**. Just storing it on a hardware wallet or even on an offline wallet on his PC would have been fine, 95% of this article wouldn't even be needed.
0	1523899806	1	Ian's issue, if he is telling the truth, is he had an old email account *that he knew had been hacked* as the recovery email for his gmail. Then once in his gmail, they could access Evernote from there. (E.g. password recovery). And on Evernote he had his private keys.This was an attack vector that could have been closed with very basic, everyday internet layman security. I.e., don't have old hacked email accounts as your recovery emails for your main email account, and don't stick your private keys on an insecure cloud service. (Especially one you can access from a compromised account!)
0	1523899919	1	Jesus christ, this is way too much and probably scaring lots of people out of crypto.

0	1523900886	1	This might be a stupid question but how can we know the Trezor or Ledger devices can't figure out our private keys? 
0	1523900897	1	Can someone clArify the VPN thing? 
0	1523900996	1	Sounds more like an al quaida 101 than a serious advice for crypto traders
0	1523901040	1	Thanks for your time posting it. It's always good to remember. I feel sad for people that are starting in Crypto and don't take any of this precautions. 
0	1523901473	1	According to CCN, the guy had his private key in Evernote, which was secured with a gmail account, which was backed with an old college email account for password resets of the gmail. Very poor operational security. He said the weakest link was the college email account. They even told him about a security violation, but he ignored it. Then they just kept getting lucky.When dealing with that much money, he should have had a separate machine, completely locked down with software whitelisting, hardware wallet, backup of hardware wallet, seed stored in safety deposit box or safe. Basically it should have been extremely annoying and tedious for him to move that much money. Also, a much smaller hot wallet that can be on a more convenient but less secure system.

0	1523902340	1	2 hardware wallets?Thats not how hardware wallets works. You use them just to generate private and public keys securely. After this you can simply create a paper backup to store somewhere else.
0	1523902388	1	Pay for all those services is more expensive than all my holdings...
0	1523902474	1	These are great tips; not always relevant, and not correct in 100% of cases, but for someone unsure of what they should do, this advice is 100% correct. 
0	1523902554	1	OP is advocating for people to get a Ledger or Trezor, but says it was a MEW address that got hacked. Does that mean I should worry about using MEW on my Ledger Nano?
0	1523902678	1	Nice guide man. Some things that you left out:- dedicated email addresses for anything crypto related- encrypted email that cannot be accessed via webmail (there are smart phone apps that offer this for free...such as Sudo)- I use paper wallets. These should ALWAYS be encrypted with a strong password- never expose private key to the internet. Lots of ways to make sure that you don’t. - don’t use online wallets, period. 
0	1523902682	1	Can cold storage even be trusted that much? Aren't you putting all your confidence into the manufacturer? 
0	1523902693	1	Very user friendly, crypto, if it needs all these things. Imagine Joe the bus driver encrypting his internet with a vpn service 
0	1523902953	1	Just put your shit on mew and print some paper wallets. And use a mac
0	1523903025	1	Why is it always ETH that gets hacked?
0	1523903314	1	Isn’t the entire point of a ledger the fact that you don’t have to worry about malware because you need to verify the transaction on the device?That is like, literally the only reason why it’s recommended to have one. That should be the one and ONLY requirement you list here besides self defense tips.

0	1523903952	1	"▪️Are you showing off your profits and portfolio to people?** If YES, think twice about who you show it to and where you are posting it. Your closest friends can be your biggest enemies. People are snakes. There are bad people out there always plotting ways to get something out of you. Always assume that - and don't fucking post your portfolio online. You are asking to get tied up to a chair in a dark basement and tortured."**Most important out of whole list - keep your mouth shut stupids!**
0	1523903986	1	I read this and laughed while thinking about the scene in “Commando” where Arnold is getting all geared up for his final assault.In all seriousness though, if you own a ledger nano s, set up a second “decoy” wallet on it with a different pin #.  And like OP said, just buy a backup now in case yours gets lost, stolen, or damaged.You never know if they will go on back order again, so you could be unable to access your crypto for long periods of time if your primary goes down.

0	1523896840	0	I have the majority of my money stored on Ledger/Trezor, but I'm concerned about 2fa on my accounts. Most of my accounts have Google Authentication enabled, but some accounts require authy - I've heard authy is less secure but why? What are the vulnerabilities with it and how do I increase security? Also I recently moved and will need to change my phone #. What do I need to do before I change my phone number? Won't that fuck up a lot of account security that use phone numbers to verify?
