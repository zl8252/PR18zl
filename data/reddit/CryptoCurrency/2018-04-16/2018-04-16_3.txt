1	1523882628	2	Do you mean project Jasper? IIRC they tested Ethereum,  but went with another blockchain insteadedit: Ethereum autocorrected

2	1523887063	1	This is a blatant lie 
3	1523892032	1	I don't think you understand what the word "lie" means.People are perfectly capable of being incorrect without it being a lie.
4	1523898406	1	I apologized. I woke up cranky this morning 
3	1523887218	1	Is it?  phase 1 was with Ethereum, phase 2 with Corda. I'm not a tech person, so can you please inform me of why it's not true?https://www.payments.ca/about-us/news/payments-canada-launches-new-research-under-project-jasper
4	1523887448	3	Sorry - that was a bit abrasive. From everything I know they are doing their due diligence but their experiments with Ethereum are still very much ongoing (as they are with Corda as well). 
5	1523887610	1	Fair, all I know is what I read from the Whitepaper that I picked up from a comference earlier in the year. I haven't been following it very carefully since 
0	1523862317	102	So, Ethereum to the moon, you say?
1	1523862983	16	To shreds?
2	1523890740	2	And his wife?
3	1523896049	1	To shreds you say? 
1	1523893053	2	Yes i do my friend, ethereum to the moon i say.
1	1523868569	-4	lol? read again> Ethereum blockchain **technology**if it had said > Ethereums blockchain then moonthis is like all the posts about company X using/partnering with ripple/iota, no.. they just want to copy the tech :D
2	1523885891	7	You have the sense of humor of a cactus 
2	1523877080	2	Joke
2	1523876246	1	Of course. Just a silly play on words.
2	1523884600	-1	uh genius that works with centralized shitcoins like ripple and iota you cant use the ethereum technology without using its blockchain by design unless you get consensus to agree on a diff ethereum. thats like saying you're using bitcoins technology to make smart contracts but not on bitcoins chain. Uh, fuck no you're not - Consensus, circa 2018. 
2	1523889819	-1	Not sure why you are getting downvoted. You’re 100% correct. So many posts of “so n so plans to use blockchain technology in its _____”It does absolutely nothing for crypto currency. Imagine if Microsoft was happy someone was using Windows technology to make their own operating system. Sadly blockchain tech isn’t protected so people will use it with out crypto benefits.
1	1523885901	-1	Yep, this and other hype that goes nowhere.The logistical challenges of space travel don't change with blockchain. A decentralized version of SpaceX lacks the managerial focus to get shit done.
2	1523889709	9	They said nasa, not starting their own decentralized SpaceX
0	1523883100	22	No concrete argument in that article about how the Ethereum technology could help their space project. Why would a decentralized system bring any advantage in that area over others?*“In this project, the Ethereum blockchain technology will be exploited to develop a decentralized, secure, and cognitive networking and computing infrastructure for deep space exploration,” Wei Kocsis says.*Replace the words **deep space exploration** with any hype terms (March exploration, AI data mining, Start Trek teleportation machine,...) and you've got your next article to post on r/cryptocurrency.That's how you create FOMO... and then crash the whole market.
1	1523900678	2	I think NASA knows what they're doing...wouldn't you think? Maybe you should apply as a consultant and let them know what's up hahaha

2	1523896377	0	I get what they are saying but the issue they talked about in terms of it taking time to communicate with scientist remain when communicating with other space vehicles. It's unlikely that there would be a enough space vehicles collocated to efficiently communicate and if there were you would likely be better off just having all the systems on one platform. There are some very interesting concepts you could use blockchain technology for in deep space travel (map collecting, signal integration/information relay, ect) but environmental collision avoidance decision making as proposed seems questionable. The first part of the proposed project seems pretty viable though. Using blockchain for machine deep learning to integrate improvements into the predictive collision algorithm would be pretty awesome but decentralizing the actual control decisions of the space vehicle would be extremely inefficient.    
3	1523902556	1	I think it makes perfect sense as there would be a decreased chance of the "one fails, all fail" type of thing. I'm generalizing here obviously, as all of their systems have redundant parts but I'm sure it makes things a little more "plug and play" when you can have parts lose comms for a little while and sync back up without having to verify with a master node of sorts.I also have no experience dealing with decentralized systems so I can only assume and am likely wrong. I've only worked/designed centralized systems which I've come to dislike because of syncing issues :)
1	1523889789	-3	Yep, totally garbage.I'm more and more believing BTC is the only project to trust. I like ETH, but decentralized computations require verification and are expensive and slow. So much bullshit in this relm. 
2	1523899037	2	Lol at the downvotes. Just shows how this sub is nothing more than a place to shill and pump coins. People hate on BTC here, but their altcoins doesn't even have a working product. The sub is filled with clueless people. 
3	1523902652	1	What's your opinion on Ripple by chance? They have showcased a fully functioning and fully implemented production product.
0	1523863859	10	I'm confused. Do they use Ethereum network for the computation or use Ethereum technology?
1	1523889721	8	Programmer here, I have 20 ETH, but this article/hype is crap.A centralized server can make the decision on earth faster than having a bunch of computers. I have no clue what they are trying to say/accomplish. Deep space decision making needs to happen on the module, not on earth. This is a central location, not decentralized.How this got published... I have no idea.
2	1523893034	1	> How this got published... I have no idea.because nasa and science, logic has no place ;)
2	1523893729	1	I can only believe it's some idea someone gave and now it's over-hyped.
1	1523886468	2	“Ethereum technology” refers to the some type of Ethereum blockchain, public or private. My guess is they would start with a private Ethereum blockchain until sharding, casper and then move onto the public blockchain.
1	1523884172	-10	uh....what? to the 7 upvoters also.....what? how hilariously uneducated on tech is this sub lulz. How can you use the 'ether technology' without being on the ether network please do let me know. The ether technologies not on the ether blockchain are know as NEO VEN and Cardano, so yeah its kinda impossible to use the ether tech and not the ether chain by design, as using ethereum means trusting the decentralized ether network to do their transactions only. Its not Ripple that any shit company can replicate it into a centralized ledger and call it blockchain
2	1523885195	16	You're not good at making friends are you.
3	1523893374	1	No need to make friends with idiots. 
0	1523891862	3	> exploitedwhy use this word? I got a really negative connotation but it seems like its a good thing?
1	1523895022	1	Yeah i thought it was a weird word to use too, makes it seem like they're doing some shady shit with it.

0	1523893593	1	lmao wtf.... this article is from my little, no-name college(well maybe not so no name, since LeBron but, still quite small for a city school). But, never in a million years thought I'd read an article from them about blockchain, let alone in this subreddit
0	1523900556	1	This is so cool!

0	1523880373	0	Fake news
0	1523896505	1	So ether is going to the moon? When lambo? 
0	1523885739	-3	Ethereum is decentralized as long as you accept vitalik as lord and savior.
1	1523887161	2	The dumbest argument of all time 
2	1523889906	-1	it's not an argument.  stating a fact.  eth, the ico factory, is not decentralized.  let's wait for the next bailout.
3	1523898354	2	Because it has a figurehead?! Do you realize how insane that line of thinking is? Also - you do know bitcoin was rolled back in its early days right? Right?!
1	1523886853	2	This isn't /r/bitcoin brah, people here are generally more favourable of ETH than BTC. 
2	1523889610	0	I know.  but we are kidding ourselves if we say eth is decentralized.  
3	1523898474	2	It runs more nodes than any other blockchain. By definition it is the most decentralized blockchain. Arguing it’s not because it has a figurehead is ridiculous. 
4	1523900942	0	Ethereum is what Vitalik decides to call Ethereum.  IF he says jump, you say how high.
5	1523901013	2	You’re either trolling or painfully unaware of how consensus is achieved with Ethereum. My brain hurts because of this discussion. Can’t argue with stupid. 
0	1523892948	0	I've lost about 1200 bucks so far on Ethereum.  Someone please let me know when it reaches ~800 again.
1	1523894461	1	Well it's going to the moon now isn't it? I mean space... I'll see myself out. 
0	1523853285	-63	You do know that space exploration is a farce right ?
1	1523858185	45	🙄 Sure buddy, all orchestrated by the secret lizard people so that people never find out that the earth is actually flat.
1	1523856089	8	what makes it a farce?
2	1523857117	-39	The fact they’re stealing millions of dollars from tax payers for computer generated images of space. 
3	1523857387	14	You aren’t serious are you ?
4	1523857554	-34	Of course I am ; if NASA told you they want to sleep with your wife would let them ? Is that how blindly you follow them. 
5	1523857689	18	You can literally see space with the naked eye? What exactly are they computer generating lol
6	1523857974	-9	You can see it, but we can’t leave earth 
7	1523858440	18	Yikes, I think maybe you might need some help brotha 
7	1523861113	13	Dude, you can literally see the space station fly by with your  bare eyes...with a telescope, you can see it up close.
8	1523866432	8	Maybe your telescope is computer generated as well/s
8	1523879142	2	You can see it, but can YOU reach it ? Didn’t think so 
9	1523881395	3	I know this is pointless because you're obviously wrapped up so hard in this worldview that nothing anyone could say would ever shake it but we can literally construct model rockets and balloons that will take us to the edge of space relatively cheaply. We can observe structures like the ISS from earth. We can bounce lasers off mirrors the Apollo program left on the moon. What kind of proof would satisfy you?
9	1523890779	1	How do you think satellite television works?  How can I call China with my cell phone?  There are virgin jets that civilians can ride, that enter space right before descending to their destination.  Space X just video recorded a rocket to space and a vehicle flying through space, you can watch that, from a private company.  It's impossible to believe what you believe.
9	1523881399	0	....so who put it there?
7	1523861116	9	Shit, someone should tell Elon Musk.
5	1523864306	1	Dude, by brother is in astrophysics (one of "them"), he laughed so hard
3	1523857274	3	i dare you to say that to buzz aldrins face
4	1523857476	-3	People have done it , he gets offended because he knows it’s all bullshit; come on now only the US has landed on the moon and no one else ever and we still haven’t colonized it ??? Be rational 
5	1523864528	7	What do you mean colonizing the moon? It was just a dick measuring contest during the cold war. It requires a ridiculous amount of resources to send someone to space and we aren't gonna colonize a rock with no oxygen
5	1523859843	4	Do you know how much of a risk that would be, how much money it would cost, and how little benefit colonizing the moon would be?It hasn't been done because there is essentially no point in doing so at this time. Mars is being considered for colonization because there are resources on that planet that make it worthwhile doing so. 
6	1523879065	1	If it’s too much of a risk why does nasa keep stealing our taxes ???? Unless you’re happy just handing them your money, that’s actually what you’re doing; mind numbing statist 
7	1523888672	1	Is every government agency stealing taxes?Also you can go watch a rocket launch...
7	1523879172	1	As someone in the UK I unfortunately don't contribute to NASA. 
8	1523879839	2	The U.K. government is just as lying and deceiving as the American government, don’t worry you’re just as brainwashed. 
9	1523880117	3	Do you find that a lot of people disagree with everything you believe in in-person? I'm not trying to pick a fight in or anything here, but when you're the odd one out telling people they're brainwashed, usually they're not.
6	1523876549	-3	So it's awfully convenient that all moon landing footage was "accidentally" destroyed?
7	1523880529	1	There seems to be results from 2009 regarding the discovery of original footage. It also doesn't appear to have been an accident, but more a cost-saving measure, as their budget fell to below 2% of the federal budget within 6 years.Though I would agree that this is still quite a stupid excuse.
5	1523884340	1	We havent colonized the moon because we landed on it and realized whoops, didnt need to come to this barren wasteland to do this which could have been done from Earth. Thats why no efforts have ever been made to go back to the moon coz the moon is so goddamn fucking boring.
6	1523885129	1	Good excuse 
3	1523877146	3	Congratulations, to one of the stupidest people on reddit. Or the best troll. I can’t decide which. 
4	1523880946	2	 I'm just so sad that our public education system failed the guy that bad
3	1523882010	2	You forget about the millions that are used just to prevent anyone with a telescope to see the truth /s
1	1523859162	18	I don't usually say this, but you're a fucking idiot
