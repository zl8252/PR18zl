Everytime they start taxing something, i.e. cryptos, they seem to make it as complex as they possibly can, with minimal explanation or directions. If newspapers are written at a 9th grade reading level so that everyone is able to understand, why does the IRS think it's a good idea to make taxes so complicated that entire professions have developed out of the need to walk people through the process?
1	1523842171	123	The IRS is actually in favor of simplifying the tax code, and has made formal recommendations to congress for decades that this get done ([source](http://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/2012-Annual-Report/downloads/Most-Serious-Problems-Tax-Code-Complexity.pdf)). The IRS doesn't make the tax code, they just enforce it, and congress needs to get it's shit together to actually make it happen. For example, one such simplification they recommend is to just let the IRS' accountants do your taxes for you - by law, every financial institution and employer has to submit *their* records of your earnings to the IRS, so the IRS already has all the data they need to do file and assess your taxes, which could save the individual taxpayer an average of $258 per year:>For 2007, IRS researchers estimated that the monetary complianceburden of the median individual taxpayer (as measured by income) was $258Historically, the problem has been that the tax-preparation industry (Intuit, H&R Block, etc.) lobbies congress strongly to prevent such measures. Tax preparation revenues are forecast to reach $11 billion in 2018 ([source](https://www.franchisehelp.com/industry-reports/tax-preparation-industry-analysis-2018-cost-trends/)), and this would seriously damage their industry. The IRS could perform this service much cheaper, and could also cut down inefficiencies that result from people misreporting their taxes (intentionally or not), which costs the IRS money to track down.In short, taxes are complicated because then you'll have to pay someone else to do them for you. This creates jobs, and the people with those jobs spend a lot of money to make sure they keep those jobs. And of course, many people get itchy at the idea of the government doing their own taxes *for them*, which feels a little incestuous, despite the fact that the government basically has to do that already so they can make sure *you're* doing them correctly. Redundant work to appease a libertarian sentiment.
2	1523850930	27	You lost me at "congress needs to get their shit together", cause that clearly is never happening. (just kidding, thought your post was informative well put together). 
2	1523886393	5	Just making it an option would work for me. Hell, they could even make money. I would pay 20 dollars to have the IRS do it for me with a guarantee that if they missed something, like crypto, that they could not come back and retroactively tax me. Kind of like audit insurance from the IRS. Of course, you would have to opt in and if you did not trust them to do it, you could continue to do it yourself or have a tax professional do it.  Seems like an easy win
2	1523848839	3	Heres the above post in a quirky video format. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj4anUL-LvY
2	1523852659	4	I never made the connection, but this is the difference between the the tax system in the UK where I live and the US one. The concept of "doing your taxes" has always been a foreign one to me, why wouldn't the IRS just tell you what you owe and then fewer mistakes would be made?
2	1523888430	2	>Redundant work to appease a libertarian sentiment.Couldn't they just provide us with an automatically generated form (_edit:_ detailing the charges), and we either* Sign it and mail back with a check* Do all our taxes as per usual and mail back with a check(FWIW am libertarian)
3	1523895863	2	Sorry if I wasn't clear, but that's exactly the process the IRS is proposing. It's called "Return Free Filing". The idea is that the IRS completes your return for you based on all the information they have, then sends you the result. You could review and amend it based on any deductions they missed, like personal business expenses. The amount of work you would personally have to do is reduced by 90%, most people would just need to sign the return and mail it back with a check or direct deposit info.
2	1523846303	3	That is super interesting. I was not aware of this. Thanks for the information.  Ignoring the lobbying of the Tax-Prep industry, I have the feeling our current president would never approve of having our taxes done by IRS accountants...
2	1523844085	2	In Canada I just download free software and punch the numbers in where it says to, then I look it over and submit it. Only people who are lazy pay H&R block or accountants. I wonder how different that american system is!
3	1523845298	2	It works the same for most people in the US too. [Software to file taxes is free](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free) if your income is <$66k, which considering the median household income in the states is $60k, means over half of all american households *shouldn't* be paying anything to file. But many people also prefer the comfort of having a professional do it for them, and to look for ways to milk out extra credits/deductions. I'm also not sure how capable those free options are of handling investments and trades like crypto or individual stocks.
4	1523846648	3	>  I'm also not sure how capable those free options are of handling investments and trades like crypto or individual stocks.They're not. Crypto tax experts are, well, experts.
2	1523890731	1	> The IRS could perform this service much cheaper, and could also cut down inefficienciesThis is the federal government you are talking about here. . .  I work for a state government and well, things are incredibly inefficient.  Feds are worse.
2	1523897350	1	> just let the IRS' accountants do your taxes for youWell there's a surefire way to pay more than necessary... 
2	1523842636	-3	> just let the IRS' accountants do your taxes for youHa,ha LOL.  Let the foxes count how many chickens are in the henhouse!
3	1523845636	7	I mean, the IRS would only know about what is reported to them... So if you do anything that would normally result in a deduction, or anything that counts as income but would not be reported... Then there is potential they might not know about it, because really YOU are the only one who knows what you did the entire year.IMO the government is suppose to serve the people. I feel like everyone forgets that...
1	1523827925	112	it being difficult is kinda the point, that way they can fuck you over if they please
2	1523833214	30	It's more so to make it so you have to hire someone to understand it for you.
3	1523839752	15	Funny, the "professionals" that I talked to & hired had absolutely no idea how to handle it and from what I can tell just went off what I told them. Not feeling confident with my taxes this year.
4	1523839987	7	They did the same to me, had to have 3 people at h&r tell my person basically what to do.Was like well you know what I paid the IRS a decent chunk of money.I have audit protection and a bunch of other stuff so worst case scenario - I did my part they entered it wrong.
5	1523842457	3	H&R isn’t trustworthy once you get past anything that requires more gam a w2 and a couple 1099s. I’d suggest finding a CPA in your area 
3	1523833425	38	Yup, another case of money in politics. Tax firms like H&R Block spend millions lobbying to keep the tax code complicated. 
4	1523837347	15	You mean Ernst and Young and friends right? H&R Block is small time compared to the Big 4
2	1523828805	36	Exactly. The IRS is essentially the SS of the US Government. The organization can solely ruin your life without any due process. 'Merica!
2	1523888020	2	taxation is theft
2	1523839364	1	Yep, it is by design. That is how the cronies operate!
2	1523887555	1	it also creates CPA jobs. Making people's life miserable is very lucrative. It forces people to work so they can try improve it.
2	1523841914	0	This. The money getting taxed out of your income goes mostly to two things: military spending and subsidies for corporations and the wealthy. As long as you can’t figure it out, there’s loopholes the top rich can go through, to grab huge refunds while everyone else picks up the tab. A product after years of lobbying and manipulation - tax is now merely extortion. So why wouldn’t they want to also start grabbing into crypto gains?
2	1523834352	0	How hard is it to know your basis and pay taxes on the gain?  
3	1523840373	1	I agree. I feel a lot of people say it's complicated because they don't want to have to figure out what they actually owe. In their defense though, a lot of people have probably made lots of trades compared to people who are hodlers. With hodling, it's a lot easier to keep track. 
4	1523842944	1	I wonder if mining could be taxed like gambling income. ugh
1	1523841035	10	Not only that, even the professionals are unsure about how to proceed.IRS: "File now, we'll tell you later how you were supposed to file and then attempt to fine or jail you if we decide you did not anticipate future court decisions correctly. "
1	1523837028	9	Cryptos are taxed in the same way as any other ivnestment, whether stocks, gold, etc.Here's how you do it!When you acquire a crypto, you record the USD amount that you acquired it for.When you unload a crypto, you record the USD amount that you unloaded it for.  It doesn't matter if it sold it for USD, CAD, ETH, a house, or a box of apples. Work out the difference of the 2, and thats your profit or loss.It's really not difficult. The main problem is that most people do hundreds of trades of exchanges and don't keep track of anything, which is irresponsible. It makes actually working out their tax owed a nightmare, so they opt for the path of "THIS IS TOO COMPLICATED"
2	1523838955	21	So what's the easiet way to find ETH price at 4.35pm on March 8 2018? Since I sold on Binance, do I have to use Binance ETH price? I have no idea how to do it. Do I use Coinbase? Since that's where I originally got ETH from? How do I find the price there? On the yearly chart it goes in 24hr blocks.Then, as an Australian, I have to do currency conversations god knows how
3	1523839308	12	Bitcoin.tax
4	1523843344	11	This doesn't take into account transfers between exchanges and holding periods of coins. It's still a nightmare with this service
5	1523867886	2	I used the API feature and it did for me for both of those things. 
4	1523840364	3	Oh yeah I have an account with cointracking. Forgot about that
4	1523840231	3	This is the $35 solution that everyone in this thread needs. Wish it wasn’t so far down.
5	1523843318	3	it doesn't account for transfers to/from exchanges.... it said my gain was way higher than it actually was, it's still a nightmare
6	1523858717	3	Is this a problem? Those events are not taxable iirc.
7	1523881190	1	Yeah the problem is it takes forever to adjust the calculation for those
5	1523846359	1	Is there not a free solution? :(
3	1523846845	1	You can get precise Binance data through the API, down to the trades grouped at the per second interval. I can get it for you if you'd like. 4:35 pm what time zone? Rather, what time is that GMT?
2	1523842137	10	This is true but not the entire story.With the removal of like-kind transactions, we can't trade between coins without recognizing capital gains taxes. Honestly, given the coins are currencies in this regard, this is dumb as fuck from the IRS.People aren't going to report taxes for trading ETH to BTC or BTC to XRP. Theyre going to report when you cash out. Otherwise, you have to pay like 40% on gains between coins in FIAT for money you dont even see because its still locked up/tied up in the investment.IRS needs to fix this. Then, and only then, will people legit take an effort to paying their taxes.IRS treats crypto like fucking real estate yet its just as much a currency. We need NEW tax laws and recognition for crypto. period.
3	1523887305	1	they have to slow down adoption of crypto. Once you can live and pay everything with crypto, game over.that's why I am holding.
3	1523844746	0	> Then, **and only then**, will people legit take an effort to paying their taxes.Well, that or a significant number of crypto investors getting audited and/or prosecuted after the IRS gets their hands on records from exchanges like Coinbase and a bunch of greenhorns learn there are real and painful consequences for tax evasion.
4	1523844944	9	Ive never cashed out on coinbase. I dont even sell on coinbase. So coinbase's records are going to be about 1% of the puzzle. Binance already told the IRS to get fucked. Decentralized exchanges will do the same. Again, no one is advocating tax evasion, but the IRS expecting people to pay money on something they dont have is going to cause the IRS to rethink this shit
5	1523851928	4	Source on Binance telling IRS to shove it? 
6	1523864375	1	Don't know a source, but being in Taiwan (as of March 2018, formerly China & Japan), there's no reason for them to cooperate.
7	1523865723	1	Binance doesn't even require user verification.
5	1523866800	2	this is what I find completely bullshit.You take all the risk, they get all the reward.  I'm perfectly fine with paying what I cash out.  Every trade is bullshit thought, just a hassle more than anything.
6	1523887386	1	they want to force back the USD into the crypto to crypto equation. they have to slow down adoption of crypto. Once you can live and pay everything with crypto, game over for USD.
5	1523845171	-1	> the IRS expecting people to pay money on something they dont have is going to cause the IRS to rethink this shitThis is... not good logic.Anyway, keep those fingers crossed.
6	1523845350	2	So you’re willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax for money you don’t have? I think that’s terrible logic.  It’s like them telling you to pay 40% capital gains tax on your amazon stock going up this year. No one is going to do this. This article is proof of it
7	1523850439	2	> It’s like them telling you to pay 40&#37; capital gains tax on your amazon stock going up this year.If you have a brokerage account and you cash out, then yes you owe capital gains tax
8	1523851185	7	> and you cash outthere's the key. No one (for all intents and purposes) minds paying tax on a fiat cash out. It's the crypto to crypto that's the bullshit part that very few are going to bother with.
9	1523851705	1	Thank you. Exactly this!
9	1523856265	1	Hey I'm with you there.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't the tax numbers balance if you compare like\-kind trades to cashing out at the end?  Not considering short term vs long term of course. 
7	1523851612	1	The gain or loss is calculated at the time of saleNot on the current value
8	1523851670	1	Not even remotely relevant. You still owe FIAT to IRS for not even cashing out.
9	1523852838	1	Yes, just like trading shares for shares creates a FIAT liability&nbsp;You used the Amazon example, which doesn't apply
7	1523890833	1	I paid thousands of dollars in taxes this year even though I wasn’t happy about it. Because it’s the law. 
2	1523840443	4	What if your total profit for a year is like $50?
3	1523844176	8	Yeah, who cares. Don't bother reporting it.
3	1523883506	1	> What if your total profit for a year is like $50?Could you add "Miscellaneous - 50.00" to your income on your tax return?  This is basically what I did here in Japan, where tax offices have people to help you file.  (And that's only if oyu need to file; most people don't, because their companies do it for them when the National Tax Agency matches their records with your company's.)I went to the tax office armed with a spreadsheet showing all my 2017 trades and my calculated gains and losses on each trade.  I had made several hundred trades and, after all of it, had about 14,100 yen in profit.  The guy didn't even take a copy of the spreadsheet; we just wrote "14,000" (rounded down to thousand-yen units) in a "miscellaneous income" box and that was the end of it.
3	1523851516	1	Report a $50 capital gain
2	1523842587	2	It's very difficult to keep detailed records of every transaction I've ever done across multiple exchanges, Shapeshift (which doesn't keep history), Shift Visa card, person to person transfers, every PoW/PoS reward, and all mining equipment I've purchased.Assuming I have detailed records of everything, how do I:1. Calculate taxes on daily PoS rewards for a year2. Calculate taxes on PoW rewards that come in by the minute for a year
3	1523863995	1	Good luck m8. I doubt that even bitcoin.tax could help you with that.
3	1523901796	1	I don't use Bitcoin.tax, but I use Cointracking.  Willing to bet it's the same thing. I have both 1 and 2, and uploading bulk records of these is quite easy.1. I have Ark. I do it by hand because it's only once/week, but I would go into teh wallet, export transactions to csv..then upload to Cointracking.2.  Exactly the same as #1. I don't have minute PoW rewards but doesn't matter. I most recently did this with probably 30+ transactions every day for my recent RVN mining adventure. Export transactions from the desktop GUI wallet to csv. Fix the formatting to be what it needs to be for Cointracking to properly recognize, and upload.Either 1 or 2 takes maybe 10 minutes per (on your first time), and <5 mins every time thereafter.  You could also do the entire year all at once, if you want. Then use Cointracking to do the rest of your tax report for you with all of your normal buys and sells etc.
2	1523840613	1	ees tru. That's how my tax guy recorded my capital gains/losses. How much it was in usd when bought, against how much it was when you traded. From there, add up all of your trades and you're good. Sorry to all the folks who traded like a madman and didn't keep track of your trades. Like the person below said, bitcoin.tax I've heard can help with that.
3	1523864072	2	bitcoin.tax can't help with exchanges that you traded on many years ago that no longer exist.
2	1523862814	1	Except it's a nightmare for those of us who mined altcoins many years ago and have no idea of the exact date or time when said coins were mined, nor have any idea if you mined solo or pool (doesn't matter anyways because nearly all of those pools are defunct), nor have any idea what the quantity was, or remember the exchanges you traded on because nearly all of those exchanges are long gone because they were scams. Not to mention, of the altcoins that you did mine, 90% no longer exist or have functional blockchains. For a lot of us, we did nothing illegal to obtain crypto currencies and we have no way to report it because we have no way of precisely explaining where our coins came from initially.
3	1523863248	1	"Hello we are the IRS and we are auditing you""Oh, sorry, it was like 10 years ago when I spent all that money and had that business where I made things that were worth money. I did not make any records of the things I made, or when I made them, or how much they were worth, or when I sold them."It's only a nightmare because you did not make records as you should have. That's not an valid excuse to not do your taxes properly.
4	1523863534	1	Spent all what money? This assumes that you put money in and got something out. For some of us there was no money going in. Also, not all of us got into crypto purely to make money. To some, mining is like a hobby. Some people mine testnet coins. Should developers or enthusiasts have to pay taxes on that as well?
5	1523863647	1	It was a crude example trying to show that not having records is not acceptable. 
2	1523866737	1	It is ridiculous.  Interpreting crypto transactions this way sets a precedent where people are going to need to track capital gains on things like mmo bartering.  taxing a change from bitcoin to ethereum is as sensible as taxing a change from dollars to nickles.
3	1523887115	1	its done on purpose.. they have to slow down adoption of crypto.Once you can live and pay everything with crypto, game over.
2	1523880688	1	Crypto to Crypto trades are the issue. If you did all your trades on GDAX, taxes are easy. If you trade across multiple exchanges and are trading crypto for crypto, its not straight forward. When you trade BTC for XLM on Binance, what's the USD BTC? Is it the GDAX value or is it the lowest possible value for BTC you can find on CMC? Also, it is not quite the same as other securities where you have to go through fiat to trade. If I have Apple and want to buy Netflix, I sell apple and use that money to buy Netflix. The crypto world is the equivalent of trading Apple for Netflix, which is a little different.
2	1523888731	1	Actually, the only thing that would remotely make any sense whatsoever, is paying tax ONLY when you cash out to FIAT, or before spending any of the profits. As well as keeping a clean bottomline (like you said, knowing exactly how much you put in compared to cashed out). The rest of it is just fucking horseshit. Over here, everyone on the stock market now only have to pay tax on whatever they transfer back to their bank account, with the initial investment as a deductable (+1.5%). However, in crypto, where I've made THOUSANDS of trades, I have to fucking reverse engineer it, calculate it back into BTC or ETH profits, into USD, then USD into my own currency. This makes absolutely 0 fucking sense. Especially since BTC fluctuates along with the USD and my own currency, so I have to check it at specific times and dates. Fuck that. 
2	1523855751	1	reporting trading crypto to crypto is about as crazy as reporting trading magic potions for magic gold in games. if the difference is decentralization, eth is a prime example of centralized trash that calls itself decentralized for zero reason and is closer to video game currency than decentralized currency. the line for reporting asset to asset trades is unclear and pointless. i only report usd connected trades.
3	1523887243	1	they have to slow down adoption of crypto. Once you can live and pay everything with crypto, game over.they cannot let crypto win the payment use case. crypto to crypto tax forces back the mighty USD into the equation. 
2	1523839602	0	What about I magically find a hardware wallet, cash out all the money in it, and tax the proceeds? 
3	1523844221	5	>When you acquire a crypto, you record the USD amount that you acquired it for.You acquired it for $0, as a result, 100% of the proceeds are taxable income.
4	1523852553	1	How bout [nah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Owndtc8h4Hc)
1	1523845870	1	There's a bill again to switch a postcard system where the IRS tells you exactly what you owe. (They already know) And force the IRS to provide IRS free filing simple and free for everyone.Guess what big companies are going to ~~bribe~~ lobby politicians to reject it again?
1	1523889048	1	Fun fact! My tax professional didn't even know how to handle my crypto! He said he had done it a few times for people who had bought/sold but since I mined then sold he was flummoxed. That's how complicated it is.
1	1523837700	0	> taxes so complicated<That is all intentionally necessary to cover up the fact people are not liable for their claimed taxes. Simple experiment, ask your tax advisor or CPA to show you the law that makes you "liable" for your federal taxes??  Please post here when you find it!
1	1523835610	0	Would say answer is in your question.
0	1523829616	30	I lost my private keys officer. Now what?
1	1523829706	13	Try to remember where you put it... maybe in 1 or 2 years you’ll suddenly find it!!! ;-)
2	1523872521	8	Best way to hodl: when you're in jail. 
1	1523831989	4	Well, they would only be coming after you if you were cashing out large sums to your bank account so it would be find the proof or they take your money.
2	1523871805	1	Oh no! The thief who stole my private keys is spending bitcoin/litecoin all over the place. The nerve!
3	1523889326	1	And oh damn he is also shipping the stuff he buys to MY address ! The nerve ! Might as well keep the stuff though right..
1	1523865012	2	You're still paying the taxes 
2	1523889517	1	But taxes on what exactly? How would anyone know what is my wallet, what is in there, and what value has it? So far, all my operations with crypto were anonymous without any id check. Also I dont live in us, which makes it a bit easier. 
0	1523844627	58	I honestly feel like since I paid taxes on my cryptos I have a 5000% higher chance of being audited than the people that didn’t even report. They will be going through crypto reports with a fine tooth comb
1	1523860409	18	Yeah I'm worried about this too. First of all, I feel like a retard for actually paying my taxes because I know none of the cool kids are doing it. Worse, I feel like I'm gonna get audited *because* I'm paying the capital gains.
1	1523862733	9	This is what I’ve been wondering as well. When it comes to life right now, I want to be as invisible to the government as possible. I don’t want to make absurd claims in my taxes, try to squeeze extra deductions or what have you. I’ll take my standard deduction and be as invisible as possible. You don’t want to give them a reason to look into you. 
1	1523862614	3	Maybe but if you made a good faith effort to report your taxes correctly it's probably a hell of a lot better than getting caught intentionally avoiding taxes. The penalties for that shit are insane and it can't be discharged. All the people in this thread that think the IRS isn't going to pay a company to a develop software to track transactions are insane. All they need is coinbase and bittrex info to get starting addresses + names. The rest is a searching algorithm.
2	1523862999	3	So people should use localbitcoins and bisq?
3	1523882597	1	What's bisq?
4	1523890158	1	The exchange formerly known as BitSquare.
0	1523840835	26	What the article is likely missing is how many CPAs in the US are unwilling to work with any clients involving cryptocurrencies for 2017 taxes. I called over a dozen CPAs in my county before finally finding one who's willing to work with cryptocurrencies. After getting turned down by nearly a dozen CPAs, in desperation I even called a business that owns a Bitcoin ATM at a local mall to find out what CPA they work with. They told me that their CPA from previous years was no longer willing to work with them for fear of risk, and that they were also looking to find someone to help them with cryptocurrency taxes. I'm doubting that my experience is particularly rare. A lot of people likely gave up on trying to find a CPA to work with them, possibly thinking that if so many CPAs won't touch cryptocurrencies, it might be better to disclose nothing.
1	1523863082	6	Let’s pause for a moment...if CPAs don’t want to fucking deal with all the work involved in this shit...do you think Joe Schmoe sitting at his desk at the IRS making 40k a year wants to deal with it either? 
1	1523893671	3	Because there is zero guidance on what you are actually supposed to do. Who'd want to put their name on a return when all they're doing is guessing at what to do.
0	1523826308	51	Im curious, how can the IRS track my trades on a decentralized exchange?
1	1523830025	64	They cant
2	1523831039	35	I guess I should have said my question is rhetorical. When the time comes to cash out, I believe technology will be 2 steps ahead off the IRS. Where there is a will, there is a way. I pay enough taxes already. 
3	1523837207	18	What happens when you get audited or go to cash out and they don't accept your two fiat gateway trades as sufficient reporting?
4	1523839674	16	Tell them to contact the owners of the decentralized exchange. 
5	1523840081	9	They would just ask for your wallet address. Block chain transactions are public after all. 
6	1523840240	19	So give them a fake one and use Monero to hide the trail. 
7	1523859754	9	Slow down there Al Capone 
7	1523862140	1	And when will you ever ever use that crypto for anything ? Buy a house or car ? 
8	1523886729	2	You can cash out in physical cash anonymously with LocalMonero
9	1523886765	2	thats fine, but if its 2 million dollars good luck using that for any large purchase. you cant buy a house with cash or even a car, without it being suspicious activity.
8	1523863904	1	Cash out small amounts at a time and when they ask how much you have in crypto, claim you have 10k and you double it every months or so, before cashing out. Or cash out a few million in one go and spend it on a house or whatever before the end of the fiscal year, point is that you avoid paying most of your capital tax.
9	1523882688	1	You will owe capital gains on whatever you cash out dude. How can you cash out a couple of million and buy a house with it without paying taxes 
4	1523839673	5	Buy a plane ticket to Bermuda and disappear
4	1523851591	7	If it's a big enough payout then you move to Thailand and rescind your citizenship like everyone else who is wanted by the US govt.
5	1523865769	2	there is an exit tax to forfeit your citizenship...
4	1523860744	1	Then you go find someone who will accept payment in crypto.
3	1523862101	1	They can track it. Unless you're trading a privacy coin or something, all transactions exist on the blockchain. The IRS is already working with companies like Palantir to develop software to make all this shit possible.
3	1523866893	1	> I pay enough taxes alreadythis, I honestly don't lose any sleep over it.  I pay a lump sum of my cash out relative to my income tax bracket.  I feel that is more than fair for them.
3	1523874366	1	They will but the IRS will catch up and then they will look back at past transactions.
1	1523834386	29	They're going to look at your bankstatements, add up all the deposits, deduct your w-2 and 1099 income and take whats left and pound a penalty up your ass.
2	1523842189	8	There are no bank statements if you mine, use a dex, or buy/sell with localbitcoins. 
3	1523863946	3	Well yeah you can get away with paying no tax if you use local bitcoins. Whether or not you should try to is a different issue.
3	1523885392	1	The IRS doesn't care about that as much as  they care about the fiat withdrawals which is exactly what most of the crypto people care about.  
4	1523890678	1	If everyones intent is purely to buy, hold, then sell... well, I have some bad news for you then. 
5	1523890783	1	Oh no! Would that bad news have anything to do with the IRS?
6	1523893233	1	No. The bad news is that a market propped up by speculation only will rapidly crash to zero. The technical and economical understanding in this thread is crazy bad. 
7	1523895642	1	Even if we shove the whole technological potency argument off the table, crypto still allows people to hedge against centralized fiat. I'm not speculating on further speculation, I'm speculating on masses of people eventually seeking to shelter their assets against governments playing fiscal games against them. That's where my confidence in my holdings comes from, I don't care what this market is currently doing, eventually that economic anxiety will force people into crypto.   Crypto does not need to have the same utility as fiat in order to provide for that need. Sure, of course, the more versatile the better, but for it to do what I want it to do, It only needs to be deflationary and somewhat accessible. 
1	1523832724	3	Any DEX usable today?
2	1523833846	6	Idex is cool
2	1523837928	4	Kyber Network for Ether and a bunch of ERC20 tokens.
2	1523837995	1	cryto\-bridge is an up and comer
3	1523845610	3	This is a Bitshares DEX with some different pairings. It shocks me how the Bitshares DEX can fly under the radar for so long and this iteration of it is somehow popular. 
2	1523864309	1	Waves
2	1523886630	1	Bitshares works for pure traders. You trade bitAssets.
1	1523837487	3	If you buy from coinbase which has your information they can track that bitcoin to an exchange and look at all the trades that happen for there on. 
2	1523839941	2	Even shapeshift? Cuz, that's amazing, I don't know how to do that. 
3	1523875059	1	Well almost all the crypto is public. So you just follow the wallets. Unless you like privacy coins. 
1	1523840181	5	Block chain transaction are public. If they really wanted to, they could easily track your transactions on a decentralized exchange. 
2	1523864278	2	I hope they have fun sifting through the blockchains for defunct coins.
2	1523852341	1	What if your coins were stolen or hacked?
3	1523862246	2	Okay. How will you ever use them if you claimed they got stolen? The moment u try to cash out you're fucked. Unless you cash out using localbitcoins or something. But suddenly you have thousands in cash you can't exactly use in any large transactions like buying a house or a car.
2	1523889770	1	Not all LN transactions are published
1	1523828038	16	The NSA has the tools backdoor straight through your intel chip, they could get whatever info they needed if they really wanted. Obviously the IRS won't go that far
2	1523832230	20	You think the NSA is operating on behalf of the IRS to make sure you pay your taxes?edit: [Seems I was wrong](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/03/10/surprise-nsa-data-will-soon-routinely-be-used-for-domestic-policing-that-has-nothing-to-do-with-terrorism/?noredirect=on).
3	1523834103	11	NSA has more important things to worry about than if people are paying the correct taxes on crypto..fuck them
4	1523834464	7	No they don't.  Why do you think it's legal to spy on citizens now?
5	1523861232	1	keep thinking the government cares that much..there's ways around everything in life and a ton of people aren't stressing..but you can think our government is making this a top priority...lol
4	1523868953	1	lol, clearly you dont know how big the NSA is and how many people they employ :D
5	1523892407	1	you really think taxes on cryptos is a big priority for the USA at this very moment? please..they're saying all this crap about how you can face fines and serve time to scare the shit out of people.
3	1523845285	6	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/03/10/surprise-nsa-data-will-soon-routinely-be-used-for-domestic-policing-that-has-nothing-to-do-with-terrorism/?noredirect=on
4	1523850496	3	Holy fuck. Thanks for that, that's beyond disturbing. 
3	1523868922	1	yes.Land of the fee - home of the slave.
2	1523845494	3	That's why you build a dedicated PC with hardware that's compatible with Libreboot and use that pc to do your trading! Or one with an older AMD chip that doesn't have PSP.
1	1523838953	6	They can't it's just a scare tactic to keep you in the middle class.
1	1523841669	2	If you aren't using Monero (or maybe Zcash) then every transaction you made is stored on the blockchain forever so if you slip up on opsec you're boned
2	1523859356	1	You can't trade Zcash on any exchange with private transactions, they force you to use the public ones.  
1	1523836059	1	Of course not 
1	1523861149	1	Thats why I think this year a big movement towards DEX, especially for US citizens. 
1	1523894787	1	Very difficult unless they do blockchain analysis and trace back your fiat exchange wallets to your dex wallets
0	1523831877	45	Wall Street is VERY honest tho
0	1523830176	59	I claimed the money that i cashed out, but i’m not claiming all 5,000 coin to coin transactions.
1	1523831036	63	Yeah that's where I call bullshit on the IRS.  I don't pay taxes when I trade my pb&j for my buddy's slice of pizza. 
2	1523837671	28	Well u should report ur gains in that instance and tell ur buddy he can report his losses too;)
2	1523838631	10	you should in their eyes
3	1523839495	38	They also want you to report your illegal drug sales. >Illegal activities: Income from illegal activities, such as money from dealing illegal drugs, must be included in your income on Form 1040, line 21, or on Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040) if from your self-employment activity.
4	1523841926	22	Lmao, they're delusional
5	1523845132	6	Throw everything at the wall and see what sticks
5	1523851415	2	That's not delusional at all. That's literally how they got Al Capone. Tax evasion.
4	1523864670	2	I wonder if anyone has been stupid enough to report income from illegal activities?
1	1523836089	19	That's what everyone is basically doing.  Pay on net gain 
2	1523836288	6	Indeed
2	1523891323	2	I paid on crypto to crypto trades. It hurt. 
2	1523841972	5	Wish I could do that on my stock trades.
3	1523856050	11	You don’t trade stocks for other stocks though, do you? Just USD <-> stock and pay taxes on the delta. 
4	1523864510	3	You win ;)
4	1523889201	1	Foreign currencies sometimes, but yeah you are correct there.  I think that is just bartering which needs to be reported too.  Do you think that the Stock exchanges wouldn't have developed trading pairs yet of big stocks if they thought they could exploit this 'loophole'.Personally, I would like to see one big registered account that you put cash in, trade to your hearts' content, and when you withdraw cash to consume, you are taxed 100% as income.  Easy peasy.
1	1523831783	10	Good luck
1	1523840482	1	I wish you the best of luck if/when you're audited.
2	1523848421	2	Thanks man.
2	1523840495	3	K
3	1523840595	3	Like, honestly, dude... if you actually want to get away with that, don't talk about it in a public setting.
4	1523840719	8	Dude, you realize 98% of traders here didnt claim their coin to coin..right?? Its a fucking broken system and even they know it. They arent going to go after the ones who STILL PAID THEIR TAXES WHEN THEY CASHED OUT. They will be going after the people who didnt pay anything at all. Just because you got overtaxed because u had no idea what you were doing, dont try to get others fucked like u did
5	1523848179	1	You clearly have no understanding of the law. If you’re a successful trader how do you plan on reporting the excess coins that you have no proof of purchase for? If you accumulated an extra 100 Eth through trading but have no receipt of it, when you cash out to fiat how are you gonna show where those gains came from? You’ll need to have records of the crypto-to-crypto transactions, which is currently a taxable event in the US. I agree the law is flawed, but not reporting is still a crime - and the possibility of getting audited is not worth it. 
6	1523848913	1	They ar still getting the tax from the ether so who cares
5	1523840918	0	Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it isn't the law.Stock traders have been dealing with this for years.  If you don't like it, move.The biggest traders I personally know all claimed coin to coin.  It was hassle, but they did it.
6	1523840963	1	Lol you just showed u have no idea what you’re talking about! Stock traders dont have to claim stock to stock trades moron. 
7	1523841153	4	Have you ever traded stock?  Take a look at your tax slip: ever single sell you made is counted for and taxed.Good luck fighting for like kind in 2017.  2018 you can't.
8	1523847289	4	You can't trade stock for stock buddy. It's impossible.
9	1523849252	1	That's what I was alluding to.  You can buy and sell on exchanges but not trade.Technically speaking, as far as I'm aware, one can trade stock for stock directly privately without the assistance of a brokerage.  And, at least before 2018, that maybe could have been counted as like kind.  I don't know enough to say for sure one way or another, however.
8	1523841803	2	I didnt say anything about 2018. This is all for 2017.  Havent traded a single coin to coin in 2018
4	1523848571	2	The only response I have seen here from an actual accountant who has spoken to the IRS on this is that you don't need to claim coin-to-coin transactions for 2017. I mean, seriously, there is no widely available guidance on this, people aren't going to get fucked because they didn't comply with some standard that the IRS hasn't even decided on yet.
1	1523833163	0	As long as you dont try to falsely claim long term capital gains tax on those coins when they were actually subject to short term gains rates, that's perfectly fine and probably preferred.
2	1523838204	8	>As long as you dont try to falsely claim long term capital gains tax on those coins when they were actually subject to short term gains rates, that's perfectly fine and probably preferred.>>>That's not the law in the US.  This is not "preferred" in any sense of the word unless you're comparing it to not paying at all.
3	1523840525	1	"Preferred" as in "sort of better than doing nothing at all, maybe"
0	1523827948	103	They seem really pleasant, they called me up and stayed on phone while I went and bought itunes gift cards to pay them.  Its good karma because right after I got an email from a Nigerian prince that wants to pay me to help move some money for him AND I got a hot tip on something called bitconnect
1	1523834829	5	Hey Hey Hey 
2	1523834989	8	Wasa wasa wasa wasa wasa
1	1523832663	0	Funny
0	1523838893	13	lol, maybe they should change the policy then, simple as that. They want people to pay and be honest, create a FAIR policy.
1	1523841326	4	I agree with you, the Taxes are ridiculous, but I have too much on the line to risk it.
2	1523841470	1	[deleted]
3	1523843438	2	Did you ever cash out into fiat though? Just curious if you had a late chunk of money appear in your bank account and the IRS didn’t care?
4	1523846198	1	I cash out into fiat once every quarter
3	1523843420	1	"Sorry, my private key was compromised. infected malware on my pc. My wallets are no longer my wallets."
0	1523839560	13	What I'm wondering is this: What is the problem with just reporting your crypto gains as 'Other income - Line 21' in the year that you cash out, instead of  going through all the bullshit of tallying up trades that never materialized into fiat into a bank, even if they are from previous years? If I cash out, pay my fair share of taxes and just declare it as other income then what could potentially happen?
1	1523846769	1	You are basically putting yourself up at the mercy of IRS by doing this. If they audit you at some point in the coming months/years, and you kept doing this, then guess what? You risk getting charged with tax evasion at the worst case scenario or get heavily fined as the best case scenario. 
2	1523848328	6	I totally agree and understand. I think the reason why we keep hearing about this now though is because a lot of noobs made a lot of money in crypto at the end of the year and then saw all that money literally go down the drain, to which they don't have enough to cover taxes for, which puts a lot of these people in a hard spot. 
0	1523842146	19	With the removal of like-kind transactions, we can't trade between coins without recognizing capital gains taxes. Honestly, given the coins are currencies in this regard, this is dumb as fuck from the IRS.People aren't going to report taxes for trading ETH to BTC or BTC to XRP. Theyre going to report when you cash out. Otherwise, you have to pay like 40% on gains between coins in FIAT for money you dont even see because its still locked up/tied up in the investment.IRS needs to fix this. Then, and only then, will people legit take an effort to paying their taxes.IRS treats crypto like fucking real estate yet its just as much a currency. We need NEW tax laws and recognition for crypto. period.
1	1523862352	1	Like kind exchanges for crypto to crypto are a very very very dark grey area that any legit CPA will strongly recommend against (for 2018, it's 100% not allowed anymore).As you admitted, to the IRS crypto is considered property and not currency. Until that chancges, not following the tax law is simply illegal.
0	1523863476	7	Paying taxes on digital cash with 100% accuracy is like waiters paying taxes on their cash tips with 100% accuracy.
1	1523887927	2	Lol I agree. 
0	1523827014	35	Between irs,scammers,hackers,fees.Is there even a point investing 😂
1	1523840159	10	It's either more of the same or violent revolution, I guess. 
1	1523867035	3	Seriously..You either get rich, get robbed or go to jail trying.This space is honestly beyond risky for anyone actually trying to make serious life changing money, as depending on how you trade up..Literally all of the money you made could be considered a gain and then some.And if you lack the money gg.
1	1523846426	2	Absolutely..... if you can figure out the right loopholes!
1	1523846422	1	Profit
0	1523826718	12	Also, people using credit karma tax are probably less likely to have investments
0	1523824739	4	I didn't under report, but I claimed like for like trades and defferred gains on everything. I reported it all though, so I'm not hiding it. Just openly trying to fit through the lgal loophole. 
1	1523863207	1	And if they decide to make an example out of you, you will have to take it to court or pay a shitload of penalties. 5% for every month you didn't pay, plus some other percentage I can't remember. I'm super tempted to try like for like exchange as it wasn't clarified until just recently that it would be for real estate only. But it's really fucking risky 
0	1523847919	6	because it couldnt be any more complicated to report. its like you have to be in the matrix to figure that shit out. force the exchanges to give their users tax forms if you want them to file. 
0	1523823636	59	There is no statute of limitations on your taxes. If the IRS gets it together and effectively enforce crypto tax policy in the near future and they come after your 2017 taxes...you’re REKT! I’ve had run ins with them before. They are merciless, persistent, and unyielding. Do not roll the dice folks.
1	1523824610	45	Plus, because blockchain will *forever* record your transactions, it'll be trivially easy for them at some future point to run software against it to easily find tax evaders. Ruh roh. 
2	1523829033	22	Maybe for some, but if you're a miner, who trades on a dex, then good luck hunting for those taxes. 
3	1523837326	6	So you cash out and tell them "sorry, I don't have any trade data because... reasons" and they'll just drop it no problem? 
4	1523837450	17	Use localbitcoins, cash with no paper trail.
5	1523859339	2	localbitcoins would still have a record, the police in the UK monitor it
5	1523851160	1	Hard to buy a house with cash
5	1523862918	1	Go for it. If you only made a couple grand. Good luck with more.
4	1523839142	1	You don't need to "cash out," and if you do, you don't have to use a government regulated exchange. Even if you do cash out with a KYC/AML exchange, they won't know about your trading history, and thus those trades are not taxed. 
5	1523842720	1	If you had a coinbase account could they ask for your address and then trace it back to Binance and see your trades? Or would they just see the Binance wallet and have no clue which belonged to whom? Maybe they could ask Binance for your info too?
6	1523842835	2	You can just not use Coinbase or Binance. 
7	1523863013	0	Stop giving people shitty advice, you're gonna get them fucked if they decide to listen. You think it's hard to get an address from coinbase and trace its transaction history elsewhere ? Lmao. Its trivially easy for software. This will not be a manual task.
8	1523890291	2	Maybe understand what's being said first. I haven't advised anyone to do anything. Everything I've said is factually true. 
5	1523839539	0	Just because they don't know it doesn't mean they won't require it. Do you think stock traders can just not report each trade?
6	1523841293	2	No. I don't think you understand. Stock trades are recorded and linked with users. They disclose all tax related information to the IRS. If I mine, no data is being disclosed to the IRS. If I trade on a dex, no data is being disclosed to the IRS. If I mine and then trade on a dex, the IRS will not have any data indicating I own, or have ever owned, any cryptocurrency. 
7	1523846048	1	Yeah, trust me, I understand. What you don't understand is simply hiding shit from the IRS, if it's true all trades are taxable events, doesn't mean you can just cash out crypto and pretend like your two fiat gateway trades are all your records.But hey, you won't be the first or the last to think they are more clever than government tax authorities 
8	1523851407	2	I wasn't insinuated that. I'm pointing out a techincal fact. 
9	1523859835	-1	Alright Al Capone, good luck with that 
3	1523840340	1	Mining profits are taxed as regular income. 
4	1523840748	4	You've missed the point. 
3	1523852282	1	How would you explain the money that popped in your bank account, or the lambo in your front yard?
4	1523852710	3	You don't ever have to exchange crypto for fiat. 
5	1523876751	1	So are you not going to spend the crypto? I said how would you explain the lambo in your front yard, not just about money but about commodities and the like. 
6	1523888199	1	maybe don't buy a lambo?
6	1523889016	1	I have no interest in buying a lambo or any other crazy, flashy things. I make a good income as it is. 
2	1523839559	3	But, people create fake accounts with other peoples names all the time. Sooooo linking the right person to the correct address will be a headache and a pretty penny the IRS will not be able to afford. That whole organization has been getting smaller and smaller year after year with budget cuts.
2	1523871511	1	Monero.
2	1523888131	1	they have to slow down adoption of crypto. Once you can live and pay everything with crypto, game over.Tracking on the blockchain will then be pointless.
3	1523891699	1	It doesn't make any difference to the tax man whether you're using crypto or not. As long as they're backed by government and can lock you up you're in their world.Even assuming some sort of libertarian utopia where government doesn't exist tracking will always have value, any personal data can be used to profile and influence you. 
4	1523896564	1	it does. Imagine everyone uses Monero. The only tax possible will be the sales tax.
2	1523903983	1	Thank God for monero. 
1	1523824619	31	stop shilling the IRS /s
2	1523837076	9	What exchange is IRS listed on? Seems like it'll moon soon from all the hype!
1	1523824832	14	Just curious what exactly your horror story is. The IRS can't do shit to me. I have nothing. No assets, no real estate, nothing of value. The IRS can lick my asshole after I take a shit. Come at me bro. I'll pay the taxes that they force me to pay, but it's going to cost them 10x to audit me than they will ever recover. 
2	1523825013	41	Wage garnishment threats. Two years plus of back and forth correspondence concerning underreported gains/wages. (They were proven wrong eventually and returned my money.) It was a nightmare and an uphill battle.
3	1523825216	5	what exactly was so difficult about it? You show them paystubs and what is more complicated than that? I assume they have access to your financials regardless of if you provide them, so why was it such a big issue?

There’s a 99% chance they won’t ever come after Joe Crypto and his unreported gains. Do you really want to chance being that guy that gets steamrolled though?
3	1523825350	-1	> Wage garnishment threatsBut hopefully by that point in time BTC and alts explode in price and most people don't need to work any more thanks to their crypto investment. 
3	1523839693	1	wage garnishments haha Ive been trading stocks and crypto since 2014 on a full time basis, wage garnishments my ASS! I smell a scare tactic.
2	1523845138	6	They will come after any bank account you ever get. Any payroll taxes paycheck. Any property you own will be get a lien. They will send someone to your house to find things of value you and force an auction. They get paid. Every time. Don't kid yourself.  I oweed them 40k at one point and thought like you. Guess how that turned out.
3	1523863357	2	Wow that's scary. Buy Bitcoin to get out of such a horrible fiat Ponzi scheme
4	1523885385	1	Bitcoin doesn't magically make you exempt from Federal laws. 
3	1523845568	1	I would only owe 800$, so if they want to take it that far I could just pay it...
4	1523884765	1	Except that by the time they finally get around to you, it will be 4000 after taxes and interest accumulate. Just pay it and move on with your life. Or don't and have this haunting you for the next decade.
2	1523842088	6	It doesn't cost them anything, they are getting paid their taxpayer funded salary whether they come after you or sit at their desk. But you go ahead and play Billy Badass.
3	1523843729	0	Their salaries don’t cost nothing.... 
4	1523895386	1	To you, individually, not really. But they are getting paid and they don't care whether it's for digging up your b-hole looking for records and transactions or whether it's going to yet another meeting on workplace fraternization rules.
5	1523897231	1	Ok so the powerless IRS peons do what they are told. But there is some IRS superior they have whose orders they are following, and if you go up far enough, they are NOT worried about people like me. 
2	1523845664	2	You don't have to have anything for them to send you to jail for willful tax evasion.
3	1523846031	1	It’s not willful tax evasion or even tax evasion. I claimed it all, I just claimed it as like for like. If they don’t like it they can inform me. Otherwise it’s not tax evasion 
2	1523872260	1	They can throw you in jail.  
2	1523886825	1	You think the government cares about spending $10 to recover $1? Do you live under a rock? How about Iraq?IRS can send you in an unrecoverable tailspin. Fines, penalties, interest, massive wage garnishment ( source: intuit; During 2017 for example, a single parent with two children who files as head of household can be left with as little as $413.46 per week. This means that if you earn $1,000 per week, the IRS takes $586.54 of it, and if you earn $2,000 per week, it can take $1,586.54.) property seizure and more.There’s a reason you see people saying not to mess with IRS. The audit process alone is no joke.
3	1523888523	1	What if you make 100$ a week? 
2	1523828860	-3	the IRS is not a for-profit agency.  that is, just because you have nothing, or that it'd cost more to audit you than you could pay, means nothing.  they have infinite money and get paid the same no matter how much money they recover.
3	1523831182	4	Then why don’t extremely poor people get audited? 
3	1523836232	3	Not true. They maximize the expenditure of energy/value. Which is why everyone doesn't get audited in the first place....lack of resources. If your income is high, you are more likely to get audited because the return is higher. 
1	1523825658	3	Are you that rekt if you actually pay the taxes on all your gainz, just late? I think most people aren't paying because they never actually cashed out and realized those gains into fiat but when they do, whether it be this year or next, I'm sure most will actually pay their % , albeit late. 
2	1523837329	11	It's not about cashing out.If you buy BTC at $1000 each, then trade that BTC for ETH later on when BTC is worth $2000 - you have sold your BTC and owe tax on it.Every single trade is a taxable event.
2	1523840393	3	Oh yeah, they add significant late penalties.
2	1523834271	2	Yes.  IRS adds a 20% fee if the amount you didn't pay is large enough, I believe a certain percentage of your total taxes for that year.  
1	1523828970	2	As long as you're in communication and make an effort, the IRS is not the boogey man. They will work with you, give you time, and set up payment plans. 
1	1523862887	1	Yep, I think they have something like 6 years to go after you lol. It might be even more if they suspect tax evasion I think. The software already exists for tracking trades on EtherDelta, in fact I used it to file my own taxes this year. Imagine what the fucking IRS will have in 6 years or less with contracts given to Software companies like fucking Palantir. Noobs need to face the facts and just pay the taxes..
1	1523832384	1	> There is no statute of limitations on your taxes. It's generally considered to be three years, or six if you're out of the country or otherwise uncontactable. 
2	1523843037	1	Not for tax evasion.
2	1523846761	1	If they think you are evading taxes there is no limit. 
3	1523850571	1	Not legally, but there are practical limits. 
0	1523831090	11	I'm Canadian so I'm not as afraid of the CRA auditing my Quadriga or my Binance or what have you. My plan is to keep track of my cost basis for each coin by simple average and to treat all crypto/crypto trades as like kind exchanges and to report gains only when converting back to fiat. I hope there won't be any problems with this.
1	1523841871	10	They probably apologize for auditing you
1	1523839732	2	Do you have any information if binance will be sharing info with the Canadian government?
2	1523843628	2	No I have no information on that and I wouldn't be too concerned about that until they force users to be verified.
1	1523844766	2	As a Canadian...I didn't tell shit about my 2017 gains to my accountant. P.S: I just spent my tax refund.
1	1523840543	2	Yeah, you're supposed to report every trade in Canada, too.  Crypto is considered a barterable good.
2	1523844075	2	I am keeping track of all my trades in case of an audit. Hopefully it shouldn't come to that.
3	1523845068	2	Hopefully.  Best of luck.
2	1523852507	1	What's the current rate for BTC : goats, or ETH : cooking oil? Coinmarketcap doesn't list them
3	1523880562	1	You convert the barterable goods to their fiat value and pay tax as such.No need to get snarky, mate.
1	1523862093	1	Not sure about Canada, but for pre 2018 in the US no CPA will "let" you file crypto to crypto as like kind exchanges, for sure not in 2018 anymore.
1	1523889175	1	Canadian here, just talked to my accountant and they told me I don't have to worry about it until I cash out 
2	1523895585	1	Get a new accountant.
0	1523834591	8	Bank statements? What if a company in Shanghai China has a credit card where I deposit my crypto and then they convert it to fiat for me to spend? How would the IRS even know I had such a card?  Technology will be 2 steps ahead. 
1	1523874684	1	they will catch up eventually and then will look at previous years.

0	1523839410	16	I Did my taxes yesterday with bitcoin.tax. It was extremely cheap and easy to use with turbotax. I feel such a weight lifted off my shoulders knowing I followed the proper procedure. The people taking the risk of not reporting are risking their future freedom and could be jeopardizing their future family as well.
1	1523840096	12	It cost me about $140 total. I used the premiere version of turbo tax (need to use download version and not online one) and bitcoin.tax for the crypto side of things. You can easily import all your trades from all the major exchanges. Honestly, I wouldn't know how to properly report everything without this software. Feels good knowing I did my due diligence, in case I get an audit. Crypto activity could be an automatic red flag for an audit in the future.
2	1523840868	8	Did the same! Super easy. Was literally losing sleep over it but turned out to be simple... Next year's however, ugh. Not looking forward to my attempts at day trading on mutilple exchanges.
3	1523862856	1	Ha! Same thing. I tried day trading to increase my bitcoin stack. Ended up with like .00015 more BTC. Something like $9 across 5 trades over the course of a week. Not worth it. 
1	1523847671	3	How does this work if each exchange has the trade history in a different format? Do you have to clean it all up nicely into a single format to submit to bitcoin.tax? On some exchanges I can't even see my full trade history.
2	1523863321	3	Bitcoin.tax cleans it up for you. Best $30 I've spent recently. It will import from most popular exchanges and you can manually enter the ones not supported. Then it tells u how much you'll owe and it gives you the necessary documentation. 
1	1523843348	3	but you cashed out your crypto gains, right? you didn't just trade BTC for an alt coin and left it all in, did you?People aren't worried necessarily about paying taxes for what they cash out. They're worried about paying taxes for capital gains transactions between coins.I'm sure as hell am not going to pay the IRS 40% of my gains in FIAT money to them when i moved from bitcoin to Ethereum. Thats money I do not fucking physically have. How the hell are they going to tax you for money you haven't recognized, and may go to zero, when its all still inside the market.Whats worse is youre only allowed to report losses up to like $3,000 or something stupid. Like, what the fuck. 
2	1523861957	1	You DO have to pay gains on crypto to crypto trades. Stupid or not is a whole different question, but if you don't, you're evading taxes. I'd doesn't get any simpler than that.
2	1523844235	1	bitcoin.tax calculated all my gains and losses from alt trades. The Tax System is bullshit, but unfortunately as the old cliche goes "it is what it is".
3	1523844511	7	No, dude, you don't get it.Calculating it, while a headache, isn't complicated. bitcoin.tax makes it easy.What is fucked up and is stopping people FROM doing their taxes is the IRS wants money from us on coin-to-coin trades where we never see the fucking money on it. If i bought $10,000 of bitcoin in January and by December its worth $100,000 and i then trade BTC for ETH, IRS wants to tax me roughly 40% on that $90,000 gain when I've not even seen the fucking money. Its still sitting in ETH. So you either need to sell 40% of your ETH to pay taxes, or you need to have money already set aside to pay the taxes.Its a broken fucking system. I'm not advocating skipping out on taxes. were all fine paying taxes for what is rightfully owed. However, this is fucking bullshit and I'll not buy into the IRS extorting us to sell our shares.6 months from now we'll have Substratum running a decentralized internet, sending traffic to decentralized exchanges, where we can do cross-chain atomic swaps with Komodo. Around this time I'm assuming most peoples transactions will be impossible to track and the IRS will either change their stance or get fucked
4	1523852883	3	You are making a decision to put yourself into a tight spot in the future if you reinvest 100&#37;, and not setting aside the portion for capital gains taxes.  The challenge that I see with reporting crypto tax is keeping straight which coins you've taxed and when.  You may only trade with a portion of your stack, and some will have x&#37; of their total cost basis taxed.  Especially if you later consolidate holdings on multiple exchanges into a single wallet, or have short term vs long term capital gains rate implications.  It gives me a headache.  
5	1523859853	2	I think a lot of people, me included, learned quite a bit about the importance of setting $ aside.  In the past I mostly just leaned on software, but now it's important that I understand at what rate I'll be taxed so I can set the right amount aside.Your point about consolidating sounds nightmarish... I had a situation like that and I'm not even sure how to keep track of it.
4	1523845765	1	That sucks man, I am sorry your in this position. I hope you can pull it off.
4	1523863426	1	90k gains falls into the 28% tax category I believe. 
1	1523864246	2	>  could be jeopardizing their future family as wellGod, you sound like the North Korean government threatening to put people's families in concentration camps because they weren't loyal.
1	1523863510	1	IRS shill
1	1523840214	1	Did you do the TurboTax import from bitcoin.tax? I attempted it, but I didn't see how to import it. If so, which version of TT did you use?
2	1523840423	0	I had that same issue at first, but then I read online you have to use the download version of turbo tax to do the import. I used the premiere version. It was around $110 with taxes and fees. I filed my entire return with the online version before realizing tthis, but you can easily save it and import it to the download version of TT.
1	1523846806	1	Same here yesterday as well, it's not worth the stress reguardless of how anyone may feel about it.
0	1523829181	9	Would you invest in this new IRS coin? 
0	1523846665	3	It's nearly impossible to report for a lot of people. Unless of course you pay a "crypto tax specialist" $700 (one price I was quoted personally). Since Bitcoin.tax also doesn't work for a lot of people. The information you find online and on Reddit is basically useless - they don't provide actual instructions on how to report. Try to report with a service such as TurboTax - good luck. If you're a long term holder, maybe. Any trades - good luck.
0	1523888314	3	My approach is to only pay taxes on the money I convert to fiat and it gets recorded as income. I don't take losses to fiat, therefore I wouldn't record a loss. Honestly, I don't really pull money out to fiat because I don't have any use for the money. I put it there as a 2-5 year investment and that's really where it will stay until it matures. As far as crypto to crypto transactions, if it's $50,000 ETH to BTC, that's a fair exchange of 1:1 with no profit, and I wouldn't claim that either. I don't see it being valid to tax cryptocurrencies on every transaction. The tax law should really be written to group all cryptocurrencies together into one category. When you close your position on that category (Moving from Crypto to Fiat), its a taxable event.
0	1523829576	7	Good. 
0	1523831872	4	That article didn't really list any proof that people are under reporting. While I'm sure it's happening, who thinks that is the majority? I thought the majority were the late comers who got rekt selling for a loss or stuck holding bags?
1	1523857091	2	They got their data from Credit Karma. Crypto sites like Bitcoin.tax aren't compatible. No one is going to use Credit Karma to report Crypto when Bitcoin.tax allows you to export a CSV file for TaxAct / HR&Block / TurboTax.PS: I reported my gains. I'm not going to risk it, even if the IRS has trouble getting records now that doesn't mean in the next 1-3 years they won't be able to get them easier. I used Bitcoin.tax -> TaxAct. It was a pretty painless process honestly.
1	1523844568	5	> According to reports from Credit Karma tax platform, revealed by CNBC, fewer than 100 people out of 250,000 who claimed to have holdings in crypto reported capital gains on their crypto investments to IRS.

0	1523825738	16	IRS is a well oiled organized crime syndicate. They are criminals who destroy people's lives. They break laws each and everyday that they remain active. Fraud? Check. Breach of trust? Check. Extortion? Check. Racketeering? Check. The list goes on. Criminals full stop. Anyone who doubts this needs to educate themselves. Take a look in the mirror and recognize who you truly are. Only then will you discover that the IRS and every other tax collection agency across the globe has no power over you besides the fear, intimidation, force and coercion they use to control you. It's despicable, it's shameful, disgusting and sickening what these mentally ill people get away with. Time to wake up my brothers and sisters.

And before some moron with ZERO nuance comes out and says, "but but muy roads" I already pay around 40% income tax and tax on every single item I purchased; inclusing gas which has a road tax moron.

2	1523839651	19	Not really. The so-called representatives are all bought and paid for.
3	1523854777	7	People really don't like reading history, especially the history of Rome, where the late-stage Roman Republic is just people bribing each other, and free stuff for the masses, and brutal power struggles with personal armies. But nope, America is somehow different despite being made up of the same sort of people who liked calling their government a "republic" but having a king in all things but name and could not ultimately save their civilization by voting. Nevermind the Gracchus Brothers, trying to introduce reforms until the people in charge had one of them killed and drove the other to suicide. Nope, nothing like that will ever happen, because we're a "republic of laws" which now has laws that were unthinkable 50-100 years ago. 
3	1523846703	2	Certainly not a president representing anyone but his own business interests.
2	1523854259	0	Representation is not the same as consent, nor is it the same as actual power and influence. You can have as much representation as you want in, say, North Korea, but it doesn't change who exactly runs everything, and how they want it run, and who has the guns to enforce what they want. So much for your power of representation. If everyone has it, it's not that valuable; if American politics is a good indicator, people only care about *muh representation* only after a few years of not thinking about it and everyone wants to feel moral and civic-minded when they probably get their political information from comedians and celebrities, rather than some boring old man or some book no one reads. Then, what about consent? If you don't consent being taxed, so what? You don't get to not pay taxes just because you don't consent, do you? The government will chase you regardless of "consent". So much for consent anyway. I mean, I guess the "Terms of Use Agreement" for a country can be declined if: 1. You commit something illegal like tax evasion, or 2. move the hell out of your country for some tax haven. (Though it's probably too expensive for you to live there). 
1	1523853789	1	There's plenty of "representation", it's just you have no personal consent. It's all mob rule, just like the markets- you're the one bagholder, everyone sells or buys because everyone else sells or buys. Then, you'd have oligarchs who are, like the rest of us, self-interested- they're just better than you at getting what they want.  You think they want *you* to stop their good times? Even they have agendas, and they have the power and influence to do what you, even if you form some sort of anti-tax policy group, cannot. George Washington was at the head of an army sent to crush veterans that served under him because of taxes on whisky, for crying out loud. You really think that power and influence is decentralized, that you have as much power and influence as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, etc,? I'm not even tinfoil-hatting here. You think you have the same importance as these people through what, voting? People make such a big deal about voting, as if the people they elected will somehow call them and thank them for their support, or that they'll directly benefit from policies that are estranged and irrelevant to them unless they're one of those few dedicated activists with some sort of autism over some obscure issue no one else cares about. 
1	1523879299	1	Finally a sane comment. A sea of slaves and sheeple in this thread 
1	1523847085	0	oh boy. I hope you sovereign citizen types GTFO crypto community already. One of the worst ways crypto will stop getting widespread adoption is when the "taxation is theft" bullshit spouting individuals exist in large numbers here. What makes crypto investors like you to ignore the rule of law when stock market investors have to follow heavy set of regulations? Its basically making it easy for regulators to clamp down hard on cryptos with no support from general voting population. 
0	1523845504	2	For those of you who plan on reporting all your coin to coin trades, what are your habits like?  I don't want to mess around with the IRS, but I also don't want to have the freedom to day trade a bit.  I got into the market about a month ago, and since then I have just held on to the coins I initially purchased.
1	1523853934	1	Unless you have strong trading experience or are willing to put in serious hours of research, I would stick to dollar cost averaging and hodling until you hit your moon.  I'm not convinced I have a competitive advantage with day trading, and the tax hassle tips the scales.Now I might reconsider if crypto bubbles again and I get that feeling that the recent gains are unsustainable and irrational \- I felt that way last December and didn't act on it, and lost a lot of potential profit.  But if I cash out at the top, I'll be able to afford a CPA who knows crypto.

2	1523827385	-1	I guess you don't like things like being ethical and not pointing guns at people and robbing them. Guess you hate freedom and government based on individual rights. Don't call me names, I'm reporting you for violating rule #1.

1	1523825849	3	I would agree much more when speaking about a tax on your own labor. When it comes to investment, I think a much larger swath of people see it as an acceptable way to fund the legitimate functions of government. Of course, some might prefer no funded government at all, but that's a tiny sliver of people IMO. 
2	1523826342	-1	> people see it as an acceptable way to fund the legitimate functions of governmentSorry, but the ends don't justify the means. Taxation is unethical, no matter how many people think it's ok. 
3	1523840320	0	unethical to you...
4	1523840822	2	 I also oppose inflation and  central banking.

2	1523830746	0	Thanks for your opinion, Stalin.
1	1523828993	0	Im libertarian but taxation is theft doesnt make sense. The governmwnt owns these borders, if you choose to stay within them then you need to follow the laws. Someone having houserules if you choose to be a visitor isnt an invasion of rights
2	1523830710	2	I'm not libertarian. I'm a laissez-faire capitalist. > The governmwnt owns these borders, if you choose to stay within them then you need to follow the laws. Any government that violates the rights of it's citizens is not a legitimate government. No man can just decide that I am subject to a contract I never signed, just because I'm in their proximity, sorry. The ends don't justify the means, there is no possible justification for violating the non-agression principle and you should know that, as a "libertarian".
3	1523830719	5	Hey, T3PHR0Cactus, just a quick heads-up:  **agression** is actually spelled **aggression**. You can remember it by **two gs**.  Have a nice day!^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
4	1523830781	-1	spambot
5	1523831951	4	Wow, it’s achieved self-awareness.
3	1523833455	1	Libertarianism is all about consent. Nobody is forcing you to stay in the US, you can pack up and leave if you wish. But if choose to stay in the nation's borders which is their property then you are consenting to also following their laws. It would only violate NAP if we were simultaneously restricted by the state from leaving the country and had to pay taxes
4	1523834107	3	> Nobody is forcing you to stay in the USYeah, they are just pointing guns and demanding my cash because I was born in their vicinity. Not ethical. Sorry I'm not libertarian. I advocate an ethical voluntary government. Nobody that tries to tax anyone has the right to claim they are part of any "government" in my opinion.
5	1523835338	1	Nobody is forcing you to stay. You dont like the rules then leave. If you stay then you consent to the laws. Nobody is pointing guns at you preventing you from leaving. You choose to be here. Someone saying in my house you have to do X isnt stepping over your rights. If you dont like his rules then leave the house. If you stay then follow the rules. 
6	1523835687	3	>  You dont like the rules then leave.Cool story Mao. 
7	1523836019	2	Im the literal most diehard capitalist youd ever meet LOL. If you willingly stay inside a country who owns its borders then you are consenting to following their rules. Thats 100% logically consistent 
8	1523836210	3	> If you willingly stay inside a country who owns its borders then you are consenting to following their rules.non-sequitur. Legitimate governments don't violate the rights of their citizens. 
9	1523844561	2	Governments decide the rights of their citizens.And freeloading off the rest of the citizenry by not paying your share in taxes is not and has never been a "right".
9	1523847664	2	> Legitimate governments don't violate the rights of their citizens. You argue that a true government wouldn't violate the rights of their citizens, and in the same breath accuse that same government of overstepping its bounds by applying arbitrary rules because of your proximity to said government.You're trying to have your cake and eat it too. As long as the rules are set to your liking, then it's fair to apply *those* rules to others, given that they operate inside that government's borders? Or are you an anarchist?
9	1523836380	1	Dude weve been over this. The whole point is that its not a violation because you consent a community's rules by staying on their property. Its a free exchange where parties can choose to consent. You choose to use private property, and on return you consent to paying taxes. If you dont want to pay taxes then fine, dont use public property and exit across the border. Nobody is forcing you to stay.This is like saying as a visitor to bobs apartment that him telling you to take your shoes off inside is a violation of your rights
3	1523832580	1	> No man can just decide that I am subject to a contract I never signed, just because I'm in their proximity, sorry. The law disagrees with you. 
4	1523832748	8	No it doesn't.> The Constitution has no inherent authority or obligation. It has no authority or obligation at all, unless as a contract between man and man. And it does not so much as even purport to be a contract between persons now existing. It purports, at most, to be only a contract between persons living eighty years ago. And it can be supposed to have been a contract then only between persons who had already come to years of discretion, so as to be competent to make reasonable and obligatory contracts. [No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority](https://www.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/lysander-spooner/no-treason-the-constitution-of-no-authority/)Rights don't come from ancient manuscripts, and neither does ethics come from the law.
5	1523832943	-1	> Rights don't come from ancient manuscripts, and neither does ethics come from the law. Rights don't come from random quotes either.  I didn't make either claim. Saying something doesn't make it so, or not so. The law of the United States of America places the creation and administration of law in the hands of government. You may disagree with that, but that is how it currently stands. 
6	1523833138	0	Not in my opinion. The US Government is not a legitimate government any more than the government of North Korea. They are both plutarchies that rule by force, upon an unwilling population. It's not ethical, and you *should* not pay it. Whether or not you *will* is your choice. In my opinion, reducing your taxable income by any method, or outright evading taxes is 100% ethical.
7	1523842821	1	Your opinion is irrelevant. The fact is if you evade taxes and are caught you will go to jail. 
8	1523852847	1	Your opinion is irrelevant. Taxation is theft and we should not pay it. 
9	1523855614	1	It wasn't my opinion, it was a statement of fact. Learn to tell the difference.
0	1523834678	6	Taxation system will be uprooted with the crypto movement.People will start rioting enmasse because most riot-aged people are into crypto and crypto taxes will make poor crypto enthusiasts even more poorer.
1	1523835808	6	Yeah, I am sure the average neckbeard is really into getting out of their basement cave to riot
2	1523855431	1	Sure I won't, but somebody else will riot for me and my cause.
1	1523838246	3	lol.....
1	1523854295	1	No it wont, not they wont
1	1523854833	1	lol nope. 
1	1523840824	1	It's the same policy that's applied to traditional securities...which honestly seems fair to me since crypto is more like a speculative investment than it is an actual currency you use to buy something with. If we were buying groceries with BTC then it wouldn't make sense to tax it this way....but we're not. 
0	1523840354	4	Can't wait for all the posts about people getting fucked by the IRS for not reporting any crypto. 
1	1523844547	2	There will be postings on here soon.......
0	1523853746	2	IRS new rule in 2019.  All Bitcoin forks are retroactively taxable as income based off their ATH valuation of that taxable year, whether you claimed them or not.   Good day.  
0	1523859625	2	Just always remember that the blockchain is an open book that will be there forever. They may get some fancy software in 10 years from now and check your history on the blockchain. Who knows.
1	1523888056	1	Limitations is 3 to 6 years for them to make an assessment. Ten years from when they make the assessment. So 16 years?  They would have to have the software in order to make the assessment by 2024. I paid my taxes on crypto.
0	1523851451	2	My tax accountant filed 20,000 returns this year, and only 10 reported crypto activity.  2 of them had gains, including me.  Yes, I reported lol.
0	1523874310	1	what if one purchased crypto and lost the ability to access the wallet? Does that count as a loss? What if one invested $USD into crytpo in December 2017, and now has a loss after selling in April 2018. Can that loss be reported, reducing tax basis? The IRS is not good at considering and communicating the issues.edit: This article is full of shit sensationalism. poor journalism. 
0	1523878559	1	This says a lot about how brutal the tax regulations are. 
0	1523888656	1	I'm confused as to how to declare Bitcoin forks. The google searches says that it should be declared as "income" instead of capital gains. However, the price of bitcoin gold and bitcoin core has dropped so much since that it makes it hard to declare. Do you declare on the date that the fork split or the date that you extracted the fork to the separate wallet?
1	1523904021	1	As I see it, you declare it on the value of when you received it. I would assume the value of when you received it would be $0, because you would have got it at the time of the fork, and there is no inherent value placed on it until trades are made.When you cash out or trade, you do it with $0 cost basis,  so you will get taxed on the full value of the time of trade.Technically, I don't know. There are differing opinions about it.  Some people say you average out the price of the day as the initial cost basis. So it would be like if you won $3000 on lottery. You will get taxed ~30%. 
0	1523894624	1	i call bullshit scaremongering
0	1523895791	1	To be fair it took a LOT of time to figure out how and when I was supposed to enter crypto gains. Even now I'm not sure I did it right. Here are some of the reasons for underreporting. 1)The IRS isn't clear on the rules. Do you enter your coins first in/first out even if you can prove that one group of coins stayed in a wallet long term while another group of the same coin was used to day trade? What do you do when coins are stolen from scam exchanges like Bitgrail? 2) Exchanges do not give you 1099-B forms. This is a big one as calculating my trades even with bitcoin.tax took many many hours. The data you get from a lot of exchanges aren't exactly copy and paste.3) Tax software is not clear on where you should be entering cryptocurrency gains/losses. The most popular tax software "TurboTax" does not mention cryptocurrencies even once. They have a place for old ass things nobody does anymore like ordering off home shopping channels, but nothing about cryptocurrency.Until these things are addressed, underreporting will continue.
0	1523844706	1	I own Bitcoin because its a big fuck you to the establishment. Fuck the Taxman!!! 
0	1523842005	1	They lock the Italians and many others up for extortion, but make it legal for the IRS which is exactly what taxes are.>Pay us our cut or else...its amazing the amount of things that the government does that's illlegal for the citizens of said government
0	1523852903	1	I reported, with gains and paid taxes despite being in net loss. I can relax.
1	1523879587	1	Baaaaa baaaaaa baaaaa
0	1523857966	1	Good! Taxation is theft. Crypto is thief protection.
0	1523843411	1	Am I the only one who reported their gains from selling in December?  Initially I didn't want to report because I made several purchases but I changed my mind. It was a little over 5k from LiteCoin but there is a direct deposit from Coinbase into my bank account in December. I was more worried the IRS would sue in 5 years and have Coinbase report any sell orders over $5000. The potential interest and penalties were not worth the risk. 
1	1523870107	1	Traded in December.. didn't even sell to fiat and I reported. Which pisses me off but whatever. We shouldn't have to cash out crypto that we haven't cashed out to pay taxes on our imaginary gains, thereby incurring more taxes on the crypto I'm cashing out to pay my imaginary gains tax.But I am playing with large numbers, so I don't want to get fucked in the ass by the IRS.
2	1523900343	1	Wait, I thought 2017 you didn't have to pay if you never realized gains by converting back to fiat? I was under the impression that it was only 2018 tax season that we needed to adhere to that law?
0	1523858027	1	You guys  know there are sites like cointaxes that literally solve this issue for everyone right? 
0	1523822974	-11	People are greedy, like seriously pay taxes people, we are making insane ROIs (in most cases)
1	1523829166	16	I think the biggest issue is that it's very unclear how to complete your taxes accurately. 
2	1523831855	5	Exactly, completely unclear. I used bitcoin.tax to calculate my taxes and couldn't find any literature on how to send them over to Turbo Tax that made sense. If they want to tax it great, just make it easier to report. I'm not going out of my way to figure out how to give the government my money. I made $20k in crypto last year and $60k at my FT job and the government wants to take something like $22k and I have to figure out how to get it to them. I'll do my best I guess.
3	1523833503	1	Any idea what the next step is after getting the .txf file from bitcoin.tax? 
4	1523834030	1	No? You can upload it to Turbo Tax if you have the CD but not online. I did the summary part for Turbo Tax which seemed impossible to find anyways. The whole thing is a joke. Crypto has no value until the IRS touches it. 
5	1523834311	1	I see. I have H&R Block so I was able to find where to import the .txf, but just trying to figure out what the next step is after that. Pretty hard to find the necessary steps to do this the right way. I mean if they made it easier to figure out they'd get more money, so they're pretty stupid for making it so complicated.
6	1523840014	2	Exactly. If they're going to audit me that's fine I guess, they'll do the math for me if I was wrong. I'll send all my transactions in on paper for them as well. 
1	1523823599	15	I'm assuming you're not very aware of the tax laws the U.S. has implemented for cryptocurrencies? Every trade is a taxable event. Until they fix that, people will *at the very most* only report capital gains when they convert back to fiat.
2	1523823763	10	Right or wrong doesn’t matter. They expect you to pay out the ass in an unfair system. They do not give a damn if it’s harsh or unfair. Have the IRS send you an audit and investigate you. It’s terrifying and they come full force.
3	1523825218	6	I understand that. My point is, people will take the risk so long as the hellish tax laws for cryptocurrencies stay in place. For someone that might do thousands or even hundreds of trades a year, it is a *nightmare* to report every trade. Even some of the online websites that assist you with this might not be fully accurate.
4	1523825909	2	It is actually easy with something like bitcoin.tax which lets you import csv' s from exchanges
5	1523826006	2	See my last sentence. There are discrepancies between different services that import your CSV files for taxes.
6	1523826114	1	Can you expand on that? Curious what differences you've seen. I used bitcoin.tax and my accountant was fine with it.
7	1523833515	1	Any idea what the next step is after getting the .txf file from bitcoin.tax?
8	1523833949	1	I just generated the 8949 form and gave it to my accountant. 
9	1523834086	1	Thanks, from what I've read online in various places, people have imported the .txf file and then most are saying that it generates the needed report. I'm hoping that's all there is to it
4	1523826837	1	What about sites like Binance where KYC is unnecessary? And does Binance implementing KYC mean I will have to put in my info to withdraw?
2	1523823825	5	Who ever came up with that can truly go fuck himself. What a bullshit that is. Is it the same for stocks btw? Is each trade a taxable event? Because that's a death sentence to day traders basically.
3	1523824067	12	Stocks are always stock to fiat, the problem for crypto is there is tax on crypto to crypto trades
2	1523824329	1	the rules are the rules
3	1523825238	2	No one is debating that.
1	1523827095	7	Taxation is slavery. Like seriously don't pay your taxes, people. We need to end nation-states that rule via fiat orders, inflation, and taxation.
2	1523829253	3	You got to pay the troll toll...
3	1523842438	2	Day man...
2	1523837540	-1	Dude. Stop giving people tax advice ur libertard/laissez whatever stance is of pure delusion and wreaks of a freshman political sic major who’s idealism has yet to be introduced to mother reality. Just stop
3	1523837611	1	BRO stop acting like a communist despot intent on pointing guns at people and taking their money. We should have an ethical government instead of one that relies on the initiation of force and expropriation of wealth via taxation and inflation. 
4	1523839086	-1	How do u think a govt gets funding??? Never mind. Forgot it
5	1523839148	1	If it's by taking peoples' money by force, then it's unethical. Nevermind, you'll never get it.
1	1523824197	5	Hey why don't then government pay my loses then when I lose?
2	1523824367	3	They do up to a certain limit.
3	1523824731	-1	How's that? Give me some example, I wasn't aware of it at all.
4	1523825059	7	Is this the first time you've ever dealt with capital gains? At its simplest, losses offset gains 1:1, you can carry forward excess losses and use $3000 of loss carry-forwards per year to offset future income / gains. Slightly more complicated because of short and long term gains but that's it in a nutshell. 
4	1523824814	4	Up to 3,000 dollars tax write off a year in losses against your income.
5	1523825346	2	Just 3k? Laughable.
5	1523825269	0	Not the same as giving you your money back and if you suffered a massive loss you’re screwed.
