0	1523861063	16	Coming Soon™
1	1523861579	5	You gotta take every news with a grain of salt. But now that LTC is integrated in the TenX App, it might be closer than you think. 
1	1523895537	1	After the multi-million dollar ICO and 100's of promises. That's how it is.
0	1523857133	73	Guaranteed to be useless for the forsee able future
1	1523859638	13	Card is only one method of payment. I see more options in the future but it's still cool to have a Crypto-branded card for everyday use.
2	1523889842	2	Shift does this already
1	1523863606	20	Like the last two cards issued by tenx... 
2	1523873665	7	I had a TenX card and it worked flawlessly and always gave me a smile when I left the supermarket having paid using BTC.  Looking forward continuing the revolution with their next card!
3	1523877722	7	Each card worked for a month or two then got cancelled.  Good idea but not so great on execution... 
4	1523879970	3	Same here - I got my card and a few days later it didn't work anymore - didn't receive another card so far... I'am just glad I never bought into the PAY token because it seemed useless from the very beginning to me. 
4	1523902337	1	Why did they get cancelled? 
2	1523866598	2	Two cards? I thought only one
2	1523878250	1	> Like the last two cards issued by tenx... Like everything Litecoin has ever done. 
3	1523880435	3	Litecoin made one guy rich.  Surely that's gotta be worth a clap or 2?
4	1523902443	1	Litecoin went from $5 to $100+ in a year... At its peak it even hit $300. It defo made more than one guy rich.... 
0	1523877093	5	So how soon is it coming? We keep hearing about these cards but none has delivered them yet.
1	1523902511	1	Thats cause they are all ultimately tied to mastercard or visa, both of whom like to fuck with crypto products. These cards are not going to work until they find a way past these hurdles 
0	1523860234	30	my money is on Monaco
1	1523860377	10	Good to know. Hope they do well.
2	1523860450	11	I just don't like the hype guy ten X has, go watch the YouTube when all the cards stoped working. Seemed very strange.
3	1523860599	8	It was a sudden notice for all the card related companies. It's a working progress but they're building a lot under the hood.
4	1523866900	2	Not all. Centra have a working product and their founding members even got arrested 2 weeks ago.They did everything wrong and still got it working. 
3	1523873968	1	You mean the guy who is quite charismatic, always transparent and doesn’t feed you bullshit?  The communication from this company has been superb to date.  I am not a fanboy and not a part of their community and am not a token holder.  I am a very happy customer and they have my loyalty because they were great at communication and deliverd a great product.
4	1523874365	2	Suit your self, when I watch him it makes my skin crawl. Only the future will tell if my instinct is correct.
5	1523881947	1	The future has nothing to do with it.  You don’t like him and that is fine.  I wanted to share my view and that is also fine.Insinuating a hardworking company are a scam and admitting it’s based off your instinct is NOT fine.  It’s potentially damaging.
0	1523872813	8	it's the brainchild of julian hosp, so i wouldn't expect too much.
0	1523873583	5	Tenx founder is the worst lying Pos dont trust this..
1	1523874456	0	There have been a few postings in the past about some shadiness with this company. I don't remember all the details, something related to security issues.
2	1523883572	3	Can someone give context or source?
0	1523874550	2	Is there any information in that vid? Seems just like 5 minutes of speculation about how that photoshopped card might look .. or not.   What does it even do? 
0	1523858466	6	Why would you want specifically a lite coin credit card?
1	1523859542	7	It would be a novelty and a way to spread the word on Litecoin and Spending Cryptocurrency.
2	1523861154	2	You have a point, I just think there are better coins. But since Ltc is one of the og’s I guess it’s a good thing!
3	1523861498	2	Yeah. And I think Litecoin is one of the most secure crypto after Bitcoin. Hope to see both projects grow.
4	1523878344	-14	You’re cute. You’re new to crypto aren’t you. Less than 12 months I’m guessing? You’re not familiar with the LTC team I take it. I highly recommend you invest in some better projects. You’re going to be left holding bags for a long, long time if you’re hoping on LTC.
5	1523879366	8	LetMe guess bittburger.... u used to be a bitcoin guy but something made you very angry and bitter in life, so you turned to btrash? Ya. I thought so. Only one bitcoin baby. Always will be. 
0	1523859644	2	Awesome!
0	1523893986	1	Didn't visa ban crypto cards? Are these using Mastercard? Also do these crypto cards work internationally?
0	1523899405	1	I'm still waiting for my Limited Edition card LOL)) I'm glad I sold this piece of shit project at ATH ))
0	1523867049	0	In the meantime Ripple got in through the back door. TenX and Monaco been nothing but bags full of air so far.
1	1523878398	-4	Litecoin been bags of air for 9 years and these noobs don’t even know it. 
2	1523883449	1	Why?

0	1523891616	1	Litecoin and TenXHmmm what can go wrong |||||:-|:-|:-|||||
0	1523893543	1	Ten X is a scam.Julian Hosp is a crazy guy that happens to have a Dr. Title. Juat watch some of his videos (mostly german i guess) and you will get an idea.
0	1523863057	0	DigiByte is what I’m mostly holding in. A bit of LTC too
1	1523873011	6	Enjoy the ride to 0.
1	1523878817	1	Yikes... DGB... that’s a throwback shit coin right there. 
0	1523885357	0	Working on more than LTC is. LTC isn’t scalable 
0	1523860160	-12	Ya shut up, litecoin is really running like a scam since litepay and litepal. Let us know when Charlie I sold my soul for profit Lee is out of this project or it gives any competition to 0 conf instant tx of bch. 
1	1523877082	7	Lol 0 confHoly shit are you dumb
2	1523878455	-1	He’s correct.  Litecoin bagholders have zero knowledge of the tech.  They just bought LTC because they saw it cheaper on coinbase last year when they first entered crypto. It’s sad.
3	1523879756	4	>0 conf>He’s correct.wtf? are you really this stupid?
4	1523881186	2	Most people here have no idea how cryptocurrency works. The sad thing is that because of the DK effect they will assume that they have a full understanding of everything from a few hours of reading Twitter posts lol
4	1523881415	0	Can you make your point clear? What is your objection, you just said 0 conf and called me dumv. Like, say something after o conf, what's your point?Wait, still waiting for the flappening? I wish Charlie fan boys all the best luck. Ltc was the first shitcoin lol
5	1523883313	2	if you dont understand why 0 conf is a complete joke i cant help youyoure hopelessgoogle is your friend
6	1523883955	-1	google is my friend, but so is my wallet which i regularly do tx with. bitpay and microsoft consider the payment done on broadcast. And let me know without RBF, how is 0 conf dangerous? And who are you to preach if i and the buyer/seller i'm dealing with are OK with 0 conf txs? Are you in the market trading bch? if not shut the hell upI welcome anyone to try to double spend on bch so we can fix that loophole or you can lose that money.
