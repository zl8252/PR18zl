0	1523895893	29	Important to realize this isn't just "another partnership." This is VeChain finishing yet another solution for a partner/client that will be launched on their public mainnet in June. You want mass adoption of crypto? This is how you get mass adoption of crypto.
0	1523891484	45	"The only thing that matters is real life use cases, adoption of the technology and the change that the blockchain provides. It is with that understanding that when VeChain decides to partner and make a solution, a solution is provided."
1	1523893215	13	Absolutely loving this. When VeChain partners, they are making sure it's useful in the real world.
1	1523895327	8	VeChain can't stop getting partnerships, it's crazy stuff.
2	1523896966	15	The partnership was announced a few months back.  What we got today was the new working product that came out of that partnership.
0	1523894179	19	> VeChainThor will be responsible for securing the millions of smart contract transactions and value transfers provided through uploading, content protection, and tracking by this service.Guys, this will just be ONE use of VETHO. When mainnet launches at the end of June, VeChain's blockchain will rapidly become one of the - if not the most - used public blockchain in the world by businesses. This is a massive project with already huge real-world uses and partnerships.
1	1523894902	14	It already is the most used blockchain in the world by businesses. Private Chain.
2	1523896196	9	Yes but that doesn't make our digital beans go up ;) 
3	1523896798	6	True. I recall reading somewhere that enterprises have already purchased VET from the open market, but I can't find it at the moment. Regardless, just give it a few months and the network effect will cause it to start snowballing. A few days ago VeChain mentioned that while it may take weeks to create a use case, once it's created it can be rolled out in just days to new enterprises. 
4	1523897170	8	yeah that was Sunny at Harvard iirc? Lot's of good things came out of thereI think all partners get to buy their VEN/VET from the enterprise pool, (20% discount), but there will be countless more companies that didn't get a chance to use said pool in the future. I imagine there will be a *huge* run up when/if the enterprise pool empties.
4	1523897671	7	You probably read it at one of the financial executive reports they publish on Medium, where they give full transparency about the Enterprise Investor Pool - VET they sell to strategic partners only. Companies that are not "strategic partners" need to buy from the open market (And of course, all companies after the EIP is exhausted which I guess will be quite fast at the current speed of partnerships!)Source: https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-financial-executive-report-vol-2-2fb65e91dad1
4	1523897765	5	Sunny said that only strategic partner buy from the investor pool - the rest buy from the market.
0	1523895125	6	wow this is cool！what a great usecase，i can see IP law firms picking this up
0	1523891282	24	'anutha one'

1	1523893519	-52	> VEN gets “shilled” so much for great reason. DYOR and you will see the massive potential of this projectWhere's my fucking money?! I put all my fucking savings and this shit dropped by 70%! you told us it will be 1000$ EOY, it doesn't seem like it, I'm gonna sue this whole Vechain shit.
2	1523893957	17	LOL
3	1523895807	3	It's /s for sure, dudes. 
4	1523897029	6	Read his post history.  It actually looks genuine.
5	1523898272	2	I have to believe. 
6	1523901205	3	I feel like it would diminish the sum of human happiness if I succeeded in persuading you so I will say no more and only regret that I had to see what I saw there.
2	1523895481	15	I assumed this was satire.  Then I read your post history.>If I didn't blew my money on VEN at 5.5$ and 8$ then I'll be buying Verge, Tron and Ripple right now, I'm sorry but there is no hope for you.
3	1523896304	9	omg that's good
2	1523893873	13	Doesn't matter where you put your money, everything fell. Vechain actually held up better than most. 
2	1523893977	7	This is high quality content
2	1523894634	6	Looks like you'll have to wait another month until mom can give you your $20 pocket money again
2	1523897627	6	"Sue this whole vechain shit" xDEither troll or iq less than a smart pig
2	1523896135	4	lol
0	1523892154	8	Great stuff !
0	1523895675	6	All the hate on one side but VEN is doing great job with these daily updates and everyday partnerships. I can say that it's gonna be one of the projects that will reach their goal.
1	1523896386	15	I'm not seeing any hate here surprisingly, it seems VEN's passed the 'fud' stage where now people are either buying it, or shutting up about it. IOTA hit that stage a couple months go 
2	1523899380	2	That's a really good point. Pretty much everyone is realising that this is a strong hold and that everyone can benefit because we are so early on. June's Mainnet release will come round in the blink of an eye and people will forever regret not buying more when they should have. Now. 
3	1523900162	2	I keep buying more and I still know I'll regret not buying *even more* in the future, but hey, eggs & baskets and whatnot
0	1523903122	2	This is the main reason I invested in this coin.

0	1523892842	-43	Is VeChain the one with masternodes that get a bigger % reward for having more coins? I always thought that kind of tier reward is scammy. The average reward for staking is like 10% a year for most coins, so if you have 500 you'll get 50 a year and if you have 1000 you'll get 100 per year. You already get a bigger reward if you have more coins, but some coins like Lomo and VeChain have these "reward levels" that looks like a pyramid scheme to line the pockets of the devs and their friends. This isn't to say there's anything wrong with the tech, I just hate the bullshit disproportionate rewards.Edit: Nothing can convince me more that the rewards system is scammy than the number of people scrambling and bending over backwards to try to defend it, saying, "this is just business, kid".
1	1523893971	14	Read up on pryamid schemes...before even using that phrase again. 
2	1523894575	-16	I have, the people at the top of the pyramid benefit from the people under them.
3	1523895234	10	That is not what a pyramid scheme is.  Practice your reading more before commenting further.
4	1523895477	-4	[deleted]
5	1523896834	13	That's not what a pyramid scheme is.  A system where people at the top benefit from the people under them is just about any hierarchical organisation.  It describes almost every company in the world, for instance, and can even serve as a general description of society.What a pyramid scheme actually is is one of these:>A pyramid scheme (commonly known as pyramid scams) is a business model that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale of products or services. As recruiting multiplies, recruiting becomes quickly impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal.That something very specific and very different to just having an organisation the flow of benefits in which can be charted in a triangular shape.
6	1523897495	2	You're right but I did assume this is what he ment by "people from the top benefit from those under". Regardless, thanks for the clarification!
5	1523896179	-2	I'm going by the info posted here https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-apotheosis-part-ii-thor-power-forged-974111a93278I don't know if it's accurate now, but the rewards for the larger nodes are extremely disproportionate.Also you have this gem near the end"We would also like to try our best to distribute the Foundation generated rewards to as many people who make up the community as possible.For this reason, the Foundation has decided that the wallets holding 1 million VET and above, require you to contribute the VeChain community in various ways before we deem you a qualified Mjolnir Masternode to receive Foundation allocated rewards"Who is "We"? Who decides which 100 biggest nodes are "deemed to qualify", seems like an easy way for the devs to selectively reward their friends over others.
6	1523896705	4	"We" is the VeChain Foundation. And this is part of the system that balances between integrity, compliance vs decentralization. Hence why the nodes are [currently being] manually selected (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/https-medium-com-vechainofficial-authority-masternodes-4c1233c6f18e)VeChain does not claim to be a privacy coin or 100% decentralized, so this is the alternative trade-off to have a compliant balance. The large entities investing millions for these masternodes will be vetted and their identities will be announced to us. If you can't trust the process then tough luck. This is how the business world works. 
3	1523900856	4	Bill Gates benefits greatly from all those employees under him. TIL Microsoft is a pyramid scheme.
1	1523894814	10	Let's put you in the shoes of a big player for a second. Is it fair that you risk millions of dollars, spend the money to maintain a full node, do what's required to have a full node (WORK with the other companies in the ecosystem to foster and develop progress) to get the same ROI % as someone who just bought some coins on binance and does absolutely nothing else? I don't think you'd feel the same way if you were one of the people doing all of this for a full node. 
2	1523895579	-4	They decide if it's worth the ROI when they buy. The problem is the top 100 nodes could end up being mostly the devs and their friends. They even say on here https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-apotheosis-part-ii-thor-power-forged-974111a93278"They" (whoever that is) will decide which large nodes get the biggest rewards based on criteria "they" will set later. Again, seems very scammy.
3	1523896113	7	Despite us investing in this, it's meant for enterprises. They have to use VTHOR to pay for the network usage, so instead of the unpredictableness of having to buy their 'gas' in the open market, they make sure that they can produce enough for their own use. Makes sense? 
3	1523896249	6	says the guy active in /r/bitconnect
4	1523897398	-1	I posted in there warning people about it being scammy, same as I'm doing here.
5	1523897860	5	You should call Jim Breyer and let him know then...
6	1523900503	0	How many tokens was Jim Breyer given as part of his support deal? Would love to see the books opened up on this. 
7	1523900945	3	I would love to this how much every single partner bought,but this information just won't be made public...
8	1523901051	1	It would be great if all  companies kept full records on the blockchain for the world to see. Completely transparent as intended. 
9	1523901179	1	Ofcourse,but privacy for such information is definitely understandable.
1	1523894501	8	Holy shit how can some people be so stupid?
2	1523894645	-12	I'm going based off the information herehttps://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-apotheosis-part-ii-thor-power-forged-974111a93278Unless this has changed, it seems very scammy.
3	1523895309	10	How is this scammy?  You invest more=you get rewarded more.
4	1523896785	-6	The rewards for the larger nodes are extremely disproportionate.Also you have this gem near the end"We would also like to try our best to distribute the Foundation generated rewards to as many people who make up the community as possible.

5	1523897350	7	The Steering Committee decides such decisions,The VechainThor Steering Committee consists of 7 members:  3 members of the Vechain Foundation  2 executives from DNV GL  1 executive from Price Waterhouse Coopers  1 independent member from Hong Kong City University    I'm sorry kid,but this is business,you risk more capital - you get better rewards.
1	1523893718	6	its so that these huge Node holders have a better reason to hold all their coins and not pump and dump them. If they sell and go under their node status, they lose the chance at those nodes forever. Its all based on enterprise cases and very well done. Do some research on the r/Vechain subreddit about Thor.
2	1523893965	-8	If the people with smaller nodes feel it's enough incentive to earn the 10% a year without dumping their nodes, then it should be the same with larger nodes. There's no reason to give the whales a bonus 25%, this is just a sad case of the rich getting richer.
3	1523894253	6	lol kk. whatever you say PTT
4	1523894506	-3	A well made counter point.
5	1523895671	8	There is no point to counter,you are spewing nonsense.
5	1523899042	2	see below. you aren't worth my time. dyor. 
3	1523894715	6	*Complaining it's unfair that those who are willing to risk more capital should get higher rewards*lol...
4	1523897707	2	"I put in $100 and only got $1000... that guy over there put in $10,000 and got $100k! Are you guys trying to rip me off? He made more money than me!"
3	1523903908	1	I get what you are saying, but I mean this sort of thing exists in every facet of business. For instance, on crowd funding sites like Gofundme, the more money you give the project, the better the perk you receive.  To be honest though, I don't even look at it like that. I look at it like when I go to Starbucks and give them 10$, they give me a certain amount of goods. If I give them 5$, should I get the same amount of goods? No, because I'm not a socialist and this isn't Canada (I'm Canadian and live in Canada, just trying to put it in words  I hear American's use online).
1	1523901895	2	You guys are like insanely idiotic Trump supporters who spout utter bullshit about issues far more complex than their tiny brains can comprehend.
