0	1523844574	10	I seen this and was wondering if it has any connection to an earlier statement by Jun on [twitter](https://twitter.com/JUN_Omise/status/918355265124102144)
0	1523841162	30	One more reason to go All In into OMG. 
1	1523843421	27	All in is very risky, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone really.  No project is immune to problems.  It would be a shame to miss out on what many here believe to be the greatest investment opportunity of our generation simply because you got too ballsy/greedy.The highest risk portfolio I could ever recommend would be ~50% in a single holding with no less than 4-5 solid picks in total.
2	1523845041	19	Agreed but can’t resist for a project like OMG
2	1523873162	7	He said ALL IN SOLDIER!
2	1523882489	3	This. I’d probably cap it at 25% myself. There are easily 10+ very solid projects in the top 50 alone. There’s no reason to risk it all on one project. And I love OMG but crypto is already very risky. You need to spread out your holdings to mitigate the already high risk. I won’t shill any coins because I hate when ppl go to a post about one coin then start shilling another but if ppl do some research they will find multiple solid projects. Just avoid the clear scam/shit coins. 
2	1523892827	2	Quite right. Even the best projects can face hardships, or even catastrophic failures. That's why it's important to diversify.I have 30% in Ethereum, 20% in Bitcoin, 30% in Enjin Coin, and 30% in Litecoin.Yes that adds up to 110%. I always give 110% to my investments. 
2	1523845195	5	I'm 70/30 ven and omg
3	1523845599	5	Ballsy.  Hope it works out for you!
2	1523850812	3	I agree - I would even recommend not going over 30%. Too many good projects out there. 
3	1523858428	13	After 5 years of researching... for me there is only 1 unicorn in the cryptospace: OmiseGO. 
4	1523885903	5	You decide your own investments mate, good luck 
4	1523898193	1	What turns you off VeChain? Just curious.I really like OMG but I haven't researched it enough, so I'm not currently invested. So for now, I think VET is that unicorn (but room for more unicorns.)

5	1523864510	9	This is illogical.
5	1523882229	3	Lol.. Have you seen any significant crypto Reddit communities 1-2 year ago? No me neither. **thinking-before-typing
1	1523861789	6	If you believe in OMG, you also believe in ETH and it would be wise to own ETH as well. Also, BTC is the king and alts are known to drop much faster in a bear market, so diversify is your best bet, in stead of 'All in'
1	1523860778	1	And ethereum
2	1523863140	0	And Chainlink :)
0	1523891294	2	Nice. From my 70% portoflio to 100%.
0	1523864656	-1	One good news after the other, these guys are getting shit done. I'll go ahead and buy some more Verge because partnership /s
0	1523854759	-43	love how premine scams stick together and mislead anyone they can thanks to their enormous sums of money from bad bad bad bad bad distribution of coins and control over their centralized networks. this is why there are no intelligent people supporting or taking part in eth or omghttps://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/6bgvqv/faq_what_exactly_is_the_fraud_in_ethereum/https://steemit.com/omisego/@eosfan/omise-omisego-omg-is-unsecure-and-centralizeddoesn't get any more obvious centralization than a centralized premine and centralized funding, some of the best examples of centralization and bad crypto design in crypto history right there.centralized networks like eth and omg have no relevance to cryptocurrencies. downvoted as offtopic.
1	1523858820	11	Put you foil hat back on and go into your cupboard troll
1	1523869081	6	Oh god, you again. Always crying out your "its not decentraliiiiiiized" bullshit. You can always pack your bags and fuck right off son.
1	1523858686	11	Cognitive dissonance, the greatest enemy in this information age. Good luck buddy. The worst thing is, you don't even know how bad your actions are, to share false info about a team who is revolutionizing the world. 
1	1523858417	6	Yeah we get it you like eos.
1	1523877026	3	I'm surprised that you maintain enough karma to post.
1	1523864428	2	Apparently the only way *not* to commit fraud would be to donate everything you own to people on the other side of your fork and cease to exist. The blockchain is law except when people I dislike own a large amount of my currency.
1	1523873460	2	you are the funniest poster in all of crypto-reddit
1	1523879465	1	Are u back from ur most recent ban? We all missed ur insightful comments in ur absence /s
1	1523863131	1	I bet you hold XVG
