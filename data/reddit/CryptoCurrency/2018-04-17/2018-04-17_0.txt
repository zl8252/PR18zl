I know of only 8 European \(EUR\) banks and 4 US banks \(most of them small, not major banks even in their country\) that are willing to work with crypto\-based companies. For example you may have noticed that essentially all exchanges dropped their GBP pairs this year and that is because no UK banks are accepting crypto\-based businesses anymore.
1	1523974348	13	You’re not specifying whether “not allowing” crypto means stopping purchases through credit, debit or both.
2	1523974908	9	Meaning they don't allow crypto\-based companies to open an account with them, period. You can be have the best crypto based idea in the world as as soon a cryptocurrency \(or "bitcoin" if they don't understand that\) is mentioned, it's a "sorry, we don't allow businesses of that type".I meant "not allowed" in the sense of not being allowed to bank with / open a current account for a crypto business. For trying to get a bank/acquirer that will allow a crypto business to accept cards it's way harder than even opening a bank account. This is the biggest reason why so many exchanges don't allow Fiat deposits/withdrawals/trading, even outside of the US \(where there's not nearly as much regulation around dealing with Fiat\).
1	1523965762	4	What's mostly of concern here is the manner in which this unfolded. There seems to have been a concerted effort and decision made by (at least) three different banks-- including one which is state owned.These businesses were all operating already so it might very well be illegal what they did, especially considering the unimaginative reasons they gave for the closures (money laundry, terrorism).In any case, what this article argues (disclaimer, I co-wrote it) is not the legal side but more, the loss of innovation and potential new business and revenue for a country like Chile which seemed to be on the right track and could potentially be a big regional player in the crypto space.
1	1523972363	1	But there is options.  A central bank ban kills the industry 
0	1523972710	14	the reason of this from internal bank sources was the addition of two shitcoins with no real use at all in a fucking exchange and they were even shilled in the main newspaper for the only stupid reason of being fucking CHILEAN, result of, p&d like 1000 times so many people lost so much moneystill made $700 for one day of mining with a 970 tho
1	1523976298	4	Thats some good ROI
2	1523977059	5	Not as good if I had sold one week later, could have been literally $20k. The coins you have the least trust in are the ones that pump more.. That hurt me weeks!!Now that coin has over 99% loss to ATH, though
3	1523977115	2	How did you find the coin in time? 1 day of mining 20k, damn!
4	1523977637	5	I had never mined before. I saw the announcement of that coin in bitcoin chile page of facebook by the dev in the very first hour. Nobody paid much attention back then. I was the miner #21 and learnt how it worked. It was intended for "educational purposes" so I learnt how to mine but after a day started mining other coins that were actually traded on exchanges. I mined around 60 CHA per hour with a mere GTX 970. That was in September. I never thought they were gonna gain value.Entered to this exchange and somehow entered into newspapers and then main TV news, and the huge pump came in. In december 25 mid of Christmas, it reached the ATH of 8600 CLP (around $15 USD). Now worth ca. 80 CLP (ca. .15 USD).It was a Litecoin fork
1	1523977063	2	It's only a problem and loss to society if it's money lost through crypto. If its money lost to lottery tickets, gambling, consumerism? Don't worry about it!
2	1523977286	2	Gambling is heavily regulated. Lottery tickets cost less than a dollar.
3	1523978269	3	So do a lot of coins.
4	1523978684	-5	Yes but nobody spends thousands in lottery tickets lol
5	1523980184	5	Well, people do, but that's considered to be an addiction etc.
1	1523979004	1	That could be the reason they're citing. But maybe the real reason is that the banks aren't involved in crypto, they're not making money in that market so don't want funds moving away from them to those markets cause they can't profit from it.In Canada, one of the big banks won't let people buy crypto even with their chequing account, but that same bank is set to provide banking service to a crypto exchange that's gonna launch in Q2 2018. 
1	1523975337	-1	I *kind of* disagree.Although I think chaucha and luka are shitcoins in the sense that they don't bring much value to society, it was a very good experiment and a initiation for many into crypto. These decentralized experiments don't have bounds and if they get out of control, its just one of their properties. 
2	1523977231	3	LUKA started trading at over 8000 CLP, lot of volume and millions CLP sold (for reference, tens of thousands USD). Then went to around 600 CLP in less than 12 hours! The announcement from the State Bank was around two days later.  They saw money flowing in accounts of people that didn't have work and millions CLP going into the exchange from people that never saw that money back.This coin was a fork of XMR with absolutely nothing new to show, just tried to repeat the Chaucha P&D cycle for the ones that couldn't get on the train on the latter.
0	1523973638	18	> why this is detrimental to the country's economyNo... it's not.
1	1523975365	-5	Would you mind expanding a bit? Why don't you think so?
2	1523976793	14	Don't see why it would be in the first place. Cryptocurrencies are not in any way important for Chile's economy. Please explain why you think they are.
3	1523978632	-5	CryptoCurrencies are one part of the blockchain technology (albeit a necessary and very creative invention). This space will create new jobs, don't doubt that. Chile is in dire need of tertiary jobs and while blockchain isn't a majo player now, our point of view is that it will be sooner than later.
4	1523979570	6	The whole point of putting up with the inefficiency of blockchain over conventional DBMS is decentralization, which means you eliminate many financial service jobs that provide social value (i.e. fraud investigation, customer service, etc.). You seem to think that blockchain has some kind of untapped magical power without, I guess, understanding what it is or what problems it would even solve. It's also a relatively old technology, so if anything if you were saying was true, we would have already seen the benefits elsewhere in the world.
4	1523980129	1	I think later in the near future Chile Government will regret it for what happened to that exchange. I hop e all the government in the world will eventually consider it.
3	1523978157	-2	Cryptos are needed to empower the so-called decentralised economy. If, for instance, a Chilean startup wants to develop a dApp on top of Ethereum, end-users will need to buy ether (or perhaps some token) in order to get access to the product/service. Similarly, startups and devs need to cash out their fees or profits. Exchanges are the easiest way to accomplish that ATM (unfortunately).
2	1523977962	5	Because no legal goods or services are purchased using crypto in Chile. No, the one time some restaurant owner accepted Nano for plate of shrimp doesn't count. That's basically the definition of useless.You can tell who the pseduo-enthusiasts are because they don't even know what they're supposed to be enthusiastic about.
3	1523979393	2	The article never says that closing exchange accounts *is* detrimental for the Chilean economy. Apart from the exchanges, the crypto economy in Chile barely exists, but it's developing. What the article says is that crypto, dApps and other blockchain applications are a *potential* area of innovation and development that should be taken seriously, and that closing exchange accounts may have a negative impact.
4	1523980639	2	The article doesn't the main topic does.
5	1523981641	2	oh ok, then I agree, OP should have been more rigorous with that title.
0	1523972611	11	at least we have localbitcoins
1	1523974486	13	Who just started KYC practices
2	1523976883	3	you have bisq network and hodlhodl
2	1523980351	4	What is wrong with that?
3	1523982896	3	Which entities of which governments are given that data?
4	1523989205	1	I don’t send that information anywhere, just keep it for my records.
1	1523977043	5	PayFair is also coming.
1	1523975079	1	There sure is, and its great, but it completely stifles the adoption rate.
0	1523977692	3	When I think about the transition from people using banks to people using crypto-currencies I see some similarities in the transition of people from cable TV to streaming based services, although on a completely different scale.There will have to be a group of people who are willing to live their lives while completely divorcing themselves from the banking system. Over time there will be more and more services made available to cover the demand that is created by this group of people.
0	1523964114	5	Some info in english: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/cryptocurrency-trading-upended-in-chile-as-banks-close-accountshttps://news.bitcoin.com/chilean-crypto-exchanges-appeal-against-banking-embargo/
1	1523970696	3	Seems like Crypto businesses are now the pariah along with the porn industry.
2	1523971826	0	That's what happens when they are not the ones in control, they threaten and enforce their strength upon you, it's a sickening world.
3	1523979249	13	Oh please.Don't act as if the cryptocurrency community isn't handing banks freighter loads of reasons to interfere.* Per _Satoshi themself_, Cryptocurrencies don't provide any tangible benefits for ecommerce. (No, speed is not relevant and there is no feeless network that operates at scale yet) Resulting in the main commerce use case being... dark net transactions.* The markets are continuously manipulated. The amount of pump&dumps is a joke.* Non-cryptocurrency blockchain applications like Ethereum are a complete crapshoot. They're getting the regulatory nuke from orbit in 38 days.* And while Ethereum is still here, it's main use case is... ICOs. Because what can go wrong subverting IPO laws? The vast majority of ICOs completely failing to have any return apparently.* Which brings us to another major use case for Ethereum: Fraud and illegal gambling. Ponzi and pyramid schemes are either fraud or gambling (and therefore requiring a license that miners do not have) in many nationsLook. There are _MANY_ problems with cryptocurrencies. Shoving them under the rug under the mantra of "I DON'T CARE BECAUSE IT'S EARNING ME MONEY" and claiming banks are annoyed because "they hate us" is dishonest.Do you _honestly_ believe anyone is going to stop the central banks from using their _near omnipotent financial control_ in order to cripple cryptocurrencies when they can simply point to the list of  problems, and then point to the cryptocurrency community completely ignoring all problems? You're not going to convince politicians that way.
4	1523980497	5	Straight to the point and factually correct.Expect hundreds of downvotes shortly....
5	1523986430	2	> Expect hundreds of downvotes shortly....No downvotes, I am _mildly_ surprised.Did get one dude spewing non-sequiturs and ignoring the fact that smart contracts do not operate on USD, and barely work with multiple networks. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
6	1523987755	2	I'm conversing with exact same guy right now.He is indeed very amusing.He told me I'm being left behind... I bet his heart bleeds for me...
4	1523980782	1	Wait, what's happening in 38 days? Some sort of regulation? First I've heard of this, would like to know what you are referencing.
5	1523981566	4	> Some sort of regulation?Yes. In 38 days the GDPR becomes enforced.The TLDR of the results are as follows:* Running an Ethereum (or Ethereum-like smart contract platform) node, or mining, will be in violation of the GDPR. (Failure to meet the requirements of a data processor)* Creating a smart contract that uses personal data is a violation of the GDPR. (Failure to meet the requirements of being a data controller)* The people who are in violation of the GDPR may either be fined directly, or will be held liable to anyone (read: EU/EEA citizens) whose personal data has been uploaded into the network, and will pretty much insta-lose any lawsuit, and be forced to take down their Ethereum nodes.The actual legal text is fiendishly complicated, so I've massively simplified, but the above is the main problem that'll hit Ethereum users.See [the GDPR's Articles 4, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 24 and 28.](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) if you want some relevant bits of the actual legal text.
4	1523981059	-2	There is so much wrong with your argument I just need to downvote and move on. This is not worth anyone's time, please don't comment to this guy.
5	1523982281	5	> This is not worth anyone's time, please don't comment to this guy.You just did.> There is so much wrong with your argument I just need to downvote and move on.Let's just humor you, in order:* `and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers` - Satoshi Nakamoto, in the Bitcoin paper, bringing up how trusted third parties are still required to protect buyers.* I am not going to provide evidence of things _this obvious_. Go look at the price history of pretty much any smaller cryptocurrency.* [See the GDPR's Articles 4, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 24 and 28.](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/)* [There's a bunch of articles, but have one from Fortune.](http://fortune.com/2018/02/25/cryptocurrency-ico-collapse/)* See PoWH & friends.
6	1523982857	-4	You've never heard of smart contracts I guess. Jesus christ man, this is why I didn't want to waste my time, but you sucked me in with just how ignorant you are.

1	1523964205	1	Great idea. 
1	1523972648	1	Thanks for making my life easier.
2	1523975391	1	I should've though about that. :)
0	1523975139	5	Awful, you shouldn't be allowed to have a monopoly on money if you block whatever transactions you want, even if they are allowed by the government.
1	1523975581	9	At least crypto is giving us some eye opening lessons. We've been living in these conditions for a long time, yet not many people question it or even realize t.
2	1523980302	1	Such as?
3	1523980953	4	Government can't stop you from spending crypto.
4	1523981185	-9	Why certainly. You can buy your... lets see... Drugs? Dodgy pills.. and whatever else is available on Darknet?Can't buy a loaf of bread though can you?So the lesson from that is - its crime money.Any more lessons?
5	1523981557	4	Are you just straight up retarded?https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-can-you-buy-with-bitcoins/oh look, buy a fucking househttp://bitcoin-realestate.com/
6	1523982031	-1	"After an initial flurry of interest among merchants in accepting bitcoin in their retail or online stores, interest has largely died down as increasing bitcoin transaction fees and volatile price movements made it less attractive as a means of exchange"Quite literally the first paragraph. I must indeed be retarded.And the second paragraph being even more true and to the point:"That doesn't mean that there are no outlets to spend your bitcoin, however, far from it. It's just that bitcoin volumes at these outlets has generally not met expectations, and by the time you read this, some may have discontinued that option." Yep. By the time you read the article - the list would have shrunk.I did giggle at the 29.5 pages of houses you can buy (more than half of which are "seeking property in x") across the whole wide world... Such choice! /s
7	1523982742	2	I just laugh at people like you. Same people who are jealous for the money I have made. Good luck in life my friend.
8	1523983099	-1	Er, um...How am i jealous of anything? You got your fortune? Good on you mate. Hopefully a real fortune even and not a couple of thousand bux/quid whatever.But to delude yourself that crypto currencies are actually usable as money is... Well um delusional.
9	1523983435	1	Overland Park Dodge Jeep Chrysler in Kansas (Kansas, lol) has been selling cars and trucks for bitcoin for years now. Years. Menufy has spent years integrating btc payments for food delivery and takeout for restaurants that don't have their own crypto payment. Bitpay and Coinbase both offer merchant services for businesses.You are behind the curve on this. Even in the face of stripe and steam stopping their btc acceptance, it's gaining steam and not waning in the least.
9	1523984104	1	My point is you're getting left behind, just like those others.
0	1523973217	4	Banks are really acting weird towards crypto now, in the meanwhile you can use Localbitcoins if you want to buy/sell Bitcoins.
1	1523979691	3	I think they are expecting that crypto community is a threat to their business because most of the people now are using it, investing it. People prioritize the crypto investment rather than saving their money at the bank
0	1523977777	1	Brazil banks too. (Cartel)
0	1523977944	1	All the more reason and motivation to use alternate routes, and there are plenty. It just takes a little more effort, but when is a revolution just handed to you on a silver platter. Stand up and exercise your economic freedom!!!! Banks ARE the ones crypto CAN displace. They won’t just roll over.More Fiat entries are coming Ethos and other options like localbitcoin will become more prevalent! 
0	1523978160	1	.....uh the rest of the world had to deal with this months ago, no it isnt fun, and no we didnt like it either.......
0	1523981303	1	Well, that are CENTRALIZED exchanges for you. Consider me crazy, but that's actually a good thing (because many of those centralized exchanges are abusing their power greatly).What we need are P2P Exchanges including FIAT transactions.They can't ban all bank-accounts :)e.g. https://payfair.io/
0	1523982669	1	I expected this to happen soon enough. edit: typo
0	1523983307	1	Its happening in brazil as well !!!Foxbit, walltime and others
0	1523987413	1	Do major American banks have this same block in place? Do major Western European banks have this same block in place? 
0	1523987764	1	Worst things Banks are doing with Crypto. 
0	1523988220	1	> Help us spread the word and understand why this is detrimental to the country's economy Problem is: It is not.
0	1523988478	1	There's nothing to help you understand if you cannot just come up with the most likely reasons yourself. I mean, a form of currency that's difficult to track and tax, I can only imagine reasons why they wouldn't block them in banks. 
0	1523980075	1	Upvote for awareness folks
0	1523974216	-3	This is why cryptocurrencies can't work, they are going against the central bank.  And the central bank controls the money supply in literally every country in the world, except North Korea.So you are fighting the world.If there is any legitimate threat, they will shut it down, and then create there own 'stable' version.You guys are investing in cryptocurrency 1.0.  The guinea pigs.
1	1523976272	3	>they will shut it downWe've been waiting for them to try this whole time. It's surprising they've been this friendly so far.This won't stop Chileans from getting cryptocurrency.
2	1523980953	1	Well "they" don't need to. Cryptocurrencies are tiny on the global scale and frankly very very easily shut down. (There will be no interest if there is no way to extract fiat).
3	1523981386	2	>very very easily shut down.Nope. Even if they got to every miner (they won't), there's still ASIC-resistant PoW forks, PoS, etc...> (There will be no interest if there is no way to extract fiat).It's nearly large enough to create a closed ecosystem already, and you can already buy fiat on DNMs (but almost no one needs to yet).
1	1523974960	0	And thats what we (or at least I) love about it. 
0	1523963551	0	 Wasn't crypto illegal in chile or something?
1	1523963804	4	It hasn't been officially defined as 'illegal' as far as I know, just a gray area as in many countries. But a couple of weeks ago, banks (kind of systematically) decided to ban exchange's accounts. There is an active legal process currently going on to determine if what they did was illegal.
2	1523964337	1	Ok thanks for clarifying
1	1523972631	1	it's not
1	1523973848	1	Usually, democratic countries constitution allows everything that is not explicitly prohibited.
