But every fiat/alt pair dropped alongside bitcoin.The real decoupling will come when the market is worth trillions, other Coins find their niche market and tokens have working products making profits to sustain the price.I also agree, almost 100% of people coming into the space is thanks to Bitcoin.
1	1523945642	13	bla bla decouplingHave a look at the stock market and see how decoupled that gets when it's volatile. Assets only decouple when there is relative peace in the market, not in full on bear markets. Everything tanks together because of the quantitative models and algo trading. 
2	1523970441	5	Yeah. I agree. Nothing really de-couples, even geographical markets move together these days. Anyway why do we need to decouple anyway?
3	1523970908	1	Nothing is wrong with being coupled to a good asset, BTC is not a good asset.  Long tx times, high fees.
4	1523970997	1	Yeah tell me about it. But hopefully in time that gets fixed. If not I see it fades away like MySpace.
4	1523978694	1	Being the most secure and decentralized has a cost.  Any coin running itself like a paypal server can easily beat it on cost and speed, but the correct way to do it is with a second layer.  Both BTC and ETH devs say this.  An instant, trustless, low cost payment network is getting built on top of Bitcoin.
5	1523979555	0	In Is not decentralized though?
1	1523933302	25	Yeah the reality is that it's actually not a good thing to move to fiat/alt pairs, because you'll just end up with hundreds of very thinly traded pairs with almost no volume because now you're splitting the volume that was previously on BTC/alt pairs to both BTC/alt pairs and fiat/alt pairs. If anything, you're making the altcoin markets less attractive than before, not more attractive by screwing up liquidity/market depth.Everyone who thinks that more alt/fiat pairings are the answer are missing that there just isn't enough liquidity to support doing that yet. Maybe in the future when crypto is a $10 trillion market we can have fiat markets for the top 100 cryptos but right now if you chop up the market like that you just end up with unusable trade pairs everywhere. 
2	1523934081	10	This is true but having a direct gateway to your favourite Alts is quite nice for the people already invested in the space.As a Canadian what I wouldn't give to have a quick easy way to ad to my OMG, IOTA, XMR, NEO, etc stacks on a whim like I do with with BTC and ETH.
3	1523945692	1	XMR and NEO have fiat pairs on some exchanges. 
4	1523947013	1	Mostly USDT pairs though
5	1523964027	1	Tether is a useful Medium of Exchange on the crypto markets, just don't hold a huge pile of it long term...
6	1523977478	1	Yes, but in reference to direct fiat pair needed for decoupling, it’s pretty useless.
3	1523935339	-11	Buying eth and BTC to sell for those alts isn't easy enough? Can't get any easier IMO.
4	1523935736	16	Nope. Its really not. Because most fiat gateways only sell btc and Eth, and therefore you have to buy ETH, set up an account on a completely different exchange, transfer that ETH to that exchange, and then buy the alt. Then transfer that alt to your wallet. Too many transfer fees, exchange fees, withdrawal fees and hassle. 
5	1523943483	1	That was true and you make a valid point as far as fiat goes but Dex's are alive and well. No more creating accounts just your a MEW/Mist wallet.  Neo as of today has a Dex aswell for it's cryptos and I believe it is crosschain which is fan-fing tastic(going to get on that badboy tomorrow when im abit more awake) Anyway point is centralized exchanges are quickly becoming a thing of the past it's just a matter of there awareness getting out more and it is.  Fees are way less usability is way better than V1.
6	1523943720	3	Yes, DEXs are the future, but as of now and for the foreseeable future, the liquidity for them is abysmal. We're going to need a bunch of them to group up like ZRX so we can have some proper liquidity. Furthermore, many people, mom and pops, will probably never be comfortable using decentralized exchanges.  
7	1523944518	3	Were still essentially in alpha phase of dex's, this isn't what mom and pop will use. Liquidity will come in time and a growing number of crypto users are familiar with MEW, Meta Mask and hardware wallets, all of these users can use dex's in there current form today without hassle. You are here and therefore likely can easily figure out a dex. Liquidity is an issue short term only. Watch what happens by the latter half of this year with the larger/easier to use dex's/
4	1523940603	7	There's tax implications if I first buy ETH and send to Binance to buy alts.  I'd prefer there wasn't.  
5	1523945315	2	Not if you do it right away, you can use the same days price as the same cost basis essentially making your first transaction net neutral.  If your using the crypto for a purchase you have even more wiggle room on whether you use the original basis or take gains/losses on the price shift. Basically if you're using it immediately you can make a convincing argument that there isn't any taxable event occurring since you've purchased it for say $400 each and immediately traded it for some other coin. I'm not a tax lawyer but this is what experienced accountants have told me. The IRS isn't going to question your intraday trades having the same price on paper on both sides of the transaction. Now if you hold the ETH for a week and THEN send it to Binance to buy some alt then yes there are tax issues
6	1523945438	5	I've calculated my last few dollar cost average events down to the second, done in such a way.  Its always a gain or loss of less than $5 by the time I've bought my alts.  The absurdity is that we must declare such events on tax forms.  
6	1523946488	1	Replying to your edit:I have no plans to do this, but surely this opens the door for large players who run bots or otherwise high frequency trade.  How do you relax laws for the common user without giving a break to the big players who would take advantage of large granularity?  
4	1523935932	7	Can I go on my phone open an app with my fingerprint and buy my coin of choice and be done in under a minute?Not saying your way is hard.  Just not streamlined.
4	1523935731	1	I go Quadriga -> Exchange -> Wallet. Takes maybe 15 minutes. It could be made easier with apps like Coinbase though. 
2	1523945780	1	Especially in a bear market I want fiat stop losses for alts because cashing out to fiat or tether will increase my ETH/BTC stacks if they also drop. 
2	1523961476	1	I disagree and think that your opinion here is shortsighted.Time will tell which side is correct.
1	1523916841	-9	No doubt the blockchain technology that gave rise to Bitcoin has ushered in a whole new industry around digital securities/assets allowing the transfer of digital property/value, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure. With that being said, I highly doubt that the majority of folks coming into the crypto space of recent days is because of Bitcoin. I think we're beginning to see the rise of the ALTs come into focus. IMHO, those spikes in Bitcoin's valuation is due to the fact that Bitcoin continues to serve as the de-facto base/exchange currency at a majority of crypto exchanges based solely on the fact that it was the first to the market.  The strangle-hold Bitcoin currently has in that regard is dissipating as more versatile, faster, and cheaper, ALTs like XRP, XLM, and OMG move into the mainstream. Unless you got in Bitcoin prior to its run-up, I just don't see how it will compete with the aforementioned ALTs in the payments arena. It's like the Ford Model-T (Bitcoin) vs. Mercedes S65 AMG. Unless this LN network proves to be all that many have hyped it to be, I find it hard to imagine Bitcoin maintaining its coveted #1 status and valuation for very long.
2	1523938275	3	When somebody compares XRP to BTC I stop the debate. If we need to have banks, why do I even need Virtual Currencies? Defeats all puposes since 1. Centralized 2. Coercion/censorship non resistant
2	1523930299	5	Ford's model t wasn't upgradable.Bitcoin can change it's code to solve problems.Programmer here, how should I be investing when most people have no clue what's going on and don't understand how ineffective blockchain is at low cost, fast, data management? What actually requires public verification outside currency?
3	1523946649	-1	Ok, Mr. Programmer, you say Bitcoin can change its code, which is true, but at what cost??? How many hard forks has Bitcoin experienced 2 or 3? I'm running out of fingers to count my friend. Oh, and let's not talk about this new and improved network augmentation. What is it called, ahhh yes, it's Speedy Gonzolas? No, it's Roadrunner? Dammit no; it's a bird, it's a plane, it's Lightning!!!  It's just laughable to see so many clinging to this delusional fantasy of how Bitcoin and its new and improved "Lightning Network" it is going to solve the scaling and exploding transactional cost problems. The truth is that there is a huge misunderstanding that unlimited scaling (via the new Lightning Network) will solve all Bitcoin's problems. Because every open/close of an LN channel means an expansion in transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, causing the bottleneck shifts from a limit on the transactions that can be processed on-chain to a bottleneck on how many payment channels can be opened or closed at any given time. It's important to remember that Lightning doesn't allow instant settlement of funds. That means that you can't spend lightning funds until the lightning channel has been closed and the final state transmitted to the blockchain. Effectively what lightning does is allow a massive increase in the capacity for changing ownership of BTC but the BTC doesn't "move" until the channel closes. This means that if more than 7 channels want to close per second you will once again get lag.
2	1523926314	-9	This. xlm will overtake btc. But i still think Bitcoin will grow
3	1523928263	-6	Yeah, but what about XRP?
4	1523937327	2	What I’ve noticed about XRP is that everyone wants the tech (Ripple) but no one wants the coin (XRP). I believe Ripple will make a lot of money when it becomes an IPO, other than that I see it as a fundraising coin for Ripple, besides they won’t add it to Coinbase due to securities, they’re more of a securities type of coin than anything else. Just my opinion. 
1	1523961596	-2	> making profits to sustain the priceIf that is the requirement everything but exchange tokens are doomed. Even BTC.The simple fact is, BTC is a broken 4tx/s old man that has been modified beyond its original intention. We didn't keep AOL around because it was the first and brought many people. Why would we keep this monstrosity of centralized Asian mining around? If the entire market fails because BTC fails then it was all shit to begin with. Corporations and governments will pick up what they liked out of this completely open-source software and use it without the cryptocurrency part they don't want/need. Otherwise, they'll buy it from companies like SWIFT, R3, Microsoft, or Samsung who have conventional stock and actually have products they profit from.
0	1523905025	166	Au the contraire, my friend. I was bashing on Bitcoin DURING the bullrun. 50$ tx fees to be confirmed quickly? That was fucking attrocious and caused loss of adoption.
1	1523926935	38	There's also the counter argument to 'people only buy alts because they've bought bitcoin' which is the exact opposite: People are only buying bitcoin because they need it to purchase alts. I'm sure both statements are true for different people.
2	1523937733	8	Sometimes both statements are true of one person. 
3	1523964657	5	Yeah for example, I got into crypto because I heard of Bitcoin.   When I read about it I was more interested in alts because I didn't see why I would want BTC when there is a better alt for every single usage .. except for turning my fiat into alts.  So yeah I bought alts because of btc, and I also bought btc because of alts.I am happy to see Bitcoin do well, but I am also happy to see it lose dominance while doing fine. The best of both worlds and probably the best setup for the market in general.
1	1523930423	6	Exactly this. My concern isn't with Bitcoin dragging the rest of the market down. My concern is with it failing to scale and become a viable currency.
2	1523937708	3	It’s already miles better than it was in December, and could handle that peak transaction volume without batting an eye. People forget that it has the most active developers of *any* currency, by an order of magnitude, and is constantly being improved. 
3	1523945337	17	Nothing you just said is true. The tiny volume spike on Thursday (Friday?) morning backlogged the BTC mempool for almost 10 hours, causing an immediate 500% increase in fees. That volume was a tiny blip compared to what was going on in December. There are several projects with much more development occurring (ETH, ADA, NEO, off the top of my head) and many of the technically inclined do not consider SegWit or LN an improvement at all—although this is a matter of opinion.  
4	1523977066	1	Where are you seeing a 500% increase in fees? I looked at the chart and I don't see it. And the volume spike you refer to was the most volume in one hour.More development in Neo and Cardano than Bitcoin? Sure kid.
5	1523978778	1	And the volume during that 30 minute window was the most ever for BTC (iirc), but the volume in the period where the backup occurred overall was nothing to speak of. 
5	1523977756	0	Look at the the mempool data at the time of the spike. This is a good site: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,24h(You’ll have to go back to that day and zoom in, if possible)The amount of increase depends on what metric you want to use and I was being generous to BTC by estimating the average fee. If you go by “fee to get into the next block” it looks even worse. You can see that around 6AM (EST) that fee was 1 sat/B, but by 10AM that fee was 20sat/B. And look at meaningful updates—“active development” as was said. Not documentation updates and bug fixes. You’ll find BTC has like 4 or 5 devs. NEO has their whole “City of Zion” or whatever they’re called, so yeah...
6	1523982352	1	Yeah I am familiar with the site. I suggest we zoom out a bit and click on the past six months. Overall volume is way down of course, but the spike was handled well. And yes, what metric you want to point to matters. I was looking at this:https://charts.bitcoin.com/chart/transaction-fees#3And expected, given your statement of a 500% increase in fees, to see a considerable spike in fees. But I don't. I see a steep decline and fairly level for the past month. We'll have to wait until the next bullrun to know how much improved the network is, but it is being worked on.And sure, an almost decade old product is going to have less "active development" than a newer project. 
7	1523983292	1	Fair enough—yeah this chart doesn’t appear to have the resolution to capture the behavior to which I was alluding. It was a fleeting effect that only lasted for the duration of the backlog, and was ~500% at peak. Point being, that high fees are ready to burst back in the scene at any moment, given the right opportunity/level-of-BTC-enthusiasm. And to your point about active development: EXACTLY my point. 
4	1523945676	-2	SegWit effectively doubled the block size without causing any nodes to desync. I think it’s a net bonus, and I’m not aware of any real arguments against it. I think you’re counting tokens if you think neo and ada have more devs - ETH is the closest contender to BTC in terms of active contributors, but iirc it’s about 400 for BTC and 200 something for ETH. Neo is a mess of a platform, anyway. 
5	1523947139	12	Come on... serious? Look at how many devs are doing meaningful commits, and then try again. I’m talking active development—not documentation updates and minor bug fixes. SegWit actually doubles the block size, but only if there are enough SegWit transactions in the block to fill the space not being counted toward fees. A straight doubling of the block size would therefore have been more effective since it doesn’t discriminate in this manner and all transactions could benefit. And for what? The transactions themselves end up using more space so it is more physical resources being used for less throughput (vs a straight blocksize increase of the same magnitude). It also introduces a couple of attack vectors that didn’t exist before. Furthermore, because it didn’t have consensus, it was pushed through as a soft fork which means they had to do a ton of extra coding in order to trick legacy nodes into accepting any new SegWit blocks. This introduces a huge opportunity for a lot of bugs to emerge. SegWit was never about scaling as it is a poor and complicated solution for that. It was about the malleability fix needed by LN. Maybe the pair will someday be able to handle December level transaction volume, but right now that is provably not the case. Further, the system is provably worse than it would be if they had simply doubled the block size. Right now. That’s not to say things won’t improve in the future, but to say that BTC can easily handle December level volume in its current state is very very false. 
6	1523947870	0	As someone else posted in this thread, we’re actually above December tx volume if you account for batching. I, too, support a block size increase to at least 2-4MB. But saying that bitcoin only has low fees because it’s not being used simply isn’t true. 
7	1523948598	5	Source on the batching numbers? Seems far fetched, imo, but glad to look at data if you have it. Agreed... SegWit and low usage both contribute, but attributing it only to low usage is like 5-ish times more true than saying it is only because of SegWit. Saying it is due to low use is a much better approximation if brevity is your goal. The most correct statement might be something like “BTC’s current state of low fees are due to the fact that relatively few ppl are using it right now, and, of course SegWit helps a little bit, too.”
8	1523980066	2	It's bs.  Ouputs per transaction barely increased and the total number of outputs per block dropped just as much as the amount of transactions. https://outputs.today/
9	1523980517	1	Wow... great find!Yeah it didn’t make sense that batching could account for THAT much throughput, but it wasn’t impossible either, so...  benefit of the doubt and what not. Anyway,  I guess this puts the batching argument to rest. Cheers!
9	1523982257	1	When you don't batch, almost every transaction creates two outputs, one for the payment one for change. Space is wasted for the additional output and for the signature to spend it in a subsequent transaction.When you batch, each transaction creates many outputs, at most one of which is change. So asymptotically batching halves the number of outputs created for a given load.Batching can also reduce outputs by combining multiple withdraws into one. E.g. Alice withdraws 1 BTC to her wallet then 5 minutes later withdraws 2 BTC more. If the batch hadn't issued yet this just gets converted into a single 3 BTC output.Lightning is on mainnet and the eclair app is on the google play store and I'm sure it has 100's of thousands of downloads by now so  you can just about forget about these metrics moving forward. I literally just paid my phone bill over lightning.
3	1523945172	7	Fees are only low now because transaction volume is low. 
4	1523945192	-4	It’s the highest it’s ever been. It’s just obfuscated by batching. 
5	1523970772	1	Batching doesn't increase volume it decreases it?
3	1523942530	6	That is plain false. Eth has way more going on.
4	1523945814	-7	[deleted]
5	1523947258	6	This site disagrees.https://cryptocodewatch.com/#devs-all
5	1523954463	7	ETH hasn't about half the contributors...    I don't know if you're a developer but this Ethereum graph is just the Go implementation of Ethereum. You have to add every repository in the Ethereum Github (+ theoretically every Token).    Also on Coingecko:Bitcoin (in Weeks -> Sunday) =  * 25  = 49 commits  * 1  = 30 commits  * 8  = 27 commits  * 15 = 4 commits   = **110** commits and not 358 commit    Ethereum Go implementation (in Weeks -> Sunday) =  * 25  = 18 commits  * 1  = 13 commits  * 8  = 15 commits  * 15 = 4 commits    = **50** commits and not 66 commits    Solidity (in Weeks -> Sunday) =  * 12  = 18 commits  * 36  = 13 commits  * 28  = 15 commits  * 11 = 4 commits  = **87** commits --> 137 commits in 4 weeks and these are only two repositories of 157   Bitcoin has 4 repos and two of them together have 114 commits in the past four weeks.    Bitcoin has a lot less contributors and activity than Ethereum. It's not even bias.. it's the truth..    Edit:  https://github.com/bitcoin  https://github.com/ethereum  
5	1523947215	1	Now consider Eth with all of the projects ontop of eth using solidity. Bitcoin is just bitcoin. Eth is eth plus everything on it. Eth shits on BTC in every single way. Many of these projects SCALE eth by the way, which is the primary focus of the current devs on BTC with the lightning network.
6	1523953872	-1	Yeah well when you get the ethereum cofounder not being able to code a simple multisig and projects lose houndreds of millions of dollars that tells you something... 
7	1523962343	2	Well, when one Asian company owns nearly 30% of the BTC mining pool that should tell you something... 
1	1523913323	2	Yeah it's sad the devs are intentionally making the coin have high fees. I think it's a big mistake
2	1523922734	8	It's because they want to eventually push people off-chain on to their centralized pay-to-play transaction system [Liquid](https://blockstream.com/liquid/).
3	1523947516	2	Wow. That has no real world use. Only speculation. Are they leaving the decentralized store of value concept behind too? 
2	1523934743	5	lol don't bash the devs they'll have the downvote army come and get ya!
3	1523937167	7	It's weird I was downvoted, the developers openly plan for the fee market and talk about it a lot. I was just saying I thought it was a mistake to make your coin intentionally have high fees like they are
4	1523937266	8	just the sheep doing their duty
1	1523913808	-6	I agree. They are no different than the so-called, vulture capitalist bankers they love to scapegoat. In the end, it all comes down to making that Dollar Bill. All of this down with bank fever is nothing more than a smoke-n-screen play to provide cover for their own selfish and greedy ends. The inefficiencies and corruption that many of them speak of is not the product of the concept of a government, bank, or FI perse. These problems are the reflection of the inept and corrupt **PEOPLE** who hold positions of power to run/oversee such said entities that lead to a lack of good governance and leadership.  Moreover, it is also a reflection of the will of citizens or individuals (or lack thereof) who vote "yay" or "nay" to put these individuals in their respective positions of power. 
2	1523915427	8	> All of this down with bank fever is nothing more than a smoke-n-screen play to provide cover for their own selfish and greedy ends.Please don't say that about our community when we are all indebted to a faceless central structure just for being alive.>  Moreover, it is also a reflection of the will of citizens or individuals (or lack thereof) who vote "yay" or "nay" to put these individuals in their respective positions of power. It's obvious you have no idea what you're talking about. The system is broken, and you're blaming the people. We voted them into the system because we are offered no other choice. They are corrupted by the system because they are offered no other choice. Cryptocurrency offers a foundation to establish a choice. If you don't understand this, you are the selfish and greedy person you hate. I pray for the good of us all the Almighty "Dollar Bill" collapses in our lifetime, and the void isn't filled with a different centralized currency.
3	1523920675	2	In my country, the people voted Donald fucking Trump into office.  I absolutely blame the people for putting corrupt assholes in power who have zero interest in protecting the common person's interests. 
4	1523923623	12	> I absolutely blame the people for putting corrupt assholes in power who have zero interest in protecting the common person's interestsThat described both candidates.
4	1523924752	3	Which common people? The dems don't want the repubs to defend their common people. The repubs don't want the dems to defend their common people. All common people, you say? Until people can grow up, stop picking sides and start following the "live and let live" principle, it won't happen. Those in power know how easy it is to manipulate simple people, and most people are simple people.
4	1523929391	1	Well no, "the people ", the majority vote, voted in Hillary. The electoral college voted in Trump.    But then we would been stuck with Hillary. Lose-lose scenario, most people I know who voted (and I'm guessing you)  only did so to try and keep someone out of office, not to try and get someone in.
3	1523918169	-2	Yes, I blame people!!! Like I said before, inept and corrupt PEOPLE were the root cause for this broken system we have now. People make the rules and regulations, people find loopholes to bypass laws that undermine the system. Listen to yourself, "I pray for the good of us all the Almighty "Dollar Bill" collapses in our lifetime, and the void isn't filled with a different centralized currency." You have no FUCKING clue as to what you speak. This is stupidity; nothing more than pubescent illogical nonsense from someone who can sit behind a computer screen and block out all of the calamity and utter disarray that would cause worldwide--civil unrest, war, etc. 
4	1523938584	1	1. So how does FIAT perform better than crypto?2. Instead of ad hominem attacks please lay your point clearly.Lack of arguments prove that you are shitposting
5	1523943222	1	I didn't say the current system performed better. If you actually read the post or better yet understood it, you would see that I was trying to underscore the fact that if you have people/individuals overseeing the process who look for ways to undermine or corrupt the system for their own personal gain, it doesn't matter what monetary system you have in place.

2	1523930083	0	Then whats the point of it you retarded asshole. Its cryptoCURRENCY for a fucking reason dumbass.
3	1523938457	1	It doesn't happen overnight, bitcoin is the only one that *has* scale, and the one even close to having the *ability* to scale. Etherem scaling is exponentially tougher than Bitcoin's. While you retards get duped by *"1000 transactions per second"* gimmicks on your shitcoins, you ignore the most important characteristics of a blockchain that only Bitcoin has. Scaling and currency usage is coming, that's not even an issue anymore, but right now this space is in the speculation phase. That's how the network is forming. If people wanted to buy shit w/ crypto they can use bcash, doge, litecoin, nano, etc but they don't, because no one gives a shit. The stats are clear. They wanna speculate, and that's okay, that's a part of the growth phase and necessary to grow the network, which in turn makes bitcoin more valuable (*metcalfe's*). A lot of people, especially any legitimate institution wanna speculate on, as the op said, the most reputable flagship. But you won't understand any of that, and I rather you keep your tunnel vision b/c you're a dumbass
0	1523929144	9	Stating that we are still very early in the cryptocurrency space is not a bold statement. When compared to traditional markets, Bitcoin and all other blockchain projects have yet to even appear on the radar of most individuals of power and wealth. 
1	1523969990	2	That's a myth at this point.  It may have been true a couple of years ago.  You won't find much real evidence that now, most of the first world is well aware of Bitcoin.
0	1523929235	49	This sub loves to hate on Bitcoin, because the majority of people here all found out about crypto within the past year and are holding heavy alt-coin bags. They also fail to realize that Bitcoin has been tried and tested for nearly a **decade**, and it is still going strong today with the most institutional/public acceptance and usage **by far**. And as we've seen time and time again, Bitcoin is the backbone of all crypto and (imo) the most resilient store of value the world has ever seen. Some of the shitcoins that people attempt to shill here are absolutely laughable.
1	1523940692	17	it's mainly because they want their shitcoin to pump.
2	1523972601	1	Maybe people just don't want to own a piece of subpar technology just because it's name.
3	1523979868	1	Could you explain to me why bitcoins technology is subpar? I don't mean arguments like it has slow transactions. I myself have no idea about the code of Bitcoin or any other crypto. Do you know anything about the code?
2	1523956628	0	Oh, so that's why REQ, top100 coin super small market cap, has a threads on Reddit daily and even its own weekly thread aswell? 
1	1523930837	-21	Ltc btc bch have the longest track records 
2	1523931083	12	Huh? Bcash hasn't even been around a year. It hard forked from Bitcoin in August of last year. 
3	1523931609	-1	Uh-oh, you asked for it. Incoming lecture about "longest chain" and "real Bitcoin" imminent.  *For the record, I agree with you.
4	1523934525	-5	Bch and btc share the same history and previous chain u tards
5	1523962910	2	lol I remember when I got sucked into /r/btcYou’ll wander back outta that hell hole eventually...if you’re lucky 
6	1523976106	0	i think you are mistaken. I own both but no way i would blindly put more capital into btc down here when I can get way more honest bang for buck with bchsome of the arrogant core frontmen make me sick. You can see their snippy stupid comments on twitter. What loser wakes up and wants to bash BCASH BCASH every day
5	1523947453	0	You sure know how to effectively debate.
3	1523934800	-6	They were the same coin until August 1st, where they split into two different versions of the same thing. So /u/Libertymark is right.

5	1523940052	2	this sub is brigaded hard as fuck. keep on keepin' on
6	1523945046	-1	Giving us both downvotesPathetic
7	1523978891	1	yep. no need to debate us with 'actual' arguments when a couple of downvotes will bury the comments
8	1523979005	1	these people are so scared of bch I love it! 
3	1523934685	-4	Wrong they both forked off the same historic chain 
2	1523937804	1	Peercoin and others are much older than LTC. 
3	1523961636	1	What are you on about? Litecoin is literally the first altcoin from back in 2011. Peercoin wasn't created until mid-2012. 
3	1523938823	1	Ltc is one of the oldest large cap cryptos that is actually relevant
1	1523935842	-6	bitcoin gonna do the same thing that the Sear's catalog did once harbor freight showed up
0	1523941414	4	Good point. Well said. 
0	1523946780	4	Word.
0	1523949924	3	When I started, i hated bitcoin, and thouht holding bitcoin was dumb dinosaurs clinging to their shit outdated tech.  Now Im over half bitcoin, and If id had more bitcoin early, my losses wouldnt have been so staggering.  Live, learn.
0	1523952678	3	This is very much true.. BTC is the statue and the model that actually became the most influential part of cryptocurrency. Bashing it won't necessary affect Bitcoin, but it will affect all of us. It is the base of the price of every coin that has been created since it has skyrocketed. Thanks to bitcoin we're finally reached a point where every person will have the opportunity to succeed.
0	1523953617	3	100% agreed whether you like BTC or not dont go around bashing it to people who dont understand the technology and the market coz you will scare them away rather try to explain blockchain DLT and bitcoin so they can make an informed opinion on their ownas for decoupling i think we need some major players to kick in first binance and bittrex adding fiat pairings and coinbase adding tokens will be a good start I think first the top 10-15 alts will decouple which in itself will take some time then the rest will slowly follow its not going to be an overnight shift as some expect
0	1523915502	11	Some people will always enjoy throwing rocks at the throne. Its just a personality type. Its never going to go away, its useless trying to get people to stop really.
1	1523971131	2	Some people just hate waiting longer and paying more than  a swift transfer 
1	1523972661	1	In the throne sits an old useless man.
2	1523980040	1	Old maybe but why useless?
0	1523956512	4	It's also mostly *why* people are hating Bitcoin that's extremely stupid. Most here don't actually have any point or any knowledge, as to why exactly they bash Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just a scapegoat for everything and became boring for the average Vergeminded investor, and there's many of those here in the sub. You complain Bitcoin is not innovative, but fail to understand that the reason Bitcoin is stiff in development, is because it's *secure and it's already operating*. Many of your shitcoins are still just theories. Of course you can claim/add whatever you want about those, but Bitcoin is already real and changes have to be applied with utmost care, to keep the security and up running. It cannot allow mistakes and it certainly can't just roll back whenever something shitty happens. The truth is, to this day, there's *very few* coins that are decentralized like Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is infact the savehaven in Crypto and that won't change either for a while, whether you want decoupling or not. 
1	1523980282	1	Is monero decentralized?Edit: I agree with you
0	1523935865	9	THANK YOU... FINALLY someone said this. Crypto community bashing Bitcoin makes everyone involved like a bunch of children. If Bitcoin succeeds, it opens the way for every other coin out there. Stop it with the immature hate just because you're holding bags of alts.
1	1523971915	0	I hate btc because it got me margin called by taking 3 fucking days to execute a transaction last year due to shit performance but that's just me
0	1523924365	18	This sub is the home of the alt-coin kiddy pool. Where retards who discovered crypto last year think anything with a "blockchain" like Tron, provides the same benefits of the Bitcoin blockchain. These morons bash the only truly immutable blockchain and give life to shitcoins and ICO scams. Bitcoin is the best application of blockchain, the only crypto that has provides financial freedom, the only crypto that banks are threatened by... and yet, these dumbasses act as useful idiots for the banks when they try to bash Bitcoin.  I love it when the idiots here blame Bitcoin when their shitcoins plummet 
1	1523930434	9	On the bright side, BTC people will gain, shitcoiners will lose because of their ignorance.
2	1523956778	3	Trading Altcoins mostly to increase my BTC amount. I know they pump in certain seasons, sell and back into safe money, which is not fiat, it's Bitcoin. My yearly goal is to have X Bitcoin more than previous year.There are some exceptions of course. I like Monero and Cardano a lot. But in most cases I trade to increase BTC comparative. 
3	1523973902	1	> Trading Altcoins mostly to increase my BTC amount. I know they pump in certain seasons, sell and back into safe money, which is not fiat, it's BitcoinYou are the last of a dying breed I think. I believe a lot of the newer investors from 2017 missed those lessons. They have 99% of their money in crypto in random alts they believe in, and hate Bitcoin for either outgaining their alts, or "dragging it down" in bear markets. They don't buy BTC because its "too expensive" and they cannot own several of them etc.Leads to them hating on it to justify their own personal bags/investments.
1	1523925128	7	100% agreed. Sub full of altcoin shills, claiming bitcoin supporters are brainwashed. So ridiculous, to be in a cryprocurrency subreddit that bashes the - by far - most superior crypto project 
2	1523947683	14	Wow, you Bitcoin supports are cult-like and delusional if you consider Bitcoin's blockchain tech to be the most superior crypto project out there. Just because something has been around for years doesn't mean it is the best choice. As I have posted elsewhere, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and has been around for many years. However, where is its mass adoption by major retailers, companies, etc.? When you think about it, the only mainstream adoption Bitcoin has is that of serving as the de-facto base/exchange currency at a majority of crypto exchanges. Bitcoin has, what I like to call, "sporadic boutique" retail usage here and there, but nothing noteworthy after 10 years in the game. Let me put it this way. If Bitcoin's network is so magnificent then why don't we hear of its worldwide domination of fiat currency etc.?? Let me be clear, I'm not bashing Bitcoin. Like I've stated elsewhere the blockchain technology that gave rise to Bitcoin has ushered in a whole new industry around digital securities/assets allowing the transfer of digital property/value, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure. I will keep typing this until my hands fall off. Adoption is key here. Bitcoin doesn't have it.If Bitcoin had a remote chance of becoming the global digital asset standard it needed to have garnered support from those in the global financial community who control monetary policy (i.e. IMF, World Bank, BIF, Central banks,etc.). I believe Bitcoin would have been more readily accepted by the broader financial/banking/regulatory community had there been a more conciliatory partnership to help make improvements to the overall system. This chasm created by Bitcoin, coupled with the lack of network scalability etc. gave rise to others, like Ripple, who saw the opportunity to strategically place themselves as the antithesis of Bitcoin's anti-bank stance and technological disadvantages. Instead of following the footsteps of Bitcoin in opposition to the entire banking/financial system, Ripple embraced the role of helping banks/regulators modernize the antiquated financial systems in place around payments of all types (cross-border, Retail, P2P, B2B, etc.). This show of good-faith, cooperation, and support from Ripple to the broader financial, banking, and regulatory community worldwide has not gone unrewarded. This pretentious idea many in the “cryptosphere” have believing governments and central banks around the world are going to relinquish the reigns of monetary policy, AML, KYC, and CFT laws to the PoW or consensus mechanism performed by a cryptocurrency or digital asset without having rules and regs in place to govern such said processes is simply nonsense.
3	1523972072	2	Are you on speed? Your argument is that bitcoin is not the best project in the space because it has not gained the strongest hold in existing financial institutions? Interesting how you didn't mention the fundementals, where bitcoin is far and away the strongest.
4	1523983435	1	Fundamentals you say, It's slow, can't scale, its community/developers disregard for regulatory compliance make it unfit for FIs, banks, Payment providers, etc. As I have stated in other posts you can't become the worlds global digital asset bucking the entire financial system as a whole.  The only solid use-case that I can see Bitcoin having is as a store of value, but even that begs the question, based upon what? Speculation? Greed? FOMO? What is BTC being valued against to give credence to its existence? In my opinion, Bitcoin should be in Ripple’s position with respects to partnerships and adoption. XRP has a defined use-case, which is eliminating the excessive costs associated with the FRICTION (i.e. correspondent banks/fees) in sending cross-border payments. What many ‘Bitcoiners’ fail to understand is that the PROBLEM (i.e. this FRICTION) that XRP is solving ascribe to XRP its purpose and therefore its massive price appreciation potential. I will repeat, if Bitcoin had any hopes of becoming the global digital asset standard it needed to have garnered support from those who make and decide monetary policy. 
5	1523984720	1	Can't scale?
6	1523985564	1	Yes, can't scale. As I mentioned in another post, so many cling to this delusional fantasy of how Bitcoin and its new and improved "Lightning Network" it is going to solve the scaling and exploding transaction costs. The truth is that there is a huge misunderstanding that unlimited scaling (via the new Lightning Network) will solve all Bitcoin's problems. Because every open/close of an LN channel means an expansion in transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, causing the bottleneck shifts from a limit on the transactions that can be processed on-chain to a bottleneck on how many payment channels can be opened or closed at any given time. It's important to remember that Lightning doesn't allow instant settlement of funds. That means that you can't spend lightning funds until the lightning channel has been closed and the final state transmitted to the blockchain. Effectively what lightning does is allow a massive increase in the capacity for changing ownership of BTC but the BTC doesn't "move" until the channel closes. This means that if more than 7 channels want to close per second you will once again get lag.
7	1523985876	1	I don't think anyone believes that the lightning network makes infinite transactions possible... It multiplies current scale by an order of magnitude. And more second and third and fourth layer solutions will be built upon the rock solid stable fundemental foundation base layer protocol that bitcoin has built.Bitcoins current limited capacity is necessary to provide a stable decentralized currency. Something like ripple is so far inferior to bitcoin in its lack of decentralization and strong security fundementals that comparing the two is laughable.
3	1523982654	2	Its kinda the Libertarian fantasy, not that Evil Bankers decide to accept a new anonymous and free financial order, but that it is some kind of bottom up monetary revolution. All the people's money just moves off their books, and when they show up hat in hand in DC saying 'Too big to fail', we show up as well and say 'just fail, we don't need you anymore' The moment of change has passed after the occupy movement ended, but the anger remains, it just needs a Financial Trump to get up on that podium, and guide the masses to a revolution. They will never get there on their own, its sort of a crisis driven change. But with 1 TRILLION dollar deficits as far as the eye can see, and infinite inflation now the standard policy in the US, its not hard to imagine a new crisis even bigger than 2008 causing full fiat debasement, being a strong motivator to move on to a people-controlled currency.
1	1523979952	1	You're right but cursing is making you look like an idiot yourself. I know it's frustrating but we should keep it civil. Edit: You stupid cunt.
1	1523937843	-3	Alta provide an easy entry to most new crypto investors, look at XVG cultist they swear that XVG is the holy grail of privacy coins and are oblivious to anything scandalous about their shit coin. They can spend 100-200 dollars get 2k coins and feel like they’re Gordon Gekko all of a sudden. Some Alts are great like Monero among others but most are shit coins that are out scamming people. 
0	1523959005	2	Agree. But people just worries about their investments, and when there was a bearish mood, people worried even about alts. P.S. Fortunately I haven't lost money from buying CS coins, so I've just looked at this bashing.
0	1523967448	2	I believe the market already is decoupled from BTC. Saying everything is increasing with BTC is ignorant, and you could even say BTC increases because the rest of the market increases. Like it or not, BTC can have good news, and that will only affect BTC, not the whole market. There are ups and downs in every kind of market, no matter which stage it is (early or late). Stocks increase and decrease somewhat in sync unless there are news or hype surrounding a stock. People use BTC for exchanging between two altcoins, thus the high daily volume (same goes for ethereum), but in general, it's all about how the market is doing... stop fanboying over your precious "anchor" BTC, and open your eyes... there's an evolving market out there.
0	1523969330	2	Forget the 'features' and 'specs', bitcoin is and will be the biggest usecase of crypto out there by providing sound, uncensored, permissionless and decentralized store of value and a currency.All the shitcoins would shit themselves if a government was to take action against any of them. Bitcoin is the only one that has gone through the hardships no other shitcoin had to and Bitcoin has set a precedent by fighting the system and standing up for the crypto usecase for years.I am an alt guy, but I never undermine what BTC has done for crypto and how BTC will always remain an integral part of it. People who shit on BTC don't know the whole market wouldn't have existed if it wasn't for BTC's resilience and the fanatic support it has. Please read the history of the market before shitting on the pillar of it.
0	1523970311	2	I just think that Bitcoin is the Netscape or Myspace of Crypto, it was the first big one, showed the potential and brought attention to the market and with that attention comes younger better projects that will eventually surpass it.Blanket calling everyone idiot shitcoin bag holders doesn't help either.
0	1523905517	21	>Bitcoin and its reputation is why money enters the crypto space. When you make stupid blanket statements like that, they are almost guaranteed to be wrong.  Crypto didn't really take off until Ethereum and ERC20s arrived so it seems to be the complete opposite of what you are saying.
1	1523933572	11	That's not true, the big 2013 bubble was driven entirely by Bitcoin itself. Ethereum just drove the huge altcoin ICO bubble by making it easy for anybody to issue an ICO for an ERC20 token. Whether that was actually a positive thing is questionable, frankly I felt it made it too easy for teams that didn't necessarily have the right talent to develop truly innovative projects to come and issue a garbage token. 
2	1523957417	2	According to university research, the 2013 bubble was driven by massive fraud by a bot on MtGox that "painted the tape". So no healthy adoption or use that drove it up, but a fraudulent set of trading bots. you can read the research paper at: http://weis2017.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/05/WEIS_2017_paper_21.pdf 
1	1523933336	6	Wrong. All the people I know that are not crypto investing tell me they want to start buying Bitcoin and not other stuff. Beginners know only Bitcoin name
2	1523934091	1	Yep. To the layman, Bitcoin is synonymous with Cryptocurrency. If someone asks me if I'm "into that bitcoin thing" I'll say yes despite owning zero BTC at the moment, because I know what they mean.
1	1523920847	-8	Yeah, but it's the OG.  I think that is what he is trying to say.  Everyone who knows what cryptocurrecy is knows about BTC.  A lot of people know about Ethereum as well, but not as many as BTC.I don't think they are claiming that BTC is the only reason people put money in.  I think they are saying it is one of the original coins.  That damaging it's reputation would damage the industry as well.  I disagree with the statement though.  I think we should bash it a shitload.  If they are going to be the front runner they need to be the best.  I really don't understand why BTC is doing better than other coins like DASH.  DASH does everything BTC does, but for a shitload cheaper and a shitload faster.   ETH has smart contracts and does what BTC does...  BTC takes over an hour to transfer money and has high ass fees.  BTC needs to step-up or get out of the way.  The sooner the better.   Anyone else noticing BTCC and BTCG increasing in value a lot more than BTC?  Probably because they are literally BTC done better...
2	1523938031	5	Dash is highly centralized. ETH has massive security holes, and for better or worse has a dictator, again highly centralized. BTC takes about 15 minutes and costs $0.30 to send a transaction. I *hold* ETH, but you’re either glazing over or not aware of its downsides compared to BTC. 
3	1523942053	4	Most people think eth==btc+code. Very few know about the reduced security issues. 
2	1523941124	3	>  BTC takes over an hour to transfer money and has high ass fees.This is patently false, and has been since the very beginning of February '18.  Crypto moves fast, you know damn well your argument no longer applies.  
3	1523960294	1	That’s not the case right now, but the next fee explosion could happen at any moment. Last Thursday or Friday (when the BTC price shot up) the mempool was immediately backlogged and stayed so for almost 10 hours—accordingly fees rose ~500% in that window. That volume was *nothing* compared to what was going on in December. The next sustained fee explosion is on the way... you can count on that. 
2	1523922376	2	Im not entirely in disagreement, but its easier to look at clones and say, look its better! when no one uses it as much as btc is. Give the same quantity of transactions to any clone and they run into issues whether scaling or security that btc has faced.
0	1523928818	3	but but... we must make another "lets decouple btc from alts because btc is dragging us down MIMIMIMI"-Post!
0	1523920524	10	Just my opinion: Bitcoin does not perform as it was intended to.  30-50$ fees and slow transaction speed have basically made bitcoin a game for those with a lot of money.  As a casual investor, I don't use or buy bitcoin. Other alts have already improved the formula and I would never use Bitcoin to bridge me from fiat to other alts I own unless I absolutely had no other options.  
1	1523924674	12	Sounds like you honestly have no clue what you're talking about. $30 fees affected a tiny percentage of users and it happened in December for a very short period of time. Fees are back to where they have been for the past 9 years. Exchanges are now batching transactions and wallets are using Segwit, so when demand picks up again you'll likely never see fees that high again. And then there's lightning.
2	1523927735	9	Doesn't sound like you do either.  The *median* fee reached $30 - not a tiny percentage of users.  Fees have dropped recently most likely because the amount of transactions have halved and are at 2015 levels.  SegWit adoption only increased ~15% and SegWit only allows for around double the amount of transactions (which isn't a lot) before the blocks fill up and the fees rise again.  Lightning is a big question mark.  I'm very skeptical myself because of routing issues, always having to be online, and loading a balance.  It's bad enough just to get regular users to make on chain transactions.
3	1523934415	2	The transactions dropped significantly but the outputs didn't, it's mostly just that big exchanges now batch a lot so that the outputs per transaction are at it's highest ever: https://outputs.today/ In fact today seems to be a record day at 3.64 outputs per transaction.The super high fees basically finally lit a fire under everyone's butt to actually optimize their outputs to avoid a tragedy of the commons so I actually think this worked as intended.I'm not so sure about Lightning as well, but that's mostly because I have some concerns that second layer solutions may screw with the well balanced incentives for securing the blockchain. Like 10 years down the line when the reward has further dropped, will fees be sufficient to secure Bitcoin properly if LN works super well? If LN really functions very well and there's a ton of liquidity in payment channels then people might almost never use the main blockchain, in which case how will we generate sufficient fees to keep Bitcoin secure? That's the hard problem to solve, because essentially we still need sufficient transactions on the primary chain to keep things secure.
4	1523938354	1	Outputs *per transaction* is up but the total number of outputs per block have still dropped a lot.
3	1523929581	0	Why are you being downvoted?
4	1523940138	9	All negative comments on Bitcoin are being downvoted.  Looks like dragon's den is out in force.
4	1523931174	0	Because he's pulling random numbers out of his ass lol
5	1523938743	2	You're welcome to correct me.
5	1523936103	4	If you actually look at what he's talking about, you'll see that he's not just making things up. Segwit adoption is low and so is number of transactions
3	1523939109	0	Fees right now are at $0.30 and would remain so if we hit December levels. Segwit adoption is now much higher than 15% - I believe it’s around 60%. 
4	1523939739	5	Fees will always increase with the amount of transactions because of the fee market design.I didn't say it was 15%, I said it *increased* 15%.  It's 35% currently: http://segwit.party/charts/#
5	1523942241	1	Thanks, that site wouldn’t load on my phone. Fees stay flat until the mempool reaches saturation, meaning that they will remain at about $0.30 until blocks start filling. 
6	1523943888	1	Ah, you may be right on that.  It seems the median fee is actually very closely correlated to the market price though.  Not sure if that's just wallets not adjusting for the appropriate amount of sats to be added for the fee or what.  I'm not exactly sure how that works.
7	1523943971	1	Oh that’s a good point. The fee will remain about the same in BTC, but fluctuate in terms of USD. Fee estimation is actually really complicated. 
7	1523957204	1	It's true. 35% adoption could in fact expose us to another time of high fees. However not in the 30$ range for sure, I think a bullrun would spike fees as currently is, assuming 20000BTC levels from December, I'd estimate that we see 1.5$ at highest. The truth is we still hold 8000$ and fees were already spiking at that level the last time around. Fee of 1.5$ would still be too high, so there's that also. Segwit needs further adoption, but some people still refuse is the issue. However everyone involved understands that these fees are too high aswell. It likely will push to bring people over to the pro Segwit side, as it did happen already in January aswell. I honestly believe we're totally fine. The solution to the problem arrived and the solution to the greater scale problem is on Beta on mainnet. Besides Litecoin there's going to be few survivors, specially among the coins that specialize on low fees. Do-Captcha-Get-Nano is probably one of these.
3	1523941551	-2	Segwit adoption doubled, not increased by 15&#37;.  Percentages are tricky. 
4	1523942197	1	Obviously I'm talking about the amount transactions that are segwit, smartass.
5	1523943791	0	[So am I.](http://segwit.party/charts/#)  It went from roughly 12&#37; to over 30&#37;, this is more than twice as many.  Where are your numbers coming from?
6	1523944281	1	Which is a ~15% increase.  Apparently percentages *are* tricky.
7	1523944931	1	A 15&#37; increase would bring it to about 16&#37; adoption.  What we've seen is over 100&#37; increase from prior levels.  You don't use subtraction, you use division.  [https://www.marshu.com/articles/calculate\-percent\-increase\-decrease\-difference\-between\-percent\-percentages\-calculator.php](https://www.marshu.com/articles/calculate-percent-increase-decrease-difference-between-percent-percentages-calculator.php)
8	1523947261	1	Pretty sure it can be interpreted either way but I don't know, I'm not a mathmatician, it's late and I don't care, and it doesn't change my original point either way.
9	1523947418	1	I wasn't trying to pick a fight, and I'm sorry if I was a dick about the rules of mathematics.  Here's to the next bull run.  
2	1523927606	8	thats crazy man. the fact of the matter is that it hits a cap around 300k transactions a day and if then fees go parabolic. if we have another bull run and people moving money from exchange to exchange, we will have high fees.
3	1523934226	5	Yes but exchanges are now batching transactions so each transaction can have hundreds of outputs. The average [output per transaction is now higher than ever before](https://outputs.today/) so that 300K transaction limit really represents something like 1 million outputs on average and with aggressive batching it could be more. So I actually think there is some fairly decent breathing room here while they work on other scaling solutions. With further optimizations we can probably get to a couple million outputs on-chain within a couple of years and obviously if second layer solutions actually work it'll be far more. Of course second layer solutions need to be balanced such that the fees on the primary layer are sufficient to keep securing Bitcoin. How we come to balance that is going to be the real problem, I'm not sure the incentives for that part are quite as well worked out as for the original blockchain.
4	1523936406	6	that alleviates none of my concerns. ethereum for example already does 4x bitcoin's daily transactions at the peak of the dec. bubble. 300k on bitcoin vs 1.2 million on ethereum. Lightning has been promised for such a long time and there are lots of videos out there postulating that it may not work. I don't understand the technicalities of that, so I'm just waiting for some news or to see something where lightning may solve some of bitcoin's problems. ethereum has it's own version of lightning called raiden and although this is an exciting project, ethereum's "lightning" doesn't really get talked about much as they just seem like state channels. ethereum has many other scaling options and plasma is getting a lot of attention as well as plasma cash. the thought with this is that they can outstrip visa in number of transactions. "batching" and having to rely on good actors to "please! don't clog our network!" seems pretty unworkable for a supposed trustless system.
2	1523941414	2	And Schnorr Signatures are in development as well.  This tech helps with optimizing transactions with many inputs/outputs that would previously have been very costly.  
1	1523933888	4	I've never paid a Bitcoin fee higher than $2 and that was to transaction what was back then a mid-five figure sum, but then again I didn't try to move complex blocks during that frenzied peak demand period. I don't think the skyrocketing fees helped adoption during that period but on the other hand I do think that the high fees actually made people work to more efficiently use the blockchain space instead of just issuing over the top huge transactions that clogged up the blockchain. So while I do think it hurt adoption I think it probably was necessary for it to occur to avoid a tragedy of the commons situation. With more efficient use of blockchain space and larger blocks now available Bitcoin has been moving similar numbers of outputs with super low fees now. If they manage to get LN to work reliably fees should drop even further.You have to remember that with Bitcoin they focus primarily on remaining secure and immutable more than just speed, speed, speed. The store of value has to be first and foremost and security is super important for that, and then the ability to spend it cheaply is basically a secondary goal. Admittedly it wasn't always like that, but it's not entirely unreasonable to do it this way nowadays when you have so much money on the line.

The real problem that I have with this "coupling" is when Bitcoin becomes dysfunctional, but we still have to use it, because it has the widest adoption among merchants and exchanges. We should be increasing adoption of our other cryptos to the point where a problem in any single crypto doesn't affect users of other cryptos.

0	1523920587	3	"Don't call out our drawbacks because then people will think badly of us and that's bad for the whole market because we are the brand ambassador for crypto." I won't push your agenda for short term gains. It will be better when people realize Bitcoin doesn't deserve the #1 spot and things are able to decouple. Which by the way, won't happen 'naturally.' It will require effort to set up more fiat pairings. Bitcoin did an extraordinary thing in paving the way for this whole space, but it simply can't compete with next generation projects.
0	1523935616	3	Bitcoin appears to be on the long term downtrend, a flippening will occur anytime in the future.
1	1523942358	3	>anytime in the future.     Wow, what a *bold* prediction.

3	1523950481	2	Market dominance doesn't tell you if your bags will go up or down. It's a good indicator telling if alts rise or drop against btc. In rare case Btc dominance can drop while btc price rises (it means alts going up big time).

1	1523940635	1	You are an idiot.
1	1523941937	0	Chances are it wont die. If you used your brian youd probably realize that. Bitcoin may decouple and lose value but itll still live in some way for people to invest.b
0	1523923293	3	Who is doing that other than fanboys of other crypto? I don't anyone serious about crypto, blockchain, and decentralization have this view of bitcoin. 
1	1523936842	6	I've personally seen two posts on this subreddit calling for BTC decoupling with thousands of upvotes. 
2	1523937912	-1	Let's be really real. The reason people are not into Bitcoin anymore is bacuse most of us can't afford it. 
3	1523941326	3	>bacuse most of us can't afford it.I'm sorry, what?  If you are avoiding buying a cryptocurrency because of a love of whole numbers, you aren't in the right place.  BTC is divisible out to 8 decimals, and that can be changed with a fork if the need arises.  
1	1523961157	1	I have the opposite experience. My circle avoids BTC whenever possible bc it is generally viewed as broken. We used to mainly be BTC maximalists (as late as summer 2017), but around that time we started to realize the project had been grossly derailed. Not to mention the marketing tactics employed by Core/Blockstream have basically devolved to trolling and censorship.
0	1523905767	5	Didnt even read the article but i feel like the title is well said. 
0	1523922753	2	Yeah I stopped using Yahoo years ago. Fuck Bitcoin. 
1	1523928765	3	You are trying to compare an early internet **company** to a revolutionary **technology**. No comparison whatsoever. 
2	1523937166	5	I think, the comparison here is fair. Bitcoin is an **implementation** of technology. The same or improved technology is used in other cryptos, in a better way.
0	1523926126	2	I think it is unfair to value other coins based on bitcoin, for this reason, I like decoupling. If bitcoin becomes "digital gold" it will keep its value, but there are many other projects which are closer to real world applications hence I dont think it's fair to value them based on bitcoin
1	1523935140	2	So then the other projects, mainly start ups, should be worth as much as real business start ups. What I'm saying is, the reason for their ridiculous valuations is because of bitcoin, not in spite of it.
2	1523958790	1	We could argue on this for days, but at the end of day, they are personal opinions. I dont think real businesses (not just ordinary people) buy these projects based on bitcoin price, rather based on "future potential" by blockchain technology each company bring. Of course if you think blockchain is only bitcoin, you are right, but anyone can create a blockchain without bitcoin (many have already been created) so each companies should be valued separately. Asking everything to value based on bitcoin is something similar to asking to value every internet-based companies based on one company, but we dont have such a system, so if oneday blockchain technolgy becomes what internet did to the whole system, each project should be valued separately. If you think buying tokens are a gamble, you are right, but that's not the case for every investor. If the whole blockchain technology change the world as internet did, each project will be valued based on their use cases (e.g., bitcoin as the "digital gold", ETH, NEO, EOS, ADA as platforms for built decentralised projects, and there are 100s of other applications).But I agree on one thing you said that these projects should be start ups and valued so, but since the whole blockchain technology is so early, people by them based on "future potential" due to fear of buying them at 100x price later.

2	1523910624	-3	she knowing about bitcoin is irrelevant, that doesn't make it flagship product.
3	1523913569	3	If it's not for recognition, then what does make it a flagship product? Simply being the biggest of them all? That's a completely transient quality to have. Most developers? That's simply being a product of it being biggest. Should another coin take that place the development just moves over.   There really isn't anything in particular that makes Bitcoin special, other than it being first. Everything else really makes it a very mediocre coin.  
4	1523930146	4	I don't consider "having heard the term but having no idea what it is" as recognition. 
4	1523916207	0	>There really isn't anything in particular that makes Bitcoin special, other than it being first. Everything else really makes it a very mediocre coin.Agree, that's why I can't call it flagship product. Flagship product is the one that has technical qualities + certain degree of recognition, and right now Ethereum is that one.
1	1523923682	-8	Naaah, I'll bet Ripple over Ethereum or any other blockchain tech in crypto for that matter. Ripple is so far beyond everybody else in this space that it's laughable. NO OTHER blockchain organization/foundation can lay claim to Ripple's level of adoption in any industry especially the global financial community as a whole……. NONE!!! While most can only speak of "collaborations" and "proofs-of-concept." Ripple can actually show evidence and provide proof of how they are solving their "ACTUAL" customers problems.  “Surveying the market, Ripple was the only company that has delivered battle-tested enterprise solutions and global bank customer traction, including commercial deals with top banks already signed in Asia Pacific,” said President and CEO of SBI Holdings Yoshitaka Kitao. “Distributed financial technology is undoubtedly transforming financial infrastructure and we’re excited to drive its adoption throughout Asia” (https://ripple.com/ripple_press/ripple-strikes-multi-national-deal-with-sbi-holdings-to-meet-growing-demand-for-ripple-solutions-across-asia/). With this being, said Ripple's blockchain tech is the only tech that is Enterprise ready.Ethereum's broad adoption is primarily from ICOs and the question that oftentimes come to mind is how many of those ICOs are going to fail as a result of no defined use-case, lack of vision and focus, poor leadership, etc? I believe while this a-la-carte ICO market has been very lucrative for Ethereum in the short-term it may ultimately cause its downfall. The fact that Ethereum has yet to find a viable solution to the network’s scaling and technical issues is still the ELEPHANT in the room (https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-time-highs-overshadow-wave-technical-issues/). It is evident that Vitalik realizes that a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus model is not robust or dynamic enough to scale appropriately. He has recently started a ‘scalability initiative’ in attempts to solicit help from the broader developer community to assist with Ethereum’s scalability issues caused by the ever backlog of Cryptokitties, Etherbots, and ICOs clogging the network (https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/01/02/ethereum-scalability-research-development-subsidy-programs/). According to Vitalik, scaling Ethereum’s network “is the single most important key technical challenge that developers need to work on before blockchain applications can be widely used.” The folks at Ethereum have even gone as far as changing the consensus model from a PoW to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) strategy called Casper (https://www.coindesk.com/ethereums-big-switch-the-new-roadmap-to-proof-of-stake/). However, as has been pointed out in Ripple’s new whitepaper regarding the newly proposed XRP-Consensus Ledger replacement consensus: 'Cobalt: BFT Governance in Open Networks,' there are inherent flaws with a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07240.pdf Pgs: 10-11).In addition to the ICO/Tokens that plague ETH network that I mentioned earlier, you have the resurgence of Ripple’s smart contract platform called Codius that will be revamped and rolled-out this year. According to Stefan Thomas (Ripple’s CTO) who said in a Quora Q&A session (https://www.quora.com/session/Stefan-Thomas-1/1), “I worked on Ripple’s smart contract system Codius back in 2013–2015. Back then, our conclusion was that a viable smart contracts ecosystem requires a standard for payments first. Contracts need to be reviewed to be trusted and that’s expensive if you need a new contract for each type of asset because every ledger has a different protocol/API. Thus, Interledger was born.” Smart contracts have been the backbone and life-blood of Ethereum’s existence for the better part of the past +3 years. I think we can expect great things for Codius especially since it will be built on Ripple’s Interledger Protocol. While Ripple might not have had sufficient “bandwidth” to fully commit to Codius development early on, due to the focus on the development of its blockchain solutions (xCurrent/xRapid/xVia/ILP), it is my belief that they have been quietly working on it behind the scenes for a while now.
2	1523930915	8	Ripple is crud on cryptos shoes
2	1523938744	4	Ripple. Lol.A centralized coin that has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies.Noobs want more of a coin and invest in it.Almost every other coin in top 10 is better. Yeah even bitcoin cash.
3	1523944970	-2	Yeah, that's the typical BS shade/response that is always thrown at Ripple/XRP. Haters reject what they fear or don't understand. While Ripple does hold a considerable share of XRP, they have been good stewards of this massive trove and to prove that they recently locked-up 55-billion into 55 escrow accounts with 1 billion to be released every month. The excess XRP left over at the end of each month goes back into another Escrow account and the cycle starts over again. This Escrow lock-up was done to mitigate the idea of them flooding the market with XRP. XRP Escrow: https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-escrows-55-billion-xrp-for-supply-predictability/.  Ripple's success hinges upon the successful adoption of XRP by the financial/retail/corporate industries, so it would be suicide for them to undermine their most strategic and valuable weapon. They understand that in order to maintain network reliability to mitigate the risk of a single point of failure the XRP-Ledger needed to be able to securely run without depending on any one entity. Ripple selects its validators based on diversity, performance, reliability, and security. They purposely have not rushed this process in order to do the proper due-diligence selecting leading data centers throughout the world like WorldLink, Telindus-Proximus Group, Bahnhof (Swedish ISP), AT TOKYO Corporation, Microsoft, MIT, and CGI. Just because Ripple isn't following the same "cookie cutter" path to decentralization like every other blockchain entity out there doesn't mean they are not cognizant of the importance of decentralization. If you are more technically savvy, I recommend downloading the PDF file on Ripple’s new whitepaper regarding the new update to the XRP Consensus Ledger featuring Cobalt (link #2 below, PDF file link will be on the right-hand side). It goes into great details as to Ripple’s plans to make the XRP Consensus Ledger even more dynamic and robust as well as clarify and further define how this new protocol will allow them to create more diverse UNLs.XRP Decentralization Links:Continued Decentralization & the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol: https://ripple.com/insights/continued-decentralization-xrp-ledger-consensus-protocol/The new XRP Consensus Ledger protocol based on Cobalt: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07240Warren Paul Anderson, Product Manager XRP Ledger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9hKaKQ0xo8However, at the end of the day, it all comes down to adoption. Individuals like yourself can't seem to come up with a counter as to why Ripple's blockchain tech (xCurrent, xVia, ILP, and yes, even xRapid/XRP) is being used/implemented by real businesses, over +100 FIs and Banks, or the +40 central bank consortium. Yet, the closest thing to adoption we hear coming from likes of Ethereum or Bitcoin that remotely resembles adoption are proofs-of-concept, MOUs, atm machines, or some random "boutique" retail outlets. You also have never heard of RippleNet having any "scaling issues" or "downtime."
4	1523947302	2	When someone holds 55 billion in escrow that's a company fundraiser and not a cryptocurrency.Hope you weren't thismuch a hopeless noob.

0	1523925198	1	it costs billions of dollars a year to maintain the bitcoin network, and the higher the price of bitcoin the more electricity it will use. I'll bash it if I want to bash it.
1	1523928903	8	Oh what a stupid argument. Electricity is getting **exponentially** cheaper every year. Bash it all you want, but the Bitcoin mining network makes it the most secure network the world has ever seen.
2	1523929042	-1	It doesn't matter how cheap electricity is per unit, the quantity used adjusts to the total cost based on the mining reward. I'm not saying it necessarily isn't worth it, there are huge benefits to having a secure global decentralized currency, I'm just saying it's hugely expensive, and don't kid yourself that the holders of bitcoin aren't paying for it.
3	1523929374	4	> don't kid yourself that the holders of bitcoin aren't paying for it.They aren't. If I have one Bitcoin, the price of that coin depends entirely on market supply vs demand. Nothing else to it. 
4	1523929501	1	You said it right in your answer. Supply and demand. When miners sell to cover electricity costs that is a component of supply which puts downward pressure on price.
5	1523930031	3	That's only miners paying for electricity, not all of the holders like you're saying. By your logic, if a miner needs to sell BTC to feed their family (for example) does that mean all the holders now "pay" for that miner's food due to the downward pressure on price? Of course not. 
6	1523930572	2	I don't think you understand how supply and demand work, or the basic economics of mining. 
7	1523930780	3	I understand, just proving how your logic is incorrect, that's all. Cheers

2	1523928074	5	All users of the network pay these billions indirectly. It is money that gets siphoned off of the network constantly, and turned in to CO2. 
3	1523930615	7	Yeah, no one wants to hear that here though... I agree with you, it totally sucks. With that being said PoW is still the most secure option at this point
4	1523930947	3	Yea, lot's of head in the sand willful ignorance. I would agree PoW hasn't been provably displaced by better options yet, but I suspect that will change.

1	1523956298	3	I won't go so far as saying *everyone* becomes a Bitcoin maximalist over time but for me personally it is certainly the case that I'm becoming more and more maximalist over time.Just some thoughts that I'm having these days:- Adjusting a few parameters like time between blocks does not make a whole lot of difference.- Achieving 1M TPS by having only a handful of validating nodes appointed by some foundation (that also holds 50% of the supply of some coin) sounds great and may have its use cases but it is in no way competing with something like Bitcoin.- Doing transactions under the assumption that they are fully anonymous - only to find out later that loopholes have been found - can be pretty bad. - Security may be more important than flexibility when we're dealing smart contracts.

0	1523948493	-2	And that my friends is the tragedy of crypto.Frankly the flagship is an obsolete implementation of really bad idea. Bitcoin energy consumption is a travesty. No privacy. Actually nothing but hot air.
1	1523956697	2	What do you mean by "really bad idea"?
2	1523957698	0	Is it not obvious.The power consumption for pitiful max 400K transactions per day is beyond ridiculous. You could run distributed trust on a cluster of Rasberry PI devices. Using waste of energy as a way of assigning value is a travesty.The the second major issue is lack of privacy. Bitcoin as originally intended as momentary unit for online transactions. I don't think there are many consumers who would be willing to use a currency where merchant can see all past transactions in the customers bitcoin address.Of course one can do opsec measures, but privacy should be default and automatic, not something that requires skills. Not to mention that since every transaction costs, accomplishing privacy in Bitcoin is rather expensive.And thanks to this, Bitcoin becomes unusable in EU when GDPR privacy legislation becomes enforceable. You can still own bitcoin, but the only way you can use it is as unit of speculation, since no merchant can accept it. Due to the fact that all transactions are readable in blockchain.Also due to lack of privacy, Bitcoin also will run afoul of GPDR right to be forgotten clause.There are newer cryptocoins which have privacy in desgin, but Bitcoin does not.
3	1523964198	1	I completely agree with you on the privacy part. Many people are saying we need more merchant adoption and whatnot but without further privacy improvements I think that would be really bad. Beyond bad. That's why I think Monero is one of the few cyptocurrencies out there that actually has a reason to exist besides Bitcoin. I do think that onion routed payments channels (i.e. Lightning Network) can help a lot too. You say you could run distributed trust on a cluster of Raspberry Pi's, but what consensus mechanism would you propose then? Proof of Stake sure sounds nice but it remains to be seen whether it can really replace Proof of Work if you ask me. 
4	1523969691	0	The whole concept of mining in order just to get coins is retarded. It leads to pyramid schemes not payment systems.What I would see as an ideal system would be running only on transaction costs, or then on added value such as ethereum smart contracts and distributed computing. All computing done by a network should be for some goal, either to verify transactions or provide added value in one way or another.
5	1523978506	1	I'm not sure I fully understand what you're saying. While mining, miners are actually securing the network. And currently there is a block reward in place as an incentive for miners to do so. The Bitcoin block reward reduces over time so that eventually they will only be rewarded transaction fees. But even in that case, they still need to "mine". Otherwise, how do you reach consensus on the state of the blockchain?
6	1523980570	1	The amount of computing used for mining is mostly waste, actual computation needed to reach consensus is really minimal. Which means that there is no need for mining clusters.It would be trivial to build wallet apps that take care of consensus with around 1% cpu load. But almost every coin is done so that mining is heavy, otherwise you don’t get the pyramid and greed effect. 
7	1523986768	1	Could you describe in more detail which part of the computation in PoW is needed for consensus and which part is not?And if there is no mining, how should coins get distributed?
