0	1523981162	129	TIL Pornhub ARIA follows crypto and knows some history of it.
1	1523987581	7	Next stop: Pornhub on blockchain.
0	1523979329	65	that was actually hilarious , who even manages this social accounts?
1	1523979603	44	Aria i assume
2	1523980185	22	i think the better question would be, how do they even select this people? "ok show me how savage you can be at roasting people" 
3	1523985764	9	Social media jobs are a thing. The person who runs this probably has a marketing degree
4	1523985830	8	I think she actually has like a chemical engineering degree or something along those lines 
5	1523988904	1	I would bet on biology.
5	1523986289	1	Sure. I just don't like it when people write off jobs as being no big deal... "How do you even get that"Working for porn hub is awesome, I am sure
6	1523986524	1	No idea about social media / marketing, but on the tech side of I've only heard great things.
6	1523988060	1	Yeah I mean it seems like an awesome job so Iâ€™d imagine it was a pretty competitive job to get.
4	1523989075	1	or other skills...
3	1523985842	2	It's one person, check Aria's interview with HYPEBEAST radio
3	1523982773	-8	nah i think the girls are cam girls or something like that
2	1523982505	8	Now the question remains, where can I see her videos?
3	1523983149	5	Let me do some research..
3	1523985998	1	She doesn't do pr0n but you can follow her on Snap
3	1523987380	1	Username does not check out. 
2	1523988286	1	Stark?
1	1523980415	3	Hahaha totally agree, that's a good question by the way...
1	1523985974	3	Aria, you could follow her on Snapchat, she posts daily videos
2	1523986039	3	whats her snap?
3	1523988113	1	Don't remember but you'll find in in the Twitter bio
1	1523984062	2	He might not have known but it does look questionable that he sold near all time high. Probably should have donated most of it back to LTC or something if he didn't already.
2	1523985562	2	He was openly stating (FUD level 9/10) LTC was over priced since $45. I don't always agree with what the guy says but from all the shit he would talk about the price being so high, he probably had no other option but to sell at $400. A broken clock is right twice a day -or something like that. He was bound to call the top correcly eventually.
2	1523985142	0	he donated some, but he's been long enough into crypto that he knew a drop was comming, that the rise couldn't continue, he did sold some at ATH, some before that (he didn't know exactly when the ATH will be), but ofcourse he wants money out of this, like everyone else, he got rich, but he is still supporting the development process.
3	1523985161	4	Hey, NaabKing, just a quick heads-up:  **comming** is actually spelled **coming**. You can remember it by **one m**.  Have a nice day!^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
4	1523985535	0	whoever made that bot is "da real MVP"! :D
0	1523978185	113	LOL, and his [reply](https://i.redditmedia.com/FI9XQnm1kHDGMREDSiTyAWdf9rAzRQSuNP6BPONh02U.png?w=623&s=2c99b056bd1d6153b763eb119b2df066)"If you accept LTC, I will buy some just so that I can spend LTC to pay for porn.  Deal? ðŸ˜‚"
1	1523985112	26	Holy cringe
2	1523985868	-22	No it's not...
1	1523978217	-145	Yo bitch wrong flair. Nice attempt at hiding the fact you're a verginEdit: Guess you guys misunderstood me l0l. Blahv is a verge cronnie trying to disguise himself as an xmr fan. 
2	1523980845	8	[deleted]
3	1523981402	-37	Sorry? I called his flair out because he is a verge cronnie but is flaired as xmr lover. 
4	1523981527	20	Heaven forbid people diversify and believe in multiple projects..
5	1523981642	-34	Go check the verge currency subreddit. He's number 1 poster there he  is trying to masquerade as an xmr fan so he doesn't get down voted. 
6	1523981759	20	Who cares...
7	1523981851	-17	Oh so from "heaven forbid people diversify" to "who cares"?
8	1523982005	14	Reddit is a website used by multiple people. You can use the username above the comments to distinguish between different posters.Monero fan, btw.
8	1523987716	3	you're responding to two different people
6	1523981860	2	Added Monero flair. I think crypto is stupid.
2	1523985849	2	Are we playing crypto identity politics?

2	1523979780	-43	STFU VERGE WILL OVERTAKE BITCOIN IN 2018
3	1523982180	4	No, no it won't.
3	1523985062	3	By the time Verge overtakes Bitcoin, the investors still wonâ€™t be old enough to get a drivers license for that Lambo
3	1523980559	9	verge is the real bcash!!1!
0	1523981291	14	I love this kind of tweets war. It's actually funny to see big personalities talking with each other on Twitter.
0	1523982969	54	He sold it to stop being accused he's doing it only for the money, but he's absolutely still working on it and promoting it, what's so hard to understand about it?
1	1523983198	22	This is what actually happened. But in this community people are never happy.
2	1523988450	3	> But ~~in this community~~ people are never happy.
2	1523988970	1	Many in the general public hate the rich but yet want nothing more but to join their ranks.  The crypto community is no exception, quite the contrary.
1	1523985142	2	>He sold it to stop being accused he's doing it only for the moneyHe sold it at its peak and cashed out, causing people who had followed him into and believed his hype to see their investment tank. To publiclly sell all of his stock and exit the market sorta send a signal to everyone else, sorta like if Bill Gates or Elon Musk sold all their stock and explain it in a tweet that they just wanted to clear their head.  Again it sends a strong signal to people when you liquidate your stock.
2	1523985804	7	> He sold it at its peak and cashed out,I don't know how people can repeat this untrue statement over and over and over again. He sold at 3 difference prices. Do some research before spreading lies.    > To publiclly sell all of his stock and exit the market sorta send a signal to everyone else, sorta like if Bill Gates or Elon Musk sold all their stock    Not even close to being a good comparison. CEOs/Board Members of major companies hold a large portion of the company's stock. It's common. For crypto, we DON'T want single individuals holding a large portion of the currency because it would become CENTRALIZED. The purpose of crypto is to be DECENTRALIZED. Charlie held too much power with the stack he had. He is also a very public figure in the crytpo community who always speaks his mind via Twitter. He would not be able to Tweet whatever he wanted to if he still held a large stack of LTC. Why? Because he would be called out for being a market manipulator.  One tweet could send LTC's price to the earth's core or to the moon. Is that something cyrpto wants? For one person to hold that much power over one coin? Think about it man.
3	1523988823	2	I disagree, with your altruistic interpretation of why he sold. 
4	1523988992	1	That's fine but if he really did dump LTC and didn't give a shit about it anymore why is he still tweeting about LTC and working on the LTC foundation? It's not my interpretation anyways. It was Charlies explanation. You can chose to believe it or not. However, I'd like some of your reasoning as to why you don't agree. 
3	1523989224	1	The entire problem is when people can't recognize the difference between a stock and a coin.
2	1523988323	1	It's not stock and they weren't options he was given for his work.  He owned his LTC as a miner who was in the community early, not by way of a gift.  His ethical responsibility to hold his coins was no different from that of anyone else who mined theirs.
1	1523984754	1	Hasn't it been a few months since he's commit to the litecoin github? It has the graph on the contributors page. I assumed he just did twitter now
1	1523988181	1	Nothing, but this is still quite funny tho.
1	1523983541	1	I know hindsight and all, but he probably should have kept a small amount. Maybe 10% of his original stack.
2	1523988992	1	Then it would make any sense selling lol.
1	1523985932	1	Still he could have said he kept a small amount and not mention he sold everything. I would like the creator of the coin to be somewhat invested. Just think about it, if litecoin goes to 0, he will not lose.
2	1523989072	1	>Just think about it, if litecoin goes to 0, he will not lose.Just think about it, he can be 'invested' in the coin serving its actual purpose rather then just driving up in value to get him rich.  People speculating and getting rich is NOT the purpose to any of this.  It will be damaging long term if it doesn't stop.
0	1523982252	42	To everyone saying Charlie Lee got owned. He sold at ATH. If you think that's getting owned, you're doing it wrong.
1	1523983186	11	I agree itâ€™s smart he did that, but overall I think it was bad to announce that. He is the creator of litecoin and he needs some stakes in it. He did not hodl or use it as payment, he traded it for cash which we are against.Edit I own litecoin
2	1523989302	1	Bad to announce he was selling his stake? So, then the hawks watching all his wallets could call him out for selling at ATH and not telling anyone? It wouldn't have gone over any better that way either.
2	1523983458	0	You need to look up what he actually did with the profits.Hint - he didn't keep them for himself.
3	1523983587	1	Still he traded for cash. I know he donated some and thatâ€™s good but he still got paid too.
4	1523984551	2	If It is the case I think it's OK getting paid for his great project. 
1	1523982546	-2	He didn't and that's just wrong info :)
2	1523984886	3	he did, but not all of it, some of it at ATH, some at lower prices.
2	1523983499	0	What part?

0	1523979471	14	He is making fun of Verge 
1	1523983025	-18	Sounds rather salty. Doesn't look good on him at all.  
2	1523989113	1	Verge is a shitcoin look at the red flags, WASSUP WASSUP WASSUP
0	1523984709	4	Weird, almost like he cares about the coin even though he sold his. Crazy how he gets "trolled" for legitimately caring about Litecoin.
0	1523984489	2	THE BEST.
0	1523986651	3	Hahaha I think Charlie is getting to the Roger Ver point of being an insufferable cunt who is at this point more of a hindrance to Litecoin than a help. If not for him and the Litepay fiasco I would still be in on this coin. Never touching LTC again because I think Charlie is a liability. Downvote away LTC fanboys but you know I'm right.

0	1523988514	1	Great team. Promissing future partnerships
0	1523988633	1	I don't think you know what trolled means.
0	1523988815	1	That wasn't the best troll response I could come up with. How about> We'd love to accept Litecoin but we're still waiting on approval of our LitePay merchant account.
0	1523989049	1	It's hardly a fucking burn, associating your business with XVG makes you a fucking retard.  How can you ignore the shit that's gone on in the last couple weeks?
0	1523980465	-4	Charlie lee gets owned again 
0	1523981900	-4	Litecoin holders are the most delusional ever. Your founder dumped his bags on you guys at the ATH lmao. 
1	1523985217	3	and you must be holding BCH (true Bitcoin lel) and Verge? :D
2	1523985793	-1	LOL
1	1523989059	1	They are brainwashed by a founder that shilled his own coin .  LTC has no use case. 
1	1523983395	2	If he was smart enough to see that it was the ATH, why *wouldn't* he dump? He loses literally nothing by selling. He also donated a lot of that money to the Litecoin foundation.
2	1523984624	4	>He loses literally nothing by selling. Except credibility 
0	1523980770	-4	Charlie needs to stop putting his foot in his mouth.
0	1523980965	-10	Get rekt Charlie lee lmfao fcuking troll 
0	1523981478	-3	hahahaa, gold!
0	1523983958	-4	wow... top 5 crypto wants what Verge has.imagine that.
0	1523982438	-11	haha put that in your pipe and smoke it Charlie!LTC ever did one thing right- being on coinbase last christmas.Other than that it doesnt do shit
1	1523982612	8	Uhm, official partner of a major merchant processor, Lightning Network, smart contracts, primary asset class for Abra, listed on every major exchange and most with LTC/USD pairing. Youâ€™re totally right, nothing major. Theyâ€™ve also been on Coinbase way longer than last Christmas, so it shows your level of crypto knowledge. 
1	1523987914	1	Username checks out 
1	1523989097	1	Very true
0	1523986664	0	Lololol Owned... :D
0	1523986778	0	Hahaha, Charlie Lee wins the "Most Salty Award" of the day.
0	1523989004	0	Anyone else think verge is fucked now? Massive target on their back, and the codebase is piss poor 
0	1523983315	-6	Verge did a great job! We should all as crypto supporter be proud of that. Regardless of what your favorite coin might be.
0	1523985982	-2	This make me want to sell my LTC bag...lol
