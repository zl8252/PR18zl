0	1523971733	352	Now you can fuck yourself in 2 different ways. 
1	1523977989	40	A DogecoinDark fork being shilled by Stormy Daniels for porn is the talk of the town. Is this the glorious crypto future that Satoshi envisioned?*[BTW looks like Mindgeek/Pornhub is dumping their pump hard](https://i.imgur.com/9IHRkcD.png).  
2	1523980633	4	Seems rather anticlimactic. 
3	1523986457	1	Mind Geek, who owns PornHub, Brazzers, YouPorn and Reality Kings, is one of the top 3 bandwidth-consuming companies in the world, the other two being Google and Netflix.
4	1523988099	0	So?
5	1523988341	1	You're not thinking rationally.
2	1523987755	1	Haters just gonna hate 
2	1523989302	1	Would you look at that. It's so low that it's at the higher price than yesterday at this hour.
1	1523982707	3	HAHAHA! Take my karma.
1	1523972556	3	Lmao
1	1523971938	1	Good one!
1	1523980753	1	Hahaha why is this not top comment :))
1	1523985913	1	Give this man a medal!
0	1523969056	164	[Verge’s name finally makes sense!](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=verge+in+french&oq=verge+in+french&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.4413j1j7&client=ms-android-samsung-ss&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8)
1	1523977810	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR4ikJ8D1BYImagine someone went into a comma 15 years ago and woke up. Try explaining this to them:Pornstar Stormy Daniels, who slept with the US President Donald Trump is doing commercials on Youtube for a cryptocurrency that is a fork of DogecoinDark, to be accepted on Pornhub which is a site where people upload pirated porn videos where you can also pay to get HD clips.
2	1523981837	38	I was in a comma once, but then I woke up as a period.
3	1523988428	1	RIP
2	1523979760	4	It's not a fork, it just renamed after vast majority of coins were mined as silly named scrypt clone.
3	1523987473	1	You can scream this at the top of your lungs if you want. It doesn't matter if you are right. They won't listen...
2	1523986746	1	Isn’t it just a rebrand of DogecoinDark? It’s a fork of PeerCoin iirc
3	1523987872	1	Not a verge holder, but the dogecoin fork misconception bugs me. There are other reasons to question verges future, most of which aren't as easily refuted as saying "DOGECOIN FORK".
4	1523988257	1	My main problem with Verge is their massive misinformation campaign. People can be hurt badly by the promise of privacy where there is none.I don’t understand why they don’t hire some competent devs with all the money they are making.
1	1523973886	6	Verge cum early
1	1523976110	1	I’m French and that’s pretty funny ahaha
0	1523969676	123	Can't say I was expecting this.
1	1523983834	4	Its beauty of crypto world, never cease to amaze us.. even in aspects we definitely didnt expect at all..
1	1523987871	1	Watch the advert and its clear this is just pornhub doing some sort of sophisticated pump and dump here. The commercial is just Verge hype, thats not the normal way a new payment method is introduced. Its not even an appropriate way.   If pornhub have substantial holdings of Verge they should share this fact, otherwise this is shady stuff
1	1523981187	0	Me neither, there was a patition for it on the pornhub forums that got like 5k votes and they were probably paid pretty well aswell so not really that shocking tho
0	1523969112	104	what
1	1523973115	18	When they tip the war vet a Verge coin he gives them the finger. I think this is PH actually poking fun at them
2	1523975530	8	Oh man, if this "partnership" wasn't really real and PH is just trolling, that'll be hilarious! 
3	1523985879	1	The ending mirror crack is from Black Mirror, that's all I have to say.
0	1523969067	171	lol :DGives new meaning to the term "Vergins"
1	1523978433	17	I think after that huge red dildo we can't call them vergins anymore.
1	1523972869	13	glad im not alone :D --> https://imgur.com/a/tWOHS
0	1523976072	176	i'd rather get caught watching pornhub than be caught using verge
1	1523979186	39	If you use verge you can very easily get caught paying pornhub. 
2	1523986116	0	Ok you have set the table. I just used XVG to buy pornhub premium. Tell me who I am.
1	1523984392	3	I’d rather get caught buying porn than caught buying verge. 
1	1523988292	1	There is no shame in watching pornhub so your comparison lacks.
1	1523982646	1	Comment of the day.
0	1523973267	49	They raised all this money for adverts.
0	1523969520	99	Well, I guess Bunnytokens are going to be used by dentists.... 
1	1523974053	19	Hi! My name is Alex and I'm a crypro investor. 
2	1523976848	1	...But I didnt order any pizza..
1	1523971217	14	Lmao I always get their stupid ads on YouTube, wasn't clear to me which 103 billion dollar industry they were talking about but now I know
2	1523971840	5	God yeah that annoyed me, I'm guessing it was a way around YouTube's ad rules by not mentioning it? SpankCoin probably isn't doing too well either...
3	1523972042	3	Oh yeah Google said they would ban crypto ads. What happened to that statement? 
4	1523973736	4	Hasn't started yet 
4	1523973789	1	I think they banned ICO ads
2	1523978927	1	Poor bunny token. They didn't need 1 mil of the community's money to say they will do porn.
1	1523978073	2	yeah I guess fk ViceToken too now...
0	1523975366	37	who actually pays money for porn?
1	1523981022	8	Verge is money?
2	1523988308	1	No? 
2	1523985565	1	It is now.
1	1523980715	7	People not resourceful or technically savvy enough to figure out how to get it for free. 
2	1523981523	28	But if you aren't resourceful or technically savvy enough to find free porn, you sure as hell aren't going to be able to buy XVG. 
2	1523982201	1	don't forget people who are lazy but want that HD booty
3	1523982494	1	There’s always a way to get it free 
2	1523986797	1	And people who want some stuff that's not available for free or only in "I can count the pixels" quality.
1	1523978368	1	sad lonely people with porn addictions in their late 20s/early 30s. future, amirite?
2	1523978496	4	nothing wrong with porn. with all the free content just wondering who actually pays for it.
3	1523989271	1	people who want proper VR porn
2	1523982533	1	Porn is great. It’s everywhere. But it’s not worth paying money for
1	1523981753	1	you do. your advertisement views are the currency
1	1523982172	1	[a shit ton of people](https://i.redd.it/cupxmjatihs01.jpg)
1	1523981428	1	Vergins apparently?
0	1523971291	71	Whats funny is even his Grandson is sarcastic about receiving a whole Verge coin. 
1	1523972990	21	This suggests that Verge is inflationary. I found that odd. As I understand it, the total supply is 16.5 billion. If that never changes and adoptions reaches the point in this video, the perceived and real value of the coin should increase so 1 coin *should* be a big deal.
2	1523974414	16	Or it could be that his grandfather has a ton of coins and he is like "Yeah thanks for giving me one while you have millions". But yeah, it is kinda strange ;)
3	1523975815	7	It's probably that The people that made the video don't understand crypto and just thought of it like fiat currency and were trying to make it funny like "back in my day a nickel could buy you two ice cream sundaes and tickets to the movies ALL DAY LONG!!!"
3	1523975122	3	Spoiled brat!
3	1523985757	1	not really, he said "back in my day you could buy an electric car with a single verge..."
4	1523988076	1	There was also a martian war vet. The ad takes place 60 years from now. So within 60 years we're not only sending people to Mars, we're also sending weapons. I'm more concerned about this than why you won't be able to buy a whole car with a verge.
0	1523971903	28	wow pornhub really knows how to target those vergins 
0	1523974234	17	"In addition to Pornhub, pornographic production company, Brazzers, and the world's largest adult gaming portal, Nataku, will also be accepting Verge. The three companies combined increase potential adoption rates in the adult industry and beyond."https://www.pornhub.com/press/show?id=1492
1	1523982754	1	What the fuck is an adult gaming portal? 
2	1523984168	1	Go find out
2	1523986388	1	I looked it up, basically a collection of manga / erotic games in flash. So targeting fat neckbeard vergins?
3	1523987874	1	so, Malware Central?
1	1523988000	1	> The three companies combined increase potential adoption rates in the adult industry and beyond."   Why the hell is a merchant concerned with increasing future adoption rates of an altcoin? This stinks of shilling, pornhub have obviously bought a shit-ton of this to manip the market and make some easy cash
0	1523975351	10	LOL wow, I guess I'm at least glad this wasn't a total scam.But how is this a partnership when all they're really doing is just accepting the currency?Top 3 incoming. /s
0	1523973827	60	So... Stellar have IBM partnership, iota with Bosch and this is what make people freak out?Go figure.... 
1	1523979098	20	It will change crypto forever. Seriously. Don't you ever sit there and say "you know what? I want to pay for some porn!"
2	1523981349	5	Like I can honestly say I've never thought to pay for porn. Ever. But I bet r/vergecurrency is freaking out right now \- "HE DIDN'T EXIT SCAM!"
3	1523981632	2	LOL
2	1523982636	2	Yes, I want to pay for porn! Not only that, I want to go to coinbase and make an account, wait for my identity verification, buy Eth with fiat, make a binance account, set up 2FA, trade my Eth there, buy XVG with itx trade it to pornhub to buy a subscription! I really look forward to do this. Thanks Verge team
1	1523979293	5	Real world adoption!!    /s
1	1523988368	1	Pornhub is possibly larger than IBM nowadays. Just saying.
2	1523988436	1	Humm... I don't have sources to confirm this, but it raised my curiosity. 
0	1523972138	40	We'll see how long that lasts until their single junior "developer" splits the chain accidentally again
1	1523984447	1	I expect a lot with RingCT implementation. As far as I can see he has less than 3 months left for the port no other crypto did before into its main net. There is another crypto doing it currently, they are working on it since at least one year. Let Suneroks magic begin :D
2	1523986785	1	He'll wait until they finish their implementation and then copy it.
3	1523987763	1	On their implementation with default ring size 4 it bloats up transactionsize by 15x. I wonder what this will do with the network. Or he implements it optional again, then the research paper about Monero from begin of 2017 applies to it, while being even worse, since stealth addresses are optional too.We will see. Still think this publicity won't be good for Verge in the end.
0	1523972080	17	Iam lost lol.Is this real or not? 
1	1523972493	18	yes, time to jerk off your pee pee
2	1523979044	2	Xhamster all the way baby
0	1523971282	217	Ok, I'll admit it... I was looking forward to see Verge crash like a shitcoin deserves, but even though it's still a shitcoin, this is huge news. Pornhub is one of the biggest websites in the world, having them promote it is huge. I did not expect this... Still not buying though.
1	1523972174	156	not really when you realize that verge BOUGHT advertisement from pornhub(the money raised).Also it keeps the narative that cryptos are for drugs, guns, murders,  porn and sex slavery.add to that that verge is an average non-annonymous currency.. this isnt good at all.edit: for all the basement dwellers,  read up i said the NARRATIVE.also porn is one the biggest affliction on modern western society.. completely ruining most addict's mental health from a very early age. Read up on it.
2	1523973006	24	Like others have said, porn is modest in comparison to the other things on your list.
2	1523972958	52	I'm with you on that first point, it's just an advertisement more than anything.  But beyond that, there's absolutely nothing wrong with porn when it comes to tech. It's porn that has been driving internet bandwith, payment for digital content, online streaming and web services. Porn is pushing the internet due to it's highly elastic value.  
3	1523973675	19	porn has typically been the first in trying to use every new technology. The fact that they are even considering trying to see if this works, is pretty big for crypto as a whole. Not only does this start to build competition within Verge, but also every other coin now is going to have pressure to be better. Who knows how long the contract will be with PornHub. At the end of the day, someone is trying to accept cryptocurrency as payment. thats a good thing. 
4	1523974277	16	Big fat 'eh' to that. I've been buying my modafinil (which is prescription only where I live) with any coin of my chosing for years now.  The fact that they're not just accepting a generic crypto api shows that they're not doing this for any revenue that they might be missing out on. They're getting paid for this exclusive sponsorship gimmick and that's it. 
5	1523982218	6	Seriously, did everyone just fucking forget they crowdfunded 75m verge to pay for this? 
6	1523982547	1	It's a nice case example of how much 5 million dollar gets you in advertising. A banner on Pornhub. I'll be eager to check for how many days that banner lasts, as that's useful info. If I don't get too distra..cted by the lesbian bondage amateurs.  
5	1523976743	1	i just bought supps from enhanced athlete.. 20% extra discount for using BTC.. really nice API.. auto confirmed the transaction.they didnt get paid millions of $ by btc's team, they just use it.
4	1523978242	1	MetArt started directly accepting Bitcoin, Litecoin and Doge in 2013. This is hardly new.
4	1523976494	1	Who was first? First is always army, then the public.. I didnt see gps in porn.. Even vr is first used for gaming and then porn.. What do you even need for porn? A camera and a website to host it 😂😂
3	1523981657	1	Sure. 100%. But how does an additional payment option aid or even relate to that adoption? We have had crypto integration prior to this partnership.
4	1523982011	2	Nothing. An exclusive payment for a service that doesn't use any blockchain whatsoever is just a marketing stunt.  That's what it is, nothing more, BUT also nothing less, got to hand it to XVG that they've been playing the crypto community like a fiddle in the last few months.  
2	1523973411	36	Did you just compare a completely legal activity with murder and sex slavery?
3	1523976269	23	You know, like arson, terrorism, and playing the banjo.  All equally terrible things.
4	1523978704	1	depends whos on the banjo, that deliverance kid will have you squealing   
3	1523982182	5	Porn industry and human trafficking are more entwined than average person realizes
2	1523972927	31	How did your even include porn with murder
3	1523973087	10	Don't kink shame!
3	1523973752	1	The need to hate bro, definition of reaching
2	1523975392	38	Lol suddenly /r/cryptocurrency is worried about addicts mental healthThis thread is a gold mine of salty and pathetic comments like yours because verge is actually pushing adoption with a company that is a household name and it wasn't an exit scam that you guys wished for which is really terrible thing to wish for in this communityThat's right guys, this sub would rather prefer it was an exit scam and act like they care about porn addictionExit scams are worse for crypto than a porn partnership. This sub has officially convinced me of their horrible delusion
3	1523981897	4	By paying for porn? By. Paying. For. Porn. You’re advocating breaking rules 1-5 of the internet. That’s heresy, not adoption. 
3	1523978644	5	They crowdsourced money to pay pornhub for ad time/space.  The fuck is wrong with you idiots...
3	1523976583	2	literally any crypto can pay millions to be accepted by a site.. only verge is stupid enough.
4	1523979575	2	"In 2013, the adult industry news website XBIZ described MindGeek as "the largest adult entertainment operator globally", and a spokesperson from Manwin, who spoke to the Irish Independent newspaper in 2013, stated that they are "one of the top five bandwidth consumption companies in the world"."It's getting more attention than ANY coin other than bitcoin
3	1523982925	1	No serious company will touch verg after this
4	1523987399	1	That would be my concern if I held xvg. This is a great partnership if you set aside the fact that they may have just bought it. That money could have potentially been used to make verge more attractive, be it through better code, better marketing, better customer relations, etc, so that partnerships wouldn't need to be bought. By buying a partnership with porn, verge will be pigeonholed as the porn coin. I don't forsee any other industry lining up to partner with the porn coin, and crowd funding another paid partner will probably only work a few more times given the verge community. That said, verge stands to benefit from being the sleazy porn coin more than being the sleazy private-not-private coin that appears on the cusp of a bitconnect fiasco. So it's better, it'd have been amazing for verge if they didn't have to buy it, and didn't hype the living fuck out of it. I'm happy for them though, this is better than I expected, I am still skeptical about the future of verge. I hope it works out for the hodlers, I'm not comfortable risking it right now though. Maybe I'll regret it, who knows?Also, verge is a private-see coin. Nailed it.
3	1523988077	1	found the verge pleb
2	1523980165	2	Crypto investing mints new gambling addicts every day. Don't act so self righteous supporting one addiction and looking down upon another. Most things can be used irresponsibly. 
2	1523975250	4	I love porn, should I be worried about my mental health?
2	1523977131	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJ_QfP2mhU
2	1523978273	1	All these flavors and you chose salty. 
2	1523985349	1	Geez porn is not that bad lol
2	1523986383	1	bought advertisement and an exclusive partnership. Mindgeek sites will not be accepting any other crypto currency.
2	1523974404	2	> also porn is one the biggest affliction on modern western society...😂😂😂I don’t even own Verge and this is ridiculous. I’m sure you’d be saying the exact same thing if one of your coins started getting accepted by one of the biggest websites on the internet.
2	1523976016	0	Agree completely. Porn is silently destroying lives, marriages and families. I just hope this shitcoin to burn and die once for all.
3	1523977292	2	Just like that, we’re crusaders in the war against pornography.Guys, come on. It’s a win for Verge. Not the biggest deal in the world and honesty not nearly as big as they hyped it up but still a win. 
4	1523982179	1	Nothing that involves porn is a win
2	1523975890	-2	How's you're monero doing you jealous piece of shit?
1	1523972289	12	Smart decision - As far as we know they might have paid them to accept verge - In anyway i do not understand why accept Verge instead of any other crypto ? (Not talking bitcoin - there is clear answer but ETH NEO NEM are used by many more and it would make more sense:) 
2	1523972416	41	Because, like you said, Verge paid.
3	1523973410	5	bingo
2	1523972881	16	It definitively smells weird, and I refuse to believe Pornhub were looking at the cryptomarket and found out that Verge was the best to go with. But regardless of how it was done, this is incredible for marketing of Verge. It could be that they introduce 10x other cryptocurrencies the next weeks though, which reduces the importance of this.
3	1523974346	17	I could imagine that Verge just paid Mindgeek (Owners of Pornhub etc.) to accept XVG as a payment option. In that case this isn't a partnership but just a marketing campaign  for verge that was funded with donations. 
3	1523973616	7	Annnnd the price is now under .10 cents. 🤦🏻‍♂️. No moon? No lambos?
4	1523976529	7	Buy the rumor sell the newsThe price went up over 400% since the announcement of a partnership
2	1523972454	11	Neo makes no sense, it's not divisible 
3	1523973439	1	It's weird, though, because one can buy partial NEO on exchanges
4	1523973891	7	not weird.When buying or trading on an exchange you are not making a transaction on the actual blockchain but on the exchanges internal system where actual coins are not traded and only data in databases is exchanged.  This is why you can trade fractions when only whole numbers can be broadcast to the blockchain.  
4	1523973686	2	Because it all stays in the same wallet
2	1523977165	1	Seems to me there is value in the Verge community rather than the coin. What Pornhub is really accepting here is the vast horde of Vergins - which given the nature of the business, makes perfect sense.
1	1523974485	8	>this is huge news.It's really not. Who the hell pays for porn anyways?
2	1523975788	25	OBVIOUSLY A LARGE USERBASE IS PAYING FOR IT TO BE A 97 BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY
3	1523976063	11	99% of that is through ads
3	1523975984	9	Yeah but pornhub and sites like that make most of their money from ad revenue and not from online payments.   Still, if people will actually use XVG instead of BTC(which I doubt) to tip strippers on mindgeeks cam sites I guess this is a good thing for XVG.
4	1523986564	2	I know you have seen that ads on porn sites. Do you really think that those companies are paying top dollar for those spots? Most of the ads on PH are for Mindgeek sites anyway, they are not paying for ads on their own platform.
3	1523976105	2	thats called advertisement and no user is paying jacked shit for that xD
4	1523986634	1	PH employee in this thread says signups have been increasing since they launched premium, and that there is currently around 2-3 million premium accounts, paying 9.99 per month.
2	1523976451	4	Way more people than you'd expect
3	1523977090	1	Especially with VR content appearing, it's even worth to pay for the membership just to get proper high quality VR stuff. You can't find it almost anywhere for free.
2	1523978472	1	>Who the hell pays for porn anyways?There was actually an AskReddit thread about paid porn subscriptions posted recently. You can find it [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8b6bkr/redditors_who_pay_for_porn_what_are_the_rest_of/). 
2	1523981812	1	Your perception = nbdy pays for pornMarket perception = 100b USD marketWhos right? mmm....  hard call
2	1523981849	1	i would, if they'd actually give me what i want
1	1523973000	15	Its actually bigger than this. The real partner is mindgeek, the parent company of pornhub**. They own 80%+ of the entire adult industry, almost every porn website you can imagine is under their umbrella. You'll be able to tip the cam girls in verge. They run more bandwidth then fb and amazon do. They own their own merchant processor and are essentially an analytics company at heart. This will spread throughout their entire network. And lastly absolutely no one wants porn on their CC statement, this is huge real world adoption.
2	1523973353	27	So how is MindGeek Verge's partner? Last time I checked, a partnership was a two way street.Verge paid MindGeek to integrate Verge as a payment option. But what is MindGeek actually doing for Verge? Are they going to be shilling verge? Are they going to contribute to Verge's development? (God knows sunerok needs all the help he can get)I don't see any of that happening. This is still an exit scam. Do you actually think anyone is going to pay for porn using Verge lol?
3	1523975674	19	If Verge paid Mindgeek to integrate this as a payment option, this is just a marketing campaign that Verge spent money on with the funds. Not a partnership.. It's more like Verge sponsoring Pornhub lol.
4	1523977948	1	This way around yea :-)
3	1523980441	1	Does "Site X now accepting Y coin" even qualify as a partnership? I don't need to partner with the FED if I want to accept dead presidents

2	1523976006	1	honestly its not.Lets say you are avg joe who is paying for porn already.(to each their own)A person has to do the followingSign up for Coinbase > Attach card > buy a coin(take a fee) > sign up for binance > transfer to binance(has to know about binance/other exchanges) > make a trade of bought coin into XVG(take a fee)  > send xvg as paymentThis type of partnership will take years to see real pay offs(which by then something else can happen, its crypto, until then its honestly a sub mediocre announcement. hence the 30-40% drop from 5 hours agoThe only reason it feels big is because XVG fan bois are happy it wasnt an exit scam and theyre rubbing it in the Internets face 
3	1523976609	5	Literally every cryptocurrency has this problem right now. If this partnership was with anyone besides verge y'all would be happy about such a huge name getting involved
3	1523977446	1	Coinbase isn't the only place to buy bitcoin though.You can do it on Localbitcoins for example, without attaching cards and going through lenghty verification processes.Or you can get on an exchange that supports fiat deposits and withdrawls, like Kraken or Bitstamp. You will need to get verified on those though.
1	1523975443	1	It just got dumped. 50% gone.
1	1523976073	1	It did crash, by from $0.12 to $0.07
1	1523985632	1	A shitcoin is a coin without a use case.Verge has a use case.
1	1523987716	1	touche.  now buy
1	1523975311	1	This is fraud by /u/Sunerok.Raising funds for "the biggest partnership ever in crypto" and all it was is 1 website accepting his shitcoin as a payment option.Thats not anywhere close to what was advertised and is almost the exact definition of theft by deception.I'll be interested to see the legal ramifications.
0	1523979849	8	Does this mean this is the climax for verge?
1	1523980953	11	It means that verge holders can now literally use their verge to go fuck themselves.
0	1523982204	6	Verge hitting there core supporters here, a bunch of 15 year old wankers 😂
0	1523972765	13	This video is hilarious. Forget any implications for verge or coin price. This is great fun.
1	1523977712	4	Yeah, I was laughing my ass off rofl
0	1523985347	5	so the past 3 weeks it was an exit scam, and now its not a big deal. Aight. Lots of salt.

0	1523971661	54	This is NOT the biggest thing to happen to crypto. 
1	1523985286	1	That’s what she said 
0	1523976412	25	So verge needed the funds to pay pornhub to use it as a payment option? Sounds desperate to me. This is by no way a partnership. 
1	1523977295	18	lol yup... my thoughts exact! Verge is now a partner along with the likes of the dollar, and visa and mastercard. Except those "partners" didn't have to pay millions to be listed.
2	1523979348	7	Well said lol
2	1523978327	5	The dollar on the come up partnering with pornhub n shiet.
2	1523978186	2	Yet it's more discreet than paying by card. A feature a lot of people will welcome.This won't be an overnight success, but with the correct marketing this could prove lucrative for both parties.
2	1523986257	1	Not only are they not paying millions, they are earning a ton of money from pornhub or whatever site uses their services. Also many banks offer online temp card numbers for private transactions you don't want to be displayed on your main account statements.
1	1523988164	1	the commercial is all abou how Verge will become more popular, says nothing abotu the benefits of paying for porn in crypto. It stinks
0	1523972051	6	Is this the coin for tipping strippers? 
0	1523973734	5	Who pays for porn anyway?
0	1523974369	5	People pay for porn?
1	1523975494	4	Vergins do, apparently. 
0	1523975229	4	I still don’t know if this is real or not. Disappointing either way. 
0	1523975606	5	This is not a partnership... it's a "buy a ship." I mean it's a great start but the part where they had to pay millions to get pornhub to "accept" verge coins is dumb. Everyone who now accepts bitcoin as a payment, is automatically a bitcoin partner?
0	1523976965	5	YOU'RE TELLING ME IT WASN'T EBAY OR PAYPAL WHAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTT
0	1523978653	6	"Verge" name is finally making sense to me.
0	1523979802	5	I guess the type of people that are paying for porn would be the type to use XVG.
0	1523980599	5	I... I don't know what to think right now.
0	1523970632	43	Sorry but have they not heard of Monero? What does XVG have over Monero?
1	1523971370	98	A dev willing to take money from the community to pay  PornHub to pretend this isn't shilling.
2	1523977462	2	You sir win the internet today
1	1523971387	110	Verge has the benefit of not actually being private
2	1523973403	11	So the exact same tech as hundreds of other shitcoins + the illusion of privacy? Got it!
2	1523981639	2	has anyone proven this yet? Would love a link.I keep seeing 'in theory' it's not actually private, but haven't seen evidence/proof of these claims by transaction logs/tracing etc..Has anyone actually executed a physical trace from sender to receiver via XVG?I just keep seeing 'it's a shitcoin, it's not private etc'.Can anyone please help out with a link/evidence?
3	1523983551	4	The reason Verge is claimed to not actually be private is that it is not private by default.  You have to opt in on a transaction-by-transaction basis to use the privacy features.  This means the majority of transactions can be traced and there are still "rich lists".  This makes things like ring signatures much less effective.  Even if you use the private chain for a transaction, the potential to trace all your funds up till then still remains if you weren't careful about all your incoming/outgoing transactions.  There is also the risk that someone else can compromise your privacy by not using the private chain when performing transactions with you.The claim is that with this set-up it allows for transparency when needed, and privacy when needed.  A coin like Monero has "opt-out" privacy, where the only way you compromise your privacy is if you choose to do so yourself, by revealing information such as view keys for your wallet (so an auditor can see you receiving funds), payment IDs (for the receiver and receiver alone, to identify specific incoming transactions), and tx_ids (to provide proof of transaction).

1	1523971429	3	Less salt in the community.

2	1523989019	1	All I hear is how shitty XVG's supposed privacy is. I don't think PH were looking for a specific crypto as a problem solver. They accept whoever offers the biggest bag of money.
0	1523970516	30	u/Katie_Pornhub can you please start to accept other currencies also.  
1	1523970647	25	Yeah this is obviously a cash grab by PornHub. Otherwise this is just as useful as adding any other alt. Let me pay with BTC or I'm still not gonna pay for porn. 
2	1523973257	9	Paying for porn with with a public non privacy coin is obviously never going to take off.I know nothing of Verge so this isn't an endorsement of their product. I know they claim privacy but their website is talking mostly about network privacy.
3	1523974431	14	Verge is as much of a privacy coin as Bitcoin. The only difference is that Bitcoin doesn't claim to be a privacy coin. Verge privacy claims are laughable.
3	1523973594	5	Because no one buys it now. One credit cards...
3	1523974328	5	Verge doesn't offer any privacy atm I think
4	1523974407	7	It offers extremely weak privacy that was copied and pasted from another coin’s code.
5	1523975105	0	There is no privacy. It leaks
6	1523975209	0	Wraith is valid DKSA, but it’s kinda useless because of timing/amount analysis.
2	1523973443	9	  I'm guessing that 10% drop ($0.10 to $0.09) was pornhub selling off the money raised to get them to accept verge. If the price shits the bed they already made a nice profit. If verge takes off they can just hodl what gets spent on the site going forward. I must admit I was disappointed in pornhub at first, but if this is what happened I can't blame them. It's a win win. Their only risk is pissing off users who think verge is a pure shitcoin. Even then, is anyone really going to be so angry they find a different site to jerk off to? 
1	1523974637	10	Yeah this doesn't make sense. It can't be about privacy because there is no privacy with verge, and I have to imagine pornhubs security team is competent enough to know that.
0	1523973692	35	What a total scam, this cost $6.5 fucking million rofl.Demand a refund vergins.

0	1523979305	8	**I AM VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED THE PARTNERSHIP IS NOT WITH CARLO MATOS. I BELIEVE THE CRYPTO WORLD AGREES WITH ME, THUS THE SELL OFF.**
0	1523978296	16	This is the statement on the youtube video by PornHub:"That’s because, as of today, Pornhub will start accepting Verge Currency, the most secure and anonymous cryptocurrency on the market."I feel like it is our duty as responsible crypto enthusiasts to explain to the PornHub team that they have literally partnered up with the laughing stock of crypto technology. 1. Verge is not a true privacy coin. TOR native integration does not equal true privacy. This is an important note, since there are real privacy coins out there like Monero who do offer true anonymity. 2. Verge developer(s?) are laughably inept and bad at coding. There is nothing original about this Doge Coin fork. Their "privacy" is obtained through using TOR (which is not their tech). Even their much advertised RingCT solution is a rip off of Monero's Ring Signature technology and is yet to be created or implemented.  I mean sunerock forked his own coin by accident for god's sake - that's how bad this team is. 3. The coin experienced a MASSIVE hack which was continuously suppressed, downplayed and ignored by the verge "team". Bans, deletions of posts, counter-attacks by the team. This whole story was quickly swept under the rug and the way Verge handled it is akin to Trump crying "fake news" loudly and then diverting attention away. All in all - I am happy that crypto as a whole is getting this kind of exposure. I am however very worried about it being done with such bad examples of crypto technology, when there are true and revolutionary technologies out there on the brink of changing our world. So finally I ask, who can we contact at PH or MindGeek in order to let them know what they are getting themselves into? I am honestly pretty disappointed that such a big company would partner with Verge without doing their due diligence in assessing the overall product. 
0	1523976166	4	Well, this explains these massive green dildos in the past few days.
1	1523983316	1	looooooooool
0	1523979819	5	Useless when everyone realizes people hold crypto in an effort to get rich, not to spend them on websites. The pizza buying horror stories have people holding on for dear life.

0	1523974979	13	Do people actually pay for porn ? 
1	1523978841	5	You wouldnt think so but it's big money
2	1523979608	2	It’s not big money.  The big money comes from advertisers.  That’s where the big money is.  The market of people who pay for porn is microscopic compared to the advertising revenues these sites depend on.  
3	1523982812	3	Our biggest advertiser is Brazzers.  Also our revenue from Premium slow taking over as people look for better content and ads-free experiences.
1	1523980593	2	Some do but most of the money comes from advertising. There was a askreddit about this a week or so ago and there seemed to be a few, not sure how many of the people who pay actually pay on pornhub though, seemed to be very specific shit and not sure if pornhub has that
1	1523979832	1	$3K per second is spent on porn.
2	1523982445	1	Advertising*
3	1523982549	1	Nope. Spent by fappers.
4	1523982756	2	So the money is already being spent without verge.. Do you really think now all of a sudden millions of people are gona say OMG we can use verge? Lets all buy porn.. No dude.
5	1523987040	1	It's worse than buying drugs with coins. Drug users who were paying regularly were still buying from their dealers with cash. The amount of people who bought with coins who otherwise would not with money is so minuscule in the grand scheme. Drugs are illegal, so it had that edge with the anonymous coins on the dark net. But paying for porn is legal and it will not increase the visitors nor innovate porn industry tbh.Just a temporary FOMO vehicle.
0	1523970566	11	i'll wait till they accept SPANK (spankchain) :D
1	1523983021	1	Isn't that a wannabe cam site? 
0	1523972229	15	This is literally just adding extra steps to paying for porn if you want to have your porn-related transactions to be "private". The average porn-paying user simply won't go through the hassle of exchanging fiat to crypto, trading on an exchange, transferring funds between wallets, and finally paying for their porn. 
1	1523979972	3	Nope. Many people wanted to buy premium but didn't because they were afraid that their wife would see it on the credit card bill. Now they can say: "Honey, you know that crypto thing? I invested 100 bucks in it" Buy premium and hodl the rest.
2	1523980354	2	Except it doesn't appear as PORNHUBPORN on your cc bill.. It appears as a totally different ID that makes no sense, could easily be masked "hey wife I bought some crypto and it shows on my cc as.."
3	1523980581	1	Yes it doesn't say PORNHUBPORN  on the bill, but I payed for porn once and it showed something along the lines "Zonga entertainment". Most people nowadays are smart enough to type this into google. And if you ask google, it knows that this is a porn site. 
1	1523977351	1	Paying with any crypto is literally just adding steps to paying with anythingY'all are fucking hilarious. Trying so hard to act like it's bad, when you guys were literally hoping for an exit scam which would be HORRIBLE for the crypto community
2	1523980120	2	Thanks for buying my top at 1700 sats last year and 1385 sats yesterday man.
0	1523975480	6	I legit thought I was watching a well-produced parody someone planned to release on this exact date. Till i realized it was for real...What a joke
0	1523972637	11	It would be completely savage if Pornhub is just trolling Verge. I'd probably die. Most  amazing marketing scheme ever.
0	1523974747	14	If Pornhub actually cared they would have integrated Monero, Zcash, and DASH.  But instead I am guessing they just accepted Verge because "F** it, they will pay us 10 million dollars lolz!"
1	1523978259	6	They were behind the whole having to use ID to access porn in the UK.They hate privacy. Probably why they went with XVG
0	1523973287	13	(before reading this, note that I'm not pro/anti XVG, I'm just trying to look for the truth out there)Honestly..... I am happy they didn't scam, BUT THIS "ANNOUNCEMENT" IS DISAPPOINTING, and let me explain why:1. Verge IS NOT A PRIVACY COIN. Unlike Monero, Verge will NOT hide your transaction history and therefore it's not a privacy coin. This reminds me of Windows Mixed Reality Headsets, they chose this name to confuse us (people thought they'll be a mix between AR and VR, it turns out it's actually just a platform for both.. whatever). So yeah, pay for your membership with Verge and have your wife, girlfriend or whoever else find out! Privacy at its best. Let me give you the best example: we all knew the XVG donation funds have been moved to exchanges. Please explain where is the privacy?2. Verge being accepted there will not change the perspective of cryptocurrencies around the world. Please read no. 1 to find out why.3. I can't even call this a partnership. It's just that you can pay for memberships with Verge. How do you define this "big"?! I thought this would be able to change the world. **How**?I'm happy for all the XVG investors for not getting scammed. I'm really happy, especially because it would've affected, once again, the trust and markets of cryptocurrencies. However, when people speculated here that it's going to be PornHub, I thought it was meant to be a joke. "The Future Has Cum" really?I wouldn't be surprised if they'll start accepting BTC, ETH or LTC soon....
1	1523974549	5	They might not have gotten scammed, but they're getting toasted right now. I had a huge position in Verge and my stop loss cashed me out this morning. It's dropping so fast right now. They might not have gotten scammed, but they're taking a beating right now.
1	1523974907	5	I legitimately thought this post was someone's parody of the partnership when I saw the "future has cum" thumbnail. 
1	1523974812	0	> Verge IS NOT A PRIVACY COIN. Unlike Monero, Verge will NOT hide your transaction historyIsn't it just different kinds of privacy? Like you can do some extra things to obfuscate the money and it's origin/destination but not everyone needs/wants it all the time?Whereas Monero has privacy all the time, good for some usecases sure but it's not right to say every other method is bullshit.
2	1523978951	3	You can't "obfusfcate the money and its origin" with Verge. I'm not saying every other method is bullshit, but Verge calling their coin a "privacy" one is purely misleading. What they "offer" you can be done for free, within a few steps, by using third party apps non-related to XVG.
2	1523980886	2	No! If your phone  is calling "phone-sex-services" and you get billed...does it matter if it was you or a "friend" who found your phone ?... Exactly this is the verge "privacy" everyone can see everything but you can say..."well yeah it was my address and my coins, but I didn't spend the money... This ip adress is in italy..."so yeah...this is the privacy of verge...what a fuvking joke
3	1523982456	1	I don't actually know anything about Verge which is why I asked, I thought it was similar to the optional mixer in Dash
4	1523983050	1	It only hides your IP. Your funds are completely traceable.EDIT: here I might be wrong, but I think I read somewhere that even the "hidden IP" can be tracked back to you.I remember using Monero a few years ago, I never really knew it was a privacy coin beforehand. I sent some money and it left no trace - I thought it was a TIFU moment for me. Turns out it was just the way Monero hides traces.
0	1523975154	6	HAHAHAHA so that verge fundraiser was probably to pay pornhub to allow verge and paid for pornhub to advertise it.Hilarious. I guess it's a household name..lol
0	1523975913	7	I was expecting a shittier partner. It's not that bad actually. But there's no exclusivity here. Pornhub accepts BTC as well and probably more in the future.

But also, still not an IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. Seems like xvg is still really oversold from all the hype... but still not  bad.I also wonder how long verge got them to commit to exclusivity for. Cause, it seems like it would be easier to accept BTC and there are vastly more BTC holders out there.

1	1523974869	2	This is nothing news. Look at these swings! Hahhhh a 10% market buy from literally one whale. This is amazing!
0	1523976248	4	OK let's address this.PornHub has become very successful over the past years, why? Anyone want to take guess? BECAUSE IT'S FREESo..... We add a crpyto to simultaneously pay & remain anonymous.  So, let's take a look at our demographic!!!We have married men who don't want their spouse knowing they pay for live cam models to jack-off. I can see pornhub taking verge for memberships as well which only helps the married man that doesn't want his wife to know he likes his porn membership. But, I truly don't see who else would use this method IF THEY EVEN PAY AT ALL. Again, PornHub has become successful because of their free model. SO when you add payments into the mix, and payments in the form of crypto, you are opening a very very small window. Yes it's great a company as big as pornhub has accepted crpyto, I love this. I also love the concept of porn and anonymity hand in hand. But, I don't see this being successful in the business plan presented. With this implemented, I'm sure they will continue to build around it. It is smart move in the long run, but will not provide any value in the short term. 
1	1523976879	3	Don’t all pornsites already use discreet credit card statements? I imagine that married man problem has been solved a long time ago
2	1523977876	1	Sure it can show a pseudo-name on the statement, but when the question of "Honey, what did you spend $9.99 on?" comes up, what will his answer be? To where now his $10 porn membership is in his $100 crypto buy and done payment justified to spouse. 
3	1523988201	1	Or buy a prepaid visa at literally any gas station or grocery store?

0	1523979438	5	Gotta be honest, although i don't care one bit about verge. A pornhub collab is still better than our boring Monero coral project. This type of partnership would have pushed Monero to the next level. Missed chance. 
0	1523981403	4	75 MILLION USD WORTH JUST TO BE TAKEN BY PORNHUB, WHEN OTHER CRYPTOS WERE INTEGRATED FOR FREE. HA
1	1523981685	2	Which other currencies are integrated with pornhub? 
1	1523981589	1	Its more like 7 million USD given the current price of Verge.... your point still stands though.
1	1523987911	1	75 Million XGV.  Obviously research isn't your strong point.
0	1523972640	8	Pornhub is NOT the official partner, XVG stated this in a recent tweet. Partnership will be announced in 15 mins
1	1523973910	7	I don’t see any tweet 
2	1523975624	3	Verge will be verge...
3	1523980870	4	First stealth addresses, then I heard about a stealth video and now even stealth tweets. These guys are GOOD!!!
0	1523974804	7	No other businesses will touch this coin now. It's only way is to go deeper into the darker world. So long XVG. You can officially rebrand to SLC - sleaze coin
1	1523980357	5	Lol give me a break 
1	1523980948	1	Man this place really has a hard on for hating on xvg.
1	1523988742	1	you know that the darkweb made coins like bitcoin right? This news is huge for any privacy based coin.... but you clearly are here for the FUD but i can handle that extra salt any time.

1	1523970761	8	Tweet deleted---EDIT:For anyone wondering what the tweet said: https://i.imgur.com/uJSNNdL.png
2	1523971923	3	Basically it says wait for the news @ 10am EST
3	1523980052	1	ok, it's 10AM EST.  so what's the news?
4	1523980335	1	Partnership with Mindgeek. Omg that's amazing /s
0	1523971693	6	This ad was a cringefest. Shame. Good gains to be made but i forsee a sharp decline
0	1523973846	2	Yah no response on twitter.
0	1523975506	2	The Vergefam aka “Vergins” ain’t virgins no more, they just go their ass fucked by a BBC no lube.
0	1523975658	2	What in the actual fuck
0	1523975681	2	I’d be willing to bet pornhub decided to start accepting crypto and told verge they could be exclusive for X amount of time if they paid for it which would explain asking for donations. This seems more like a paid exclusive than a partnership. 
1	1523977652	4	It's not an exclusive. You can already pay using BTC on these sites.
2	1523987919	1	Yeah and oddly Bitcoin didn't need to brib these websites with millions to accept it.
0	1523977021	2	HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA !!!!
0	1523978808	2	How was this info available before the times stated on their twitter?
0	1523979530	2	Verge / DogeDickcoin
0	1523982033	2	😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂NO WORDS!!!
0	1523982106	2	Is this real life
1	1523983130	2	Or is this just fantasy?
2	1523988131	1	Caught in a landslide
0	1523983236	2	Cringeworthy 😁
1	1523984735	1	Pretty funny I think
0	1523986380	1	hahahahaha /u/sunerok facepalm idiot
0	1523986451	1	Penis + Pussy = Vergefam hahahahahaha
0	1523981915	3	Can someone please explain to me why in the hell you would need to raise millions just to get a company to accept your coin as an optional payment method? Is this really what we're calling a ***"Partnership"*** now? lmao
0	1523973597	2	1. who the fuck pays for porn?2. why would those fucks use verge to pay for porn?I'm curious how much Verge paid for this "partnership". The only result of this "partnership" is verge fan boys will be paying for porn. Great for pornhub! They get new premium users and they got paid for it. 
1	1523979979	2	Pornhub Premium existed, there was askreddit thread about who used it, Paying with verge though, that's really big question.
0	1523976072	3	LOL.  Verge's price is going down like a cheap whore.Like they say "Buy the rumor, sell the news."
0	1523978655	3	New slogan: If you are a perve, buy verge!
0	1523978972	5	Verge is like that one hot chick you knew back in HS who's life fell apart and just started doing  stripping and porn. 
1	1523980801	2	And made enough money to retire by age 30 and married a rich guy and drives a 7 series and shops all day.
2	1523982105	2	I would like to invite you to my shitty hometown in Texas and see if that theory stands up.
3	1523982158	1	You need to hit the big city.  
0	1523981783	3	I don't have XVG, but the salt here is hilarious. Why is the coin hated so much in this sub?
0	1523973770	4	Verge making partnerships is proof that it's not decentralized. 
1	1523973853	3	no shit
1	1523979096	1	we can argue about that. they asked for 75 mil in donation, it wasn't a normal partnership. i am not a verge holder and never been.
0	1523980471	3	The amount of Verge hating here when this should just universally be excitement for mass adoption is pretty pathetic.
0	1523984328	3	99.999999% of supposed catalysts in crypto are objectively idiotic. Great pornhub will now accept verge tokens (which they’ll promptly liquidate to fund their operations). Why does this make verge a better investment? What problem is this solving? A lack of ways to give money to pornhub (rhetorical)? USD is accepted everywhere - by this logic  shouldn’t we all invest in cash?? It has by far the most adoption right?!?For news to drive a higher price, it should make a coin look more like a store of value, not just a payment rail. Ex:/ you might hold eth because it could benefit from an ecosystem of ec20 apps or bitcoin because it has an established/secure protocol with a (relatively) liquid market. “OH MY GOD CRYPTO + WELL KNOWN BRAND = MOON” isn’t the sort of thoughtful analysis that’ll get you a hedge fund job. It will get me to call you a moron tho :)
0	1523969614	8	Rofl. So it's a real partnership, but it's just as a method to pay for Pornhub premium?I hope for all the people who fell for this that they paid for more than just that. That there's something else. Otherwise...
1	1523970483	24	"just a method to pay""people who fell for this"Clearly your anti-XVG bias is showing. I am not a Verge fan by any stretch of the imagination, but if this partnership were announced for any other coin out there, it would be received universally as very good news.
2	1523972754	7	Except for the fact that the lead dev literally just paid them to accept his crypto ($3 million) that he raised from the community. 
2	1523973323	6	1. who the fuck pays for porn?2. why would those fucks use verge to pay for porn?
2	1523975932	3	thing is,this isnt a partnership.
2	1523971162	16	And your stupidity is showing. Collecting coins from your "community" for an annoucement is just shady. Verge totally deserves the shit it gets.
3	1523971591	7	Exactly, will they explain why they needed the donations get this announcment. It doesn't make sense.
4	1523972822	6	because they had to pay pornhub to accept their shitcoin. Possible other shitcoins were in the running but Verge made the best bid. 
5	1523975199	3	What a bunch of gullible fucks out there. 
2	1523971366	6	It's just a payment method for a site. It's small scale in terms of payments (not saying there isn't money to be made in porn, but it's not huge). Sure, it's bad news for all the porn tokens coming up, but this isn't the biggest partnership crypto has ever seen. This won't change the game. This wasn't worth begging token holders for donations.Also on that last part, having to pay Pornhub for a partnership where Pornhub makes more money? Weird all round to me. Also, it's in Pornhub's best interests to eventually open payments from other cryptos too, so what did Verge really get from this?
3	1523971975	6	But they paid for that partnership, that is still super weird.
1	1523976510	2	Is it *really* a partnership when you have to pay a company to accept your currency?  In the real world, for example, companies pay credit card companies to accept their cards as payment, not the other way around.
0	1523973066	3	LOOOOOL. Biggest partnership of crypto :D PornHUB Omg.Can´´´´´´´´t stop laughing.Solid project :DDDDDDDDDDDDD
0	1523972929	2	What's up with this? https://twitter.com/VergeLife/status/986224718104682496Was deleted. https://i.gyazo.com/80a1cb99bfea6feb2dac2cc70c25efca.png
1	1523977806	1	@VergeLife isn't an official accaunt mate, who cares what that random dude says.This is the verge crypto twitter: https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/
0	1523973855	2	Thais partnership makes it top 3 coin what a joke 
0	1523973922	2	All the shit XVG got I think this exceeded 0ⁿ everyone's expectations. I'm surprised. Really surprised. So much so that I'm skeptical if this is a joke.but since pornhub posted it... I guess it's true.
0	1523974318	2	Is this legit? If so, damn that's impressive for a shitcoin
0	1523975508	2	Do vergins still not think their subreddit is an echochamber (which is a huge understatement) when alibaba and amazon were the smallest partnerships they expected.Seriously, this kind of pump and dump hurts all of cryptocurrency as mainstream media will spread the negative news about these topics.Don't buy hype coins - don't FOMO into announcements of announcements.
0	1523976472	2	Pornhub is the billion dollar company/ payment processor? what? 
1	1523977180	3	Nope. Mindgeek is. This is gargantuous.
0	1523977283	2	I'm actually surprised, pretty big partner. I expect most Verge holders to be horny teenagers anyways
0	1523977912	2	What the..... F
0	1523978269	2	Hahah I love Pornhub's promotional videos. I don't know much about Verge other than /r/CryptoCurrency hates on it quite a bit, but as a fan of Ripple and IOTA I understand that bandwagon hate against some coins isn't always warranted. Hope this works out for Verge. I don't own any Verge, but I think I will pick some up now :\)
1	1523982056	2	Yes, funny at the very least
0	1523978318	2	Omfg that was it? ahahahaahha
0	1523979369	2	Surel this has revolutionised the cryptocurrency world!!! LOL
0	1523982142	2	Wait does Pornhub make money from something other than porn ads?How is the pornhub partnership beneficial for XVG holders?Some XVG holders care to explain?Was this the big announcement for today?
1	1523987560	1	Its Mindgeek and mindgeek owns lots of porn sites like brazzers, redtube, pornhub etc and on some of their sites they use a premium subscription and now they have verge as a payment option. So this is gonna be huge no doubt and i think that on sites with live cams is where verge is gonna shine.
1	1523987973	1	No, just part of the announcement. The announcement is that they are partnered with mind geek. https://www.mindgeek.com/
0	1523982620	2	Wait a second - Did they imply that verge is inflationary? One coin used to buy a lambo and now 1 will get get you some porn. The mainstream plebs are gonna love this "news"
0	1523983956	2	Honestly that was a exceptionally good advertisement 
0	1523974658	2	Raise your hand if you pay for porn
0	1523970588	3	This is the true peak of the virtual currency. You must be a madman not to have a bag of the almighty verge c̶o̶n̶ coin.
0	1523973807	2	So does this mean that Verge isn't a scam like what everyone in this sub said so ?
1	1523976012	6	It's not inherently a scam it is just extremely shady what they have been doing. This shows they did have an actual partner so I'll give them that but it also shows they spent 75M Verge they acquired from "donations" on it. Worth it? I don't see a single reason to support this coin or its "developer".
1	1523976230	6	well..he made the community pay to get a bussiness to accept it as payment system.not really a partnership.and i wonder how this legally works.cant they just drop verge a few months in anyway?
2	1523978405	3	exactly. sounds more like a bribe. 
3	1523982819	1	ofcourse it is. What's stopping them from accepting other crypto's? Or even drop verge in a few months for something else? The community donated verge to them to accept it...it's a forced implementation. It wasn't about verge, it was about them getting money for it. If I wanted to implement a privacy coin, the last one to choose would be verge. The fact this "partnership" wouldn't even go trough if they didn't donate enough says enough.
0	1523984882	0	So this is supposed to make me trust Verge? I still haven't forgetten Wraith Protocol NYE. The fact that they spend 90% of their money and time on marketing is a big red flag. If this was a true partnership, would the Verge "fam" have paid PH so much money?This isn't true adoption, it's a paid PR stunt by a team that should be shunned by the crypto community. 
1	1523986165	3	Just be happy verge is making moves. How can you be mad at this partnership lol.
2	1523989123	1	Cause he sold and lost money. 
0	1523975392	3	And that's it? The Pornhub? Vechain makes this kind of announcements every Sunday lmao.
1	1523981083	2	Thats because Vecain is the most shittycoin out there. Enjoy HODL your doomed coin.
2	1523982990	1	What the fuck xD lmao

0	1523986954	1	Vergina 
0	1523987123	1	if Pornhub accepts Bitcoin, how much have they made off it? are people even using it? and now Verge an has to compete for that space also.

0	1523989316	1	[verga!, verge users just got verged](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=verga)
0	1523989349	1	I just don't understand why this is getting so much hate. Even if Verge is a total shit coin this just brings more exposure to Crypto in general and that's a good thing. ANYTHING that makes anyone think about getting into crypto is a good thing. Even if they paid for the partnership, who cares, it's exposure, it's a good thing.I personally think this could have a use. The husband that wants to buy porn, but never did because his wife might see the credit card statement, or a teen, who knows. It doesn't matter if it's not 100% private because a spouse isn't going to be looking at a crypto ledger tracing IP addresses. You don't have to be 100% private buying porn if all you're trying to do is hide it from another person. The government doesn't give a shit if you're buying porn so who cares if they're not really a privacy coin? They do need to admit that Verge transactions can be traced, but it's still positive for crypto in general that this happened.I'll admit I made a KILLING on XVG (got in at 58 sats) and I did bail out almost in full this morning fairly close to it's high from the pre announcement pump. I still don't know one way or the other if Verge will last and I really don't care. I still mine it too because it has a good daily return. I'll hang onto a little (plus what I get mining) in case it catches fire eventually, but the raw hatred this sub gives Verge is just beyond me. It's like you're rooting against crypto.
0	1523989350	1	Actually... VERGE gave us a hint since the beginning ...Just go to www.google.frtype "large verge"and click on IMAGES...Makes perfect sense now!
0	1523978064	1	I personally think this is fantastic news.I was really sceptical leading up to the announcement but this has surpassed my expectations. I never believed the whispers of Amazon or PayPal.
1	1523982138	1	I didn't expect pornhub to be honest but I saw some people who did, pretty impressive guess I must say
0	1523974629	1	Partnership is pretty solid and really ties toguether with the BRAND that Verge is becoming. The whole fundraising, on the other hand, is shady af. Looks to me like the money raised has been used to pay for marketing, video and to Pornhub to use their official channels to push this deal to the public.I'm sorry for all the people that donated.
0	1523972123	1	So this is why they needed money:) 
0	1523975541	1	Hahaha. Guess verge is now the porncoin.. what a let down. Didn't the verge team say this announcement would change cryptocurrency.Verge the porn coin. Hahaha awesome entertainment 
0	1523975862	1	The real news is with Walton. What a flop!
0	1523978061	1	Lol
0	1523979009	1	haha ok
0	1523979425	1	So many puns, so few time
0	1523980007	1	Does anyone actually pay for porn? I saw this on askreddit and seems like most people who do just do it for very specific stuff, don't really know how this is gonna give verge more of a usecase
0	1523987341	1	That's it? Partnership with PornHub? I expected nothing and I'm still let down.
0	1523977933	0	are you guys all braindead little kiddies?if you dont think this is a lucrative move for verge, i honestly think you have problemsim not even a verge bag holder, got like a measly 100 bux in it, you guys sound honestly RETARDEDyou're coming off as dumb little 21 year olds without a clue, think more before you keep posting how this could somehow be a "bad thing" or "shitty partnership"its honestly comical, you guys are SO lostit hurts.
1	1523983279	2	Verge raised a large sum to somehow pay for a partnership with a free pornsite, how could this possibly be a bad investment?
2	1523983467	1	so u don't think anyone pays for pornhub lol kk
3	1523987952	1	Not nearly as many as you think... Better question is how many people in crypto pay for porn if I was to venture a guess I'd bed maybe a few thousand MAYBE 
4	1523988224	1	stop acting like you have inside knowledge of the statistics when clearly you dont.next.
0	1523975881	-1	Leave it to reddit to spin any positive news into pure negativity if they have bias against the coin. Jeez guys, grow up.
0	1523972814	-2	wow so the partnership was real?Nice
0	1523975132	-2	Everyone is hating but i feel if YOUR favorite crypto announced tomorrow that Pornhub.com is accepting your favorite crypto.  You'd all be like "moon!,  lambo!"
1	1523976142	1	i really wouldn't... LMFAO. Why the fuck would anyones favourite coin want to be associated with a porn site company.. Cryptos bad enough in the public eye being linked to drugs and all that shit.. and who the hell pays for porn.. 
0	1523979508	-2	This is huge news and mindgeek is the biggest online porn so its a big thing for all privacy crypto coins. I can already smell the idiot FUDLERS who sold their coins at a lost. Aint karma a bitch
