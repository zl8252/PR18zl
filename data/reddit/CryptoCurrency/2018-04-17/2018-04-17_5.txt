0	1523919729	18	Want, but poor. Thanks for the free look.
0	1523917249	15	I am the same guy that brought you the Bitcoin Astronaut on metal, as well as the Bitcoin Satoshi White Paper on metal that you may have seen last week.  [Here's a full shot of the Ethereum panel](https://imgur.com/gallery/ySo2Z)  and for those that would like to own one, it's limited to 10, signed and numbered, and [available here](https://lynxartcollection.com/collections/metal-panels-limited-to-10/products/ethereum-white-paper-typographical-metal-panel-art-limited-to-10)  Also - I accept crypto directly on the site (ETH, BTC, LTC, XMR, & DOGE)  
1	1523925865	1	this is pretty amazing, do you ship to Europe? shipping costs? customs?
2	1523928333	3	I sure do.  Shipping the metal panel to Europe is, I believe, $97.  I do commissions as well, yes :)
1	1523932989	1	I want that really bad but not that bad XD. Glad you're selling though!
0	1523917212	3	[mp4 link](https://i.giphy.com/pVV4hzeAiksejRVpKA.mp4)---This mp4 version is 73.18% smaller than the gif (4.19 MB vs 15.62 MB).  ---*Beep, I'm a bot.* [FAQ](https://np.reddit.com/r/anti_gif_bot/wiki/index) | [author](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=MrWasdennnoch) | [source](https://github.com/wasdennnoch/reddit-anti-gif-bot) | v1.1.2
1	1523943548	-3	mp4 smaller than gifs, wut?
2	1523947534	2	Gifs aren't optimized for video, it was always a animation format.
0	1523920994	3	Well done!
0	1523932940	2	WANT
0	1523928681	3	It's a beautiful thing. I'm a artist at @sick_ta and want to get better. So many ways to express yourself in the cripto world
1	1523933581	2	thanks man.  best of luck to you with your artwork, I'll check it out!
0	1523918825	1	Did you already sell one in the first 30 mins
1	1523918925	1	the listing has been active for a few days as "reservations" since the majority of pieces I release sell out within 24 hours of me making any type of announcement.
0	1523924414	1	Sexy sexy stuff!
0	1523932287	1	Looks really cool, but $899 is way too much for me. Any cheaper versions? 
1	1523933085	4	I have it available on both print and canvas mediums [here](https://lynxartcollection.com/collections/crypto-artwork/products/5a7dd6fbe4966bd789d8d766)
2	1523933148	1	Thanks a lot. Might buy the other one if ETH goes on a bull run above $1400 again. 
0	1523969115	1	I like the part where Vitalik mentions ASIC resistance.
0	1523969481	1	Looks cool. Why would anyone want to own a white paper though?
0	1523970316	1	Thatâ€™s actually pretty sick man. You need to vinyl cover a Lambo in that. 
0	1523970410	1	Can you do a Verge one? Where I reel off the whole story and see it go to 0?
0	1523970605	1	You should make some that are 3"x5" if possible. It would be cool to have a little collection of them lol. Looks great!
0	1523973371	1	I would definitely buy if you did a more affordable version in the 1~200 done on shiny plastic or something.
0	1523973624	1	Nice looking phone.
0	1523976345	1	That's beautiful. Nice work!!
0	1523930224	1	Why?
1	1523949393	1	It's for sale.
2	1523949568	2	Sale implies value.
3	1523963669	2	Why does art have value? Because people think it looks interesting.
3	1523968903	0	"I don't like something therefore it's worthless"
4	1523971529	0	I'll elaborate.Why the fuck would I pay any amount of money whatsoever for a printed out fact-file about a cryptocurrency that I have no affiliation with, apart from the fact that I hold a few coins of it?It's a dumb idea and in the same wheelhouse a people who got bitcoin tattoos
0	1523943423	1	wow very reflect much glare
0	1523947156	1	Could you do one of vitalik dressed as the 'mona lisa'?
0	1523966013	1	Nice craftsmanship but the paper is a lie. There is no asic resistance. Just resistant to do anything about it when asic shows up. 
0	1523970717	-1	I hate this sub
