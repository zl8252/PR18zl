0	1523964017	48	To be honest, I didn't know how much I didn't understand about OmiseGO until reading this post
1	1523978298	0	It’ll be something different tomorrow 
0	1523971518	35	If only this sub would understand half of what this project is doing it'd be worth twice as much as EOS, tron and verge combined.
1	1523978194	-5	Don’t combine eos with shitcoins 
2	1523978334	11	I love it that you're an ETH fan and said that.
3	1523978893	1	I own both. And omg. I’m currently most optimistic about eos 
4	1523979692	2	I'm in the same boat. Own them all and believe they'll all do well. Especially EOS come June. I do believe OMG should have a closer market cap to EOS (or EOS lower) but then again EOS did raise over a billion dollars so it makes some sense
1	1523973985	-14	I get that you meant market cap, but it actually is worth almost double the price of those coins combined lol
2	1523976744	5	.... which is irrelevant. Why even bother posting that? Why not compare the total number of letters in each coin's name. That's about as relevant.
0	1523963379	21	Man I remember the days when OmiseGO was under $1. Feels old but it was less than a year ago...
1	1523965006	13	I'm feeling also sad that I haven't bought that token by that price...
2	1523970891	6	Don't live with regret. I know somebody who is constantly stewing over "I wish i'd bought X at X". It's pointless to think that wayThink about upcoming potentials and not times in the past you've missed out onEverybody wishes they'd bought Amazon/Google stock. Everybody wishes they'd picked the correct lottery numbers.....
2	1523971074	3	Even if you did you'd feel bad you didn't buy more
2	1523967029	-1	However now still is good time to buy CS. 
1	1523970735	5	I bought over 3000 of them at $1.50I then stupidly sold them all at $5. Trying to build up my position again.....
2	1523978064	10	Yes, you "stupidly" locked in over triple in profits. Must be rough man.
3	1523982309	3	"Guys, I beat the S&P by like 300%. It's a sad day."  
0	1523969576	27	u/octahedronjerku/mnightshyau/smartist_chartistu/notlikethis1994u/zenyaddaAll appear to be the same person lol, why is Store of Value blog still allowed on r/cryptocurrency
1	1523971278	-12	Trigger them by sharing this link https://steemit.com/omisego/@eosfan/omise-omisego-omg-is-unsecure-and-centralized
0	1523977623	10	Not the sexiest of coins in terms of price action but going to blow up one day and predict it to be one of the first alts to completely decouple from BTC in terms of price. This is a long term hold that should be in every crypto portfolio, even if it is a small %.
1	1523981504	1	Why do you think it will decouple first? I'm pretty sure decoupling will be very gradual and in waves
0	1523963455	8	Well researched and objective review +1
0	1523975235	6	If you love OmiseGo you should definitely look at Electrify.Asia (ELEC). They have partnership with 4th biggest power company TEPCO.OMG CEO Jun Hasegawa is also the advisor And they will use Plasma 
0	1523976659	1	Can we assume that OMG is a direct competitor to Waves? 
1	1523977527	2	OMG is doing a lot more than Waves from what I know. Waves is a DEX and token creation platform, so the only similarity there is that OMG will also have a DEX built into its protocol.
2	1523977951	1	They are aiming for fiat - crypto conversions, too. The 'owner' is coming from a payment service as well so their target business should be quite similar 
0	1523972608	1	Quality article, thanks for the share.
0	1523974680	1	Good article! One of the most professional teams. I see OMG in top 10 in the long term. 
0	1523974412	0	It's funny how most people see these features as "great ideas" only ex post facto
0	1523977936	0	great project and nice pump
0	1523986080	0	Oh tank you, it's only the 70th "deep dive into OmiseGo" article someone posted here this month
0	1523965858	-17	OMG one of the most stable coins in bear marketI wish i bought it under 1$But nowadays a lot of coins under 1$ and they can go as OMG
1	1523968842	4	Price doesn't mean anything if you exclude supply from the equation. A grain of sand is cheap because the supply is high. A grain of gold is more expensive but probably a better investment. It just feels better to have more of something, and this is probably the reason so many high supply coins did extremely well last year. 
1	1523968651	3	Name 2
1	1523971027	6	No they can't go like OMG, there aren't many teams as strong as the OmiseGO team in crypto.
