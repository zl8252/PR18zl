1	1523976252	26	Wish more people could open their eyes to this.Congrats on being invested in good projects.
1	1523976409	23	IoT industry is going to be massive. 
1	1523977574	15	You're smart. Why fight about who's "going to make it" when you can just hold both.
2	1523986196	7	Totally, im throwing Ambrosus, Modum and Origin Trail in there too for good measure :)
1	1523977959	16	yup.  I'm here to make money, not be a cheerleader.  Holding WTC/VEN masternodes in the same wallet.  No worries at all.    I find it is one of the most toxic parts of American culture.  Always us vs them.  Republicans vs. Democrats, Conservatives vs. Liberals.  Blacks vs whites.  They love to build up walls amongst themselves.    
2	1523984399	4	Rooting for crypto, polictics, etc. like their sports teams 
2	1523986302	3	Yeah but tribalism isnt confined to American Culture :)
2	1523982980	2	America thrives on division of groups but that’s a whole other story lol. 
1	1523979321	7	refreshing man, gets old looking at the post history of the people who FUD Walton and they are all invested in VEN.  It's ok for both projects to succeed and literally does nothing to try to discredit the other, but clowns will be clowns.
1	1523986596	3	After reading this thread, and all the nonsense below, I am of the same opinion as u! Room for many to flourish. Both excellent projects! 
1	1523986023	-3	Disagree 100%.Supply Chain Management implementations are sticky as hell. No one wants to be the one betting on the wrong solution and then being stuck for a few years before having to invest a ton of money again. WTC/VeChain both offer solid technology but lack the implementation and industry know how needed to convince companies to bet on them beyond a trial phase. Reading all the responses from IBM Think 2018 about their private blockchain solution I don´t think any C-level executive will decide for a public solution before seeing their pitch. 
2	1523986730	5	> I don´t think any C-level executive will decide for a public solution before seeing their pitch. Waltonchain and Vechain support permissioned child chain ledgers...
3	1523988922	1	I know, but there is no benefit for MNCs/OEMs to use child chains compared to the private/cooperate solutions offered.Plus as I said, they don´t have the know how to implement their technology and would need consulting firms to help them. Those consulting firms, however, are already committed to their software partners. 
0	1523972224	60	Sadly this isn't going to reach the same audience it did before, but thank you for taking the time out to compose this article and clarify the facts for us. It's great to see a public blockchain company being this deeply involved with the IoT industry. It's sometimes hard to draw the connections because it's done through a long list of subsidiary companies, but that's the corporate structure Waltonchain has chosen to adopt, and it has its legal advantages. Xiamen Zhongchuan IoT Research Institute being accepted as a member of the Alibaba IoT Alliance has great implications for Waltonchain in the future. At the very least it highlights their impressive hardware capabilites. This compliments the fact that Lin Herui, a core member of Waltonchain, was promoted to Vice President of the Fujian Province IoT Industry Association: https://medium.com/@Waltonchain_EN/waltonchain-project-director-elected-the-vice-president-of-fujian-iot-industry-association-e17c27335aa1. If you haven't, do you research on the role the Fujian Province will play in the One Belt One Road Initiative. 
1	1523976322	11	Absolutely, great advice.  The OBOR initiative is a truly global project and being a part of that is priceless.
2	1523977163	17	There will be many public blockchains involved with the OBOR project. The scope is historic and its reach global. There will be no single blockchain to take the whole share of the pie. If anything, private, consortium, and public blockchains will be interoperable with each other, and data will be shared between them. People need to realize supply chain industry, and especially IoT centric blockchains, which incorporate a public token, aren't only limited to the transactional volume generated by humans. Fully automated, global economies will generate hundreds of billions, perhaps trillions of automated transactions per year without accounting for consumer transactions. The level of transaction volume successful, public supply chain/ IoT centric coins like Waltonchain and Vechain will see compared to fully consumer focused coins will be substantial imo.IoT will be the biggest industry by far, and I believe Waltonchain is leading the way in the IoT industry for public blockchain adoption. 
1	1523983369	4	Waltons tech can't be overstated enough. They produce their own chips that are very cheap and better than anything out there.
0	1523974754	26	Personally I don't see how anybody could mistake these comments as bot shilling. Each comment seems to bring up different points about Walton. We've been alienated ever since the Alibaba Cloud partnership tweet removal, but this is evidence that there is cooperation between the two parties. This isn't even concerning the Smart City partnership. This a further development between the two that we weren't aware of previously. I just truly believe there is a good thing going on at Walton, and implore people who felt as though its a scam to dive deeper than the headlines. The foundation for global adoption is there and is being expanded upon everyday. 
1	1523987591	2	In every single thread within this subreddit there is a minimum of a few people saying the content is shilled and fake. Its a tribal mentality that has no basis in fact.
0	1523974610	42	Waltonchain tweeted they would be working with Alibaba on IoT smart cities project. The tweet was later redacted because of China politics around cryptocurrency. A community member did the research to PROVE that the tweet about the Alibaba partnership was real and not removed for being false information. OP clearly goes into detail to provide a link to a subsidiary of Waltonchain being part of the Alibaba IoT Alliance. Yes they are among many companies on that list however that does not discredit the information. 
1	1523981096	13	Who would be silly enough to think Walton would try to lie about something like that? They're not stupid. The connection is clearly there. Regulatory uncertainty caused a delay. 
2	1523982391	8	It was a weird situation that followed their giveaway scam, so it was easier for people to connect the dots that it was a liePlus this sub LOVES to yell scam
3	1523982500	7	Twitter was done by someone getting paid minimum wage. Taking photos shaking hands with Alibaba executives can't be fake.
1	1523976382	21	128 members, but Walton's subsidiary is listed 8th on the first page.
2	1523977153	17	8 is a lucky number in China
0	1523973074	17	Cant wait to see their tech and blockchain in cities across China and Korea, then hopefully the world. Should really pump the need for wtc coins when all childchains are up and running.
1	1523976431	5	Don't forget Brazil
2	1523986098	2	Yeah Brazil could be huge! China is heavily investing in Brazil, and Waltonchain is setting up their Brazil offices this month or the next.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-china-investment/china-investment-in-brazil-hit-seven-year-high-in-2017-idUSKBN1F7387
1	1523978830	4	Walton is also aiming for Japan and Russia. 
2	1523979347	6	And eventually the US.  I also believe they are trademarked in France/EU.
3	1523985978	1	They already established contacts to US-based executives of fortune 500 companies through CAST-USAhttps://medium.com/@Waltonchain_EN/citylink-welcomed-dr-a0f91afa341e
0	1523974160	25	BRB selling everything I have including my wife to get more WTC holy!!!
1	1523975207	10	if you move fast there's a good arbitrage play on grannies you can make on binance/bitfinex
2	1523976030	8	Moving fast is key to investing in the Alibaba Waltonchain partnership while WTC remains so cheap.  Those aleady invested, congrats.
0	1523979226	14	It's funny that WTC is VENs competitor and they always get compared. Funny because WTC is so grossly undervalued. Rank 60? That's a  joke they are working with Alibaba. Get it while you can it wont last long.
0	1523985716	8	Ive seen a couple threads now with both VEN and WTC, without any serious bickering. This is really refreshing guys, please keep it up! 
1	1523987503	3	I agree! Finally, a little tranquility.
0	1523972681	19	The Waltonchain team are doing all the foundation work to be at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption in tomorrows Smart Cities and the IoT.Thanks for the oppprtunity to be able to invest!
0	1523972895	20	[removed]
1	1523979034	16	Unlike the other post which was disgustingly misleading, this one  is 100% kosher and factual.  Congrats to all wtc holders!
2	1523981006	7	You suprised me with this one. Have an upvote!
1	1523973246	8	Made me chuckle, take an upvote:). Excited for the future of WTC as real world usage and adoption takes place!
0	1523972083	32	Wow you've really done your research! Slowly Walt will unravel it's iot web of interconnected real world usage. 
0	1523971910	50	This is 100% confirmation of Alibaba working with WaltonChain. It took Alibaba a week or two to confirm but they have finally done it!People should never have doubted the integrity of WaltonChain, their aim is to change the world and with our support it is something they will achieve!!In a very short space of time we have secured partnerships with BOTH Alibaba and Huodull. The work going on behind the scenes at WaltonChain is truly incredibly. They are one of the hardest working teams in crypto!!!Keep up the incredible work everyone!!! :)
1	1523974076	8	But they are working with a subsidiary?  Can someone explain then the difference here, since the last thread was deleted by mods for too many inaccuracies in the title (i.e. Claiming it was a Walton partnership instead of Walton subsidiary).  Obviously there must be quite a difference if it was worth deleting a thread over. Also, not to get into semantics too much, but it's a membership IN not a partnership WITH, correct?  I thought they were one of hundreds of members.  Please correct me if I'm wrong. 
2	1523976682	17	Yeah, so "Waltonchain" is a conglomerate of companies. There really is no one single company that you can point to and say "*that's Waltonchain*." Even their blockchain is built by a "subsidiary" company. And their RFIDs are developed by another subsidiary. Their smart cities company is another. The list goes on.All of these companies are a part of The Waltonchain Foundation, which is the umbrella. This has certain legal advantages in China, considering the climate surrounding blockchain technology. They are able to announce partners with govts and large corporations without mentioning blockchain.
3	1523979280	5	in the US this structure is usually just a company that owns many other LLCs.  It can own any percentage of other companies etc.  In Walton’s case, almost all their subsidiaries are 100% owned by the foundation.  So while they are technically a different company, since ownership is 100% they are all effectively the same company as far as control goes.  It’s not like the foundation has a minority interest in all the subsidiaries.
2	1523974314	25	The title WAS inaccurate. It was posted by a known moonboy of the Waltonchain community whom we have learnt to not take so seriously. The implications and confirmations of simply having the Zhongchuan IoT logo posted onto the Alibaba website by them however, was important for validation. That's why everyone is so excited. 
3	1523977371	1	too bad the pump already happened tho
4	1523977401	8	And the fundamentals improve 😎
2	1523974942	10	The subsidiary is 100% owned and operated by Waltonchain. You will find that waltonchain have many subsidiary companies to ensure the workflow of their business is as streamlined as possible. Anytime you see "Waltonchain subsidiary", this is 100% Waltonchain.  In regards to the alliance, you will see that this is an IoT alliance that Alibaba have created so they can work together with their "IoT Industrial Partners" of which Waltonchain is one, to further develop and deploy IoT.A small abstract from their website:"In order to unite the members of the Internet of Things such as the Wisdom Family, Smart City, and Smart Industry to jointly develop and build an industry-oriented ecosystem for the Internet of Things, Alibaba and the IoT industry partners will jointly establish the IoT Connectivity Alliance."
2	1523986267	1	Check out this chart to have a better understanding about Waltonchain’s subsidiaries and ecosystem: https://i.redd.it/6f5uqtdk6j001.jpg 
2	1523976480	-13	Because they are 1 out of 300 members, and not a direct partnership as implied by previous thread
3	1523979061	5	Partnership simply means two entities working together because both see benefit from doing so. 
3	1523987760	1	Lol what do you think a partnership is? Seriously. Because we must be using different dictionaries. 
1	1523974418	-17	Shill alert 
2	1523975123	8	Just pure facts and some enthusiasm on my behalf :) You should learn what the definition of a shill is before you make such slanderous suggestions. 
1	1523973702	-27	If this is an industrial standards alliance like it seems to be as there are hundreds of other companies in it, it is absolutely no proof of Waltonchain and Alibaba working together in any way that would result in the price increase of the token.People should keep in mind that the Alibaba cloud "Partnership" tweet was quickly deleted and we haven't heard of it since.There also hasn't been anything on the China Mobile IoT Alliance since the vague announcement.Almost all we know about Waltonchain is from Waltonchain sources.
2	1523974637	14	If you read through the information and links provided in the post, in regards to the alliance, you will see that this is an IoT alliance that Alibaba have created so they can work together with their "IoT Industrial Partners" of which Waltonchain is one, to further develop and deploy IoT. A small abstract from their website: "In order to unite the members of the Internet of Things such as the Wisdom Family, Smart City, and Smart Industry to jointly develop and build an industry-oriented ecosystem for the Internet of Things, Alibaba and the IoT industry partners will jointly establish the IoT Connectivity Alliance."You can read through the materials provided to get more proof. In regards to the removal of the tweet a few weeks ago, this tweet was removed as it was not the right time to announce the partnership. The team are working extremely hard behind the scenes on R&D to ensure that they deliver on their Blockchain-IoT solutions. Just because they don't brag about their partnerships, but instead focus on actually developing their product, there is no need to criticise them. More so on the China Mobile IoT point, senior China Mobile staff attended the annual Waltonchain conference and spoke very highly of Waltonchain and their partnership etc. This was covered by multiple media outlets, not just waltonchain.      
3	1523975001	-15	When it comes to the China Mobile staff attending Waltonchain conference, it was a General Manager of a China Mobile **subsidiary**, not the parent company. Furthermore he made ridiculous claims of the token price increasing and top 4 coin and even "the next Alibaba".I can't really take that as proof of anything.
4	1523978361	6	You must be a real fun guy.
5	1523978645	-6	Investing isn't a party unless you're just gambling.You actually have to think and not just trust other people.
6	1523978692	3	Right. That's why I'm still up a couple hundred x over last year...  
7	1523978926	-1	Everyone is who got in to crypto early last year, i am too and it doesn't make us smart.In the long term smart people get to keep it and gamblers have a good chance of losing it all.
8	1523978958	2	Dayum I'mma get rekt then. 
8	1523978971	2	Who do you recommend?
8	1523979139	2	Damn. Looks like you used to support Walton but then got swept up in the fud. Sorry man. Hope Vechain works out for you. 
9	1523979440	0	Not all fud is without reason and it's not a competition of who has the strongest hands.
6	1523978895	0	I started with a dollar. I now have 300 dollars. Fuck yeah. 
7	1523979144	1	Good for you, i would be gambling too if i was in with a few hundred.With larger amounts it is good to be investing and not gambling.
8	1523979209	1	Lol. I have alot more. I'm clearly trolling.
9	1523979218	1	Hey, westhewolf, just a quick heads-up:  **alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  Have a nice day!^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
1	1523972337	-24	> their aim is to change the worldChange the world... of supply chain logistics? Hooray, I guess.
2	1523973267	18	The breadth of Walton's real world application spans **so far beyond** supply chain logistics. Please look at this link and see the different smart city solutions Walton already offers: https://linkmarket.aliyun.com/m/enterpriseDetails?supplierNo=144519971674#/Smart wasteSmart lighting (wifi hotspot / wireless charging)Smart fire hydrantSmart grain managementSmart garden managementIntelligent vehicle monitoringRFID ordinance management (aka military grade weapons tracking...)Smart sanitationRFID drug traceabilityAnd so on...
3	1523974251	9	Context! Thank you.
2	1523972788	15	Not supply chain logistics, IoT.The Internet of Things will truly change the world as we know it today. It will allow for a new much more efficient shared economy. It will be the next industrial revolution. When you combine that with blockchain you get the trustless aspect as well. Automation, trust, efficiency. A new better economy. Aggregate efficiency on a whole new level.
3	1523972903	7	Exactly... Waltonchain are trying to create the foundations for our Blockchain-IoT future. This will have endless possibilities! :D  
2	1523972727	12	IoT, Smart Stores, smart contracts, dApps, etc....
2	1523973140	7	Smart Cities will change the world and be good for the planet. Way to show off your lack of vision!
0	1523972592	36	WTC going to 10x again when people realize....Physical working product - RFIDLegit Use CaseCorporate/Government partnershipsOn schedule road mapMain.net just launchedGMN holders just got the biggest reward (current $$$ value wise) in crypto history - I could be wrong about this lolMother fucking ALIBABA!
1	1523979157	8	>Physical working product - RFIDThat's an understatement, I mean, I can make my own RFID chips at home, pretty sure I could buy the machine to do so on Amazon. Walton's physical tech is far more than just "RFID", if you look into it. 
1	1523973189	4	> GMN holders just got the biggest reward (current $$$ value wise) in crypto history - I could be wrong about this lolWouldnt this lower the price? Knowing that we will never be able to get a GMN again + knowing they will get a lot of airdrops too 
2	1523973559	18	1. This multi gmn holder would never sell this low.2. Someone said they sold their air drop to pay bills, and the order was eaten in less than a minute.No need to fear this, imo.
2	1523974487	11	same here multiple GMN holder, and I haven't sold my 700s either and won't, i could have sold my GMNs at 30 -  45 USD but its to of a low ball price for something that should have a multi billion market cap, these other projects that are just speculation or have no real world use cases right now are worth billions, WTC has a real world usecase in a trillion USD industry with the partnerships and connections to continue to get adopted 
2	1523973642	11	Well it certainly incentivizes me to continue pushing towards a MN, rewards should be just as good
3	1523974530	6	The real reward will be the increase in price in the years to come for WTC, mining will just be a bonus
3	1523975750	-2	Rewards for a MN depends on your mining farm. You'll need multiple ASIC's and a cool place to run them. Then continue to add or replace with better ones so you don't get overtaken by more powerful and bigger farms which reduces your mining income to hardly anything and then you're mining at a loss. 
4	1523976286	5	This is pure speculation, we don't have any concrete information on asics other than the fact that WTC will be rolling out proprietary units in the future
4	1523976496	3	PoST system hasn't been revealed yet.
2	1523974366	7	the airdrop went out a few days ago - price has held steady since the airdrop went out.Sure it's easy to think that people would sell their airdrops ASAP because hey why not, it's free money.On the other hand you need to consider that airdrops only went out to GMN hodlers. Do you really think the people who believe in this project the most are going to sell this far from the ATH? So far the market has demonstrated that GMNs are hodling strong. 
2	1523983538	2	GMNs held above $45 all the way down to >$10. Now that the rewards are out they should be freer to sell as long as they don't dip below 5k in their wallet but they're less likely to sell than an average holder particularly at this price point. They'd need to have long term confidence to buy the amount needed in early December and hold without selling.
1	1523972821	-11	Whatever makes you feel better
0	1523976231	9	When are we getting a pornhub partnership? ;P
1	1523981705	2	when WTC chips are integrated into porn actors. 
2	1523985804	3	New consensus algorithm announced... POTW = Proof of Thrust Work
3	1523986804	1	You forgot that walton is POTW+POS. Proof of steak. Take it as you will.
0	1523979606	4	I'm starting to get cross-eyed between Wanchain and Waltonchain. I hope I don`t screw up when trading. 
0	1523972647	6	> I would venture out and take a guess that Fujian province is the hardware Silicon Valley of China.No that would be Shenzhen. Fujian has been growing more because the President is from Fujian province. Xiamen has had some government support by hosting some big conferences.

1	1523974643	10	Top 4

0	1523978931	8	Good title!
1	1523981853	7	Down-voted you quite a bit earlier this morning, but this comment gets a +1 out of me. 🤪
2	1523986000	3	I knew he’d come around sometime. Lol Welcome to the team! I think it’s a great title too.
0	1523977210	4	"In April 2014, Xiamen Zhongchuan IOT Industry Development Co., Ltd. was formally established under the witness of the government's competent authority." I will leave this to your interpretation as to why they would explicitly state this! :)"- You realise this kind of language is pretty standard when incorporating a business in most countries, it just means the company has been incorporated legally. 
1	1523987840	1	Yep. That's exactly what it means
0	1523973274	-14	What actual proof is there that Xiamen Zhongchuan IoT Industrial Research Institute Co., Ltd is a Waltonchain subsidiary?There is no mention of Waltonchain or blockchain on their site. The "official" reason seems to be that "Chinese government doesn't want companies to be associated with blockchain".Also there are hundreds of other companies in that partnership, like someone pointed out in the last thread about this, this seems to be an industrial standards alliance rather than a commercial partnership. It is also not proof of the "parnership" with Alibaba Cloud, we still haven't heard anything about that after the tweet was deleted.
1	1523973980	10	Waltonchain will never be associated with non crypto companies unless China politics change. If dig deeper you will see all of the companies that are under the umbrella of Walton and this information is publically available. Also there are hundreds of other companies and a Walton subsidiary is ONE of them. Why would the amount of companies discredit the partnership/alliance? Also go list your company on the site if its so easy... I expect to see DoorbellGnome on there tomorrow.
2	1523973989	1	Hey, logohere, just a quick heads-up:  **publically** is actually spelled **publicly**. You can remember it by **ends with –cly**.  Have a nice day!^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
2	1523974496	-7	If it is and industrial standards alliance it doesn't mean that they are working together as partners.From what i read from the alliance site, it seemed like they had attended a conference that attracted hundreds of companies and they joined an alliance with hundreds of companies.Because it doesn't say what they are doing together if anything, it rises a concern that a company would only join the alliance to link their name with a big well known company, this is not that unusual in China.
3	1523975174	7	But Waltonchain hasn't announced anything about this. This was discovered by an inner group of researchers in the Slack group, and then a more enthusiastic member in the general chat decided to make a spontaneous post which caught fire. Hope that clears up your concern 
4	1523976404	-6	But the knights are involved with the team so they aren't really your average community members. As i understand they were planning the announcement on slack and vferr decided to go solo.
5	1523976593	10	DragonBallaf isn't a Knight. None of this was organised by the Knights. This is public information accessible to anyone who goes on the Alibaba website. I don't even know why the Knights were brought into this tbh. Agenda much? 
6	1523978771	-1	I didn't claim that he was.When i was still invested, the knights were the most active members of the community and i assumed that the ones that remain still are but it might have chanced by now since some of the knights have left the project.
1	1523973750	17	Lin Herui, a core member of the Waltonchain team, perhaps even the face of the company on the B2B side of things, is the dean (director) of the Xiamen Zhongchuan IoT Industry Research Institute, which is listed under his experience briefing on the team section of the Waltonchain website: https://www.waltonchain.org/en/team/He is one of our poster boys, and is incredibly well connected in the IoT industry. Besides that, Waltonchain directly addresses Zhongchuan IoT Research Institute as its subsidiary company in its articles. BTW this isn't about the Smart City partnership. Thats another thing entirely. This alliance is about establishing industry standards, creating cooperations, and promoting IoT. Zhongchuan IoT Industry Research Institute being a member of this is not only another step forward for Waltonchain, but it CLEARLY addresses the FUD that came about from the twittergate being that Waltonchain was a scam. This third party validation from Alibaba themselves of Zhongchuan IoT Industry Research Institute is what's important, as it shows they are aware of them and their situation. If there was any type of fraud or misleading statements in the article they posted, there is no way the Zhongchuan IoT Industry Research Institute would be involved in this alliance. I hope that kind of clears up why the Waltonchain community is excited, despite the further developments of cooperation between Alibaba and Zhongchuan which we were not aware of 
1	1523974326	5	Are you kidding? Stop being in denial. The proof is that it is.
0	1523975791	-18	[removed]
1	1523976500	9	Lin Herui, a core member of the Waltonchain team, is the dean (director) of the Xiamen Zhongchuan IoT Industry Research Institute which is the subsidiary that is working with Alibaba.But i'm never going to be able to reason with you am I, Stanklove? Since you'd have nothing else to do if you didn't have Walton to fud.P.s. this is a big deal and any other project would be writing posts about this level of integration with Alibaba.
2	1523976986	-13	You can think what you want. If you want to think that is a big deal then it's fine by me but it doesn't make my post untrue. At the end of the day we're all here to make money and if you think that WTC is the way to go, then good on you. Just don't go around spreading dishonest information and making mountains out of molehills, and not expect to not get called out. 
3	1523985476	2	The funny thing is when you look at his history the first thing you see is him shilling a Vechain Louis Vuitton partnership😂😂😂 typical reddit moron and scared Vechain investor.
3	1523977929	4	It's not a mountain out of a molehill. Please stop bashing a decent project just because you're bored. People who fuck with people's money for thrills are scum of the earth. 
1	1523976361	-5	This, pretty much. 
1	1523975933	-13	But that wouldn't pump the price and then they'll get stuck bagholding. Gotta always frame it to get the greater fool to buy.
0	1523974079	-21	This is not Waltonchain, it’s just a subsidiary. 
1	1523974674	10	Lin Herui, a core member of the Waltonchain team, is the dean (director) of the Xiamen Zhongchuan IoT Industry Research Institute which is the subsidiary that is working with Alibaba.This is listed under his experience briefing on the team section of the Waltonchain website:https://www.waltonchain.org/en/team/
1	1523975141	8	Waltonchain is not one single entity. It is comprised of many subsidiaries. By your logic then Onchain is not associated with Neo in any way. 
1	1523975261	8	So China Mobile Shenzen is not China Mobile? It's just a subsidiary? 
1	1523974504	14	I don't think you know what a subsidiary is..
1	1523983298	2	Dude SMH.. read the post.. Yeah it's a subsidiary 100% owned by the Waltonchain umbrella corporation 
0	1523973065	-28	why do all of these poorly written comments look like they were put together by bots?
1	1523974558	12	"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win." Even Mahatma Gandhi knows whats up.
2	1523979282	-5	He doesn't seem to be ignoring, laughing, nor fighting. It says nothing wrong about the actual project to point out that the WTC reddit community has it's share of shills, like every project.
3	1523985583	2	You’ve been quite cordial in this thread! I’ve upvoted all your comments, including this one. If you’re being reasonable, our community should be as well. If you can change...and I can change... everybody can change!! “Said in the voice of Rocky at the end of Rocky IV”... 😜Seriously...nice to see you in here with the comments you’ve made. Anyone who denies their project has shills...is just refusing to accept it. 👍
2	1523980922	-1	"First you do fake competition, then you forget to log out, then you reply, then you get rekt"
1	1523973364	14	like yours?
2	1523973555	-26	He is not wrong, they all look like poor English low effort responses made to puff WTC up.This is some advice from an average reader. Everyone with half a brain can tell these are shill comments. Get better at shilling and learn some English.
3	1523974352	17	You know you're out of fud when you start dissing OP's english.
4	1523975096	-9	Screenshot this whole thread and watch the price in the coming years.
3	1523975040	3	I only have a quarter of a brain but some of these comments actually look like people put thought into them.anyway the big takeaway here should be that the Alibaba partnership was real all along. omg I can't believe we won!
4	1523981977	-6	It is painful how obvious this is... Please be more subtle and people might listen to you more. If I didn't know better I would guess this is a conscious effort to keep people away from WTC.I used to hold WTC before. I was interested in the coin and I came to read here. But after I see what is going on here I am going to stay as far away from this coin as possible. It seems like you have hired children to do your shilling.These kinds of low effort posts are usually made by discord shills who accept small amounts of crypto for payments per comment. All that matters is that they make a post with positive words, they screenshot the proof and post it to discord to get their commission.To be fair you probably aren't even reading this because it doesn't matter to you.
5	1523982122	3	I am reading this... believe it or not I'm just a fan of this project
6	1523984641	-1	I'm not saying real fans don't exist, but the level of coordinated shilling on this board is starting to scare me. I wouldn't touch anything being shilled like this.TRX, DADI, WTC, VEN, LINK, all the same shitty shill projects.
5	1523986006	1	So you got cucked out of your position by price manipulators is what you are saying? 
6	1523987093	1	I bought in at 0.0016 and sold at 0.00225, so I made profit and I'm glad I sold. I've used this profit to move into other coins that don't have such a social media mess. If they stop shilling like children I may consider buying back, but so far all this shilling accomplishes nothing but scaring people like me away.Someone wrote earlier on CC that WTC is partnered with the government or is some government entity, they have since changed their post as it was easy to pick apart. They choose to use vague verbiage when it suits them and imply that the "partnership" is bigger than it is. The "partnership" with alibaba is actually a membership.I have been in crypto since 2014, I can smell desperate shilling from miles away upwind. There are many more small cap viable projects that will gain much more than WTC this year.
7	1523987464	1	Little known fact vferr (op of that thread) is a red headed step child that we constantly have to tell to shut up, and that none of this shilling is from Walton? And good for you on taking the money and leveling up. You a millionaire yet? Also, you get in on Devery yet?I got in Walton at $1.30. can't remember the Satoshi, it was like .00025 or something. You should check out Devery if you haven't already. Similarly priced, etc. 
8	1523988830	1	Thanks, just bought 100k.
9	1523988893	1	Dude. Definitely get 200k. It's what I got, and we should be doubled up.
3	1523985926	2	Wow. Such racist. Very racy. Ah shit, forgot to turn off my Doge bot.
4	1523986401	0	This has nothing to do with race. This is about using language effectively to not look like a shill.
5	1523986757	1	K. Well, thanks for the advice.
2	1523973564	-20	No, like the ones made by accounts completely dedicated to promoting one cryptocurrency and then acting like an independent source. Like you.
3	1523974666	11	A well researched and documented post about Waltonchain? Must be from a paid actor. No way a real investor out there would do such a thing....
3	1523977021	12	wait - what the fuck? people invested in this project are discussing it in this thread!? the outrage!
3	1523974238	16	You know you're out of fud when you start questioning whether OP is a robot.
1	1523979124	-1	not bots just the same group of people
