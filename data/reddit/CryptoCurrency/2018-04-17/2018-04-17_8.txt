0	1523964513	19	Seems that Barclays doesn’t know what it wants. Aren’t they the same ones who said that demand for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies had already passed its peak?
1	1523971161	9	Its hard to tell whats actually going on just because these "Crypto news sites" are such a shit show. The amount of times I've seen "Somebody familiar with the matter" as source is ridiculous.
1	1523972369	0	And why do you think they might have said that?Traditional financial markets are still manipulated, crypto markets are even worse.
0	1523966133	10	Lots of bullish news lately, new bullrun is imminent. 
1	1523969861	10	I feel it in my fingers...I feel it in my toes.

0	1523968358	2	They caught the 'virus'. At first they were all, 'I don't want your good damn pink eye!'
0	1523974622	4	Nooooo the whole point of CryptoCurrencies is to get away from the banks!
1	1523988076	1	Banks need more lambos, too
0	1523964997	1	Get with the times or, well, don't.
0	1523972221	1	Lots of mixed news lately. This would be good for the market overall but its just discussions like it says. Lets wait until it actually happens first. 
0	1523972935	1	Hope this is true.
0	1523977636	1	We regularly analyze developments in the digital currency space and will continue to have a dialog with our clients regarding their demands and expectations for this market.
0	1523984287	1	Money is money..... This is what banks care about.
0	1523972903	1	Last thing crypto needs is yet another exchange. There's already dozens of them. Besides, from the article, it looks like this was some sort of memo written by an intern proposing the idea.
0	1523976226	1	Isn't Stellar working with Barclays?
1	1523978507	1	If I read the fucking word "Partnership" one more time in relation to crypto I'm going postal.
2	1523979941	1	You might need stamps.
