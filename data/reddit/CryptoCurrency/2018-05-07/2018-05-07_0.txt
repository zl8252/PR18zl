1	1525687910	17	Axe also invested $1B in crypto.
2	1525700483	4	real life Axe, Steve Cohen has a lil scratch in it too i'm sure
2	1525707445	0	Source?
1	1525672593	18	Source? I'd like to see that.
2	1525673247	16	Showtime. 
3	1525695981	1	[deleted]
4	1525696918	3	No.. it’s showtime. 
3	1525673284	-7	Yeah, but do you have a YT link or something?
4	1525673589	9	The show aired a couple hours ago I personally can't find anything yet. 
5	1525680172	6	https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8hkvwz/billions_tv_show_references_cryptocurrency_and/?st=JGVYJS86&sh=01ff03fc
3	1525697653	-6	... hbo actually
1	1525679697	6	How is that show? Is it good?
2	1525685033	14	Loved it when it started, have had some trouble loving the later storylines. Overall, it is a wonderful take on the tech industry.
3	1525703145	3	I think there was a bit of a lull in S2 and maybe first couple of eps in S3 but I really like where the show is at right now.  It's got my full attention at the moment, going to watch the latest episode tonight.
3	1525704558	2	Yea I agree season one and two are gold. Now it’s pandering to a general crowd and is slowly losing/lost what made it special and great. Imo
4	1525713346	1	It's the equation of - Something good happens...lets see how (Insert main character here) screws it up - getting tired. It worked for a bit since the characters involved are somewhat endearing but the novelty wears off.
3	1525698713	2	Yes your right it shows off how people are been manipulated by the tech industry as employees and also as consumers. 
2	1525684066	1	It's not bad.
2	1525707263	1	Billions is unbelievable good!
3	1525707363	2	In what way?
1	1525673736	3	somehow I missed this part then - any clue which episode?
2	1525674555	4	The one that aired today
3	1525676000	2	ah, ok - I haven't started with s3 as of now. Thanks
4	1525677068	-18	How he fuck did you get through season 2, it was total garbage ~~composed~~ compared to season 1..Edit: don't worry, nerds, downvotes make it suck less.
5	1525677326	5	nah, I found it fine really
5	1525682527	2	Kinda lost me season 2 , but season 3 has some more plot to it 
1	1525676987	0	I didn't see it but if you do that use a  Open Dime. Only safe option to trustlessly transfer funds in the real world. 
0	1525667344	123	Here is the PowerPoint: http://www.piedpiper.com/app/themes/pied-piper/dist/images/Gilfoyle_s_Crypto_PowerPoint_-_Digital_Edition.pdfMy favorite excerpt: "There is a 98.745% chance of making 100x profit"EDIT: Oh man, you should also check out the main page of the website. They even have a ticker:PPC   PiedPiperCoin   $0.07 USD   Market Cap: $94,500   Volume: $7.14PPC, of course, is Peercoin: https://peercoin.net/ (too late)
1	1525668512	82	“It’s not about buying lambos, it’s about a decentralized economy” man I really wish the vast majority of CC thought this way. 
2	1525669758	17	It's a lot better than it was around January, time to get back in the game I guess 
2	1525672157	4	Sounds like the Goodomy approach. (Otherwise known as GOOD thinking)
2	1525689729	3	It will slowly get to that point.  Right now people realize it's highly speculative so they just care about making toilet paper.
2	1525694496	3	The people who do aren't the ones posting daily in the daily thread about every movement of price.
2	1525672879	6	I wish that too. But unfortunately there are more "investors" in here than actual tech educated people. Because of that you will only hear repeated marketing bullshit in this subreddit instead of actual real substance.  I enjoy EthDev subreddit as people in there only talk about software dev for eth and sometimes other technologies. No lambo talk. I would recommend it.
3	1525696912	2	That's a funny way to spell gambler. 
4	1525698650	1	All innovators are gamblers
5	1525700641	3	lunkheads leveraging their mortgage to buy crypto are not innovators, or investors - they are gamblers.
6	1525709302	1	Not everyone dumping money is leveraging their mortgage. I have dumped 16k, no leveraging debt, just single with a good job. If it goes to 0, well that sucks but it's not the end of the world, just the end of lambos.
7	1525709774	1	oooh, look an innovator!!
2	1525708914	1	Why? Bitcoin would only be worth 2 dollars and adoption would be miniscule if that was the case.The incentive to earn money is what brings attention and money to the market. The technology and ideas behind it is what it gets them to stay. Trust me, the profit seekers are good because the more that come, the more that staySure some will leave and never come back. But as long as those who stick around continued to grow - there are more people staying around and helping to give it value and legitimacy as a currency
1	1525675444	13	Of course peercoin is up 9% because of this
1	1525670694	4	Thanks for this. I was hoping to see the rest of the power point.
1	1525673281	5	Ha, I was hoping for some screen caps but they put the entire presentation up, that's pretty awesome.Also if you missed out on the Pied Piper ICO, you can always stock up on Peid Piper Tokens: https://peidpiper.com :-D
1	1525678233	4	This is actually a really good summary of crypto that my parents could understand. 
1	1525667734	2	Love the last slide! 
1	1525673393	2	Have a link to the piedpipercoin white paper?
1	1525668052	1	Thanks! You are the real hero.
1	1525692929	1	> PPC, of course, is Peercoin: https://peercoin.net/        They *really* need to revise the voiceover work in that [“What Is Peercoin?” video on their intro page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tra0vmparI). I don’t know if it’s because I watched it under context of a comedy show like *Silicon Valley*, or if the narrator actually has an ironic tone, but the majority of the video came across as a parody of crypto, haha, just because of the guy’s inflections.      It sounded like he was making fun of how many coins/tokens there are out there, blind investors, and major fears of crypto users. (The really robotic, cartoon graphics/sounds didn’t help much either, haha.) Kinda reminded me of the product advertisements found in those old Fallout games. I had to look up Peercoin on CryptoCompare and CMC just to be 100% it was an actual thing — not a knock on the technology itself or anything, just the tongue-in-cheek that intro video gave me.      P.S. – About Peercoin itself though, there were some facets of the tech described in that video that reminded me a little bit of IOTA; would you happen to know if they are competitors or even just overlap each other a bit? Sorry for the immediate “coin vs coin”-type question, haha — I’m just a long term holder and haven’t been keeping up with new hot topic coins or anything for a while, and I don’t have time to go through their whitepaper or anything until later tonight probably. You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to, but just thought I’d get a “nutshell” response to that question while I’m here. Thanks for the consideration :)
2	1525710556	1	Peercoin was very cool back in the day. It had it's era and it's done. It invented Proof of Stake and it was like the 6th or 7th cryptocurrency ever. And that was at a time where all the remaining cryptocurrencies (except maybe Namecoin maybe) shared like 99% codebase of Bitcoin and had nothing really new. Whereas peercoin had PoS.It defines deserves credit for inventing proof of stake but that was about it. No users, no further development and it died down. 
1	1525693183	1	How relevant that powerpoint can really be as a summary of what is crypto?
1	1525694199	1	i had no idea they didn’t use money in the bronze age. age of empires lies to me. 
1	1525707761	1	Thanks! Deck is ace 
0	1525667238	137	God this episode was so fucking good. I lost it at this line:“I have a PowerPoint I’ve been wanting to show you for some time”-every crypto investor to family or friends who ask about crypto. Myself included.
1	1525690452	40	Alright mom, so listen up. What do you know about apes using teeth of other apes as a way of getting more bananas?. Cause that's where the history of Bitcoin really starts. You see before there was money there was gold and before there was ...... ..... (9 hours later) ... and that's why it's so important to realize that one dogecoin will always be one dogecoin. ...mom?...*is she still breathing?*  
2	1525690752	4	This is so me it’s painful. Hilarious 
3	1525690858	8	But she will always love you even it you bought a shitcoin. 
1	1525700217	1	Post the ppt if you can. Id love to show some people too
2	1525704054	8	http://www.piedpiper.com/app/themes/pied-piper/dist/images/Gilfoyle_s_Crypto_PowerPoint_-_Digital_Edition.pdf
3	1525705515	5	That was pretty good. 97.45% chance of x100 gains, where do I sign up?
0	1525664130	154	From the first episode of the season you know it was going to be crypto heavy. Pretty cool to see.
1	1525678983	21	They added coinbase to the intro, was obvious. 
2	1525706462	9	They also added oculus but the vr plotline was short lived
3	1525714281	1	As has been the move towards VR so far. Slow, has legs, but not ready for primetime just yet.
1	1525673498	8	I was really hoping for that since last fall. :D 
0	1525662249	137	Such a funny show.. though I do miss Ehrlich this season
1	1525666301	136	yeah the Erlich v Jin Yang feud was one of my favorite parts of this show :/
2	1525668045	103	Erich Bachman, Dis is you *as ole mahn.*
3	1525671214	36	Dis is ya motha...and you are not my baby.
4	1525694503	7	Which one is for burning?
2	1525667810	31	Jian YAAAAAANG!!!!!!!!!
3	1525676863	15	MOTHER FUCK
2	1525670302	32	Errich Bachman, is your refrigerator running? This is a Mike Hunt.
1	1525672694	19	It's just not the same since Ehrlich left... writing seems off as well.
2	1525678733	32	They folded the stupid from big head and Ehrlich into Dinesh
3	1525701455	3	i think that really happened back during piperchat.  silly shit, that was.
2	1525679787	5	Kicked out*
1	1525670311	3	Yeah, but what he did was incredibly stupid.  People like that should not be given a spotlight.
1	1525667501	1	This season has been worse top to bottom, unfortunately. The story lines aren't interesting and the jokes are getting stale. 
2	1525671060	68	respectfully I disagree, I've enjoyed this season so much more than last season
3	1525695254	7	Yeah this seasons pacing has been great. 
3	1525704966	3	I can't believe all the people that miss Erlich. I'm super glad he is gone.
4	1525707798	0	Yeah his whole schtick got real old. Plus he's not a good person irl
2	1525668314	14	Yeah I agree in-part. Still one of the better (if only) comedies I watch, but they really are beating a dead horse with a number of jokes.
2	1525693166	4	I watched but didn't enjoy everything after season 2. Writing felt pretty repetitive.
2	1525679906	13	This is the best season to date. IMHO.
2	1525672439	12	Happens with every US TV series. The execs milk it till all joy and humor had been rinsed out of it, then it's discarded like an empty husk, forever tainted by its bland demise.Other countries seem to know when to call it a day.
2	1525701719	2	You didn't like Jared's lips lol?
2	1525692317	1	Oh no way, this is almost as good as season 2.
2	1525711088	1	I've been thinking the same but I'm wondering if its less about the writing and more about the changing world. The tech industry is past being self aware and I'm not sure if the show is keeping up with the times. Its almost as if its 10 years behind where the bay area industry is currently. 
3	1525711533	1	I can't really comment on that. I liked the show because it was funny while being a compelling story. It's losing the former and has seemingly lost the latter.
2	1525700530	-2	Im with you. I don't get the people that think its improved since removing the funniest character on the show while making the other ones some how worse.
3	1525703229	1	It's not even that. The earlier season it was make or break. The story was compelling. Now, it's just another feud between Gavin Belsin. They tried to make Jin Yang this threat, but it obviously didn't work. Especially after 3 seasons of him being an afterthought. Dinesh and Gilfoyle's rivalry is so forced now. It was way better when it was just Dinesh hating Gilfoyle, and Gilfoyle not reciprocating at all.In all, I feel the show is treading water. Entourage suffered the same fate back in the day. They all "made it." It was much better when it was make or break and they were working out of their garage. 
1	1525679761	2	He got kicked out of the Show and Deadpool for doing some serious messed up stuff. Just read his wikipage. 
2	1525688420	2	Look under the heading "legal issues"
2	1525713948	1	I thought he was still in Deadpool 2, what did they end up doing reshoots or something?
3	1525714455	1	He got kicked out for Deadpool 3. 
1	1525709111	1	I stopped watching when he left the show. Those who kept watching, was this a mistake? Worth getting back into it?
1	1525713855	1	Yea well the actor of Ehrlich is a terrible person so we're better off without him
1	1525715546	1	I actually don't. I'm absolutely loving this season I think he's been phoning it in for a while.
0	1525665399	33	It also shows the very very risky side of crypto as well. Overall very excited about the exposure nonetheless 
1	1525697810	12	Oh man. Digging through the dump to find a pair of jeans with a thumb drive in it worth 300m. I carry around my ledger in my work backpack. The ledger is worth more than the crypto stored on it, but still I immediately felt stupid. 
2	1525698457	5	_And that's why you leave a note._
3	1525698858	3	You hear about the new season and season 4 remix my man?
4	1525700794	1	Yessir
4	1525715019	1	The remix one was way better IMO. I wonder how much new footage they shot for it, there were definitely scenes i didnt remember from the original. 
2	1525711253	1	This is why you write down the seed words and password.  There are no coins stored on a ledger anymore than on a thumb drive.  Wallets only contain the private key that owns coins on the public blockchain.I love the show, but it was stupid when Big Bang Theory's story had the guys losing a thumb drive "full of coins" and now PP character losing a thumb drive with $300m on it.  It just fuels more fear in those who have yet to get into crypto.  Write down the words and you will never worry about losing a ledger or thumb drive again.
3	1525712510	1	That's kind of what I took away from this episode, or assumed at least. Russ had the seed stored on a thumb drive since, like you said, you can't exactly download crypto on a thumb drive.
4	1525712916	1	That's what you and I took away.  The average non-crypto person was taught, incorrectly, that the physical device is much more important and flawed than it is.  True, if one doesn't write down the correct info to recover a wallet, then losing a hard drive or removable device would be the end of it.  They should at least mention that he can't recover the wallet because of no seed words.
5	1525713312	1	I see your point. It could have been an easy line to slip in there.
0	1525671875	27	Coinbase board member Barry Schuler is a technical adviser to the show :)
1	1525707086	2	PiedPiperCoin getting listed on coinbase confirmed?
0	1525685006	10	I knew it :D  [https://etherscan.io/token/0x679423731ec1df3be6e7386d5821b9bfce376c92](https://etherscan.io/token/0x679423731ec1df3be6e7386d5821b9bfce376c92)4 hours ago..
0	1525693084	14	* I'm reading a post about Gilfoyle, the satanist of the show* I'm reading a post on CryptoCurrency for the first time* I subscribe, this subreddit has 666k subscribers.* All hail the antichrist
0	1525662582	23	And what were his points, exactly?
1	1525664832	76	The guy picked the worst part to show points-wise... Literally right after this he goes into a power-point describing the origins of money and the definition of an ideal asset from Aristotle in 350 BC; fungibility, inherent value, scarcity, etc. The other dude stops him and is like "Can we jump ahead about 2000 years, I know what Bitcoin is". The guy shown then details a lot of the benefits of having an ICO vs. traditional VC - who is going to fund their series B, but has ill-intent. Yada yada, they do the ICO. The whole episode was honestly great exposure, and the season arch has increasingly moved more towards decentralization as it has progressed. (They're attempting to build a decentralized internet).
2	1525667251	7	Is this only on HBO? Or is it somewhere else? I haven’t really seen it 
3	1525667979	9	Yes hbo
3	1525671354	14	Torrent is your BFF. 
4	1525683073	2	Torrent shows and then buy DVDs when available
5	1525683660	9	Hey, it's not the people who live outside the States' fault we can't legally watch it 
6	1525701591	3	hbo is available outside the united states, but your point does still have merit.Edit: https://hbowatch.com/which-countries-is-hbo-available-in/
7	1525703742	1	This is the part that confused meI know the Norwegians have HBO Nordic, but here in the UK we have Sky or Now TV, and they only show it at certain times in the year
2	1525672763	1	and ICO fails miserably.
3	1525713537	1	for this episode. According to the preview for the next episode, it looks like someone buys up the token and 51% attacks them, which should be funny. 
0	1525667806	12	if only they treated the ico like a real ico where they try to gather the $30 mil they wanted. Not just go straight to a coin and from there 7 cents. lol. Besides that, I was fine with everything else crypto related on the episode.
1	1525670456	27	If it was a real ICO they would have ended up selling 300 millions in 15 minutes.
2	1525701633	-1	and then walked away with all the money
1	1525674904	6	real world their $0.07 coin would have prolly hit exchanges at like $0.28 and dumped down to $0.07 from there in a day or two before taking off. that would have been fun to watch too
2	1525705705	1	real world they would already have 100 mil in their pocket already also
1	1525711509	2	Agreed.  They build up the idea of launching an ICO but then don't do it.  Those who don't know about such things probably didn't notice and don't care.  But it seemed strange, given the writers obviously did research into ICOs.
2	1525711607	1	yea exactly. Didn't really make any sense. Richard could have fucked up the Series B 20 other ways but they chose to do it the ICO route without even doing it correctly. smh
0	1525664795	23	can't hear shit
1	1525687958	3	He will defend damn cryptocurrency.
0	1525667354	10	This was a close to a crypto infomercial as I could have hoped for, especially in the way Gilfoyle explains it to Richard.
0	1525685014	4	Where can i invest in that ICO? 
1	1525692855	5	Pied Piper is based on SAFE network by MaidSafe.  Some of the MaidSafe team members are listed in the credits as technical advisors.  Their token is MAID.
2	1525692905	5	Haha nice new new internet

0	1525688101	3	the best season so far!
0	1525696131	3	Could never have imagined cryptocurrency and satanism fitting so comfortably in the same sentence.
0	1525697227	3	This is me. 
1	1525702926	2	We are all the Gilfoyle.
0	1525697814	3	Wow, is this TV show about crypto??
1	1525697978	5	It is now
0	1525699355	3	Bitcoin has been mentioned since season 2 or 3. I should have paid attention and bought low:(  
0	1525700015	3	anyone have a link to his powerpoint?
1	1525711663	1	On the piedpiper.com website:http://www.piedpiper.com/app/themes/pied-piper/dist/images/Gilfoyle_s_Crypto_PowerPoint_-_Digital_Edition.pdf
0	1525665648	12	Uh, are you sure they're not making fun of crypto and the type of person that is typically into it?
1	1525667422	22	Well his character most of the time ends up being right about everything.  I mean, they kind of make fun of everything. But if they were really making fun of it they probably would have had Big Head (character who is constantly stumbling into success by accident) be heavily invested.
2	1525678913	9	Or even Dinesh, like the Tesla jokes.
3	1525707405	2	Man they really know how to turn a semi funny character into an annoying piece of shit.. the tesla bits were too cringe for my liking to where its not even funny. I love this show, one of my all time favorites but this season is a little wonky.. or is it just me? Makes me sad boi.
4	1525707587	3	The whole Tesla piece and the spy thread were poorly done.
4	1525711214	1	Dinesh is the 'cringe humor' character it seems. Always has been. 
1	1525678876	4	Gilfoyle has been shown to be consistently right and saving their ass.
1	1525667161	2	Not at all, seen every episode
1	1525677803	2	They're not, especially since it's part of the arc that their company now depends on this ICO to succeed so we'll probably see it do just that in the next episode or episodes.
0	1525700158	2	Rah it was fantastic!
0	1525700313	2	It’s SATIRE, ffs!

1	1525670794	1	Yo dude comedy is only funny if it's true. Who are your fav comedians and shows? Keep that in mind when viewing.
2	1525686707	1	That's not true. Have you never watched Creflo A. Dollar?
3	1525701913	1	Haven't seen it, usually comedy is at least reflecting some basic truths. I'll check it out tho .
2	1525670963	-4	Yeah crypto is a joke. I laughed 
3	1525671012	3	Looks like you're the joke trolling in a crypto sub. Now I laugh at you. Hahaha.
4	1525671308	-1	Good you could probably use a laugh

0	1525683348	1	good job
0	1525684158	1	What's the bit about Satan and Tyranny about?
1	1525685995	3	that's part of that characteras a general instinct he is prone to rebelling against what the general populace does. he practices leveyan satanism which is a fake religion with the purpose of exposing christianity as harmful>Practitioners do not believe that Satan literally exists and do not worship him. Instead, Satan is viewed as a positive archetype representing pride, carnality, and enlightenment. He is also embraced as a symbol of defiance against Abrahamic religions which LaVeyans criticize for suppressing humanity's natural instincts and encouraging irrationalityfrom wikipedia
0	1525695293	1	You neglected to mention that it all utterly failed on the episode. 
1	1525695419	2	I have a feeling Mcafee is going to PnD them
0	1525698651	1	Very good!! Love the show!
0	1525700081	1	Blacklist mentioned Bitcoin multiple times throughout the series. Red uses it multiple times for his money transfers and in fact there was an entire episode where there was a problem because his finance guy got killed and they couldnt access it anymore without the seed.
0	1525706004	1	I fear ICOs will become even more competitive to enter now that everyone with an hbo subscription knows what they are. But that’s just my greed talking.  
0	1525709449	1	Satan as a metaphor against tyranny? I'm atheist but please FFS do NOT let this catch on. That's just straight up fucking stupid right there. 
0	1525709467	1	It's literally the plot device used to explain how they're still fucking up despite having some world-changing technology. 
0	1525709846	1	All for crypto adoption, but they are forcing it on the show. It was almost cringe worthy to watch. 
1	1525709938	1	I don’t think it’s too bad
0	1525710557	1	Checked my portfolio hoping for a bounce but no such luck. At this rate I'll never be the Tesla guy in my household. 
0	1525711039	1	You know it is not going to end well for them right? These things never seem to end well in the show. 
1	1525713162	1	What’s the worst thing that could happen to your fresh new ICO?
0	1525711316	1	Does anyone have a source for this particular clip? I can not say definitively, but it is just about identical to a clip i posted to FB last night. 😂 Would be pretty amazed if it was mine. #privacysettings #nothingsacred 
1	1525711412	1	They would need to have travelled into the future to steal your line.
2	1525711504	1	I'm saying the clip of the show.
3	1525711592	1	Lol my bad brother. Thought you were on Gilfoyles medical marijuana
4	1525711681	1	🤣🤣🤣 I wish. No marijuana for the law enforcement community.
1	1525712725	1	This came off of my phone, and was posted to Facebook as well. I recorded my TV right after I heard it. 
2	1525712812	1	Lmao my clip is a hair longer , has Richard saying "Bitcoin!" 
3	1525712944	1	Mine was a bit longer but I trimmed it before uploading. It’s insane that that two people had two identical clips of the same exact show. /s
4	1525713144	1	Great minds think alike they say
0	1525712872	1	This is glorious! Hail Weed and Crypto!
1	1525712958	1	And Satan 
0	1525713561	1	where I can buy PPC? Or they are doing ICO?
0	1525687835	1	This is not good for crypto. We need to build up the ecosystem and for that we can't have another hype pulling people in who just see it as speculation. First the infrastructure, THEN the goldrush. 
1	1525697124	1	Disagree.The more people who are in, the more money we all make, and the faster adoption gets here.Why can't the ecosystem be built while people are pumping money into it? Sounds like a good thing to me.
2	1525701872	1	Because they won't hold it or use it. They are in it for the speculation. Meaning that at some point, the herd will get spooked and stampede on out. Trampling a lot of hard work in the process...And it will be very hard to convince them to give crypto another try.

0	1525680315	0	Fucking yes - love it.
0	1525664676	-5	Can someone explain why their ICO could be be worth only 7 cents and so quickly? Am I missing something here? Don't they dictate the value of the coin before it even launches on any exchanges? 
1	1525665016	29	Dude it’s fucking tv
1	1525665012	18	It's a comedy tv series, relax.
2	1525665953	3	If you're wondering how he eats and breathes  And other science facts (la-la-la)  Just repeat to yourself "It's just a show,  I should really just relax"  
3	1525666318	2	for mystery science theater3000
4	1525667301	2	That show was my jam. Love it
3	1525700230	1	Big Head had a 7-11 big gulp in one scene. The pied piper team went to dinner and never ate.#science
1	1525665699	4	How much was Ethereum when it launched? How much is it now? How much was EOS when it began its ICO? How much is it now? The market and demand always dictate price.From their stated numbers, they have a circulating supply of 441,176. For it to be $0.07, the marketcap would only be around $30,000... believable for a company which in the show raised millions in funding? Probably not. Comedic value on a fictional show? Yes. But it also could have been seconds / minutes after a no-hype release; the coin will likely increase as they go and navigate all the problems around facing a 51% attack, etc. etc.
0	1525673439	-2	Actually disappointed by this episode. They should have easily cleared $1B.    Also, Hanneman was disappointing.. How can you get scammed from your own ICO??
0	1525666927	-1	Where can I watch this without HBO?
1	1525668777	2	Only on HBO, but they have streaming. You can get a month free though and plow through the episodes... They are hilarious and worth watching.I mean, of course you could pirate it too. More hassle than it is worth though these days.

0	1525702409	0	just a little mention but well, at least they try.
1	1525702797	4	The entire episode was about them doing an ICO
1	1525711549	1	Episode was literally called “Initial coin offering”
0	1525706310	0	Ah shit I missed this episode!
0	1525710224	0	They also mention aliens on the X-Files, another fictional show. Guess we should all invest in alien defense now.
0	1525677153	-3	They want you nerds to watch the show.. that's all. You're being played.
1	1525697322	1	So the show Silicon Valley, which is about a bunch of nerds starting a company, is trying to attract nerds to watch it?I for one am shocked and appalled.
0	1525661674	-61	God that show looks insufferable. 
1	1525661882	35	That show is amazing imo, it has 98% on rotten tomatoes as well.
1	1525662794	8	Honestly, that particular character is probably the best in the show.Virtually every programmer character in the show aside from the main cast is insufferable.  Unnecessarily jerkoffish about everything and always disrespectful, which really makes the show unbelievable much of the time because you’ll have 25 year old programmers arrogantly talking down to someone equivalent to Steve Jobs (eg Gavin Belsin).
2	1525667515	0	Gilfoyle isn't a jerk?? wut
2	1525669132	0	I went to see Dan Larimer speak (EOS), and he hung around after to answer questions. The ~20 year old in front of us dropped a notepad from the stack of stuff he was holding as he asked DL some irrelevant bullshit. Then I watched this innovative and *extremely* wealthy guy bend over and pick up this kid's stuff without a shred of recognition. I mean, it wasn't just a missing "thanks." Dude didn't even flinch and just rolled through his nonsense.
1	1525661789	11	It’s actually one of my favorites.
1	1525662167	19	It's actually pretty good, it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but let's say you prefer "The Big Bang" nerdy to this, you should be put down.
2	1525665728	5	lol amen
1	1525666653	2	It's pretty good, though I will say season 4 (the previous one) was a little too repetitive 
1	1525665098	4	Umm mike judge who did office space created it. One of the funniest shows I’ve seen. You must be from fucking some bobo country where humor isn’t a good thing. 
1	1525663411	2	It's getting formulaic and the best character was acted by a weirdo who had to leave. But still enjoyable. The first season is by far the best, and definitely worth a shot.
1	1525663002	-20	It’s a big circle jerk show here on reddit hence your downvotes, which is unfortunate 
2	1525663488	9	It's almost like it's actually a good show that a large number of people watch and enjoy.You mean, people who view HBO are allowed to use a website such as Reddit to freely express their views? The blasphemy!
3	1525663623	-11	You mean people who watch HBO and don’t enjoy the show aren’t allowed to freely express their views on Reddit? Because by down-voting a post into oblivion is doing just that.
4	1525664790	6	Calm down hipster we get it your different 
4	1525664270	3	So you've seen every single episode and can judge it fairly? I honestly highly doubt that. And even if you had, you're still part of what is evidently a small minority - this is not merely on Reddit by the way. However, while on Reddit, things get downvoted based on merit; choosing to downvote a post into oblivion isn't a circle-jerk, or being against free speech... it's expressing one's opinion, which ultimately adds up.Shows like Silicon Valley and Westworld are huge on Reddit, as well as in popular culture. They are critically acclaimed and highly rated for a reason. You can sure as hell dislike them (though I believe it's unfair to do so without properly viewing something in its entirety), but if you voice your opinion and get rekt by downvotes, it doesn't mean you should cry about something being a merit-less circle-jerk. Btw, if you support crypto in the slightest, you would not be bitching about the decentralized-focus of this show's current season.
5	1525664724	-2	I’ve seen every episode and it’s pretty average imo.  Cyclical plotlines and poorly written tertiary characters just leave me annoyed mostly.  Westworld is on a whole other level compared to Silicon Valley.
6	1525665286	1	The cyclical failing and then bouncing back is the main problem I actually do have with the show. I was glad T.J. Miller left, because it forced them to change things up for the first time in a long time.Westworld is one of my favourite shows of all time, but that said, they are extremely different and tough to compare. Silicon Valley is a nerd's dream, and imo fills the niche better than anything else out there. I recently watched Halt and Catch Fire after shrugging it off years ago; it's an incredible show as well, and offers a much more grounded tech-centred experience. Honestly though, the zany and dark humour of Judge, along with some great performances, is what makes SV unique.
0	1525692000	-4	I wonder why he has use so much cuss word with Cryptocurrecy. I am sure that wasnt warranted.
1	1525712019	1	That's how his character is.  It would be strange if he didn't swear when talking about satan and/or crypto.

0	1525673596	-1	Yup, crypto is starting to get written into tv shows and movies. Watch the new trailer for Superfly, they mention it in there too. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQIvV800Atk (0:46)

0	1525665306	-14	Silicon Valley just isn't as a good as it used to be, it seems to just be spinning wheels because it is profitable.
1	1525668980	2	As is typical for any show. The original idea is hard to keep fresh and the best ideas are used most up. The first couple seasons were phenomenal. Recently not as good, but still better than most TV in my book.
