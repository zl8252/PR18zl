0	1525664335	238	There’s a lot of WB hate in here. He’s allowed to dislike the idea of crypto. There are a lot ways up the same mountain.He’s a value investor. He invests in companies that have an earnings history and gives them an approximate dollar value of what the company is worth. He then waits for the price to drop below that value and buys.And he’s the best ever at doing this.Of course he hates crypto which is purely speculative (at this stage, anyway)
1	1525666291	68	This.  I just hate how ppl will say "Warren Buffet says crypto is bad" and use that for their own opinions.Personally, I would just say what I think but disclaim that "I don't know shit about this".  Buffet missed almost every single big tech stock, I don't fault him for this at all, however it should show that his area isn't tech related therefor his opinions on crypto shouldn't be worshiped by the masses.
2	1525667928	-8	And yet He is one of The richest and powerfull ppl On Earth and is Best friend with one of The Biggest tech person ( Bill Gates). Dont under estimate The thing He says. You might not agree with him and He might be worng But He has some valid points, that He sticks to. Remember He doesnt need that 3000% return with insane risk. He just keep is filosofi and win Big On other stuff that he is good at.
3	1525669144	15	where did I say any of that?I said he's good in his lane, he's missed almost every tech opportunity though therefore his advice on the value of tech stuff shouldn't be so highly worshiped as he put his money where his mouth was (and lost him a ton of potential profit)He never got into google or apple till after the hype, not a bad thing... 
4	1525678235	2	>He never got into google or apple till after the hype, not a bad thing...Exactly.  When he could make a decision based on financials, rather then speculating on the potential of the technology.He makes money buying undervalued companies with solid financials, not by betting on horses.
5	1525679622	2	Yea, and I never said that's a bad thing, simply that's his style.If crypto was established and "undervalued" and he has experience in it then his opinion should be closely watched.I'm just saying I'm not sure why so much stock is given to his opinion when he's missed so many things before. (aka listening to him about apple, google, amzn, etc years back would have you missing opportunity) 
3	1525668679	-5	He had not studied crypto and admits itHe knowsIt can replace many of his financial interestsFact is grandpa b hates competitionCrypto can displace many of his businesses
4	1525668733	12	Tell me how it Can replace Coca cola and trains or even apple ?
5	1525669022	7	IIRC he's holding some big bags in banks lol
6	1525669117	4	Ye He has a large Capital laying around But i would be insane to put it into crypto, The risk/reward is insane here, and He is a conservativ investor :)
7	1525669513	0	for sure, I'm more than happy he has a style of investing that works.  Exactly my point is that I'm not going to go knocking his investments cause I know nothing about them/how they work.
8	1525672578	1	Ye, But Its not buffet that is making The question when He is interviewed :) so some times He is kinda forced to Take an oppions On subject that doesnt interrest him
9	1525673619	-1	No wb and munger look like banker stooges after this weekendWhich is what i alreadyKnew anyway
4	1525675429	3	Him admitting he hasn't studied it may still mean he knows a lot more about it than the average Joe here. No offense, Joe.
5	1525698874	1	its like pretending the average joe knew more than elvis at the timethat rock music is doomed. I guarantee it!
1	1525669179	14	He also doesn't invest in commodities or currencirs of any kind. And he advises against bonds. He has a rather narrow view of what makes a good investment, but has been amazing at evaluating those investments.
2	1525671258	7	The difference is that he understands commodities, currencies, and bonds, so his strong opinions there make sense.  With crypto, he readily admits lack of knowledge, but then has a strong opinion anyway.  People are just pointing out this inconsistency, which I think is a fair one.
3	1525707374	3	And yet, if he truly understood crypto he still wouldn't like it.
2	1525712581	0	Not entirely true.http://www.silvermonthly.com/analyzing-warren-buffetts-investment-in-silver/
1	1525669020	3	He says before that he doesn’t invest in something’s he doesn’t understand so it makes sense if he doesn’t fully understand crypto so he’s staying away from it.
1	1525703069	2	Read his book, it has little to do with value investing. His father was a US senator with  a huge amount of contacts. Warren Buffet would have been nothing without his families political connections. Most of his money was made with hostile takeovers. Read about his takeover many of the newspaper companies, he is cold, to clients, employees, friends and family. He strong armed his own friends into not investing into things he wanted control over. This guy grew up spoiled. 
1	1525686605	1	Funny stuff...and the old man is not a speculator?
1	1525710433	0	Warren Buffet is absolutely allowed to dislike the idea of Crypto.  The problem is he seems to state this publicly bi-weekly.  We get it.  Warren Buffet doesn't think Crypto is a good investment.  However he is old as fuck.  Like I've said before have you ever tried explaining the way the internet works or how cell phones work to a 90 year old senior citizen?  They just don't understand it.  The fact he keeps spouting his bullshit every couple of weeks is irritating to the community.  Congratulations old man you made your fortune trading rocks but step aside because this technology > rocks.
2	1525711160	1	You sure seem offended by Buffet's opinions, maybe you shouldn't invest so much emotion into crypto?
3	1525711325	-3	That's my opinion on this dinosaur offering his advice towards technology he can't even begin to fathom.  I'm far from emotionally attached to my investments, in fact I've been +2500% through this entire 'bear market' you all have been crying about.  Nice try though.  Maybe you could try parting with your Crypto to trade some rocks based on your idols advice?
4	1525711672	1	So much hostility, clearly you aren't emotional over it all. Whatever you say buddy.
5	1525712136	-3	Ah yes, a bubble wrapped child who considers my comment hostile.  Don't forget to take your feelings and discuss them in a safe place, ok?
1	1525694598	-6	I use to think that too but it's becoming apparent: He's a greedy capitalist that exploits consumer ignorance. Denouncing crypto is a just disrespect to the young generation, it's like saying rap music is wrong without listening to it.  Do you think new investors and kids today are going to want to invest in stocks, ETFs, and bonds? Wait 30-40 years to see a return? Crypto is so easy to understand and the platform framework infrastructure being built, is making it so much easier for kids to trade, transmit and buy it. Crypto fundamentally educates retail investors in how to move money. He represents the greedy capitalist movement that has destroyed the American economy by keeping investors dumb. He is rat poison squared. To shill his own investments he owns, is just plain pathetic. 
2	1525706648	9	How did this ignorant shit get upvoted? >He's a greedy capitalist that exploits consumer ignorance.Buffett is a value investor; his investment strategies don't 'exploit consumer ignorance' unless you consider extensive due diligence to identify stocks the market undervalues to be exploitative. He's not making money at the expense or well-being of someone else.  >Crypto is so easy to understandNot really.>the platform framework infrastructure being built, is making it so much easier for kids to trade, transmit and buy it.This is not necessarily a good thing.>Crypto fundamentally educates retail investors in how to move money.No, it really doesn't.>He represents the greedy capitalist movement that has destroyed the American economy by keeping investors dumb. He has literally donated billions and billions of dollars in his life time, and has pledged to donate the overwhelming majority of his fortune when he dies. How that translates to being a greedy capitalist, I don't know. 
3	1525710351	-2	You make a point. Buffet doesn't have vision. He doesn't understand that new companies are not about fundamentals. Companies today are driven by ideation to marketability then scalability and then fundamental placement in the market. He fails to understand that crypto's value (at it's core) is technology driven. The core value being transmission of verified information & payment. The future is headed towards global, agile and light companies backed by automation systems & manufacturing. Instant payment will be a necessity. He is more stifling American innovation and confusing the public to understand vital technology that will fundamental change the way they interact with each other on a global level. If the rest of the world is adapting blockchain, American will be left behind and worsen their economic future. They won't have many allies against blockchain tech and cryptos. I was a Warren Buffet fan, but he exposes his elitism and his self-interest beliefs when he talks about crypto like this. If he is calling ALL of us Rat Poision, we have every right to call him an old elitist dinosaur. He is poisoning the future and letting other developing countries adopt/thrive with this technology. His foundation has $4 billion in assets but has not given out billions. Don't be fooled by charitable giving by elites. The Susan Thompson buffet foundation is pro-abortion, gives scholorships to only 100 Nebraska students & doesn't even publish an annual report.  
4	1525713737	2	> Buffet doesn't have vision.Investing only in things he understands is not the same thing as lacking vision. >He doesn't understand that new companies are not about fundamentals.Fundamentals are everything; a good idea in and of itself is worth nothing.>Companies today are driven by ideation to marketability then scalability and then fundamental placement in the market. This is how garbage like EOS and Cardano end up having multi billion dollar market caps. >He fails to understand that crypto's value (at it's core) is technology driven. The core value being transmission of verified information & payment. The future is headed towards global, agile and light companies backed by automation systems & manufacturing.I'm speculating here, but I don't think he fails to realize that. Hypothetically, someone could see the value in blockchain technology while also holding a negative opinion of bitcoin; it could be that the 'best' implementation of the tech has not yet been created.>He is more stifling American innovation and confusing the public to understand vital technology that will fundamental change the way they interact with each other on a global level. If the rest of the world is adapting blockchain, American will be left behind and worsen their economic future. They won't have many allies against blockchain tech and cryptos. This is total nonsense. Are you really suggesting that Buffett has so much influence that he is single-handedly capable of 'stifling American innovation'? >He is poisoning the future and letting other developing countries adopt/thrive with this technology. What the fuck lol. Is he the Supreme Overlord of the USA in your mind? He's not as influential as you're suggesting.>His foundation has $4 billion in assets but has not given out billions. Don't be fooled by charitable giving by elites. The Susan Thompson buffet foundation is pro-abortion, gives scholorships to only 100 Nebraska students & doesn't even publish an annual report. That's not his only philanthropic endeavor and even a cursory glance at his wikipedia page would enlighten you to that fact.
5	1525714176	0	You bring no facts to the table, your rebuttals are weak and I don't deal with emotions. I have clearly stated my case. This debate is over. Bye. 
6	1525714651	2	> You bring no facts to the tableThe irony here is overwhelming. 
2	1525711227	1	I would agree with you but I'm fairly certain Buffet has read up on the state of things top to bottom. Its just his opinion...were he to live another 30 years I'm sure he would eventually come around to crypto assets in the same way he has sorta come around to tech. Remember how down he was on tech in the late 90s? 
2	1525706004	-2	Thankfully even the Dinosaur's pass away and the new capitalist will have an eye on the markets of future. Crypto is for the agile mind.
1	1525668588	-7	DudeHis companiesCan be displaced by cryptoHe hates competition
2	1525678559	10	Which ones?  You gonna munch on BTC instead of See's candies?  You gonna crash your car and hand over your private key instead of your geico insurance card?  I didn't know he owns the US Treasury.
3	1525698814	1	you are forgetting BUFFETS main businessesreal estate brokerage insurance brokerage financials/banks direct investments or stockson and on it goesthe dairy queen sheet is very small part
2	1525683960	6	Not really sure what you mean. Either you mean the company he invests in: in which case bullshit. Crypto isn't going to replace Cola or ketchup or laptops.If you mean *his* investment company then I don't really see what role crypto will play. AI investment companies might in part pop up more and already exist, but AI is not related to crypto. 
3	1525698792	1	you are forgetting BUFFETS main businessesreal estate brokerageinsurance brokeragefinancials/banks direct investments or stockson and on it goesthe dairy queen sheet is very small part
1	1525669947	-6	If what he was saying were true, I would listen. But he has way too many interests on the banking side to trust a word of what’s coming out of his old, washed up mouth. Michael Jordan was an amazing basketball player. Had arguably the best career of all time. Doesn’t mean I want him on the court when he’s 80 years old. 
2	1525678408	5	His age has not impacted his ability to generate returns for his investors one bit.I don't know why people think the banking sector is inherently anti-crypto.  The banks make money by issuing loans.  If BTC displaced the USD, would people suddenly not need to borrow money anymore?The banks coming out anti-crypto right now are responding to TODAY'S problems, which are idiots who bought BTC @ $19,000 on credit and now can't pay their bills.  It has nothing to do with "Feeling threatened by bitcoin" and more to do with "feeling threatened by idiots making losing bets on bitcoin on our fucking dime".
3	1525704736	1	Yet the same banks had no problem handing out loans to sub par borrowers.  That is apparently a risk they are willing to take.   The difference between now and 2007-8, they cant come and slap a foreclosed sign on your private seed.
0	1525665796	64	He also only invests in businesses he understands. Cryptocurrencies aren't businesses. Pretty reasonable tbh.
1	1525671826	7	Does anyone understand crypto? How do you know when you’ve understood crypto?
2	1525672214	12	For WB, he would probably like to understand it enough for him be comfortable parking several billion dollars in it and be able to justify it to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders?
2	1525708639	1	Yes. Unfortunately, judging expertise is no easier in crypto than it is in any other field, there's no "trick" or metric.
2	1525711286	1	Moving target. Knowledge of the space is a constantly evolving thing. The house is still being built. 
2	1525706385	0	do you mean understand how it works, or being a cryptographer? 99.9% of us aren't cryptographers, i'm not, but that doesn't mean I can't see tha value in projects like [insert shill here]
1	1525686143	1	Sure but when he says Bitcoin, I'm pretty sure he includes the whole ecosystem, even companies like Coinbase
1	1525680450	0	You are right, but on the other hand people like buffet should be more open for new technologies and ideas ..
0	1525668846	18	He's not wrong about cryptocurrencies though. The majority of cryptocurrencies are scams or clones. While the others are under regulatory pressures and high manipulation. The market is also not liquid enough for him to successfully enter if he wants. If I had 80B+ , why would I risk my wealth on those kind of speculative assets? 
1	1525678021	4	Unpopular train of thought but..........If I had his money I would dump billions in and use my power to manipulate the market to swing easy gains, no doubt about it. Like c’mon, he’s Warren fucking Buffet. If he decided to shill a coin for 2 months straight he could turn a 5 cent coin into a $2 coin. 
2	1525682160	5	It's not worth the risk though. The type of shilling and pump n dump schemes in crypto are highly illegal in stock trading or investments. A lot of manipulation is going on here. 
3	1525708406	1	Mmm good point
2	1525679300	1	scary but true
3	1525679421	0	I believe blockchain will revolutionize the world. But let’s be honest, we’re all here because we want to make money. 🤷🏻‍♂️
4	1525695746	1	Got burnt in januari so i guess i'll be here for the tech either way, as i was too stubborn to cut my losses. Now i have to pretend i love the tech and believe in the future 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️High key, i do think this stuff is quite epic, i believe in the crypto's that make systems which solve problems and have a sustainable way of generating income. Like kucoin shares and coss (assuming people will keep trading currencies on these platforms) and blockchain as a service solutions etc
5	1525708367	2	LOOOOOOL same. In January my portfolio was worth enough to buy a brand new corvette in cash. Now its not even worth enough to buy a used Toyota Corolla. Lesson learned: fuck hodling, sell high, buy lower 
2	1525713484	1	He is 87 accomplished investor and what you are describing is a immature behaviour of teenager with a little bit of money and influence.
3	1525713598	1	I’m doubt the SEC was established to combat broke teenagers manipulating markets 😉
0	1525666055	105	He talked down about it, then said he didn’t understand it. All in the same video. The one thing everyone has been telling me since day one of starting investing is research. Never jump without knowing what you’re landing on. He’s too influential to be throwing around opinions on stuff he doesn’t understand. So while his opinion does not phase me for a second, I still worry about what comes out of his mouth l. 
1	1525671773	8	> He talked down about it, then said he didn’t understand itJust like everyone in this sub. At least he’s self aware.Nobody understands crypto, even if you’re fucking Satoshi Nakamoto
2	1525672137	1	Right I don’t get it either BUT I’m not telling people not to buy into it. I’m just doing me. 😁This thread of comments has been very helpful to my understanding of his mentality though so I understand where he’s coming from. 
3	1525672732	1	To be fair maybe WB has different standards of “understanding” from everyone else, since he has to park several billion dollars
4	1525677620	4	Its easy for people who aren't even worth $1M let alone tens of billions to fail to grasp that Bitcoin is very much still an experiment that can fail hard.  Bitcoin is still just as likely to go to $1,000,000 per BTC as it is to go to $0 per BTC.  This guy made his money by NOT making those types of bets, which is exactly what he admitted in not betting on google and amazon.  He made his money on companies that were undervalued based on very solid fundamentals.
2	1525701104	0	It is a way to trade things that is:1. Decentralized - can't be turned off barring a disaster on the scale that it wouldn't matter anymore. Can't be hacked without sustained 51% control of a global network's computational power.2. immutable - can't be erased.3. trustless - I don't have to know you and you don't have to know me. In Math We Trust.In short, it is a way to fairly exchange value when you know you are in the presence of bad actors. It assumes at all times that someone will try to exploit the system and all structure is derived from that assumption.
1	1525669798	13	He understands that his firm is majorly leveraged on the institutional legacy banking system. Trust me, he gets that part. Therefore, he clearly understands crypto is a major threat to the current banking system. I’d be very, very concerned if he was not dismissing crypto. If he wasn’t scared of this, that would freak me out. 
2	1525677194	51	Thin foil cap stuff like this is why I consider most crypto investors to be idiots.
3	1525677351	31	God damn I'm sick of hearing it too.They act like these business people are personally offended by "threats to the banking system".Dude, if the Euro or the Rupee started to kick the dollar's ass they wouldn't sit around defending it like its their child, they would shift their holdings to the winner.  Bitcoin is no different.  Its not like if bitcoin became dominant today, he couldn't just buy a few billion dollars' worth.
4	1525685877	-8	Either way he wins by fudding.1. Either traditional banking doesn’t change because of the shit he says to fud cryptoand 2. He can buy crypto cheap because of fud and wins anyways or he at least gains time to shift his company towards crypto by delaying/hindering bull runs etc Why would he go all in on one horse? Close-mindedness will destruct you.
3	1525706436	2	Do these people realize how old Buffett is? Or that he's one of the least greediest investors in history?Crypto will likely never affect Buffett's life in the slightest and will barely make a dent in BRK by the time he's gone.
2	1525696640	1	nice spin
2	1525673146	-9	That's assuming he doesn't hold a ton of crypto.
3	1525674299	-6	Irrelevant. He can’t come out and support something that is a direct threat to a huge percentage of the Berkshire portfolio. This isn’t complicated. Conflict of interest. His opinion cannot have any value. 
4	1525677468	11	Bitcoin is not a direct threat to the berkshire portfolio.If the dollar were under a serious threat from bitcoin then his companies would just *gasp* start to accept bitcoin.
1	1525668544	0	He is the ole grandpa frontman for the oldBanking system and matrixDo not trust him on this tech as crypto can seriously hurt his stockAnd holdings even his insuranceBusiness
1	1525670197	1	> He’s too influential to be throwing around opinions on stuff he doesn’t understand. So while his opinion does not phase me for a second, I still worry about what comes out of his mouth l. Very good observation.This man isn't a fucking idiot. And anyone who thinks otherwise is a fucking idiot.I.E we cannot take his words seriously. Not under the former supposition.
1	1525677650	-1	He was a leading cause in keeping me from crypto (several years late) and shared his views with others who were considering. Never again.  His depth is in one arena
2	1525686513	1	Correct...His depth is in one area.Anyone that thinks not, is merely rambling.
0	1525669622	9	Anyone who knows anything about Warren Buffet understands that he and his opinions have nothing to do with crypto.  Asking Warren Buffet about crypto is like asking Michael Jordan about disc golf.
1	1525678927	3	The part people are missing is they're showing Michael Jordan a frisbee and asking he thinks it is a good basketball.  His answer should be nothing short of "good lord man, stay far away from both basketball and frisbees!".  Cryptocurrency is speculation, not investing.  If you think it is investing, he is correct that it is rat poison and will end badly for you.  You clearly don't understand what "investing" even means.
2	1525706571	2	speculation and investing aren't mutually exclusive though.
0	1525685463	13	Yea an from a guy who is likely the most profitable investor in modern times.  When crypto enthusiasts try to make fun of Buffet you make yourself look like an idiot and you harm the crypto space. He might be wrong about crypto but on a bad day he makes more great investment decisions than this sub together. 
1	1525704495	2	It's just interesting to say at least to call something "rat poison squared" if you don't even understand the thing your are calling that.
1	1525706703	1	I kind of feel bad for the dude. There's some kiddie-diddler that had to buy a few hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin back in 2011 or whatever in order to buy some CP on the darknet. He had $25 leftover and forgot it for years... that guy made a better ROI by accident, than Warren did by spending his life investing.I mean any 18 year old can, in one year, make what he aspires to make in 25-50 years... that probably doesn't make him too happy. 
0	1525681701	6	"this from a guy who’s advising people to stay away from cryptocurrencies."This really doesn´t mean anything. Kinda shitty post to feed some hope.
0	1525704933	4	If you ever pick up a Buffett book, you'd understand his mindset 
0	1525666450	29	I'm not sure why all the hate?  Warren is a value investor in assets with a predictable and verifiable value.  There is not one person who knows what an ETH token's actual worth is, or why Bitcoin is $9000 instead of $20000 or $2000.  Until crypto coins have an actual value and purposeful use, we're all speculating.  Why would he come in to an asset class that is totally undeveloped and non-predictable?    
1	1525668071	17	Most ppl here doesnt know basic of investing and have only tried Bull markeds, and made money of that and now belive They Can School a person that have Been into The game Forever and won Big over The years
2	1525678690	14	Exactly.  They're so thick headed they can't understand a reknown *investor* is being asked about *speculation*.  The fact that they think bitcoin is *investing* means it is indeed rat poison to them, because they have no fucking clue what it is they are even doing.  They're betting on horses, but they think they're building a company.

1	1525704751	0	Who expects him to go into the space? I just can understand people being annoyed by the way he talks over crypto. I mean, calling it rat poisoned squared. How can you even take him seriously? > Buffett said that the cryptocurrencies will see their fall soon.Like, did he even spent a single day reading up on cryptocurrencies? The whole tech is merely at the beginning... how on earth would you except the downfall of crypto anytime soon? You will hear from uprising use-cases more and more, will see more and more companies join interest in the blockchain and alike... and during that time you'll see the downfall? I doubt so.
0	1525663274	6	Yeah but, if you invested in this product 289 years ago, you’d be doing better than most index funds today! 
0	1525679294	3	I don’t need Warren Buffet to tell me Warren Buffet was wrong about Google and Amazon. 
0	1525683943	3	Despite his undoubtely high experience - he is old
0	1525684464	3	It's simple, he avoids risk. Even if it's high reward.  Both Google and Amazon were risky investments.  It worked for him. He rarely gets burned on anything. 
0	1525703913	3	Its difficult to discount anything WB says. He is a legend in the investment industry and we all can learn something from him.  One thing he strongly endorses is investing in your "circle of competence" basically saying invest in what you know.  He doesn't know crypto, therefore doesn't invest in crypto.  He also doesn't day trade, instead he puts $ in businesses he wants to own a piece of (via shares) and grow with them. All solid points. If you truly understand what he is saying many investors in crypto are following his principles.  
0	1525714092	3	I have my own reasons why I don't like WB and I've been around long enough to see his press reactions to everything from the DotCom boom to know and quite frankly, he's a one-trick pony. He's very good at that one trick, which btw he borrowed from his mentor, which is value investing, buy-low-never-sell, and it's worked out very well. It will work out well forever. He and his shareholders will always be fine if they never stray from that course. Insurance is a smart game. Railroads that monopolize specific types of industry transport - amazing. Good for him.That being said, he's been a grumpy old man that refuses to change since the dawn of computers. He doesn't even want to try to understand them, the Internet or anything involving technology. He's missed Microsoft, even though he played Bridge with Gates since the early 90's. He missed Amazon. He missed Google. He missed Facebook. He missed LinkedIn. He'll continue to keep missing on companies like AirBnB, Uber, Lyft and various other world-changing tech companies. And it's not like he was looking for these opportunities and just didn't see them. He flat out dissed them because of valuations or complexity. He isn't used to technology and hypergrowth. He wasn't used to the reach the Internet provided and if he was in any other position he'd be paying dearly for the non-chalant "I don't invest in anything I don't understand" ethos he's adopted. Buffet is a damn dinosaur and it works for him, but he needs to stay out of the fucking news and stop giving people ideas of what "value" really is. Value in this century is getting into something massive before it's even more massive.One could argue that even at Uber's current valuation if you were to buy 1% of it right now you'd probably still pull 10x within 5 years after IPO. I'm not one to harp on WB for railing against crypto. That's actually a better position for him to take than he's taken against tech companies with actual products and customers, but man, if he lives another 10 - 15 he's going to regret it again. He has to see what's happening here and conceptualize the change that's coming. Everything is going digital. One-by-one the things we do daily are being digitized, fulfilled by AI or handled via crowd sourcing. He should want to be a part of that, even on a small level, instead of wasting his breath warning against it.  
0	1525664905	4	He says it's rat poison.Who are the rats?
1	1525679194	1	banks
2	1525679215	1	In other words:Warren = bullish on bitcoin
2	1525679594	0	no, banks can use bitcoin like the rest of us
3	1525695587	0	banks cant print bitcoins
0	1525684403	5	Guys, WB is amazingly successful at what he does. Has any of you seen Berkshire's performance? He has delivered 30% YoY for decades. How many here have managed to do that for over 5 years with this supermassive rally. Crypto is speculative. Whole market can goto $10 trillion or collapse before making an attempt for that (unlikely now but who knows). Buffet is no technology guru and is conservative in his investments. He will likely lose out in coming years with WF and Banks as his major holdings. But none of that is the reason to disrespect this guy's legacy. We all can learn a lot from him. If not about investments, about life
1	1525687130	2	No not about life, about accumulating zeros...Warren Buffet is no philosopher.
2	1525700381	2	You really should read his shareholders letters. He's called Sage of Omaha and has been behind multiple philanthropic initiatives.
3	1525703313	2	You should read his book the Snowball, then you will see he is not the amazing person you think. The only reason he started giving away his money was because of Bill Gates, before then he kept everything to himself, even his family suffered around him. 
4	1525711570	1	Ditto on Snowball. I still think hes amazing but now I think hes amazing *and* troubled (and emotionally 8 years old)
0	1525669139	2	Well, not just on blockchains. Buffett and Munger missed out on the investment of many technology companies like Google and Amazon. They only invest in Apple like these few years.They are just too old for new technologies \("old" here refers to mindset, not age\).
0	1525677723	2	I thought I clicked on the Silicon Valley thread and started reading the comments. I was like, “you guys are way too involved in this show and how Gilfoyle and Hendricks think.” A little relieved and a little sad you guys aren’t that insane. 
0	1525694437	2	Here's a recent quote from Buffet" "If you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don't really have anything that has produced anything. You're just hoping the next guy pays more."""There's nothing wrong with it. If you wanna gamble somebody else will come along and pay more money tomorrow, that's one kind of game. That is not investing."He's not wrong. Keep in mind that this is a man who by his teens had run several businesses and could memorise the minute details of hundreds of companies. 
0	1525697038	2	A other WB hate. Wtf is wrong with you moon boy. He dont like crypto because is speculative, that it. That guy is a legend 
1	1525713858	1	Easier to hate him that he is wrong or old or something than to admitt that maybe crypto is overhyped and very speculative business.
0	1525699530	2	He was wrong about Microsoft too! And Bill Gates was his friend forever and still he didnt believe in Gates vision :D
0	1525700445	2	Warren Buffett is not the kind of investor that would invest in cryptos; he’s a value investor. Compared to him, Soros is more a risk taking investor; in fact, his most famous trade is his bet against the Bank of England. Both are extremely successful and there’s no good or wrong investing style I think, you just need to be really good at and understand what you do.
0	1525669933	2	Lol. Everyone needs to chill on vilifying an 80 (?) year old man for not understanding or liking new technology. 
1	1525670238	3	He didn't like investing in technology when he was 30 years old too 
2	1525707068	1	Is there something wrong with that?
3	1525709587	1	No, but it doesn't have anything to do with his age.
0	1525669673	1	Buffet has stated in numerous interviews that he invests in what he knows. He also admits he’s not tech saavy, so not that big of a deal in my opinion 🤷🏻‍♂️
0	1525670308	1	Yeah he's such an idiot /s
0	1525673659	1	A guy who makes billions of dollars can afford to be wrong about a few things lol.
0	1525678765	1	Don't get me wrong. I believe he's wrong about crypto too. BUT one has to say he has balls. Not everyone, especially not everyone how's used to be rich and right, would admit he was wrong.
0	1525681651	1	He his also wrong about crypto but this is a whole different story.,
0	1525687068	1	That's OK, he's allowed.
0	1525697130	1	I never considered his thought and I feel so happy :)
0	1525700558	1	So, a guy who makes a lot of good guesses and decisions has made bad ones?  So, you're saying that Warren Buffet is human?  Got it!
0	1525702007	1	We have Trump coin, Jesus coin, who's making a Buffet coin ?
0	1525702476	1	I don't believe beelzebubby has the right to just Warren Buffets investing strategies. 
0	1525702502	1	i think we should stop picking on such old man, though i normally don't agree with what he says but, let him live. haha
0	1525708018	1	If you don't sell, they can't buy without pumping the price.
0	1525715462	1	Warren will make investors consistant gains over the long period which is great for retirement funds and so forth. However he is almost never interested in inovative products. he only likes well established companies with a stable product. It's a miracle he is invested in Apple even. I imagine the only reason is thier consistant sales on the Iphone. He doesn't like risk and his word is far less valuable than most people make it out to be. His opinion on tech means nothing, he has little to no expierence in the field and has shuned it conistantly. 
0	1525697384	1	Warren owns stock in Bank of America Wells Fargo American Express, etc.  If people embrace crypto he loses money!!!!!!!!
0	1525675315	1	Past performance is no garuntee of future success. 
0	1525684145	1	His 83 billion USD fortune tells me he has been very right about something
1	1525686256	2	that's the thing, he doesn't have to be right about the companies he doesn't invest in, he only has to be right about the companies he invests in
1	1525705798	2	he was very right in the time period where he made this wealth. It's 2018 and the guy is in his 90s. No disrespect, but I wouldn't trust a 90 year old on a breakthrough innovation revolutionizing the entire financial sector, no matter how brilliant he may be.
0	1525684766	1	He is wrong about a great deal of things. Maybe the comfortable majority of things over the past 20 years. People still have that natural tendency to put men on magical pedestals because of their momentum.With all due respect he's almost 90 years old. I have maximum respect for age & wisdom but his wisdom is primarily in traditional business valuation... Territorial battles between hardware stores & dairy marts. When he weighs in on technological or political disruptions it's pure "cringe".
0	1525703022	1	People are mistaking him for being a genious. He had his time investing in the things he understood. I'm not a genious just because I have Facebook  stocks. 
0	1525711559	1	Grasp at straws much? God this sub is a pathetic fucking circlejerk. 
0	1525661731	1	He was a giant in his day but is clearly not cut out for the digital age. 
0	1525663023	-4	It's time to move on old man !!!!
1	1525678773	5	Then tell people to stop asking an investor about gambling
2	1525709541	0	Stocks in a sense is legal gambling itself
0	1525661681	-10	Buffet is a maggot.  He buys coke and apple, what a genius.  What he really does is use his massive buying power and influence to squeeze management to create favorable odds for his investment.  Case in point... his recent investment into a failing mortgage company in Canada.  He's not a genius, just an old fashioned land baron having his way.  
1	1525668492	8	You have absolutely no idea what your talking about nor any understanding of value investing. These sort of nonsensical comments that sound like they're coming from a 14 year old on any Warren Buffet article make crypto look immature.
2	1525710188	0	Uh, ok stupid.  But you don't think the "oracle" of omaha and his old fart friends calling bitcoin rat poison is reminiscent of a 14 year old.  You are either incredibly fucking stupid or own too much BH stock.  Go dig a hole dummy.
2	1525712118	-1	Hey stupid, here's Munger's latest quote...this must be your shining example of value investing deep insight."Bitcoin Nearly as Bad as ‘Trading Harvested Baby Brains’, Says Berkshire VC Munger"Gosh, I wish I had your understanding of value investing.  Then again, you're definitely the dumbest guy you know.  
1	1525671482	4	You're an idiot. 
2	1525712197	0	Here's Munger's latest deep thought..."Bitcoin Nearly as Bad as ‘Trading Harvested Baby Brains’, Says Berkshire VC Munger"You ever wonder if you're the idiot in most conversations?  Newsflash: you are.  
2	1525710096	-1	No, you're an idiot.  But you already know that.
1	1525668795	-1	Exactly butThat is why he is successfulHe is an entrepreneur using network of advisors to invest in and improve businessHe cannot do a thing to stop cryptoFrom replacing his interests
0	1525683145	-1	Tell Grandpa from "Up" to stay in his lane.
0	1525690303	-1	Why should I care about the opinion of a 87 year old?
0	1525678725	0	People are afraid of change and afraid of what they don't understand. Old people like Warren Buffet just don't understand the future. Also at this point, Buffet just profits from his name. If he buys anything, it turns into gold because people hear he bought it so they all buy it too.
0	1525693255	0	don't trust anyone who drinks coke
0	1525693407	0	Knowing this...., he is not completly stupid, he probably already invested a few 100.000 dollars in crypto via his business, just in case the coins keep rising. And now making noise he does not believe in crypto...  but reading all the comments, perhaps he really does not believe and invest. He will be as wrong as he was with Amazon and Google.
0	1525699377	0	You are OLD Man now probably you should sit and don't think much.. My Mentor
0	1525702984	0	Nobody in crypto would care about this guy. But he is FUDing and somebody needs to expose him. Luckily we have our man: http://fortune.com/2018/05/05/warren-buffett-elon-musk-trolling-sees-candies-moats/Hilarious!
0	1525704654	0	Warren Buffets investments aren’t a good or a bad indication for any industry or technology. The manner in which he invests (while very successful) doesn’t have any link to its long term viability, just what he perceives as a short term up-trend/positive quarterly value trend.
0	1525710299	0	He’s 87, one of the richest people in the world and made his net worth off the stock market. I wouldn’t expect these type of people to take crypto seriously. 
0	1525665533	-3	Haters gonna hate.
0	1525689979	-1	this ancient fossilized hyena only heard of speculative and volatile side of bitcoin, he has no clue of all the other projects that are chainging the world
0	1525695603	-2	He missed Google, Amazon, Microsoft... how is this guy still relevant?
0	1525665754	-5	He has been wrong many times..."value investor" does not necessarily make you a good fortune, you could be right in every aspects but still lose money... Warren Buffet was lucky, because American chose him to be the "value investor" to make American looks great...not sure if we can wait for that day that he admits he was wrong about crypto tho..
1	1525677251	5	BRK outperformed the market consistently over decades, you're a moron if you think he got "lucky." Guy works hard and likes what he does. 
2	1525694635	-1	Why you are here moron... go load up with BRK then...
0	1525697052	-1	Fcuk buffet. Why do people still care about this old fart. His ancient investing methods can’t even comprehend crypto and this guy is losing money along with the banks. 
0	1525699215	-1	He's wrong about a whole lot lately. Why are plain index funds out performing his own? Lol 
1	1525706821	0	You got it backwards dude. He bets that the index fund outperforms hedge fund managers. A bet that he was won every time.
2	1525707294	-1	No, you got it wrong dude. I'm not even talking about that statement. I'm talking about HIS PERFORMANCE. It's been trash, ironically he's right about the index fund thing, because a basic index fund sure is beating his ass every year now. My portfolio has returned a higher % in the last year and I'm a regular joe who researches/invests on the side as a hobby...
3	1525708076	1	>No, you got it wrong dude. I'm not even talking about that statement. >I'm talking about HIS PERFORMANCE. It's been trash, ironically he's right about the index fund thing, because a basic index fund sure is beating his ass every year now. He still beating it on average over the course of many decades, he's only been outperformed in the last major bull rally because of the growth of tech stocks which he is underexposed to. If you call that performance "trash", then you have high standards. But then again you're a retail investor who had a higher rate of return on a sample size of 1 year so maybe you're the expert here.
4	1525708240	0	how many years has it been since he's beaten the index funds again? Yeah, tell me again how past performance guarantees future success He's lost his touch, like it or not that's a simple fact. But I guess you're the expert here who somehow has a different set of numbers than everyone else i guess. 
5	1525709768	2	>how many years has it been since he's beaten the index funds again?A couple yearshttps://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/435425/berkshires-alpha_large.PNG>He's lost his touch, like it or not that's a simple fact. But I guess you're the expert here who somehow has a different set of numbers than everyone else i guess. His best days returns-wise are behind him but he's still a great investor.
0	1525680866	-2	He is sitting on a ton of Fiat. Of course he does not want crypto to make them obsolete. I am pretty sure he does not own any crypto either. Because he should have invested by now if he wants to be  sneaky about it but he's still going around spreading FUD. He legit does not understand it just like how he did not understand the first Internet companies. Crypto and Block Chain is literally the next Internet. Once again he will make the same mistake. He does not invest in future groundbreaking companies. He is only rich because he is the biggest hodler of all time.
