1	1525677864	45	>Real knowledge is knowing how much you’ve been shilledi like thisAlthough it doesnt beat socrates:>True wisdom is to know one thing, and that is to know that you dont know anything
2	1525677977	3	From this i sort of derrived a subphilosophy i apply in my own life: If i dont know anything, nobody else knows anything either, but together we can struggle to get 1 step closer to the truth.With this, you also assume that you yourself bear enough wisdom to make the choices in your life that are necesary, and advice from others is always to be seriously considered, but not per sé blindly followed.

4	1525693171	1	This is why we have science. Follow the evidence people.
5	1525696352	2	What kind of evidence? Empirical scientific evidence relies on our senses which didn't evolve to reveal true nature of the universe, but to achieve better survival. I believe in mathematical evidence more than my own eyes.
6	1525702904	-1	obligatory /r/im14andthisisdeep we get it, you took philosophy 101 last semester
7	1525707524	1	obligatory interjects into conversation with nothing but hatefulness, adding no value, in an attempt to look superior
8	1525711762	1	You're wrong, it was all for internet points
5	1525706783	1	Even science books were centralized in,school.  Shilled to believe things happened a certain way.  Theres truth mixed in of course, One truth can be used to cover a mountain of lies.     Psychopaths .   so I can try to make a factual point to show why my coworker should be fired. ..   If I was motivated enough I can key his new car knowing he will be very pissed about it. I can make the point to other people "this guy shouldn't be our custoner service rep... He cant control his emotions and doesnt know how to separate his life from the work place"  knowing his car got keyed...he comes into work with a frown, and a little frantic.,,, I can say "see...the guy is nuts" What I said was the truth...I pounted out emotions that suggested what I just said was true.. Now everyone in the office thinks,the guy is short tempered.  I only think this because he mostly kept it to himself about him noticing his car being keyed when left for work.  Maybe he told one or two people but those people didn't inform the office he was upset only becsuse his car got keyed.  Now everybody has the idea he is just short-tempered and that could ruin his position.So I used one truth to cover up a mountain of LiesThis is similar to what goes on in advertising and that type of deceptive advertising should be illegal but it's not because our centralized system does nothing about it
5	1525711617	1	this is why... SCIENCE. blind faith in... science!!!sound familiar?this is why... RELIGION. blind faith in... religion!!! some dogmas in science: if not science, not trueif i can't see it, not trueif it's not in a paper, not truei dont question my own beliefs reality is objective 
6	1525712609	1	I don't think you understand what science is or what it means.
5	1525695401	0	science will never be able to explain which way is the correct way to live
6	1525697302	6	This is so deep I see Adele rolling in it
6	1525713035	1	Sure it can.Science demonstrates that the planet is warming at an unprecedented rate and that human carbon emissions are the primary driver of that warming.  We can infer from this that humanity must take steps to reduce its carbon output or risk destroying ourselves.Science also demonstrates that the survival of the species is paramount in nature, so it is in our natural interest to preserve our current environment or adapt ourselves to the changes we see coming.There you go, the correct way to live according to science.

0	1525662846	198	How much weed did you smoke before you typed this post? 
1	1525663954	131	Not much, but strong.  very tired 
2	1525664790	88	You got shilled into thinking that weed doesnt make you retarded
3	1525665037	91	You got shilled into thinking that thinking  differently == retarded
4	1525665370	35	You got shilled into thinking that thinking that thinking differently ==! retartedOr maybe I got shilled to think this way
5	1525669199	53	I’m shilled as fuck right now 
6	1525670075	28	Shill man
7	1525673758	12	/r/theredshill
8	1525677697	6	i lvoe this
6	1525676515	-6	Liberals don't need to roll out actual decent policies that help human beings, come election time just shill weed and the dopers will vote ya in. 
7	1525692788	4	You seem to think that we need your political FUD here. 
7	1525705318	1	voting is broken, freedom is coming
7	1525699312	-1	This is sad but true, however I'm a little smarter.  As an 18 year old,kid..I voted Ralph Nader becauae he wanted to legalize weed, Today I see it as just trying to shill me to vote. 
5	1525683028	3	shillception
3	1525670991	4	But it doesnt?
4	1525675063	-7	it kinda does tho
5	1525675274	5	Youre the retard if you think drugs affect all people the same
6	1525675496	2	I dont think I said that lol. Its pretty easy to see that weed becomes a habit for many users and is often a catalyst that removes their ambition in life. 
7	1525677744	6	That's actually another "shilled" opinion. I can't clean my house without smokin' a bowl, I get super interested in new things and get introspective about getting my shit together a lot. Ask Joe Rogan about his ambitions.
8	1525678200	4	Lol I'm not gonna make the argument that nobody has ever been successful while smoking weed consistently. I am simply pitching the notion that I and many others see  that some people lose their ambition in life and allow it to revolve around weed. Your comment supports that. You cant clean your house without smoking? That sounds like a guy who cant leave the house without drinking. Its not healthy.
9	1525699787	1	The best part about stoners is scientific studies around weed only work in their favor. The second you tell them weed has been proven to lower ambition in individuals then science no longer matters, only their unique case(which I'm sure is unbiased lmao).
9	1525680342	-1	I can function without it... I was just using cleaning as an example for something I am not particularly ambitious about. You are entitled to your opinion for sure, I was just giving my personal experience on the matter. 
7	1525701794	2	and thats what retarded means for you? Call it losing ambitions or becoming lazy but don't fucking say retarded. 
8	1525707282	1	did that hurt your feelings?
9	1525710814	-1	actually I don't smoke but to say it makes people retarded is very insensitive to actual mentally handicapped people. I don't really mind, but I just think retarded is not the term you were looking for
7	1525676642	1	So people make people retarded, not weed. Got it
3	1525713047	1	Drugs have complex effects. Even a couple drinks of alcohol can improve performance for some tasks, such as socialization, which is actually important for your survival as a human being at times. There is also an effect in programming where a couple drinks lets the programmer kind of get in the zone a bit. I'm not sure why that happens, but perhaps it calms the nerves and gives a bit of a pleasure boost to make the activity of sitting at a desk and staring at the screen more pleasing.There are two of you on the inside. There is the rational part that takes time to think about things before acting, and the automatic part that reacts quickly and applies things like muscle memory.Some drugs give one or the other "you" a bit more gas or sway in your daily choices.
2	1525664199	3	Choose Wisely ! 
1	1525703433	3	I'm betting at least 7 weeds.
1	1525663956	-2	Enough
0	1525672595	76	Why is everyone's response "what'd you smoke bro"? Why can't you acknowledge that public discourse is one giant advertisement without being "high"? I think OP's right - society is mostly a sleazy salesman. And I'm not high. Diabetes and many forms of cancer would probably be a fraction of what they are if the sugar industry hadn't convinced people that fat was bad and sugar was okay. It's really the opposite - fat facilitates hormone production and sugar facilitates inflammation and chronic illness. 
1	1525678137	15	> fat was bad and sugar was okay. It's really the opposite YES! i'm seriously pissed that western society has been anti-shilling fat products, they barely even teach us about the distinguishments between the different fats and which ones are benificial...(They don't teach us that sugar is OK though, as they put "zero sugar" on their products. But still they try to get us hooked on sweet stuff which is addictive)
2	1525699711	2	They did in the 80s say fat was bad and sugar was better.  Weight watchers commercials used to explain this and even released a whole line of products with "0 fat"   Only sugars we should be eating come from natural honey, and fruits
3	1525706178	2	Sucking on natural sugar still in the Cain can be beneficial as well. Its just refined sugars that we need to not touch. 
4	1525707795	2	Basically eat a wide variety of unprocessed plants, some meat and a little grain that's really all there is to it
4	1525712274	1	Why?
3	1525707454	0	Who the fuck is 'they'?  Even the shitty food pyramid had sugar at the top
4	1525710578	0	Bread and grains are straight carbohydrates. The whole second level is all sugar.
5	1525713961	1	All sugars are carbohydrate, not all carbohydrate is sugar
1	1525684520	12	Because it comes off as a stoner epiphany.Companies are shilling you that their product is superior. I mean yeah no shit that's the whole point of marketing. It's up to the individual to do their own research. 
2	1525700630	-2	Yeah but...what kid is supposed to understand this by themselves? Its not enough for an 9 year old to know commercials are trying to sell you.   Kids pick up what they believe are facts from commericals like "milk does a body good" Which is kinda sorta true depending on what milk and if its organic but don't rralize how bad milk can be when buying that mass produced shit,    their was no extensoce information people could look up at the snap of a finger.   You would have to go to the library and read about milk to find the truth, and at best there might be some author talking about milk...youd have to browse through books to,find itMonopolies pretty much killed people. 
1	1525691271	2	Because they dont want to lose thier "stuff" they worked hard for, they dont want to admit that they are living a lie and refuse to fight for change, they are conditioned to being told what to do and when to do it.
1	1525691300	2	because OP thinks that decentralization or blockchain will somehow free us from the chains of society
2	1525692670	2	It actually could though, or at least in terms of advertisement. Tokenizing attention and data could compensate us for what media aggregates are currently taking massive advantage of.
2	1525700946	1	Dude if you don't believe.  GOML. People like me created Bitcoin and diaspora to escape the control of Big Corp, big bank, and centralized control that was influence by "outside investors " If you don't believe we can escape this...than youre not helping .  either way, you csnt truly help,decentralization if you believe we can't escape centralization. 
3	1525703105	1	wtf are you talking about? you created bitcoin?besides, bitcoin is even more centralized than banks now
1	1525690325	3	Because it's presented as if it might be new or critical information.  As if it's some discovery that needs to be shared with the world.  But it's not.  Marketing is used to create psychological connections to products, services, and ideas in order to cause you to desire, or agree with, them more.  This should not be news to anyone.  Taking the time to write and post this suggests that the author thought that it was a worthy post.  Assuming that he/she is high is mostly giving them the benefit of the doubt.  Because if someone were to take the same action completely sober, I'd expect them to be pretty slow or extremely young.
1	1525691509	1	Yeah he has some good points. On the other side sometimes centralization is good (provides a better overall result?). A lot of complaints stem from not understanding whatever issue as a whole. Often it is more complicated than "if they just did it this way..."That being said nothing pisses me off more than education having been turned into a business that sucks as much money out of you as possible with little to no, or bad guidance. Shame on government lending for letting it happen.
1	1525694379	1	Well, op actually admitted he was high when he wrote this. Not that it matters really but just pointing it out. 
1	1525699543	1	I did a few years of nutrition in college,  Even they didn't emphasize how bad sugar was until I read a book written in the early 80 s by Joe Weider.Suger is the death of us.   But don't worry, now we will toss in aspartame,..thats another thing that was once shilled to us
1	1525703323	1	Let's be careful though because fat can still be harmful. The worst is high fat/high sugar diets. Not saying you're wrong, fat has definitely been scapegoated as the bad guy, but it's not entirely false. Nutrition education in the general public is just so poor overall. 
1	1525707533	1	>  the sugar industry hadn't convinced people that fat was bad and sugar was okay.Well they hadn't for a start, otherwise the diet soda industry wouldn't  be so large.  You think the dairy and meat lobby had no power or something?   And it isn't the opposite either.  Too much fat is bad for you.  Public advice has always been to  moderate fat and sugar
0	1525663780	59	I want to smoke what you had, OP.
1	1525663899	78	I had blue cookies.  Hybrid of blueberry, and girl scout cookies.  THC 28 Its decent shit but I fell asleep half way through typing this so I half added it
2	1525691170	2	As someone who’s tried both blueberry and gsc already. I’ma demand some blue cookies next time I go to the dispo. 
2	1525705537	1	Wait, for real?
1	1525688260	9	I would like to add that people were shilled into thinking that these kinds of "enlightenments" i would say, only happen when people smoke weed or use any other type of substance.That is bs. OP is telling the truth about the marketing industry and you don't need to get high to realize it (substances CAN help though, just saying it is not necessary)Big corporations aren't *evil* as you would imagine. They are doing the same thing as people here on this subreddit, marketing to make money. If Bitcoin core is a threat to Bitcoin Cash, what do you do? Market Bitcoin Cash as the *true* Bitcoin.*Hey by doing this you aren't really harming anyone, you are just making money by encouraging people to buy stuff so you get more profit. Nobody gets harmed by this. People don't care about the truth anyway, we are just here to sell our product, so we are in the right here by advertising the real good project - Bitcoin Cash* /s
2	1525713271	1	Corporations may not be evil but they have a lot of evil outcomes due to systemic problems. Sometimes you need to think of them as their own entity like an ant swarm. The system can have bad side effects for some even if the motivations of individual participants in the system aren't inherently immoral.

1	1525674641	17	With apologies to Mr. Palahniuk:> Shilling has us chasing ICOs and tokens, signing up to exchanges we hate so we can buy coins we don't need. We're the shitcoins of history, man. No purpose or smart contract. We have no Great Bubble. No Great Flippening (yet). Our bubble is our hopes and dreams... our flippening is our lives. We've all been raised by Reddit to believe that one day we'd all be crypto millionaires, and whales, and go to the moon. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.

0	1525677640	6	>This is seriously why we need decentralizationAnd in my opinion a well developed value judgement system (i don't know what to call it in english), but i mean the wisdom to distinguish useful from useless information and apply healthy skepticism and the ability to view the world from different perspectives.And i think this is happening already, hundreds of thousands of people are watching 2 hour long psychology lectures on youtube, over this pop-science-5-minutes-half-facts. We have a combat with our short attention spans, yes i agree to that, but on the other hand i also seriously believe that civilisation is waking up. We're seeing more bullshit, we have more means to spread it (for example youtube and decentralised networks). 
1	1525683424	2	The term you’re looking for is “critical thinking”.I wish this was taught to us from a young age
2	1525715203	1	Why? So you could have autonomy in this economy and your life? Or so you could actually influence your destiny and make a notable contribution to the world? Pshaw.

0	1525684373	6	**Welcome to the human race**It has ever been thus, in big urban areas, but now it's accelerated to such a degree, that we can no longer believe 90% of the news we read.When a single tweet can ruin someones life, cause a seismic share price shift, or even ruin a company you have to realise that sometimes, it's best to just back away.I gave up reading news 9 months ago - I was a complete addict at one point, checking the news every 20 minutes. I now watch zero adverts on TV, as everything I get is streamed through a pay service. I have an ad blocker on my browser - except for small independent sites that really rely on ads and provide a good service.The only news I read is tech related and very localised news, as this could impact my life. I also occasionally dip into financial news related to my assets (mortgage, savings etc.)In short, I've narrowed my view on the world dramatically, simply because I cannot trust any of it, can do nothing about 99.999% of it and because it just makes me anxious.
1	1525693001	1	Do you have good sited sources on why to stop watching (bad, negative) news and why it's bad for us? I don't pay attention to them myself mostly, but at one point I was also addicted. Just asking for some sources I can share since something made you change your mind and the people who I shared it with don't think mine are good enough.
2	1525697823	1	I don't, but if you search about, you'll see it's generally accepted that constantly feeding yourself with news media has a very big potential to bring you down - to make you anxious.Lets say you keep reading about violent crime in the region you live in - it could be a wide area, but you consider it your region, whether that's a state, a province, a county etc.If you keep reading "shocking" reports of violent crime, you'll lose perspective. You have to do the maths - what's the likelyhood you'll be a victim?The media will use shock tactics and misleading headlines to basically "sell" their online service - ad revenue. So suddenly, 5 fatal shootings out of a regional population of a million, becomes an onslaught "we are all at risk!"Then you get constant bombardment about things which are bad for you, about some food product that has been recalled because 1 person got sick from it, about too much sugar will give you diabetes. (Yes, it will, but it takes a **lot** and constant abuse, obesity etc.) The list goes on and on - and we have no way of knowing how much of this "news" is fake, misreported or sensationalised. Finally, we get mainstream political news - things which **could** impact you, but you have so little power to do anything about it, it makes you anxious. Most of it is just repetition - the same stories again and again and again. Tell you what, if something **really** big is kicking off, you better bet your friends and family would tell you, so there really is no reason to follow the news at all. Just pick the things which you need to know about.For me, it's a bit of finance, it's things like road works in my area (directly impacts me), or planned strike action, maybe news of a housing development going up nearby, or a new shopping centre - local stuff that has an impact.The rest? So what if someone got shot 1000 miles away from you, or there was a 20 car pile up on the highway nowhere near you, or that african killer bees are on the rampage - it's just shit. Completely pointless shit that clutters up your mind. Sure, for the victims, it's terrible - but you don't know them. If you keep reading about these things, you start emphasising (if you are a decent human being) for no reason - it'll drive you nuts, unless you feel you can do something to change things.
0	1525668606	23	Your beliefs about BTC vs BCH are shills too.
1	1525695559	3	How so? Last time i looked at rbtc even most BCH supporters agreed that BCH is not Bitcoin but Bitcoin cash (at least for now). What Bitcoin.com did is straight up scam.
2	1525695765	-1	"scam"? no one owns the name or brand of bitcoin. bitcoin cash is a version of bitcoin as much as bitcoin core is. put them both on the table, look at them, use them. only one works like bitcoin. hint: it aint btc...btc fees in fact are around $2 now. LN is cool but not sensible as the sole scaling method .send me your bch address and ill show you
3	1525697620	0	>"scam"? no one owns the name or brand of bitcoin. Irrelevant. Just because no one owns the name doesn't mean you can't mislead/scam people. There is a 99.99% social consensus regarding which network the Bitcoin network is. >bitcoin cash is a version of bitcoin as much as bitcoin core isWrong. While you can see Bitcoin Cash as an alternative version of Bitcoin with a different network, Bitcoin core is just a client for the Bitcoin network.>put them both on the table, look at them, use them. only one works like bitcoin. hint: it aint btc....btc fees in fact are around $2 now.I don't think so, i used Bitcoin every other day for the past months with 10 - 40 cent fees in the next blocks (mostly 0 - 1 blocks). I agree that it didn't work well last december though.>LN is cool but not sensible as the sole scaling method .Bitcoin Cash doesn't even need scaling, because no one uses it. In any case, if Bitcoin doesn't win the adoption race it will be another competitor but not Bitcoin Cash, as it's way too controversial. I'm not a Bitcoin maximalist. I think ETH has a good chance to take over in the midterm anyway.>send me your bch address and ill show yousend me your segwit address and i'll show you
4	1525700516	3	I like other cryptos more than BCH.Not 99.99%. even if it were that number being majority does not make it Bitcoin.It's like saying just because the majority of people thinks a man is a woman then the man becomes a woman. Social delusion exists.
4	1525699441	1	>Just because no one owns the name doesn’t mean you can’t mislead/scam people.If you were told Bitcoin was fast, cheap and had reliable transactions, and you got transaction prices that range from a few cents to 85$ and sometimes don’t go through because your fee wasn’t high enough, you were mislead. I’ve spoken to people that have invested in BTC, but never actually made a transaction (they just left it on the exchange). They think it’s fast and reliable, many of them don’t even know how high the fees got. Bitcoin Cash is the original version that Satoshi put forth. Blocks were always meant to get bigger, this is extremely clear if you take the time to read some of what Satoshi has said on it. Bitcoin Cash is gaining adoption fast after it was forced to basically build itself from the ground up. I wouldn’t be so quick to dismiss it. 
1	1525701555	1	That was definitely a minor shill but not intended it was more of my qualms with bch

We have seen the world through a very centralized media, and now that the world is becoming decentralized we are waking up. If you cut out the bullshit this could be a really meaningful post.

0	1525666120	2	That ain't being shilled . They knew  they were rocks 
0	1525674194	2	We need to be friends forever...
0	1525678077	2	The flaw with everything we get shilled on is that most people don't necessarily act on their needs anymore, instead focusing on their desires. This leaves us unsatisfied by default, since there will always be someone with more, some new car that's better than ours, a bigger house etc. Might be an unrelated thought though as I don't see how decentralization would help here :P
1	1525712181	1	Hierarchy in wealth is difficult to avoid in free systems. However, we live in a world where wealth = power, and those in power make the rules so they leverage rule making to break the ladder towards the top of the hierarchy. That needs to end. That’s what decentralization (of money) does. Decentralization of energy and internet service will be similar; utilities and ISPs have all the power which they leverage for their own benefit and survival at the expense of customers. The power to break away will be with the individuals, not the incumbents.

1	1525681084	1	I agree but that’s what the OP seems to be talking about - we’ve been shilled stuff the shillers don’t really believe in.
0	1525693713	2	Guys, if you want to see how the majority of your life is shilled, read the books by these authors:- Robert Greene.- Nassim Taleb.- George Orwell.Those 3 authors I only read some of their books, totally changed me personally and my outlook in life, you have to be strong mentally to read them though.
1	1525697361	2	Anti fragile is a awesome book crypto longs should readWe gain from disorder
2	1525697566	2	Yup, it’s a book that gave me the mentality to dive into crypto, in the book he says that life is too short to not take the risk.Right now reading Skin in the Game, another exceptional book by him.

1	1525702460	0	Right, I like it myself,  but industrial mass produced in the 80 s especially by planters was over irradiated ... There's more radiation in planters peanuts than any natural food source.  Also there was aluminium contamination that wasn't "known" so they never got in trouble, planters sold peanuts to major peanut butter brands. they just had to update their equipment. So alot of parts got switched out with PLASTIC instead.   Now planters just have more BPA than most products.   Thats another thing.  Things get thrown in our face in a deceptive manner.   Companies of plastic containers advertise "BPA free" but don't tell the customer that "its instead made with BPS which is just as bad all they did was switch the formula up enough to be legal be able to say "BPA free"Theres no laws saying "you cant deceptively hide behind the truth on good facts "It should be illegal to put anything dangerous to our health in our food.  Kids should be taught nutrition in school. This alone would cut the cost of medical insurance. This alone would also hurt big pharma.   A health conscious nation fully educated in nutrion would cost big pharma Billions and billion because everyone would be more healthy.  Less people would need health insurance and the whole making profit off the peoples health would,disappear.  
2	1525703696	2	> in the 80 s especially by planters was over irradiated ... There's more radiation in planters peanuts than any natural food source.Sigh.  Ok, let's get some science out of the way.- Irradiating something (e.g. to sterilize it) does not "store" radiation in the material unless you hit it with a massive amount of energy.  Induced radiation does not happen with food-level irradiation energy- Induced irradiation usually requires alpha particle radiation, which is spectacularly bad for actually sterilizing food/objects.  Alpha particles don't penetrate far at all (your skin will stop most alpha radiation).  Food iradiation is often gamma or xray- Food doesn't "store" radiation just because it was hit by radiation.  Your body doesn't store up xrays from the dentist, or from a CT scan.- Peanuts are naturally radioactive because they contain potassium.  Just like bananas.  Relevant XKCD: https://xkcd.com/radiation/  Note that you receive more dosage from flying or living at elevated altitude than a banana.

0	1525677234	1	I really like most of your list, but the reason peanuts are cheaper is because they're legumes, not nuts. They don't require expensive orchards to grow, require less (but still substantial amounts of) water and are self-pollinating.  The other (actual) nuts are more nutritional, but peanut butter itself is a great food in and of itself, at least the pure ones without additives.

0	1525684169	1	It's called advertising yeah, nothing to do with decentralization whatsoever
1	1525706228	1	Oh sure it does. Companies can advertise dangerous food additives because a central power says "its ok" not because "people said it was ok" .If everyone was educared on trans fat before it was passed by centralized power than most people would say "nah we dont want it in our food" So the whole reason major companies,can offer cheap products is because they use shit cheaper ingredients that sre bad for the heslth.  If they were forced to use only,healthy ingredients, non BPA/BPS packaging, no aluminum tanks...then costs would rise and that would open up the door to more competition.    They can advertise garbage becsuse the  Centralization system let them do it.  Christopher Columbus was advertising?  "You have to go to college to get a good job" isnt?  Clearly you dont need a college degree to get a good job. I'm going off on a rant here unrelated to,your comment.An education, a certificate , or running a business. You don't need a business degree to run a business either, you need experience.  Working as a caterer for my step father growing up taught me all the do's and don't when running a small business.   I have more experience with the know how to run a business than,someone with a masters in business.  Degrees only show dedication, preparation and the ability to be successful in whatever position you're applying for.     But experience shows,the same thing when your work proves it,  thats why guys with engineering degrees work below me fpr the first 2 years when they get hired. Its very rare I come across an engineer fresh out of college thats up and,running,full force in less than a year.  I even seen apprentices out perform engineers in certain areas .   I have 10 years experience as an industrial HVAC service tech, and I'm fully licensed  = more experience than an degree.         Life was just one big advertisement.

0	1525703624	1	While I do agree there is a lot of propaganda and shilling going around. But education, though some may not agree, is a solid path to follow.Not everyone knows their skillset or has talents. They just know they either like numbers or words and they get a degree in a field they may be interested in. Usually with the goal of having a stable job. Decent pay. And not worrying about any work related pain in the future.If youre after money, you could easily pick any construction related work and gain very nice amounts. But 10 years later who knows what symptoms you'll get. ( talking about fumes, back pain, injuries, accidents etc. )I understand where you're coming from though.  Usually degrees dont "work" because either theyre too niche or outdated ( 7th century Byzantine literature degree )

0	1525705562	1	Lets get meta: This anti-shill post could be shill.
0	1525705712	1	The whole “you have to go to college to get a good job” concept is certainly not good advice across the board, but getting a college education in:A) An undersaturated fieldB) A “future-proof” industry&C) An in-demand industry Is still the best way to get a good job and have long term growth potential.If you can be a welder, electrician, plumber, etc. without going to college or by just doing a 2 year certification, do that. Just know that your job will constantly be in jeopardy of being replaced by a robot, and you won’t have a viable business you can pass on to your children.
1	1525707221	1	What fields would you consider to fall under all three categories? I’m struggling to think of a high paying job that robots won’t first replace before replacing the trades. 
2	1525713710	1	* Psychiatry (software is decades if not hundreds of years away from being able to do this)* Marketing & Sales (automation software exists for many tasks but nothing can write copy for you, and predictive software is a lifetime out for doing this well enough to even be considered)* Management (humans are overwhelmingly uncomfortable with the idea of a robot managing human resources. Until this perception changes in society, it won’t matter if a robot could do it better. We are centuries away from this.)The *first* things to be replaced fully will be the trades. Already we are seeing welders in factories go away, not only is the practice of welding outdated for a lot of previous uses (why use a weld nut when you can use a river nut?), but a robot can weld far faster in virtually all scenarios, and is already cheaper for high volume spot welding and arc welding. It’s only going to be a short time before these machines get smaller, cheaper versions that can replace humans in small production run factories at a cost effective level. Most of these jobs won’t outlast the current workforce, let alone the next generation.Things like plumbing and electrical work will be slower to go, but it’s still a series of highly predictable, programmable actions. All you need is a mass producible robot with the dexterity and finesse of a human (we are getting pretty close with prototypes) and these jobs will quickly be gone. Electrical work in particular will be replaced because the insurance for a human worker to do these jobs is extremely high.

4	1525676210	2	Do you have any peer reviewed scientific research to back that up or are you just spouting vegan bullshit? 
5	1525677029	-1	Read the China study. Most comprehensive peer reviewed research you'll ever find. Also, have a look at death demographics compared to industry consumption. These facts have been around for many, many years. Look up Dr. Milton Mills, Dr Esselstyn or T Colin Campbell. These are some of the most well respected Drs in their field.I'm not going to force you to do research though. You can keep consuming the lies you've been told. I didn't to go vegan because I wanted to, I did it because I live my life based on fact and research. Find one peer reviewed study (not funded by industry) that says consuming dairy and meat prevents heart disease and cancer. Seriously try, I've already been there.
6	1525677372	3	the fact that you are vegan and use some obsecure chinese study already tells me enough. That you assume milk and meat are unhealthy because they don't prevent heart disease and cancer is kind of sad. Just because it does not prevent it, does not mean it causes it.
7	1525677877	3	Lol obscure. It's a study done by an American doctor who's parents were farmers. It literally proves, that meat and dairy, do in fact trigger the growth of cancer cells, and that a diet based on plant protein not only stops it but in many cases can reverse it.What the fuck would my motive be to go vegan other then health, the planet, and the benefit of animals? I have no financial incentive, It's a pain in the fucking ass, and I've had to completely stop many of the traditions I once enjoyed. General society and industry (animal ag and big pharma) have everything riding on the consumption of these products. They will tell you everything you want to hear.
8	1525677983	1	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_China_StudyJust a quick review on what this study implicates, and how it's a little more reveared then you seem to understand.
9	1525677992	1	**The China Study**The China Study is a book by T. Colin Campbell, Jacob Gould Schurman Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University, and his son Thomas M. Campbell II, a physician. It was first published in the United States in January 2005 and had sold over one million copies as of October 2013, making it one of America's best-selling books about nutrition.The China Study examines the relationship between the consumption of animal products (including dairy) and chronic illnesses such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and bowel cancer. The authors conclude that people who eat a predominantly whole-food, plant-based diet—avoiding animal products as a main source of nutrition, including beef, pork, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, and milk, and reducing their intake of processed foods and refined carbohydrates—will escape, reduce, or reverse the development of numerous diseases.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
8	1525678663	1	A single study with such a low sample size is not enough to prove anything scientifically. Why all you vegans are so paranoid is beyond me.  
9	1525679747	1	Low sample size? This study is respected largely based on its massive scale. It's also not the only study that proves these things, just the one that is best for explaining to the laymen what is happening within their diets. Don't be paranoid though. Let these diseases creep up on you. You'll learn eventually. You're only hurting yourself...... and innocent animals, and the planet. But let's just worry about yourself for now.
