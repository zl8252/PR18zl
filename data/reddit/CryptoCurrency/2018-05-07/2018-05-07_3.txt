0	1525688515	23	It's great to see things coming to fruition with Quoine and Liquid. The impact of this, and Liquid in general, go far beyond just Qash and is significant for Crypto as a whole.It's also good for Qash... Which makes me happy too!
1	1525688908	7	what makes you say that qash would be significant for crypto as a whole? i just glanced through their website and stuff (not the wp) but its unclear as to why its being billed as such a game changer 
2	1525689487	12	Not Qash, Liquid itself. Liquid will connect exchanges. If one exchange offers USD/CoinA. And another offers CoinA/CoinB then liquid will let you do USD/CoinB, doing the trades in the background.This opens up the market significantly for all of Crypto, but even this is only half the picture. By joining the exchanges via the world book liquidity is massively improved. Instead of lots of small cups of liquidity with volatile prices they are joined into a larger, more stable, pool. Liquid gets you the best price from ANY connected exchange at the time of trade.Qash is separate from this, and is not required to use Liquid. 
3	1525703888	5	More or less an end to arbitrage, too.
2	1525689227	8	You should watch this interview with the CEO of Liquid/Qash. You can thank me later ;\)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl\-\_ZX4dpfc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl-_ZX4dpfc)
3	1525689654	5	thanks ill check it out 
2	1525694196	4	Then do more reading instead glancing and look into the liquidity problem businesses have.
0	1525679835	18	Work it!
0	1525680071	16	Sounds great
0	1525686602	12	I've been watching QASH/QUOINE for a while, there are a lot of expectations from this project in certain circles, glad to see something is happening. Though didn't have any idea they were into building an ICO platform, pretty cool.
1	1525690681	3	I've been shilling QASH/QUOINE for a while. QFT.
0	1525683207	12	Great job!!
0	1525680374	19	LIQUID is going to be one hell of a regulated complete platform. Looking forward to use it! 
0	1525679983	17	Sweet, this should help reduce the number of ICO scams
1	1525687096	18	QASH is gonna be huge! 
2	1525689691	1	I think their user experience is subpar
3	1525692651	9	They just did a UX revamp and other improvements will be visible when Liquid platform launches in less then a month.
3	1525692677	7	They are undergoing a complete revamp of design for liquid. 
0	1525695624	7	Vuulr, the first ICO launching under this platform is incredible. Full disclosure - I am investing myself and was so passionate about the project, that have also started playing a marketing advisory role due to my background as a brand manager at a Fortune 500 company. I don't however hold Qash, though Quoinex is my primary fiat-crypto exchange.I am investing because: - * It has been vetted by the Quoine team and approved as the first ICO on their platform, who have one of the most secure exchanges (in my opinion) * The token economy/mechanics are incredibly thought out and address the token velocity problem in crypto. There's also staking from the beginning* Superstar team: have been to their office and met quite a lot of the team, this is a real business with top talent behind it and they're hiring more people* There is a strong investor hook and consumer hook (for us marketing geeks this is awesome)* The product and business has strong traction with quality partnerships to be announced soon. They're simplifying a $240 billion industry and saving media buyers and sellers huge amounts of money* Guaranteed listing on Qryptos; so many ICOs fail to get listed on any larger exchanges which is why I hardly have made any ICO investments in the past* Hard cap is tiny for a project of this sizeGreat summary on what Vuulr is: https://www.vuulr.com/Vuulr-Summary-Apr2018.pdf    Affiliate bonus link: https://accounts.qryptos.com/sign-up?affiliate=KWgZT8ms167285Regular link: https://qryptos.com/ico/VUU None of this is financial advice, so please DYOR. 
0	1525687149	8	What is the best way to store QASH at the moment? Does it have its own wallet? Can can you explain its distribution, CMC seems to be incorrect 
1	1525687317	6	Circulating is 350mil. You can store it on MEW or any ERC-20-compatible wallet, like a Ledger Nano. Or there's always our exchange, QRYPTOS, which uses cold wallet storage. 
2	1525687753	3	I meant the non circulating, its always risky when there are 1 Bil coins but  only 35% is in circulation of the rest being dumped on to the market..
3	1525693235	3	We have no intentions of dumping on the market. 
4	1525697330	2	Sure sounds nice but still, are they locked away for a couple of years at least?
5	1525701870	2	[white paper, page 35](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/liquid-site/quoine-liquid_v1.9.pdf)
2	1525710082	1	Ledger Nano S. 
0	1525680751	11	Sweet deal. Better that ICOs are conducted on exchanges like these. This is a much easier path to convert tokens to value later.
0	1525693609	4	"QUOINE launches ICO Mission Control platform on QRYPTOS"  added for voting, proof and forecast on YEENOT TODAY https://yeenot.today/catalog/news/196QASH token need for participation? it is time price follow up?
0	1525684524	3	how in the hell do you pronounce "QUOINE" 
1	1525684886	4	"Coin"
1	1525684715	2	Maybe like „Coin“ but with a U after the C
1	1525701065	1	Kwoyne
0	1525687965	2	are the icos gonna be on the ethereum platform? 
1	1525688153	2	Yes, at least the initial ones. 
0	1525702631	2	I love the idea but what is the use for the qash token? 
1	1525709961	1	QASH will give you similar benefits to what BNB does but more extensively as they will provide more services than Binance. This will all be clear when the LIQUID platform is released. The ICO platform is just one part of the LIQUID platform. 
2	1525710718	1	So coin burns and what stuff?
3	1525712356	1	No. Discount in fees, QASH as a settlement token between the exchanges that partner up with LIQUID and later on they have utility within the PoS when they launch the blockchain. The latter is future talk. 
0	1525690637	3	Hey man. Some honest customer feedback; th3 exchange qryptos is OK in terms of UI and it's okay to use.  However, withdrawals are a nightmare and so is your support. I initiated a withdraw last Thursday and still nothing. In crypto world this is a huge thingFor this reason I am staying away from anything quoine does. Bad experience so far
1	1525695102	8	I hear you. Withdrawals have been a pain point. We process withdrawals manually from cold storage. So the system hasn't been quite efficient enough to meet the surge in demand. We just recently addressed this in a statement: https://np.reddit.com/r/QASH/comments/8hg1yn/a_note_for_our_community_on_withdrawal_times_from/Similarly, we're introducing an automated KYC system. The bulk of our support tickets and for withdrawals or verification. We're tackling those two issues head on and should soon have them smoothed out. That frees up our customer support team and will mean they can respond quicker to other issues. We did recently bulk up our customer support team by adding a whole new unit in the Philippines. Also worth noting we are also working to improve UI/UX: https://medium.com/@QUOINE/simplifying-the-crypto-exchange-experience-2d3f5ba3c1cf This will continue as we work towards launch of LIQUID platform. So I can only apologise for your experience so far, but hope that you'll give us another look at some point. If you have an issue you'd like looked at currently, find me (@Vanalli13) on Telegram and I'll get it looked at. 
2	1525702695	3	Thanks for response.  Will be following your progress for sure!
1	1525690811	6	They announced yesterday they would make withdrawal time their highest priority. 
2	1525690904	1	Until they fix that, I won't risk getting my funds locked for days/weeks
1	1525692462	5	Yeah, this is a fair point.Qryptos has issues currently with slow withdrawal. And customer service can definitely be better.On the flip side it is one of the most secure exchanges out there, which is largely the reason for the slow withdrawals. But I totally get why you would want to see improvement before getting involved.
1	1525694386	1	Then don’t fucking use exchanges which store your coins in cold storage.Your comment is so absurd on so many levels.
2	1525694602	-1	Why you so angry?  Qryptos says that they process ur withdraw btwn 24 - 48 hrs.. its been 5 days for me and still processing.  That's where the problem is.. saying something and doing something else
3	1525695020	1	I’m angry because you don’t fucking read. They don’t operate withdrawals on weekends. Their terms are also in business days, not 24-48 hours. 
4	1525696484	1	Chill.Quoine have acknowledged directly there was a slow down in withdrawals recently due to the local holidays. They also said they saw it as unacceptable, hence the proposed improvements.
5	1525696805	1	His withdrawal isn’t late or slow yet. Thursday to Friday would be 24 hours. Then there’s today. Nothing is late; he didn’t read. 
6	1525698760	0	And Friday to Monday would be 48hrs right? So its late then :)
7	1525701603	3	Nope. Try taking time zones into consideration. 
8	1525702578	0	Ok I checked when I did it and it's been more than 100 hours (weekend included) and counting.  Do you really believe that's okay or just defending them blindly?  You know part of making a product better is actually admit its flaws and fixing them instead of denying it
9	1525703123	2	What the fuck bro??? You DONT include the weekend!
1	1525694017	0	> I initiated a withdraw last Thursday and still nothing. In crypto world this is a huge thing Lmao gues you never used coinbase 
0	1525703098	2	Good luck with that.
0	1525710016	1	Love QASH and Liquid. So much potential here to change crypto for the better.
0	1525689962	-10	Stay away, their manipulation is terribly done let alone whoever have developed their platform. Not their first scam, research is key.
1	1525692336	7	Do you have any evidence to back any of the above up?I have done my research and Quoine are, without a doubt, one of the most legitimate teams in the space. 
1	1525693167	8	Hi there. Not sure where the manipulation or scam bit comes from. If there's something specific you're referring to, would be happy to address it. We are a JFSA-regulated company, Big 4 audited, so we set high standards for security and other elements of the business.

3	1525706264	2	why do you insist on spreading lies? what's wrong?

3	1525706669	3	Okay, I'm done feeding the troll.For any who are interested. Here is the certificate translated to English. I'd encourage you to translate the original yourself.Quoine FSA translated https://imgur.com/gallery/UflGhhqEdit: For clarity: I have literally zero to do with Quoine beyond being an investor in Qash.
4	1525707601	-6	I understand you are dumb, the document you've linked to is uploaded to it's own folder, recently, that means you've rooted their server and have access to domain controls as well as the certificate issued is fraudulent. Why would a government use a fraudulent certificate, issued in Belgium without having their ownership verified? Thankfully criminals are usually stupid, I also managed to find your management and investment 'firms' who claim to specialize in the same field as your so called 'team' does. IPO scams are kind of out dated now, but your 'group' has a long record of those kind of things, should we spice things up and let everyone know publicly what's going on here? Or would I ruin your investments into your ICO/IPO scams by letting everyone know? We could make it a fun Monday evening since you seem chatty enough to cover your tracks :-)
1	1525704006	6	https://www.fsa.go.jp/menkyo/menkyoj/kasoutuka.pdfYou're welcome. Nice try though haha. Took me 2 minutes to find. Love how you acted like a threatening bad boy like you're going to do anything. 
2	1525706800	-2	A fraudulent certificate issued in Belgium, I mean your name couldn't be a better match. Well done on the root though, not so well done on hiding your tracks :-)
3	1525708395	2	Are you going through a psychosis or are you always this confused in your attempts at reasoning? Nothing about that sentence made sense. It's an official JFSA document, I'm not affiliated with QUOINE and it has nothing to do with the country I may or may not be a citizen of. So either you need help or this is a very embarrassing attempt of trying to make sense. Or you're on heroin. The document link has been on the QUOINE site forever. You might be the weirdest person I've encountered on Reddit the past 3 years. 
4	1525709092	-1	That response has nothing to do with reasoning. It simply means your name is very suitable as to where their certificate was fraudulently issued. No it's not a official document, because a official document would be in the license category, not in it's own folder created not too long ago. It's 'very' embarrassing how badly they have claimed things, the certificate has correalation to other DNS addresses, which I have no doubt they also have possession of. I like how silent they became now, I place my bets they're on telegram right now telling their 'head' someone knows too much, should we push him or try to counter with yet another terrible 'proof' of legitimacy.
5	1525709442	3	https://www.fsa.go.jp/search.html?q=Quoine
5	1525709534	3	Two things here possibly happened:1) You got embarrassed as you were super confident you were onto something but it turns out you just had to an extra 2 minutes of research on the official JFSA site and now you're saying random nonsense in hopes someone less educated here falls for it and joins you're anti-QUOINE agenda. This failed and now you have to keep saying nonsense as you're too deep in so you can't turn back.2) You're suffering from Apophenia. Your comments could be used as a case of someone developing Apophenia. Rarely've seen such a great textbook example.-I hope for your health it's just number 1. 
6	1525710332	-2	'Specialized in government regulations' You are a clown mate, JFSA site means zero since the license isn't found under the regular category in where licenses are posted. It's in it's own folder that was created recently. JFSA uses a fraudulent certificate which means obvious take over, you claim nonsense because you don't know what I am speaking about as you have no technical background. 
7	1525711137	2	1) Some more nonsense, keep it coming.2) I am not your mate.3) Yes, I'm specialized in government regulations and that's how I make my money, not bad for a clown. Some people here have actual great careers you know, unlike you. 
7	1525711062	1	Wow.Lol.
