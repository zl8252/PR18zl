0	1525678064	37	Your turn United States.
1	1525713247	1	The next 5-10 years are really going to show which countries are going to be a big player in the future global decentralized economy. 
0	1525678042	23	We all know how influential Korean trading was in the past. It would be great to see them return in full force. 
0	1525686096	14	Now is a good time to invest in Korean projects like ICON. Koreans are a lot more affine with technology as a people in general compared to the western world. A lot of Korean money will flow into the market, which is good for all cryptos.
1	1525705659	4	Erm ... no. After reading this and watching the Korean Pump and Dump of IOTA above $5 and below $2 before they've been excluded on KMC I'll say - no thank you (not even talking about XRP).https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/8h6mml/i_introduced_nano_to_50_people_in_south_korea_and/
1	1525707015	3	lol. I live in Korea. they like eating pork and kimchi and believe I kid you not if you eat black foods when you are pregnant your kids will have dark skin \(they see that as undesirable\) or if you eat duck when you are pregnant your kids will have web hands so wtf are you talking about?
0	1525703034	5	Your turn China.
0	1525703958	6	All these south korea "news" should be banned from this subreddit. Next week there will be an opposite "news" article about this. The circle will continue... Ridiculous! 
1	1525705536	5	It's funny because there is no way government regulation moves as fast as news about it on Reddit.   It's as if all Korean govt does all day is flip-flop on crypto regulations.
2	1525706865	2	Its become a standing joke.
0	1525703134	2	Ideas on popular alts with Koreans, other than ICX?
0	1525691595	1	Finally, this has been long waited. Expect more volume :)
0	1525693480	1	God bless this man 
0	1525696011	1	pawmp it
0	1525700282	1	 ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
0	1525705492	1	If its true this should help cryptos get stronger :\)
0	1525713353	1	The new title of these should be: Please help me get rid of my pos icx bags.  This would be vol. 10 ed. 5
