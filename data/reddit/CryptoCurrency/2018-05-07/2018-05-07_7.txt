0	1525702448	5	the best article i've read so far within this year, as there're so many crappy stuffs out there.
0	1525690884	17	The article is well-written with some useful information.
0	1525705178	5	Great project, the amount of marketing reminds me of XRB just before its run from $3 to $25. Just wait and see.
1	1525714543	0	Req was getting shilled here before xrb
0	1525692817	19	What was the initial distribution of REQ?   I'm getting a bit suspicious of the constant dominance on reddit here, with sometimes five topics on the /r/CryptoCurrency front page, but the price is just stuck below the top 100 on CMC or moving down even.Are some initial owners unloading all this time? Did the founders get a huge chunk? Or do they actually not have so much followers/fans and are brigading here or buying upvotes?   Anything else that explains the discrepancy?
1	1525695279	38	Slow but steady news, road map is hitting targets. Just seems like they are moving forward with development. They don't come off particular shilly to me and there has been no price pump.Edit: Check out their [mind map](https://www.mindmeister.com/991002501?t=R1iofDilV0) its quite comprehensive.
2	1525710436	8	This.  I'm more weary of cryptos that are obsessed with their valuation over providing a functioning product.  Req is about the product, and as long as they keep doing what they are doing, the product will sell itself then the valuation will come; not the other way around.
1	1525695173	24	Although it does not quite reflect in the price, Request network has a huge community. For example its subreddit with 33k+ subscribers is comparable to or even bigger in size than some coins in the top 20.
2	1525705554	1	put simpler: it was shilled here long ago so now there's even more people to shill it now.
2	1525698982	1	Good luck finding an equally large community in Asia however. Hence why you see reddit (western) popularity of a top 25 coin, but the volume of a much lower mcap coin.
3	1525701253	2	what are you talking about? the Volume is way better then many coins above it.
4	1525704154	4	Way better? Volume for REQ is really low on binance.
4	1525704010	5	How in the world do you people think 1.9m volume is anywhere near that of a top 25 coin? Perhaps I forgot to mention that REQ is by and large my largest holding so you fools wouldn't just instinctively downvote me.God forbid someone gives a logical reason as to why a good project has been held back in price.
5	1525706286	3	the 24 Hr volume for today is not what it has been for the past weeks, its been around 6-8 million. Im not saying REQ should be top 25 right now, I'm just saying its volume isn't a big issue and seems on par for what it should be for a coin that just had its main net launched. REQ is the type of token that wont have huge Volume until the stores this summer that plan to start to implement it. its not my biggest holding i actually have a small amount but its just one of those projects that I have a hard time finding any negatives about
2	1525707430	0	I am req fan too, but this argument with 33k subscribers is not a term of comparison for me, because a company that rise millions can easily throw couple of ten thousands $ for buying fake and real users. Cheers!
1	1525696653	26	then where is the price pump that comes along with this enormous 'shilling'? this coin is justy criminally underrated and undervalued. this should be a top-20 coin by now with the confirmation of all their recent partnerships.Crypto currency trading continues to baffle me.
2	1525707701	2	You're making my point. With all the attention it gets, it should have long been higher... > Crypto currency trading continues to baffle me.Amen to that.
2	1525705632	2	coins that get shilled heavily don't always pump, I mean look at TRAC and their posts, front page every other day for months, still like $50 mcap or something.
3	1525712518	1	> at TRAC and their postsHuh?
4	1525713545	0	TRAC is a coin that gets the front page no matter the quality of posts, several people here notice it and complain. Seriously any youtuber could review TRAC, post it here, and they'd have the front within an hour. It's not the community (I'm a TRAC holder and am in the telegram), but it's most certainly someone (or a couple people) that have several reddit accounts
5	1525713721	1	Honestly, never noticed this coin around here. I see REQ, VEN, ICX links - the usual bunch.
2	1525700366	0	or maybe other coins are overvalued instead? req is currently worth $170m and nobody uses the product they released, looks still overvalued to me
3	1525701388	-2	[deleted]
4	1525704104	-2	and what the point of your post was?
1	1525696315	13	As an ICO investor in Request Network I can tell you that their distribution went smooth and if I remember correctly about 15,000 unique people whitelisted with KYC. Projects this size also have vesting. There were however a closed pre-sale for individuals with special interest in the ecosystem.I doubt that the 'low' price got anything to do with distribution but that must people barely understand it or the lack of hype from team. Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge believer in the team and love that we don't have pre-pre-announcements. 
2	1525702338	2	Yes, I couldn't get on the whitelist because it was full. Only got in on the January-March dump
1	1525695011	12	I believe it is just incredibly undervalued.
2	1525700440	4	I keep saying it but it's the token burn aspect. People don't understand it and it can be hard to convince people of the value proposition. 
3	1525702043	6	This is what I think as well. It even took me a while until I had that breakthrough moment. Most people think of token burn as just taking coins out from a set amount reserved for that, and it not affecting the price. But the fact that tokens are market bought to pay for transaction fees is completely different. You have buy pressure that slowly ramps up, coming from all angles of the platform they're building. Most people won't understand this until it actually starts to happen, and that's when REQ moons. 
3	1525705146	2	I may not get it, but isn't the REQ token burn abysmally small? Like it would take thousands of years to consume the supply? If that's the case, how is the price going to increase? Also, if that is not the case then and the burn is really fast what happens when we run out of REQ?
4	1525706239	3	The supply is obviously meant to never be fully consumed, otherwise there would be no tokens for fees. The fees scale with token value, so yes, all other things being equal the supply decreases token value increases and number of tokens burnt decreases.For the supply to be fully consumed all 18 decimal points of the ERC20 token would need to be consumed, this will not happen. If it did, the token could be forked to add decimal places.
4	1525705471	2	That's a question I keep asking and either I don't get it or I haven't found a good explanation. REQ needs to move towards an OMG style staking system, IMO. With fees distributed to holders. 
5	1525712639	1	> REQ needs to move towards an OMG style staking systemThey still may, if Plasma comes through.
4	1525705746	-3	Why did Request even need a token? Just build the platform, I know that doesn't involve making a bunch of free money for yourself but you still get the job done...
5	1525712733	1	> Why did Request even need a token? Just build the platformToken's role hasn't been fully defined yet. It's fuel for network, sure, but there may also be staking (Plasma progress-dependant), management/voting system. Give it time.
5	1525706066	-2	I whole heartedly agree. Why not just write the code that takes advantage of the Kyber network (which to me seems to be doing the heavy lifting anyway) and allow transfers as needed? What does a distributed token bring to the table for this project? Always ask yourself this question in order to really filter the good projects from the not so good ones. 
6	1525707565	4	I believe the token is a better way to raise money and then redistribute it to the potential developers. Req is not intended to be just an exchange/ POS app, but an entire seamless platform for accounting/auditing/invoicing. Req token powers the entire platform, but people using platform will not have to worry about buying the token as it is all done in the background. 
6	1525706820	-3	>Always ask yourself this question in order to really filter the good projects from the not so good ones.I can't count how many projects i've wanted to invest heavily in just out of interest... then I see they've incorporated some shitty token that will prevent adoption massively. 
7	1525708274	2	Can you explain how they have "incorporated some shitty token that will prevent adoption massively"?As it is with the REQ token you don't need to buy it yourself to use the network so I don't see how it will actually prevent adoption. As it all happens automatically. 
8	1525709368	1	>"incorporated some shitty token that will prevent adoption massively"wasn't directed at REQ. I have nothing against the platform, I just have no desire to buy the token over better investments
8	1525708982	0	> you don't need to buy it yourselfwhich means the token is useless and there is no need for it.
9	1525709220	2	Nope you are either thick or not trying to understand. You as a user don't need to buy REQ and the Request Network actually buys it for you when you make the transaction automatically.BUT YOU NEED REQ in order for the transaction to happen. Do you see the difference?
9	1525709083	1	No, it means that the token will have a very real demand based on real market pressures dictated by use of the platform. 
9	1525715027	1	the "need" is built into the system itself, it's a crucial part of the ecosystem. as a user you don't need to worry about it because it happens automatically... it's not that hard to understand. as more people use the system, more token gets burned as fuel/fee --> less tokens available --> value goes up
5	1525706885	-2	I rarely agree with you on things but I do have to say you are probably right here. I would have preferred if REQ just raised X amount of ETH to fund the dev work and then built a intuitive crypto payment gateway with auto conversion to a stable coin like DAI on the backend. They could even auto take their fee in DAI at the time of conversion. I think its a great project but I doubt the token will appreciate because it seems unnecessary to the ecosystem.
3	1525704366	1	For the token burn to be effective, the product needs to be adopted way more than now. Or doesn't the burn works that way?
4	1525705215	2	That's how the burn works, but what I'm saying is that kind of system really hasn't been implemented in any other financial system. The average person doesn't get it. 
1	1525704286	2	There are a large number of small holders of REQ.  Lots of people have a small proportion of their portfolio in it but I haven't seen many who have it as a big chunk since it is a high risk, high reward play.
2	1525708527	3	How did you go about doing this portfolio research? I'm actually very curious. As with any research you need to get a good amount of people who are diverse enough to give you a fair representation of this audience you're thinking of (CC audience?).Or this based on your friends portfolios? I'm very curious as I know people are not too comfortably sharing their portfolios always. And you can't really give a believable statement like you did based on a few random people on some random threads here and there on Reddit.Otherwise I could say something like people who make portfolio statements on Reddit are always basing their statements on ill research and hasty judgements, based on yours if that's the case? :D
3	1525709743	3	A combination of things.  On the one hand, people frequently post their portfolios for critiques on /biz/ and quite often talk about the contents on reddit, so it's not too hard to get anecdotal data.  I have heard a lot of VEN holders speak about being all-in, or 50/50 but I don't think I have ever heard the same from a REQ holder.  Of the dozens to low hundreds of portfolios I have seen, REQ has consistently tended to only account for 5-15%, where it is present (normally sub-10%).  Of course it's possible that the sample are atypical but you base your conclusions on the data you have available.That said, it's really not hard to check and I have seen people post analyses of the total REQ distribution quite a few times.  I can't find any links to such parsing right now but you can just look at the wallets themselves to check.https://etherscan.io/token/0x8f8221afbb33998d8584a2b05749ba73c37a938a#balancesOut of the 36,000 REQ holders, only 150 or so have $100k or more worth and 35,000 of the 36,000 have less than 20k worth.  Compare that to VEN holders, where every one of the top 1000 wallets has at least quarter of a million dollars in it.  As I say, other people do more sophisticated analysis and you could also run a program to just look at what else is in the wallets of people holding a given coin, so these questions aren't as opaque as similar ones about share portfolios might be.Then there is also other comparative data to inform your views.  Given, say that WTC has 30% fewer holders than REQ but 500% of the market cap, the (mean) average WTC holder is holding much more value in WTC than the average REQ holder is holding in REQ.  Again, it's not decisive but its pretty indicative and I think it's reasonable to extrapolate from this kind of data when it matches closely with the anecdotal stuff. 
1	1525694385	1	just thought the same thing. 
0	1525689558	2	Great article!
0	1525704927	2	Serious question, why should the REQ token gain value? I mean do we need to hold the token?
1	1525705173	8	Everytime a transaction is done with Request Network, it is burning REQ as a fee. If the payee pays with something else than REQ the network converts the fee in the given currency automatically to REQ and burns it (decentralized exchanges - i.e. Kyber Network)With the constant burning of tokens - when using the Request Network z the total supply will shrink and so the token will gain more value.For an overview of the current burnt tokens, here is a website with a tracker: http://reqtokenburn.com/
2	1525709145	1	Who will drive price higher (i.e. who is bidding more for the coin?).  The burn rate has to scale down at some point as well which is bad for the price.   
3	1525710228	1	The burn rate scales with the price of Request.  If Req = 1$ and the fee is 1% you burn 0.01 of a Req.  If req is 2$ and the fee is 1% you burn 0.005 of a token.  It's automatically scaled with corresponding price.
4	1525714383	0	This doesn't result in a higher price for REQ. The higher the price of REQ, the less tokens are burned.
5	1525714472	1	Wasn't speaking to it resulting in a higher price though.
2	1525705227	1	Will this lead to higher fees driving people away from use the pay with REQ?
3	1525705386	5	No the fees are calculated with an maximum: 0.5% of total request amount but a maximum of 1$ in total (someone correct me if im wrong with the dollar value)
4	1525705954	3	The fees are reduced at a rate equal to the burning of tokens I believe so as to prevent fees skyrocketing 
1	1525705325	4	Supply and demand. The user doesn't need to own the token as tokens are brought and burnt by anyone making a transaction on the network. The more Transactions on the network the more Req tokens burnt, the lower the supply the higher the price.  
2	1525705706	1	Yes, but then you get other problems like too high of a fee driving people to other payment solutions. Don't you agree?
3	1525706109	3	Fee rate does not change.
4	1525714608	1	rate doesn't but as price of coin goes up the fee follows, unless there's a hard cap like $1? someone clarify
5	1525714742	1	It's a flat % fee based on size of transfer. Price of coin has no effect. 
2	1525709367	1	Ok, and when req price goes up the burn rate has to go down otherwise fees will be too high per transaction so less demand for req which brings price down.  No?
0	1525713450	-5	Oh another front page Req post. Tbh I am very interested in the project and have skimmed its white paper, but god damn it is shilled 24/7 here
1	1525715241	1	i thought it was shills too but then i actually took a look at it. it's actually really promising stuff. just do your research. to me this has a lot of potential
0	1525702777	-23	Shit coin, no adoption: everything will fail
1	1525703359	16	Shit comment. No explanation. Will sell all
1	1525703196	8	You must be fun at parties.
