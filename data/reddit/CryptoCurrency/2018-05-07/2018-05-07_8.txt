0	1525644763	214	Buffet likes slow, steady, stable, proven industries that produce small but consistent returns.Crypto definitely doesn't fit into any of the above categories.
1	1525648561	52	https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/08/warren-buffetts-one-word-answer-for-why-he-hasnt-purchased-amazon-shares.html  http://fortune.com/2018/05/06/why-warren-buffet-was-wrong-about-google-amazon/    You can't expect much considering crypto doesn't have a proven historical business record... Just like when he avoided tech in those days.  Essentially, we shouldn't care what Buffet thinks.
2	1525683103	-4	Asking Buffet about gambling (which this is) is like asking your doctor about that noise your car is making.
3	1525703436	2	its gambling to him because he probably couldn't even tell you what an IP address is. Anyone who takes the time to research isn't gambling. This guy makes his money on hostile takeovers anyway, I lol when I read "slow growth" or "value investor"
4	1525708974	1	What sources do you recommend for research?
5	1525711710	1	Its gonna take a broad approach if you want to make sure your money last. Look at the real uses and the technology. Ive spent my life in IT so I had a decent background to get started. Even today though, I may know how things work, but I need to learn programming to really see the differences between coins. Lots of the GEN 1 coins are just clones of each other. I use reddit, youtube, but not for opinions, just as indicators of new tech I should look into. Reddit told me not to invest in Ripple, Verge, Antshares(NEO), Thank god I did my research and still bought. XVG and XRP I got below a penny, Neo at like 20 cents. Lots of people tend to focus on things that have nothing to with the underlying technology. Don't listen to opinion, look for coins that solve real world issues. Even it if goes against the "crypto-anarchist" ideals. Sorry I cant be more specific, I there are so many good youtubers, I add and drop some every day. This SUB is also my top choice for finding out new coins. 
1	1525657462	16	I like red sauce pasta. It doesn't mean I should go bashing white sauce pasta.
2	1525658928	26	Go take your reasonable, well adjusted outlook on life elsewhere. Your kind isn't welcomed here. 
2	1525658961	12	Na fuck white saucers
3	1525690408	6	wscaucers
3	1525659071	0	How should we get em? Impaling or quartering?
4	1525659421	3	Drowning. In vats of red sauce
5	1525659599	2	Thanks Satan.
2	1525663766	2	Wow that is a terrible analogy.
3	1525683357	1	No, its perfect.  If you were asking him, as a pasta sauce expert, about whether motor oil would be good sauce.  Motor oil has its purposes, but the fact you are asking a pasta sauce expert whether its a good sauce means you're an idiot and it will end badly for you.  Crypto is NOT investing, it is speculation.  That may change in the future but it is very much the case today.  Buffet is not a speculator.  Asking him his opinion on it is a bigger sign that whatever his opinion is.
4	1525707739	1	> Crypto is NOT investing, it is speculation. That may change in the future but it is very much the case today.I'm very curious to know what you would consider the point at which it isn't speculative and becomes an "investment" in your eyes. I always considered every investment to have a bit of speculation so it's interesting to hear this point of view. How can a gradually evolving computer protocol somehow not gradually evolve out of speculation, but instead switch from "speculation" to "investment" at the snap of a finger?
3	1525665321	0	I apologise. 
2	1525683156	1	If I ask you, as a pasta sauce expert, whether white sauce makes a good shampoo then you are right to tell me it is rat poison and stop being stupid.AKA "Hello world reknown investor, so which horse do you think i should bet on as a solid investment?"
1	1525646178	20	I wouldn't mind 1-5% return anually if I had $200B to invest either. WB will be dead soon enough, and the people with his mindset are also a dying breed. Crypto has become one of the go-to topics at our family dinners. I suspect that will be the case for many families the coming years. 
2	1525658290	62	> the people with his mindset are also a dying breedNot at all.  People that go for small, reliable gains will never be a "dying breed".  You probably just think they are because you're spending your time on crypto subs on Reddit.  Losing millions/billions on a bad investment is different than someone here going all in to HODL with $500.
3	1525678064	-1	People who refuse to invest in crypto because they are unable to understand it are a dying breed.. Yes and no. I know lots of ballers that invest heavily in crypto. No one even remotely close to WB's level though. 
4	1525683568	4	That is because ITS NOT INVESTING.  Its speculation.  If a company with $20B in profit sees their $150 stock price suddenly go to $0.01, its NOT going to stay there because they are fundamentally sound.  If a cryptocurrency suddenly goes from $150 to $0.01, there is absolutely no reason it shouldn't stay there.Unfortunately, you are correct that people who can't tell the difference between investing and speculating are not going anywhere.You can make millions playing poker, it still doesn't mean you're fucking investing in poker.  
5	1525684966	1	Are you fucking stupid? Do you honestly believe that we won't see a massive increase in stream revenue from crypto companies during 2018? Look at the amount of BaaS and Protocol, transactional and auditing blockchains are being establied. Alot of these companies are getting ready to launch their mainnet in q2-q3. Which means?!?!?!? Paying customers. You make it sound like stocks are purely non-speculation. Off the top of my head I could name 5 mid-mcap companies that are ALL reliant on getting a license or a contract to be able to make money. Yet are priced in the billions allready. You're unable to spot the future cashcows in crypto, that's fine. But please shut the fuck up about stocks, bonds and derivatives being a better investment. The market crashed 10 years ago, bet that felt like a fucking great investment that could never go to shit. Loads of $10-30b companies are now worth cents on the dollar because of it. If you can expect dividends, you're investing. You have no idea if disney will pay dividends next year or not. The same goes for whatever in crypto. Historically speaking, there's no market that has crashed so much, and so hard as the stock market. Please tell me again how much safer my money would be there. 
6	1525688194	3	1) "are getting ready to launch their mainnet" - it is still in the future. The companies are moreover new and have no history. Most of the leaders behind those projects / companies do not have the experience you'd expect from someone who manages so much invested capital. I love crypto but it is a highly speculative and a textbook example of a bubble.2) Speculation is not binary. Yes, you base your valuation of stocks / bonds / der. on future expectations; thus, you do speculate to an extent. But you do so by using tried and tested methods, which have consistently yielded results.  There is no speculation as in crypto. Here you have a new company with mostly fresh management which has gathered millions due to the strength of crowd financing and which has promised X, Y and Z. They are not bound by anything to deliver. Moreover, you cannot evne be assured of the product because they (on average) have no product whatsoever. Some hadn;t even released testnets...3) There is no "better investment". Using such terminology shows you are incompetent when it comes to portfolio management / investing. Everyone invests with respect to their risk profile. I can indeed throw $500 on some really boom-or-bust coin which might give 10x but some people cannot afford it.4) Historically, crypto has crashed the absolute most. Also, its business cycle is fucking miniscule. We have had quarters with more than one sizeable crash. Don't be extreme in your views. It makes you short-sighted.
7	1525690699	-2	>There is no "better investment". Using such terminology shows you are incompetent when it comes to portfolio management / investing. Everyone invests with respect to their risk profile.
2	1525663266	11	So... you're saying that anyone who is close to retirement or at retirement are a dying breed? Most of your investments should be in a combinations of bonds, cash, and slow, yet steady growth assets in your later years.You're a fool. I dare you to put a significant amount of your retirement funds in something as volatile as crypto when you're 60+. You won't do it. Easy to bash investment strategies that are actually sound when you don't put your own money where your mouth is.
3	1525683747	1	I would venture to guess that most people saying stupid shit like that don't have a 5 digit net worth, nevermind 10 digits.
3	1525677914	1	I'm saying people who thinks crypto is an investment not worth making are a dying breed. No, most of your investments shouldn't be in bonds, currency or assets. They should be in whatever your risk picture represents as best. You talk like a chump. You have no idea how much money I've got invested, yet you proclaim that most geezers have more to lose than myself. Your entire argument is baseless just because you have no possible way of knowing this 1 tiny bit of information. It's impossible for me to say what I'll do at 60+.. What I will say is that after 60, I doubt I'll give a shit about my investments anyways. I make the money I'll need in 30-40 years, today. 
4	1525688854	2	> I'm saying people who thinks crypto is an investment not worth making are a dying breed.Lol, no. We're nowhere there yet, although much progress has been made.> You have no idea how much money I've got invested, yet you proclaim that most geezers have more to lose than myself.It doesn't matter how much you have invested. There are principles of investing that you just don't break based on your age/risk tolerance. Hey, if you want to risk it all when you're retired, be my guest. You can circlejerk around mooning and lambos now. Objectively speaking, neither you or I have 0 idea if crypto will even be a thing in 5 years since it's in the infancy stage. >I make the money I'll need in 30-40 years, today.Lol, ok. Have fun being a trillionaire.
1	1525649475	2	Not really accurate (at least over time). That's only somewhat true today because his holdings have grown too big at this point. Take a look at what he was into when he was first getting going.
1	1525660227	2	And he likes industries/businesses that are simple to understand, or that he can understand. Another reason he isn't into crypto at all. 
2	1525670366	0	If he doesn't understand it then perhaps he shouldn't publicly bash it.
1	1525686666	1	This.
0	1525644139	22	He's been successful making money doing what he knows. He's pretty open about not being an expert in tech and sat out of the dotcom boom. Same thing again here.On the digital gold side of the conversation, iirc he's not a fan of investing in actual gold either. (I know he did buy some silver and other minerals before but that was out of character and more of a fu** let's see how it plays out move)
1	1525688986	2	Ya, he has even gone on record and said that the only reason he isn't investing in cryoto and doesn't recommend it is because he doesn't know enough about it to feel comfortable doing so. Honestly that is just the kind of level headed investment strategy I would expect from an investor of his caliber.
0	1525643950	27	I don't think it's him "hating" per se, it's just that he doesn't invest in what he doesn't understand. We understand crypto so we invest in it. Although we don't understand traditional brick-and-mortar businesses so we don't invest. Everyone has their own game they're playing.
1	1525646841	10	That may be true, but we don't normally criticize most of the things we don't invest in. His comments about crypto are active assaults. 
2	1525662672	8	Or he's actively "assaulted" by reporters asking him about crypto.The dude is 86 years old. He may not live long enough to see the emergence of the tech so it has no value to him.
3	1525668294	1	That and for many of people with great wealth like him or similar, crypto isn’t the right move. Yeah there’s lots of money to be made but if ur already a billionaire it seems a bit too risky to invest any significant sum when it’s just as likely you’ll lose it as u will gain from it. At the same time I feel people at those levels of wealth don’t really think about money in the same way ur middle class working citizen would so they don’t care if they lose a few million trying to gain a billion. I just think a large amount of people with that sorta wealth are better off being more conservative in their investments. Many also just like power. Fuck this comment is all over the place
4	1525685216	1	I know, its getting annoying as fuck.  This is speculation, not investing.  >if ur already a billionaire it seems a bit too risky to invest any significant sum when it’s just as likely you’ll lose it as u will gain from it.Exactly.  To a poor person a lottery ticket is a 0.0001% chance to get rich.  To a billionaire a lottery ticket is a 99.9999% chance they just wasted a dollar.  A billionaire would be playing for fun, not to realistically hope they win.People here love to flaunt guys like Draper, but what did he put in? $20M?  2% or so of his net worth at the time?  That's a fucking day at the casino for him.  A day at the casino that beat the odds and made him a couple hundred million.  Of course he's now pumping that casino since it pays him even more if he does.  Its a fucking game to him, not some super serious investment.  You don't see him putting his money where his mouth is.
3	1525681995	1	I'm sorry, but rational thought that doesn't agree with the masses isn't welcome here. Please change your stance to imply Warren Buffet is spreading FUD. /s
3	1525663615	1	Honestly I think this has a lot to do with it. The man is 86 years old ffs, when you’re 86 you’re probably not going to want to sit around and learn a whole lot about something that really isn’t going to pertain to you in your lifetime. He doesn’t have much time left, so he probably just wants to enjoy it investing in what he’s comfortable with and enjoys, and there’s nothing wrong with that. 
2	1525687893	2	he's mad because he missed out.
2	1525667875	1	I disagree. The main reason ppl criticize an investment or really anything is cuz they don’t understand it. Also many are trying reassure themselves that they made a wise decision to not invest so they talk crap about it. I doubt this is what Buffet is doing but many other are. Man if ignorance was a financial instrument that thing would fucking moon so hard. Lol 
2	1525684130	1	Or its aggravation that people keep asking him about bitcoin as an investment when its not an investment, and if you can't tell the difference between investing and speculating then you are in for a bad time. 
1	1525668491	2	Could u imagine if Buffet gave his “sign off” on crypto investing. People would likely flood in like A broken dam. 
2	1525681939	1	"Warren Buffet FOMO buys Bitcoin" would be the headlines lol
1	1525647865	2	Speak for yourself.
1	1525655832	2	He just see's the market an outsider and doesn't understand the driving force behind the scene. Of course he's bitter, its a great market compared to equites and he can't believe he missed the boat to understand it. What stock gives you: 1,059,218.12% ROI in 3 years? That's Verge BTW.He didn't grow up with technology and doesn't understand the virtual world. It's a revolution against the current institutions, not for what they are but how they function. Which is too slow and filled with elite classism. 
1	1525670536	1	🤣😂😂😂 We understand crypto. Yeah, rigth. 
2	1525672192	3	Look here motherfucker, I might not have read the white paper or have any relevant college degrees, but I’ve read a bunch of QUALITY articles written by journalists who know nothing about economics or cryptography!I’m on the hype train, and you’re an idiot for being off it! Everyone else on Reddit agrees with me so you’re clearly wrong!
3	1525681947	2	This guy gets it.
1	1525645812	1	No. He hates crypto and he’s not sugar coating it. 
0	1525675534	7	Yep.At this stage Warren is not an investor in banking. He is the bank.Crypto is the rat posion and he is the rat.
0	1525661793	5	Fuk that old fart buffet.  
0	1525657236	5	I understand that people have different preferences and also different levels of risk comfort. If it's not for you, then fine, that is your decision.But what I don't understand is why Buffet and some others feel the need to go overboard when denouncing cryptocurrencies.This is for a number of reasons:1. They do not provide any specific technical reasons for their hyperbole. Usually its some vague statement about the price movement. No intrinsic value, too fast too quick, bubble, sheeple following sheeple etc.2. They lump all cryptocurrencies together. **As far as they are concerned, Bitcoin and BitConnect are one and the same.** There is never any nuanced discussion about whether one has a better probability of success than another.3. Other than media attention, there is nothing for them to gain by denouncing cryptocurrencies so harshly. They claim they have no short positions so there should be no financial impact to them. So why not just say it is outside your risk limits instead of unnecessarily comparing it to "rat poison"?Quite frankly, it is just disappointing. Especially when you hear this coming from people you expect to be smarter (in being more considered, and more thoughtful about the merits of what they are examining).
1	1525660763	2	He employs smart people as does Jamie Dimon. They don't spew this nonsense because they're ignorant. They spread this crap because they recognise an existential threat to their business interests. Banks may adopt blockchain tech but they want private blockchains, they want patents preventing others from developing trustless public ledger systems. Transparency is the death of stock brokerages and investment banks.
2	1525675845	1	Basically they want the same thing as they do now but only under the name of blockchain so they can trick more sheep who were about to leave using their business.
0	1525666410	4	To everyone saying he only invests in what he understands, yes I get that BUT don't you think that if you do not understand something then you should not talk bad and negative about it just because its threatening to your current business model.Hey, I don't understand crypto but fuck crypto because I don't understand it.Cool story bro.I think at this point we should accept that he is an old grumpy man, who isn't ready for change. He said same thing for tech and failed miserably and going to happen the same thing with crypto.Just cause you're good at riding bike doesn't mean you should give tips about driving a car. PS: I have huge respect for what he has achieved. And I don't hate him.
0	1525661320	4	Its funny seeing  buffet saying such shit on crypto.back in 08 when the banking crises was in full force,no one heard a peep from buffet on how fraudulant banks were back them...so the bottom line for buffet is...banks are good to defraud people and crypto is bad for liberating them...good advice..not!
1	1525665643	1	Great point
1	1525676767	1	good point!!!! fuck that old dinosaur and his gay paedo friend munger
0	1525668036	4	His name is Buffett.A buffet is a system of serving meals in which food is placed in a public area where the diners generally serve themselves. Buffets are offered at various places including hotels, restaurants and many social events.
0	1525648959	6	Anyone banking with Wells Fargo at this point is ignorant.  Why would a serious investor continue to do business with that bank amid such incredible scandals unless he had an absolute disdain for the public? Otherwise he wouldve pulled out long ago. 
0	1525668042	3	Crypto definitely isn't for everyoneThat said, listening to very old men about emerging rtechnology is a terrible idea.
0	1525648108	5	That argument doesn't make any sense. Either he thinks cryptocurrencies are worthless, then he doesn't see them as a threat, or he thinks they are the beginning of a new era, then he could just invest, nobody's holding him back. There won't be a "too late" for investing. He's making profit, he'll keep making profit. Many people made losses while he made profit. So don't pretend to be smarter than him.  
1	1525705699	1	Like what do you expect? Huge amount of his holdings seem to be in the finance sector. Blockchain and alike techs (IOTA/Tangle) are there to interrupt those sectors. However as the tech is in the early stages it will take quite a while to get all this settled. So you are 87... what do you do? Do you seriously think he bothers taking all his finance holdings and put them into crypto... where you most likely don't even see the benefits anymore?
0	1525654776	7	Put this dinosaur in a museum 
0	1525647242	8	He is obviously very overinvested into the currentBanking paradigmTime to overthrow his kind
0	1525648474	10	What an ignorant and stupid comment. Nobody hates crypto, nobody is afraid of the crypto, there is nothing to be afraid of. If crypto somehow (impossible in forseeable future) starts to threaten banks, they can kill it in a heartbeat (they can't kill the blockchains but they can kill adoption and value easily) If there is money to be made wallstreet guys will do it better than a bunch of morons without any investment experience other than circlejerking with stupid memes. If you ever read anything buffet has written in his annual reports you can easily see why he doesn't want to invest in crypto, its exact opposite of his investment style.
1	1525668892	5	I think it’s very likely the banks have already tried to kill it to some extent. The difference being other very powerful people want crypto to succeed or at least rise in market value so they can profit from it in some way. I just believe the banking industry is so large, powerful and connected that either likely tried and got blocked(by other more powerful ppl) or they are secretly on board and have been working to incorporate crypto at some point. This is all just a perspective that I have my own doubts about, but I see it as def possible 
1	1525649823	1	Bitcoin thrived when it was essentially just used to buy drugs. You can't kill it, there will always be money in this space.
2	1525651777	3	But buying and selling it was still legal. 
3	1525652385	0	And buying drugs wasn't lol. You just need a decentralized p2p exchange and you're set.
0	1525657694	2	Guys, Warren Buffet is going to the same place as the rest of us: six feet under.  We're all just taking different paths to get there. Me, personally, am taking the path that includes driving my Crypto-financed Lambo on the Moon.    Winning!
0	1525661229	2	Er, Buffet's style is to only invest in safe things he understands. Buffet doesn't understand Crypto, so he doesn't invest in it. 
0	1525647833	6	Crony capitalists don't lke cryptos for many reasons, but the main one is that there is no bailout mechanism in place.
0	1525649734	5	Hm, yea that explains. Crypto for him is effectively suicide.. also as he is pretty much on banks side, it makes sense he defends it.
0	1525649864	2	Sup on that $5 billion, 5&#37; apr bailout loan buffet. Hook it up. Wish I can trick people into loaning me money for 3&#37;, while I make billions in crypto trading.
0	1525654922	2	He could support crypto if he felt like it, but he doesn't. He's very good at what he does and crypto doesn't fit into it. It's not like it's some sort of conspiracy.Next you'll be telling me he's setting up a global conspiracy against Amazon.
0	1525649944	2	Quite the revelation. Next you're going to tell us how Elon has a whole lot of stock in some car company.  /sLiterally zero information in here is new or useful to anyone under the age of 18. It was headline news every day during the 2007-2009 financial collapse that Buffet was buying up bank stocks, so much so that it was basically the social confidence equivalent of a second bailout.
0	1525657587	1	He can still turn around this ship and go balls deep in crypto.. imagine if in 2nd quarter he disclosed he bought 100,000 bitcoins. 
0	1525659530	1	Buffet does not invest in technology 
1	1525662898	1	Doesn’t he own a good chunk of Apple?
2	1525668978	1	So did my grandma and she refused to use a voicemail cuz “she won’t bring the devil into her house”. no joke
3	1525677906	1	“she won’t bring the devil into her house”HAHAHAHAHA 
2	1525695556	1	https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052515/why-does-warren-buffett-largely-avoid-investing-technology-sector.asp
0	1525662463	1	[deleted]
0	1525662649	1	He doesn’t invest in technology, how ignorant are people in this space? Dude never invested in AMZN, NFLX etc
0	1525664349	1	This is such a low effort post. Your $50 mil market cap ERC-20 tokens aren’t going to topple those institutions any time soon - Buffet has said time and time again he prefers slower, more predictable investments. Of course he doesn’t like crypto. 
0	1525665022	1	It's funny to see the reaction by this community dismissing his opinion, bashing him for bias and whatever else. Maybe he's right. He is also well known for investing in safe and classic American investments. 
1	1525665772	1	Yea, interesting exchange. I have mixed feelings after reading. I do believe that a large amount of coins will be worthless in time. 
0	1525666601	1	you know there's a word for a thousand million, right?
0	1525669089	1	I don\`t get all these warren buffet posts, why?
0	1525672384	1	I’m sure they really don’t have a complete idea about Cryptocurrency. I was introduced to Lamden TAU first and I was sold actually the project’s got good features which will attract people.
0	1525673772	1	Im a bit confused at how the numbers are done.... does $29,000\+ million mean $29bn?? does $20k\+ just mean $20k\+? Does $5.5k million mean $5.5bn????
1	1525674653	1	Twenty-nine thousand million. Like that.It should be $290B
1	1525692585	1	Yep thats such a complicated way to say denominations. Thousand, million, and billion is so much easier to say and understand
0	1525675255	1	The idea that these people are revered and somehow their opinions mean shit is what is wrong with the world.  Nothing against them personally nor their riches; it's the people who chug down the Buffett kool-aid that are the fools.
0	1525694495	1	There's always a reason...
0	1525711495	1	I agree they are idiots but those bank holdings are peanuts compared to what Berkshire is worth. He just bought 75 million shares of apple and that doesent begin to touch on what his holdings are worth
0	1525661436	1	I'll tell you one thing: Switching to Bitcoin over fiat would just give us different kind of "whales". Picture the Crypto market surging to 20 Trillion dollars, with BTC priced at over 3million$, ETH over 500$ thousand, Ripple at 10$, BCH at 100k$. The new whales would be the developers... and scumbags such as Craig Wright and Roger fucking Ver.I'm sorry but I think I'll take Buffet over Ver anyday of the week.
0	1525655419	0	From Old Wizard to Old Fool. 
0	1525657501	-1	Crypto is going to make huge money for banks. It’s a seemless tool to the banking industry which in and of itself is one of the most liberating industries in history for the common man. If you hate banks you hate normal people.
