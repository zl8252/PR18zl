0	1525640624	23	When exactly is the hearing tomorrow?

0	1525643279	27	The chairman did not explicitly say eth is not a security. I watched the US Senate hearing a few months back on cryptos (the one where Giancarlo tried to define HODL), and I must say the SEC Chairman seemed adamant in defining ICO's as securities. "As far as I'm concerned, these (ico's) are securities". I am VERY cautious on tomorrow. IF the SEC decide that eth is a security, and all exchanges must conform to US laws for securities, this can be one of the most significant events in crypto since mtgox
1	1525647477	44	I think the US vastly overestimates its influence here. Only exchanges *based* in the US will have to delist, the rest of the world will continue along fine. 
2	1525648453	3	Correct me if I'm wrong but jurisdiction extends to any exchange outside the US that involves activity by US citizens, which I assume is a hassle exchanges will want to avoid? Whilst I do agree that the US may be overestimating their circle of influence here I think it's dangerous to underestimate the reaction the market will have if the US decided on the crypto-security classification. Also, many other countries in the west are likely to follow suit subject to the efficacy of the legislation. 
3	1525651635	4	How can the US enforce this jurisdiction? Lets say there's an EU exchange that US citizens are using, due to the exchange not blocking them from using it. What do the US do?
4	1525659572	2	As an example, if an American wants to create a bank account overseas, the bank will ask the US citizen to fill out a FINRA form. All banks that want to do business with the US then has to report on the US citizen's bank account directly to FINRA. Since the US is a massive market, they are all forced to comply.In your example, the EU exchanges will either a) close the American accounts as they discover them; and b) not open new accounts for Americans. There are probably workarounds if you have dual citizenship or a PR, but at that point, those EU exchanges would very likely be breaking some local law that exists because of agreements with the US government.
5	1525660987	1	But lets say an American buys some BTC on a Coinbase (BTC definitely wont be considered a security), then sends that BTC to exchanges and trades to ETH or other 'securities'.They couldn't do anything about that.
6	1525661343	3	The governing mechanism can occur on a number of ends. If Coinbase has done its KYC and knows you're a US citizen, then it will simply bar you from sending your BTC to any exchange that isn't also completely in the clear. On the other hand, to trade on an exchange, you also need an account. The recipient exchange will identify who you are in the KYC process and simply not open one for you if you're American.
7	1525662423	2	>it will simply bar you from sending your BTC to any exchange that isn't also completely in the clearThat's silly. Would they also bar sending to private wallets? If not, then I can send to my wallet, then to another exchange.Not allowing people to send to their own private cold storage wallets is insanity.>The recipient exchange will identify who you are in the KYC process and simply not open one for you if you're American.Plenty of exchanges don't KYC, and there's plenty of non-exchange methods to change BTC to ETH, such as Shapeshift.
8	1525668644	3	Not sure what is unbelievable about any of this. It's not like this is news. Talk to any American who works overseas and they'll tell you what a pain in the ass it is to open a foreign bank/trading/investment/finance account. >>it will simply bar you from sending your BTC to any exchange that isn't also completely in the clearThis is a slight exaggeration on my part, but if Coinbase decides it might be liable for money laundering because they facilitated a transfer, they would be wise to refuse.>That's silly. Would they also bar sending to private wallets? If for example you were sending USD to a known terrorist private bank account, yes. Same concept applies to crypto. If your money is in a bank and you want to use your bank to finance a weapons deal, your bank will not process the transfer and probably alert the government to put you on a watchlist. If you do it wallet-to-wallet, no the government may not know, but if you're going through a 3rd party (i.e. an exchange), they're going to care.>Plenty of exchanges don't KYC, and there's plenty of non-exchange methods to change BTC to ETH, such as Shapeshift.KYC is just a process. You can KYC with fancy tech and all that, but most of the time exchanges just require a passport. They don't need extensive KYC to know you're an American. Many financial services across the world will flat out refuse service to Americans.GDAX/Coinbase, for example, refused to open an account for an American friend of mine in Singapore. He found a way around it, but technically, the fact that GDAX opened an account and allowed him to trade ETH through it is illegal. The Monetary Authority in Singapore could shut them down or kick them out of the country for that.

8	1525666164	2	Cheap citizenship of a third world country, anyone?
7	1525699656	1	Exchanges don't require KYC yet, unless you want to withdraw the highest amount possible. That and you have things like Payfair now, which is a decentralized escrow service and P2P exchange. You can't do shit against that. 
8	1525701442	1	Crypto exchanges are weird and operate in a twilight space. Exchanges for other financial instruments typically don't engage in the retail consumer space, so they don't need KYC either. Crypto exchanges, however, are actually closer to a broker + exchange. They will almost certainly be required to KYC in the future.>That and you have things like Payfair now, which is a decentralized escrow service and P2P exchange.That's fine but it's also inefficient and will become a liquidity bottleneck in the future, not to mention the security issues. Exchanges need to process on the order of millions per second. The fastest DLT might optimistically process in the tens of thousands per second. 
2	1525659317	2	US money is a pain in the ass to touch. If your business doesn't meet compliance with US law, it's probably both difficult and illegal to take American money regardless of where the US citizen is. Doesn't matter where your business is based.Moreover, most developed markets will structure their laws to be similar to the US once the US has made up its mind. This is a trend that has happened over and over again in finance. How the US decides to regulate cryptos will likely impact most of the countries across the globe.
2	1525694342	-1	No.Dumb money comes almost exclusively from the USA in ALL online schemes.Poker dumb money? Muricans.Sports betting dumb money? Muricans.HYIP/Ponzis? Muricans.Penis pill and whatever else you can send dumb publicities for affliate money? Muricans.etc.Muricans' disposable credit "income" is what runs the world, most of the world has 0-1k$ in credit when broke americans have 30k$+Canada is also pretty close, as a 17 year old i had a 9k$ credit limit with no job before the last financial crash
1	1525654384	3	HE was not referring to eth he was referring to icos launched on ethereum  or alt nerworks in initial coin offering
2	1525669850	3	ethereum itself was launched through an ICO though.
3	1525673474	1	NopeEth classic aka etc is original chain
4	1525674418	2	Doesnt matter. Ethereum was created through an ICO that may well have violated SEC regulations, and hardforking doesnt somehow magically undo that. Im not overly worried about it, since the SEC is about protecting investors, and no investors where financially harmed. I also dont believe ethereum could be considered a security today, but I wouldnt be surprised if Vitalik and the foundation get slapped on the wrist for their unregistered ICO.
1	1525675106	1	I can't say for sure, but I don't think Ethereum will get counted as a security. To me Eth is more of a digital commodity, a lot of tokens on the Ethereum platform are 100% securities though. 
1	1525677705	1	nope. He was talking about the scam ico's he prosecuted that we never heard of like Munchee. Those are the ones he thinks are securities which is why he shut them down.
1	1525646030	0	This. 
0	1525688614	2	Is there a live stream?
0	1525651930	5	Bought some ETH yesterday, it's a gamble but I think it will pay off.
1	1525700496	1	Why would you do that, if you knew this was coming...
2	1525705513	1	Because I think they will not declare ETH a security and the price will blow up after it is confirmed.
3	1525706142	1	You may downvote if you want but eth (and btc, and thereby the whole market) is clearly going down. Waiting a bit and buy now wouldve been the better choice ofc. I personally tethered eth from 700 till 800 and am slowly buying back again.
4	1525706657	1	I don't downvote people with different opinions.In hindsight, yes it would have been better, but I almost bought a few days before when it was over 800, so it could have been worse.
0	1525639715	4	Then why is there an SEC meeting about it tomorrow????
0	1525633114	1	M cmo
0	1525643367	4	This seems more and more like a publicity stunt.Its only logical that the SEC declare ETH aa a non security.Afterall,how many securities are you familiar with that can be created from thin air through miners!
1	1525649472	1	is there a place where the SEC have a guideline for how to classify different cryptos as security vs non security ?
2	1525652226	3	The term “security” meansany note, stock, treasury stock, security future, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a “security,” or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing. 15 U.S.C. §77b(a)(1).The importance of the definition of “security” becomes apparent in the area of private actions for securities fraud because the standard for establishing securities fraud is much lower than that for common law fraud.
1	1525650056	1	If 2% of US population holds Crypto (based on MasterCard numbers) it's the best time to declare it as a security before it hits mass adoption and investment-sphere.

0	1525656449	-5	Every idiot who is worried about whether or not ETH will be deemed a security must have forgotten about how ETH is working with the United Nations. No way it’ll be considered a security. 
1	1525673554	3	> idiotIs attacking the best defence against your own insecurity?
2	1525693842	0	Way to skip addressing the important parts of what I said.Oh wait...guess you can’t.
2	1525689162	-1	The best defense is offense, so yes. 
1	1525661103	5	UN has zero influence over US domestic policy
2	1525661650	-7	LmfaoOk keep thinking the world really works that way. 
3	1525661972	5	Please expound upon your theory of how the world works
0	1525661904	-2	 ETH on their webpage lists itself as a derivative which is a security.  Ethereum description is the definition of a derivative and how Bitcoin makes it said security.[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp) \-## What is a 'Derivative'A derivative is a financial [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) with a value that is reliant upon or derived from an underlying asset or group of assets. The derivative itself is a contract between two or more parties based upon the asset or assets. Its price is determined by fluctuations in the [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp). The most common underlying assets include stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, \(insert Bitcoin here\), interest rates and market indexes. [https://www.ethereum.org/ether](https://www.ethereum.org/ether)Ethereum would never be possible without bitcoin—both the technology and the currency—and we see ourselves not as a competing currency but as complementary within the digital ecosystem. Ether is to be treated as "crypto\-fuel", a token whose purpose is to pay for computation, and is not intended to be used as or considered a currency, asset, share or anything else.There are many ways in which you can use Bitcoins within the Ethereum ecosystem:* **Trade BTC for ETH:** multiple third\-party companies are working to make the exchanging of ether and bitcoins as easy and seamless as possible. If so desired one could trade bitcoins for ether with the purpose of executing contracts and trade it back immediately in order to keep their value pegged and secured by the bitcoin network. The latest version of the wallet includes an automatic conversion between ether and bitcoin.* **Use a pegged derivative:** Ethereum is a great tool for creating complex trading between multiple parties. If you have a source for the price of Bitcoin that all parties trust, then it's possible to create an [ethereum based currency](https://www.ethereum.org/token) whose value is pegged to the market value of Bitcoin. This means that you could trade bitcoins to a token that is guaranteed to always trade back to the same amount of bitcoins while still being fully compatible with other ethereum contracts
0	1525656232	-5	I think I, like many, are hoping Ethereum isn't classified as a security. I would be really surprised if it weren't, though.
