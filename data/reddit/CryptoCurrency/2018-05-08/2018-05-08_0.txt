0	1525753721	94	Man. Crypto has come so far in just a few years. In 2014 this was almost the endgame
1	1525790875	26	In 2017, we didnt know if Bitcoin was going to be banned/illegal.The moment it was 'legal', I decided to DCA 1k USD/week. Legal bitcoin is beyond my original hopes, I thought people would be running nodes against the US government's wishes and we'd have to trade BTC against the law.Everything that has happened in 2018 seems unreal.
2	1525803651	1	I can tell its not easy for them. Just look how many countries reacted to it. Still illegal in some.They don't want this currency but understand there really isn't much they can do about it. They realized it would be much better off adapting than fighting it and get caught flat footed when crypto starts to really spread and scale. 
2	1525803068	0	Are you really putting 1k a week into BTC, or are you diversifying into modern crypto?
3	1525803911	1	Yeah I'm 50% BTC and 50% USD each week.Id go 50% BTC and 50% SPY(its an ETF) after the economy recesses.I dont trust alt coins, they are far too unreliable and Bitcoin has solved its old problems.
1	1525786035	34	Lol, getting traded on a state sanctioned and regulated stock exchange was almost certainly not the endgame in 2014. I'm pretty sure the end game is so people can evacuate the outdated model of industrialized fiat fiance and mock monetary policy that is robbing the West of all of its excess productivity.A stock exchange is not seeing the digital forest for the crypto trees.
2	1525790933	6	Eh, legal bitcoin that is sold on multiple exchanges sound pretty good to me.From 2011-2017, there was monthly fears of a Bitcoin 'Ban'.
3	1525791921	-1	Yeah, but those fears were unfounded to anyone who understood the underlying technology.The general trend is open-source, decentralized, anonymous technology is pretty much state and censorproof. Bitcoin is one instance of that, and even if it fails, people will build better tools. Look at how far online piracy has come, or online blackmarkets. We're people prosecuted for engaging in those activities? Fuck yeah. Are your chances of being caught less than a rounding error? Also, yes.Its an exciting but terrifying time. So much potential for positive change, but also so much tragedy.This happens every time humanity has rode the crest of the disruptive waves of paradigm changing technology.The best you can do is see the writing on the wall, learn as much as you can about the technology underlying the paradigm change, and be ready to use those tools to survive in the new world it has carved out.Most people will not be early adopters, by definition. You want to be as early of a common adopter as you can. Do not be a late adopter. History tends to be very unkind to those people.
2	1525790778	5	I mean this literally open up billions of dollars worth of adoption. Sure the institutions will have a lot of sway on the markets, but it's a huge step to mainstreaming for the public. Just bc it's on an official exchange doesn't mean you can't still go through the normal methods.This is getting the biggest rubber stamp possible for the general public. Now true globalization of value exchange is actually on the horizon.The exchange books are going to get deep and the wild swings will taper off with that. Even if institutional buy in isn't part of the philosophy of crypto, it can only help in the long term. 
3	1525792526	2	I think you've misunderstood my position.All of this is a small stepping stone for the end game. Many people in IRC channels and Reddit, and many other social forums were talking about much bigger and better things than just getting on a legitimate fiat exchange back in 2014.You have to remember that this technology is born out of a culture of crypto-anarchy and for many early adopters would spell the end of statism.Part of that is the state breaking bread with the new tech in hopes to regulate and profit off of it, which they will do for a while...until enough people have adopted it and realize that there isn't really shit the state can do.And the more that happens, the harder the state will clamp down on it. I honestly don't see bitcoin surviving that, as it is already fairly easy to de-anonymize bitcoin transactions with enough compute power. But the importance of bitcoin will always be as the first attempt that proved it was possible. There have been better blockchain systems built since bitcoin that have been informed by the weaknesses found in bitcoin under state scrutiny of users of bitcoin. I do see bitcoin surviving as a bridge between "legitimate" state crypto and the much larger "system-d", global, agorist economy that has developed (and growing rapidly) as a result. That bridge will only be useful as long as there is a state to make that bridge useful.It will only get harder for the state from that point on.Let's all just be greatful that it wasn't JPMC that cracked this complex computer science problem in such an elegant way. They almost certainly would have made it proprietary and the past decade would look slightly different.
2	1525798827	1	I don't understand how crypto will fix the problems fiat has created. Won't the wealth simply accumulate in the hands of the few with crypto the same way as it has with fiat? The government will probably require taxes on crypto and the regular Joe will pay the tax while large corporations can probably avoid paying tax with crypto even easier than they do with fiat
2	1525790538	1	I'm glad someone is making sense in here. Can't believe how excited everyone in here is getting over this...
3	1525792771	1	It is exciting, but it's a good thing to remind people that the endgame here is not state regulation, even though they will make an adorable attempt and probably ruin a lot of innocent lives in the process. The end game is to empower the individual to exercise true control over the results of their productivity. In this way, each person will have a far more inalienable right to the sweat of their brow than any monopoly-backed piece of paper ever could.It's a beautiful thing, but needs to be brought up as a reminder from time to time.We're dealing with an influx of early normal adopters and it will reach an eternal September eventually, but it's up to the early adopters and innovators to remind people coming in where this ship is sailing.
1	1525798833	1	This type of news was almost unimaginable 3 years ago. It would have shot the price of bitcoin up at least 100 dollars, a 75% day gain
1	1525801032	1	It's here to stay. There's no way of making it disappear now.
1	1525785765	1	This is unheard of in terms of the traditional market 
0	1525743923	437	I hope this is true, it would be a gamechanger.
1	1525755252	164	cant wait to unload my doge bags on these suits, bring em on... 
2	1525756154	129	I've got thousands of Fuck Tokens and Sloth Coins I'm ready to shower upon some unsuspecting 58-year-old Merrill Lynch trader.
3	1525757149	16	What no hobonickels?
4	1525784962	20	It's Stanley nickles and schrutebucks
5	1525791505	5	one of the most amazing scenes 
6	1525798103	1	I prefer Jim's leprechaun leap at the end of the garage sale episode before he swaps the pots Dwight just planted the seeds in. 
4	1525780670	5	No Litedoge? Fkn scrubs.
5	1525794016	1	pascal?
3	1525782919	8	Looking forward to dumping my JPMC tokens on JPMC
3	1525780692	1	He won't know what hit him
2	1525790617	8	Im guessing the NYSE traders wont be interested in Shitcoins.Expecting almost entirely BTC and ETH trades.
3	1525793080	2	I'll laugh my ass off at how butthurt this sub would become if they accepted bch and none of their spam coins like nano and vechain are accepted
4	1525795289	-1	ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗPraying to the crypto gods for this to be real. Seeing the shitcoin shills moan is so worth it. BCH is the only hope for permissionless peer to peer digital cash.
1	1525746725	366	It's the New York Times, not hodlmoondaily.info. It almost definitely is true.That said, the article itself says that nothing has been finalized.
2	1525753091	120	Lmao, I mean that's pretty much this subreddit 
3	1525759138	32	Its either gonna be a yes or a no I'm sure of it.
4	1525767493	12	What if it’s a maybe?
5	1525767946	6	Could be a possibly 
6	1525769895	3	Who knows!
3	1525755453	41	The sources here have been terrible lately.
4	1525757551	16	1000x on SCAM coin in 3 months! Two Teh Mun! 
5	1525781626	1	But really though, it seems the fastest gains are on the scam coins. Whole market is a Ponzi scheme right now. 
2	1525747522	31	Y’all thought the SEC hearing was true............. (so did i)
3	1525755273	26	All you had to do was go to SEC agenda and you'll see there was no mention of ethereum.Shilling is ATH. This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. That's why I'm a skeptical fuck. 
4	1525793177	1	But his point is the "trusted" sources were reporting it.
3	1525797424	1	It wasn't wrong. Just people don't know what commenting on. It's a topic that is being discussed, but no indication was given that a final answer would be determined.
3	1525764478	0	I bought 0.25 ether on 6th may 
2	1525772266	10	> hodlmoondaily.infoWhen you wrote this you just *knew* we'd all go and check whether that domain exists for real.^(Hint: It doesn't. Go forth and register!)
2	1525763148	11	"According to sources close to the NYT, they are planning on launching a new publication called 'Hodlmoondaily'. "Journalism is fucked" the source said."
2	1525765819	10	Haha, hodlmoondaily.info. Upvote for you. 
3	1525789809	1	Hodlmoondaily is fake news
4	1525797036	1	agreed, i prefer the dailymoonhodl. they're fair and balanced and always shill my favorite coins
2	1525766089	2	Haha, hodlmoondaily.info. Upvote for you. 
3	1525792673	1	I mean, [it's not far off](https://hodlformoon.io/).
2	1525757686	4	As reliable as the WSJ?
3	1525761028	7	Far more reliable
4	1525778248	-8	Lmao the NYT is no even in the same stratosphere as the WSJ
5	1525778653	14	Right. It's way better
5	1525794016	1	Yep, the WSJ is a Murdoch owned rag while the NYT is a genuine bastion of real journalism, despite its occasional flaws.  There really is no comparison between them.
4	1525778433	-6	1000 x 0 is still 0
5	1525780220	11	The WSJ is owned by Murdoch, he also owns fox news. He doesn't have a great track record (although the WSJ is far better than fox). Whereas the NYT is by far the most reliable source for news.
6	1525781261	-7	Nyt has a liberal agenda. Fox has a conservative one. Your best bet is to listen to both sides and trust news that relies on good primary sources and throw out the rest. No media organizations should have the public's full trust they have all walked all over it.
7	1525786369	6	Well fox is more of an entertainment channel 
8	1525790391	5	...at best.
7	1525782303	8	I take it the 2.50 cover charge for the times is out of your budget. You’re conflating a 24 hour news entertainment network with actual journalism. 
8	1525782654	-4	Don't care about the paywall but good attempt at a straw man I guess.  Regardless are you trying to act like New York Times does not have a liberal agenda? Or are you saying that the only way to be considered a journalist is to have a liberal agenda?
9	1525785239	5	I was implying that you don’t read the nyt. That’s ad hominem at best, but not really. A straw man is something entirely different. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man
9	1525783466	8	There is a decent point that fox is a product of the 24 hour news cycle, whereas the NYT has been a core of American print and investigative journalism for a long time.
7	1525794306	2	The NYT has a liberal slant; Fox has an active conservative agenda and is a political machine that rejects fact-based news in support of a specific party and worldview.  Putting them in the same sentence shows an incredible lack of perspective and reason.  They are nothing like two sides of a coin that balance each other out.  One reflects in a limited but unavoidable way the biases of its writers and the city it is based in, while working actively to restrain those biases.  The other is simply a propaganda outfit, dressing entertainment and opinion up as news.
7	1525798459	1	The NYT has conservative and liberal journalists. They have in the past defended Shapiro \(in opeds, the journalists at NYT are generally allowed to post what they want without too much interference, except if it's obviously inappropriate\) and has stated that he is the "Cool kids Philosopher" however obviously there would be many journalists that would disagree with it. But the fact remains that the NYT is the best source for News in the country \(Opeds are not the same as news\).Does the NYT occasionally mess up or get the story wrong? Of course they do, but they are still far better than CNBC, CNN, FOX, ABC etc. The next comparable publication is the WP. 
3	1525778779	-1	Not even close. Don't understand the other comments. Must be trolling
2	1525765004	1	>It's the New York Times...It almost definitely is true.Oh lord........fuck it, I'm not going to bite.
3	1525765962	20	No news organization is perfect, but the NYT is about as close as you'll get. Unlike random crypto bloggers or Brietbart, the stories will be the result of actual journalism rather than sensationalism a wishful thinking. When they push an agenda, it will be by selective inclusion, not outright fabrication.
4	1525782473	14	When they push an agenda it will clearly be labeled as an opinion piece/ editorial. Unfortunately 40% of the country doesn’t understand the definition of those terms. 
5	1525793989	-2	Awww you're so cute with your ignorance yet acting like you're not.You wanna know who played the biggest part in pushing and popularizing the Duke rape story? The New York Times.Just Google new York times controversies and you'll get lists upon lists upon lists of all their shoddy reporting that didn't have "opinion" in the header.And regardless of if it was an opinion piece, because that's a seriously bullshit cop out especially since you're acting like any time they've been wrong it was an opinion piece which is 100% verifiable horse shit, the fact of the matter is their publishing and standing behind it. And like I said, the majority of their poorly researched pieces weren't opinion pieces, but it's seriously cute you think that.Oh and do I need to remind you the NYT has trashed cryptocurrency time and time again? Just as recently as January where they had a big hit piece on it. Oh and that one didn't have opinion in the header either.Nice fucking cop out though.
4	1525773380	-9	Deception by any other name still smells like bullshit.
4	1525789886	0	Aha. Well now we all understand 
2	1525775739	1	I see you've never read Mr Krugman's column.
3	1525789889	3	Which is an editorial. All newspapers have editorials/op-eds which are explicitly opinion pieces and often have them side by side with a contrasting viewpoints. That’s how all legitimate newspapers work. 
4	1525795680	-1	The point is not that his opinion is one thing or another it's that he spouts flat-out lies and the paper stands behind him.
5	1525803023	1	Dude, white supremacists and civil rights leaders have had editorials in the NYT. That's what an editorial page is.
2	1525787418	0	> It's the New York Times, not hodlmoondaily.info. It almost definitely is true.lololololol
2	1525782489	-11	Up vote if conservative, downvote if left leaning ;) 
3	1525783756	9	Can't tell if sarcasm.
3	1525790181	2	Actual list of fake news sites. Fake news isn’t just news/facts that contradict your own perception of the world. Fake news is fabricated or exaggerated news to mislead the public or get clicks for $$.https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/fake-news-sites-list-facebook/
2	1525785074	-6	Just like the Wall Street Journal bullshit on the alleged SEC Ethereum Hearing yesterday?
3	1525785734	6	[You're an idiot.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8ho5mb/apparently_there_is_no_sec_hearing_on_ethereum/dylalkg) Stop blaming reputable news sources for your own inadequate reading comprehension skills.
4	1525786492	-3	You don't have to insult people when you correct them.
5	1525791120	3	Maybe not. But you should understand that I'm not reacting to a single innocent mistake here. The real root of the problem is that you (along with many others in this space) tend to vastly overestimate your own ability to competently evaluate the credibility of your sources. When you smugly and casually reproduce memes about the supposed untrustworthiness of the "mainstream media," you play a role in sustaining that tendency and spreading it to others.So what's the best and most efficient way to cure overconfidence? How do I maximize the likelihood that you'll read a little bit more carefully and be a little bit more skeptical in the future? Isn't a small dose of  semi-public humiliation exactly what the doctor ordered?
6	1525792244	1	You can advise people to DTOR without that. And yes, you're right in that by failing to review the primary source of this scenario I inadvertently spread misinformation. Ironically enough, you cited a Reddit comment rather than the initial article yourself.Sensationalism and hype is definitely a problem in the crypto space. My failure was trusting Boxmining, who initially helped me understand fundamentals of blockchain technology. I still follow him, but this is another reminder to always hold some degree of skepticism. So you could say in this case I fell for the argument from authority fallacy.
7	1525795056	1	Not quite. The argument from authority fallacy doesn't really apply here. In fact, the common misconception that it is always some kind of mistake to ever trust *any* authority on *any* topic is something that makes this whole problem much worse, because it leads people to the belief that all sources of information are equally (un)reliable. Why spend any time thinking carefully about the trustworthiness of your sources if you know in advance that none of them can be trusted at all?Your mistake was to trust an *inadequate* authority. The Wall Street Journal is a reliable source of news about the SEC. Boxmining is not--nor is he even an especially reliable source of information about what has recently been published in the WSJ, apparently.
1	1525764406	4	Not sure if it's actually good or bad for Bitcoin.
2	1525791389	4	Regulation here we come! Weeeee
2	1525785693	5	Bad at first, good long term.
2	1525802497	1	Since one of the main things keeping big money out from speculating in bitcoin are the unreliable exchanges that cannot be trusted I would say this is very good both long and short term if true. If nothing else it would bring an incredible amount of liquidity to the bitcoin market.
2	1525790696	1	The only threat IMO to Bitcoin is shitcoins.ICO scams and pump and dump alts are a gigantic risk. They have already screwed people and the moment they screw someone important, we will have regulation.
1	1525753602	27	New York Times is very reputable source for news. We will probably get confirmation during blockchain week in NYC.
2	1525784495	-11	Bwahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahaahahahahhahahahahhaha
1	1525786257	2	Good for lambos, bad for decentralized currency.
1	1525789067	2	How the fuck are NYSE documents "classified" this title is click bait city
2	1525789470	3	lol thats exactly what I thought. 
1	1525785655	1	I love how when its a rumor that causes the market to drop everyone is yelling FUD and "media manipulation", yet when its an anonymous source from some vague unclassified documents, everyone takes it at face value. Let's save the exaltation for when the NYSE actually goes on record saying this.
2	1525787682	2	It’s buy the rumor sell the news, not the other way around. 
0	1525747720	133	THIS IS WHY ALL THIS FUD CAME OUT RECENTLY. No weak hands here =D
1	1525783805	30	Can you imagine being that guy who bought near 20k and sold at 6k then start hearing news like this and NASDAQ etc.. lol
2	1525788406	3	Can you imagine being that bag holder that bought at 20k and is now down 50%?
3	1525791567	9	Back in the day, I bought in at $200 all the way up to near $1200.  My average price was like $700.  I watched it drop all the way down to under $200.  That shit sucked but I guess it works out if you just sit on your hands.
4	1525799935	4	I remember those days. I bought near the ath around 600-900 USD. I remember the 2 long proceeding years where my investment went to utter shit. But I didnt get into the tech for the money, so I HODL'ed and now im here. Learn this lesson bois, HODL for massive gainz, HODL for freedom, HODL for lambos, HODL for moon
3	1525794788	3	The key was to keep buying on the dip. A couple big buys in the 7-9k range go a long way to fixing that problem.
3	1525790468	3	Eh I bought near 20k and am doing fine. Made some swing trades, got some alts that did well
3	1525799227	1	50%? Lol.Try some alts that are -90%
0	1525744083	70	We mainstream now, get the rubber pool ready so i can jump into my pile of coins
1	1525744415	27	For real though, ICE knows that they will lose ground to crypto exchanges like coinbase if they don't adopt asap. [Tom Lee](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=58s&v=GGberGnxiJk) gives a great talk on why older generations/traditional financial systems will be left behind if they don't continue to adopt new technology that has enthralled millenials.
2	1525779986	2	I've shared that talk with several of my family and friends who are crypto naysayers.  Hard to not at least see some value in what Tom is describing in that excellent talk he gave.
1	1525782794	3	Scroodge McDuck here. 
0	1525743974	54	"bullish"
0	1525751084	30	If this and the nasdaq trading for october both materialize then there is no readon why we cant see a BTC repeat of last years performance.
1	1525752463	28	yea hopefully. though I do think there is something to be said for avoiding centralization at the institutional level. It would be a shame if this technology, which was invented specifically to circumvent banks was coopted by them in the end. 
2	1525757598	19	You really think they're just gonna sit by and do nothing about it?
3	1525786301	1	They can't meaningfully coordinate. So when each regulator gets it, he buys in.
2	1525767477	11	This is a funny one as I’m 100% in agreement that decentralisation is important but at the same time they are effectively stepping into the exchange space which is already centralised. I guess the only hope is decentralised exchanges become popular. There is still a key difference that the currency is not issued by the centralised party, only held so it still has a decentralised advantage over the traditional banking system 
2	1525799257	1	Anybody can use it, just like anybody can use the internet.  The little guy has a head start, but in the end it's a neutral game.
1	1525794834	1	Why aim so low?
2	1525795623	2	Leaving the big unknown for if any BTC ETF's get approved by the SEC this year.That would be yuge.By the way,repeating last years performance (20x from its early 2017  price would be crazy in of itself.BTC would be around 200-300k.
3	1525797100	3	It's not like this hasn't happened over and over and over so far in BTC history. Typically the ground floor ends up somewhere around 10x the ground floor of the previous pump. I.e. ~600 ground floor from previous pump, this one was 6500. Last time we went from 600 to 20k, a 33x. A similar pump would put us in that range 200-300k. Market cap at a BTC range like that could be somewhere around 18-30T, depending on BTC dominance.I know it sounds a lot compared to today. Hell, a 10B market cap sounded ludicrous previously. Considering many hedge funds throw around 1-3T in money, each, it's really not that crazy to think that market cap (overall) could hit 30, 50, even 100T. When? certainly not this year, but in a few years, it absolutely could. More than that, there's so much money tied up in shitcoins, that once they all shake out, market cap could get cut in half and most people's portfolios would be completely unaffected. The thing is, right now nobody is using the stuff (hardly anyone). It's not inconceivable that in 10 years most transactions will occur using blockchain technology, even if simply in the background. I.e. merchant accepts BTC, OMG network DEX converts BTC to USD, transfers USD to merchant. Both parties don't even realize OMG functioning in the background.That's the real potential of this technology.... which tech is going to function like TCP/IP, where people access the internet every day and use TCP/IP and don't even realize it. It's all happening in the background.Get your new drivers license? The information is transmitted and stored on the blockchain, using OMG. New citizens card? Verified and processed using TKY on the NEO blockchain. The users don't even know these things are happening, but they blockchain is providing the security and auditability of these transactions, for a fraction of the cost to the retailer/distributer, etc.Merchants get their money immediately, not in 14 days from Visa. They get it right away and with very minimal fees (less than Visa). That's when adoption happens. When that happens, 50T marketcap is an absolute joke. It's peanuts. Don't forget what the ceiling is here... it's literally the entire global economy. Will we hit 100%? We don't need to, but that's the ceiling.1T market cap? What an absolute joke. We're still SUCH early adopters it's not even funny.
4	1525798691	3	I agree with what your saying...I am trying to give a very rough estimate of what the end of 2018 price target could potentially look like.Most bull runs for BTC do end up going 10x from the previous ATH which is where the 200k comes from.although I can imagine BTC hitting some major problems to surpass the 100k area,kind of like what we are witnessing with 10k right now and 1k previously.
0	1525743540	113	Wow. This is YUGE
1	1525766329	17	Feel a bit out of the loop here, what are the implications of having bitcoin on wall st? Excuse my ignorance...
2	1525772263	47	REAL institutional money. Also having BTC traded on that platform basically means that BTC is legitimized in the eyes of the world, and it will provide a much simpler way to trade/speculate on it
3	1525773291	13	Will they actually buy and sell btc or just go long or short on it
4	1525776349	12	They will buy and sell actual BTC. This article states that Goldman is actually buying and holding the actual BTC asset, rather than a financial instrument, clarifying news from earlier that they are opening a trading desk. 
5	1525778773	15	Why are people pretending this is only good news? You think big institutions won't short Bitcoins? If Tesla is inflated, Bitcoin is the motherhood of overvaluation
6	1525783732	7	Short term sure it could cause dips, but if you think about the big picture if we want mainstream adoption longterm this is necessary. If you think of the January crash/dip from when Bitcoin Futures were introduced, a few months bear market is nothing compared to what would happen when we see mainstream widespread adoption maybe 5-10 years from now, or possibly even sooner. This is just one of many necessary baby steps along the way for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies in general to be considered a legitimate asset (in the eyes of the general public, not just early adopters) 
4	1525775782	22	Yes, this is the important thing everyone seems to be missing...

1	1525746263	271	They aren't "classified." They're confidential. OP apparently doesn't know the difference.This is exactly how a bunch of you ended up thinking that there was going to be a public SEC hearing on Ethereum today. Stop adding your own confusion to the news that you share with each other. Use the original fucking headline, or a verbatim quote from the article. Don't attempt to improvise until you've mastered reading comprehension.
2	1525751715	66	What do you mean the SEC is banning all crypto???
3	1525751886	21	I heard the sec is banning crypto
4	1525753369	16	The sec is banning crypto? Do we sell?
5	1525755122	15	HODL! If they ban crypto you may well be the only one that can sell after a while, you can set the sellprice yourself! 
6	1525762304	5	And you and I can sell to each other! yay!

5	1525760883	6	Wall Street Journal 09/05/2018> Evidence found that Bitcoin may cause cancer, are YOU at risk?
5	1525762248	2	FUD. or is it? 
4	1525761800	8	I heard the U.S. Government is declaring War on Bitcoin!!! If its anything like their War on Drugs, it'll surely drive the price up though xD
4	1525754485	6	Remember, you heard it here first!
4	1525765662	1	SEC is banning crypto tomorrow? May 9th??

2	1525762211	2	I know right? But this is a crowd where think magic things can happen. Like Skycoin will take over the internet. Or Tron is the next platform for  -- well -- everything. Or Walton will make RFID uhmmm... practical? There are some amazing projects out there. Huge game changing stuff. Not sure why people fall for anything that falls off the truck. 
3	1525791934	1	Hey take that back! Walton has a video where they show magic things happening on their computer in their office!
2	1525787592	1	This made me chuckle.  The amount of FUD and shilling garbage in the crypto world is insane.  It makes it very difficult to find the real, actual news sometimes.
2	1525750313	1	I came here to make this point. I'll believe it when it happens. 
2	1525747540	-37	I actually meant to specifically type confidential but I'm posting on my phone and using the swipe to text function. By the time I realized, I wasn't sure how to fix it on this app. No need to be so rude my friend, I'm just trying to share exciting and important news. 
3	1525747758	19	That's not how typos work. Swiping to text wouldn't cause an attempt to type "classified" to result in typing "confidential" instead
4	1525758655	4	That's exactly how swipe works, predictive based on finger path.  For instance "for" ends up as "got" fairly often because they are so close on the keyboard layout. It'll definitely do it with much larger words as well, especially if you misspell, or go to fast and get sloppy.
5	1525766134	2	They longer the words are, the sloppier you can be because there will be much less possibilities for this path to mean another word. 
4	1525748496	-19	Okay, well that's what happened. It was an honest mistake over what's really a trivial point but feel free to get riled up over it
3	1525749189	7	Sorry for my tone. It's just extremely frustrating to watch this community confuse itself over and over again.
4	1525750082	-13	Totally man, I know how crazy the hype gets around here. It's just nuts how the internet literally jumps on people sometimes over small things, which I have probably done myself before. Sometimes, I just don't even want to post stuff on reddit or twitter because of how hostile it can be. 
5	1525751356	10	Fuck you 
6	1525752526	14	why? seriously though, what makes you so upset that you would say that to a complete stranger online?
7	1525757485	9	I guess that was just a joke to the previous reply.. you know, about hostility and all..
7	1525761527	5	Its a joke mate. Literally the last thing u said was that u dont like posting due to how hostile the internet can be and he just replied "fuck you" 
8	1525776604	3	Dude that's actually kind of funny, but sometimes you can't even tell if people are being serious or what
7	1525754489	1	BECAUSE STONNNNEEEE COOOLLLDDD SAID SO 
3	1525757848	1	Ignore the angry kids. Cheers for sharing 
1	1525756280	7	Because the CIA and the NSA are partnering to open a new Bitcoin exchange with the long-awaited Spankchain/USD pairing.
2	1525795059	1	Spookcoin
1	1525746304	-5	Well, the obvious reason would be that any move the NYSE makes regarding their operations affects the entire financial market as a whole.  
2	1525746383	8	Yeah....that's not how classification works....
2	1525746556	3	As someone else said, it should be "confidential" not "classified"
3	1525746630	1	Yea, OP was confused.
0	1525760405	9	5% of global pension funds getting into btc would equal 47.9k of actual hard cash per BTC. Add to that existing value, speculation, shitcoin syphon and you are looking at 57-100k per btc

0	1525748571	33	NYSE's parent company, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), is *possibly* looking at Bitcoin instead of Ether as it is uncertain its future due to the *possibility* of SEC regulations. This statement is based off of:> "...emails and documents viewed by The New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still **confidential**."One, it's confidential if it really is being looked into. Not classified. There is a difference between the use of the two.Two, we have no knowledge about these sources. Where and who did these emails come from? Are they legitimate? And what is the credibility of these 'four people' that were briefed? We have nothing **confirming** that the NYSE is going to open a Bitcoin exchange.This, along with the SEC and Ether scuttlebutt, is an example of what happens when people put their own sensational interpretations to build up news.What was wrong with the original headline that you felt it necessary to change what the article is actually saying?
1	1525750427	25	as I mentioned above, I actually agree with you that the wording should say confidential, not classified, but I made a mistake using swipe to text on my phone and can't change it. I tried to post it earlier as "not-yet-published" which would be more accurate, but the mods deleted it? I don't post much on reddit, and especially not from my phone, so I apologize. The tone on this subreddit and social media as a whole is so toxic though that I really should stick to lurking. 
2	1525752179	11	Everyone makes mistakes. Learn and move forward, dont give up.
3	1525795241	1	I love how it's total bullshit though, confidential and classified would not be mistaken by swipe-to-text. Why not just admit you thought it was classified because you read the article super fast so you could post it first for that juicy karma
2	1525752776	9	My tone is coming from the side of presenting the facts, not misinformation. I can understand if it was an honest mistake. I'm only commenting because of the sphere of confirmation biases that exist in these communities. We need to be skeptical and ask questions; it's healthy.We face manipulation in this market by those benefiting from other's losses through fear and false promises spread through misinformation. This community and other communities/platforms are prime targets and we have to be vigilant and aware of what is happening in this market.If it doesn't have sources or credibility, we have to take it at face value and use the opportunity to educate others.
3	1525753161	3	Totally get that. And I personally got killed in a trade I made based on inaccurate news last year about Korea shutting down exchanges, which was actually published by MSNBC, a supposedly reputable source. I just don't understand why some people, not you, are so willing to spew hatred online to people they don't even know. One person above literally replied to my comment above with "fuck you". Like... why?  
4	1525754432	5	Some people just like to be dicks, man. Don't take it personally.And you have to take most news with a grain of salt. This market is wild right now and we really don't know what's going on. This is all brand new. It's exciting but it's also speculative. And publishers are saturating the headlines with stories about *anything* crypto to sell ads and subscriptions because they know we're hungry for it. Money is at stake and there's profit to be made on all sides.Do your research and trust your gut! If you're day trading, you buy the rumors and sell the news. Easy way to get burnt, though.And taxes. *Oof*.

2	1525791611	2	I'm talking about general sentiment. Sorry, should have clarified that. Its suddenly a lot more positive.
3	1525795004	0	You have to be careful where you get your trend indications from. On this sub, there has been a split of tetherers and holders, bears and bulls both make money, etc. All I know is that my neighbours approached me this weekend asking if I was "still in crypto" and "how do I get in". My co-workers are talking about it again. I hear people at restaurants talking about it, etc.The sentiment is very much changing.People also have to understand, even back in Oct, when sentiment was VERY BULLISH, you could still ask 10 random people their opinion and 9 would say it's a scam.Do that today and 8 say it's a scam. Does that mean it's bearish sentiment? Not at all, because it's less bearish than ever before.
0	1525749174	16	I feel slightly more sad each time a more legit source prints this kind of news. I mean more money is good, but that just means that the time for sharks to cash out legally is approaching.

2	1525778261	5	Nah, they will be dumping regardless. Just feel that the playing field is gonna be more tilted against the smaller players now, when there is liquidity and market becomes more efficient.

0	1525746537	3	Really exciting news. Its really smart that they are going to use swaps to facilitate the trading of bitcoin instead of trying to trade bitcoin directly, since swaps are a really common and already regulated financial instrument.It is a little bit concerning that the article had a negative outlook on ETH in terms of regulation, but its really all just speculation at the moment. For anyone interested, you can learn about swaps here: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp)
1	1525751542	3	These bigger players have to play it safe, they have a lot more to lose than upstart crypto exchanges so they don't want to lose their ability to do their other work because the government slaps them with restrictions/fines.Still, it's been a long time coming and the day we can legitimately trade Bitcoin on the NYSE will be a great day.

3	1525783035	2	"But the new operation at ICE would provide more direct access to Bitcoin by putting the actual tokens in the customer’s account at the end of the trade."
3	1525747895	2	Swaps to start.  Trading after regulation.
4	1525748196	3	I thought Bitcoin doesn’t meet the requirements to be a security ever? 
5	1525748507	12	Some large financial exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, have already created financial products linked to the price of Bitcoin, known as futures. But the new operation at ICE would provide more direct access to Bitcoin by putting the actual tokens in the customer’s account at the end of the trade.ICE has had conversations with other financial institutions about setting up a new operation through which banks can buy a contract, known as a swap, that will end with the customer owning Bitcoin the next day — with the backing and security of the exchange, according to the people familiar with the project.The swap contract is more complicated than an immediate trade of dollars for Bitcoin, even if the end result is still ownership of a certain amount of Bitcoin. But a swap contract allows the trading to come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and to operate clearly under existing laws — something today’s Bitcoin exchanges have struggled to do.

If the process is streamlined and allows every-day investors to participate in the market, that would be a game changer for us but at the crux of bitcoin's "decentralized currency" ideology, this seems counter-intuitive.
