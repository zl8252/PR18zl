0	1525758456	132	Anyone know where I can buy PiedPiper's shitcoin? 
1	1525762574	53	SHL is a decentralized internet
2	1525777926	18	MaidSafeCoin. They actually consulted with their dev team from Scotland, check the HBO credits
3	1525798802	3	What's up with that coin's name? It always makes me think of plastic storage containers.
4	1525799560	3	It reminds me of a large metal box where I keep my house cleaner.
2	1525795897	0	I got airdropped SHL and I'm pretty happy so far.
1	1525793655	6	I bought in to 35 of russ's icos..fingers crossed.
1	1525778946	11	I don’t know but I bought a bunch of GBC Gavin Belson Coin 
1	1525780032	12	Substratum? No?
2	1525790026	5	Let's wait until they actually do something. Right now, the beta software doesn't even do the most basic thing it is supposed to do, which is clandestine routing of info. The DNS redirect is working the way it's supposed to, but none of the privacy stuff. Which makes it useless at the moment. I have high hopes for them, but I got out at $1.50 while it was on it's way down. Will buy back in once it does something. 
3	1525802142	1	It looks very promising but you’re right. I think it’s worth investing now just in case though; if they can do what they’re trying to do it’ll be revolutionary.
1	1525760441	7	Isn't it [https://peercoin.net/](https://peercoin.net/) ?
2	1525765645	3	True
1	1525794182	2	This won.
1	1525803554	1	Would you actually pay for it? =)
1	1525799580	0	Siacoin does that. 
0	1525752659	237	Show’s writer must be a Hodler
1	1525799835	-1	Nah, they end up regretting going with an ICO.
0	1525764368	152	They have some marketing issues but it's a solid project. You should really pick some coins up once they get on a respectable exchange. * This team have worked together in the past on other projects (with mild success).* The team won the Techcrunch Disrupt competition with their compression algorithm (they use the same one for that PiedPiper platform). * The company has already received alot of offers and investments from venture capitalists. * Substratum, their main competitor is currently valued at 300.000.000 million (8 cents x 400.000.000 circulating supply). Whereas PiedPiper is currently only valued at 300.000 (0,7 cents x 440000 tokens). That is a x1000 potential if PiedPiper succeeds!* They recently hired a new Business Manager / Crypto advisor. Some cons:* They have ties to Russ Hanneman, the joke of the crypto world.* A chinese company are planning to copy PiedPipers code or fork their coin.* PiedPiper's CEO is notorious for making bad decisions. DYOR!
1	1525767203	45	Those cons are so overwhelming you would have to be an idiot to sink any substantial amount of money into this project. Where can I buy?
1	1525777291	34	You’re forgetting that Nelson ‘Bighead’ Bighetti (former Co-Head of Hooli’s Moonshot Division) is a major investor. Also ran his own VC. Sounds like a major Valley player to me! 
2	1525782739	6	He just keeps stumbling into these amazing projects!
2	1525790899	4	And he's extremely humble.  That's the kind of leader you want on your team!
2	1525798491	2	I feel like I saw him on the cover of a tech magazine. I’m in!
2	1525789972	3	Lmao when he didn’t understand the nickname
3	1525799270	1	Love me some bighead. 
1	1525775524	9	Haha.That cliche scene of searching the garbage dump for a thumb drive with crypto.Found a thumb instead.
1	1525776788	6	Forgot: They are in the U.S. so will be plagued with lawyers advising them to register their coin as a security effectively making it useless for mass trade and adoption. Also, no one will be able to buy it unless you're an accredited investor, you can't legally trade it for a year and then there are no exchanges for it. 
1	1525781608	2	Extremely undervalued. Ready to moon any day
1	1525788805	2	The next episode is titled Fifty One Percent.  I may have an inkling about what's going to happen.
1	1525795748	1	You should mention that their [website](http://www.piedpiper.com/#ppc) looks promising as well. Plenty of information about the coin there. I have high hopes for this.
1	1525804673	1	So many green flags you didn't even have time to mention their Weissman scoreI've been following this team for a few years and despite numerous hurdles, they've come a long way
0	1525750970	121	This was an awesome moment on TV.  Not surprised it was HBO
1	1525765877	21	Didn't HBO get hacked a few years back and had some episodes held random for Bitcoin? Maybe they bought more than they needed to pay the random, now its paying off?
2	1525767350	29	$ 6 million worth of BTC for an episode of GOT but HBO didn't pay the ransom. But it is definitely ironic
2	1525782229	20	This show is written by Mike Judge who is a brilliant guy and who understands all of this stuff deeply. I'm pretty sure it being on HBO is a coincidence.
3	1525782647	11	pretty sure it's a coin-cidence he he eh
4	1525784868	5	ICO when?
5	1525786096	6	CoinCidence (CxC) launching late July mate
2	1525791107	3	Mike Judge has been heavy in the tech industry since forever, I think he used to work in tech before he made a bunch of genius TV. Im sure he's been hodling for a long time.
1	1525792636	1	Why awesome?
2	1525800079	1	You can tell by the way that it is
1	1525803076	1	HBO shills out and about
0	1525757703	29	Silicon Valley is #0 and Gilfoyle is #1 on my GOAT_list
0	1525756253	16	Great show
0	1525766847	9	SingularityNet (AGI) have the biggest parody in the series with 2 episodes based around it their CEO and Sophia robot mimic. With multiple subtle "possible great tech" references to it. It's a great series been watching since s1 and great token AGI.  
1	1525782811	9	> It's a great series been watching since s1 I still maintain that the final scene of that first season where they give Richard the inspiration for middle-out compression is probably the most well written and funniest scene ever on television.I just wish they'd stick to one storyline for more than half an episode. Nothing ever matters because it all gets resolved in 30 minutes.
1	1525804089	1	Yeah, I was really surprised when I found out that AGI really exists. I had absolutely no idea...
0	1525782147	7	I find it funny that they goto a VC to ask for an advice to do ICO. It's like asking a taxi driver if he likes Uber.
0	1525764092	15	In the same episode they made a point how bad funding a company with crypto can go.
1	1525764651	32	No, they just said '99% of icos are complete shitcoins'Which is 100 percent true
2	1525791567	2	Also shows how ravenous and delusional people get when they start seeing dollar signs, or comas. 
1	1525786889	4	and the rest of the entire series is about how much shit you have to go through to get funding from a VC
2	1525794869	1	One Swiss company raised about $40m in funding for their company, need more to expand, don't want ot od that VC crap again, so they're just doing an ICO. This is going to be more and more normal.
0	1525774494	9	I need to check this show out. I need something to watch until Mr Robot comes back.
0	1525771759	8	\(Guys, I think he's mocking us.\)
0	1525774841	9	What's this 'Satan is a metaphor for rebellion against tyranny' idea?Where can I read more?
1	1525778899	6	I think he's a LaVeyan Satanisthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism"Satan is viewed as a positive archetype representing pride, carnality, and enlightenment. He is also embraced as a symbol of defiance against Abrahamic religions which LaVeyans criticize for suppressing humanity's natural instincts and encouraging irrationality. "
2	1525799824	3	That's why he named the servers "Anton."
2	1525778905	1	**LaVeyan Satanism**LaVeyan Satanism is a religion founded in 1966 by the American occultist and author Anton Szandor LaVey. Scholars of religion have classified it as a new religious movement and a form of Western esotericism. It is one of several different movements that describe themselves as forms of Satanism.LaVey established LaVeyan Satanism in the U.S. state of California through the founding of his Church of Satan on Walpurgisnacht of 1966, which he proclaimed to be "the Year One", Anno Satanas—the first year of the "Age of Satan".***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
1	1525777636	5	Look up Satanism. It's probably not what you think it is.
1	1525796063	3	To be fair, he's wrong.  Technically the view of Lucifer (originally not Satan, now combined into one entity in modern mythos sometime around 400 A.D) as a rebel against the Tyrant of God is not in the Bible, but is an apocryphal story (and not in the Protestant use of the word Apocryphal).  Most modern opinions of Lucifer/Satan are taken from *Paradise Lost* by John Milton and Dante's *L'Inferno.*  As far as biblical references to the rebelion of Lucifer against God, there is literally 1 small line that maybe references it (I think in Psalms, maybe in Kings, I can't remember).
2	1525799030	2	IIRC Lucifer is barely mentioned at all in the Bible, is that right? 
3	1525801511	2	That is correct.  Really the only mention of him is complete interpretation as well, not direct reference.  There is a little more to Satan, but not the aspects of him associated with the Luciferous rebellion.
1	1525787555	1	If you are into graphic novels, grab Mike Carey's "Lucifer".
0	1525772661	4	I loved this episode even more then I love this show. 
0	1525779036	5	Gilfoyle is the best character of this show
0	1525782562	5	You never go full crypto 
0	1525781267	3	This guy cryptos
0	1525774557	2	Biblical Satan? 
0	1525775623	2	What the OP fails to convey is that they ultimately goof on cyyptos by the end of the episode. 
0	1525791267	2	>biblical satan 
0	1525795690	2	Pied Piper's [official website](http://www.piedpiper.com/) actually has a PiedPiperCoin tracker at the top of it and a [full page](http://www.piedpiper.com/#ppc) talking about the coin. This is amazing.
0	1525760888	7	As much as I like the show and am into crypto, I think that for most of the conservative population in the US, they would associate what he’s saying with someone crazy and in turn, something they don’t want to invest in or use themselves. 
1	1525762355	64	Why would most of the conservative population be watching Silicon Valley in the first place 
2	1525764380	7	Good point.
2	1525775657	3	Exactly.  Only people I know that I enjoy the show are in tech already.
1	1525762524	5	You're reading too directly into it. If you're watching season 4 or 5 or whatever of Silicon Valley you probably understand where the writers are coming from.
2	1525763907	0	Yeah you’re right about that. But I’m wondering about the people who will take just this one quote from the show and associate it with crypto. I don’t think it’s negative what he’s saying, but I know that some definitely would unfortunately.
1	1525771552	2	You ever seen king of the hill?
1	1525791033	1	True, except time and time again Gilfoyle has proven that he delivers and is the smartest guy on the team.  If any character is going to shill crypto he's the guy you want doing it
0	1525776457	2	You know its making fun of you guys, right?
1	1525778804	1	Yeah right, and who are the ones laughing on their way to the bank?
2	1525780106	12	HBO
3	1525789032	3	https://i.imgur.com/YAGpXPd.png
2	1525783837	3	The ones running the exchanges? The ones running the ICO scams? The ones running ad-infested blogs?So many to choose from!
2	1525785249	3	Depends. Are we saying past 5 months, or past 9 years, really.
0	1525769684	1	Muthafukn crypto bitch.
0	1525773625	1	Global economics and myth management ...system overloading
0	1525775336	1	Great show. Great quote :)
0	1525780118	1	Endorses "motherfucking goddamn cryptocurrency." Guilfoyle is the man.
0	1525786946	1	Do we have a gif of this yet?
0	1525788643	1	All hail crypto Jesus! (crypto Satan?)
0	1525789836	1	The snake freed humanity by giving us consciousness.   Organized religion in modern times is a way governments and ruling elites use to Control and make the population complacent with the way shitty things are.   Opiate of the masses.  Mind control.  
0	1525789940	1	and full satan...
0	1525790191	1	Who is this chump? Satan?
0	1525792622	1	Broken clock situation
0	1525796161	1	Did this show ever get good? Quit watching at some point in the first season.
1	1525797581	2	Are you kidding me? Season 1 finale is a brilliant masterpiece that involves jerking dicks
0	1525796990	1	I like this guy.
0	1525797612	1	Well the current season was written (I assume) at the height of the last crypto mania so they would be dumb not to include crypto in some way.
0	1525798365	1	You never go full crypto
0	1525799403	1	And their ICO tanks like most have been lately. This is hardly bullish.
0	1525800078	1	Guys, they talked about bitcorn on a tv show! We're going to get lambos! See you on the moon!
0	1525800600	1	There's more goodness at the PiedPiper [website](http://www.piedpiper.com/), including the full [powerpoint presentation](http://www.piedpiper.com/app/themes/pied-piper/dist/images/Gilfoyle_s_Crypto_PowerPoint_-_Digital_Edition.pdf) that Gilfoyle attempts to give to Richard during the episode."There is a 98.745% chance of making 100x profit"
0	1525772269	1	I wonder how many viewers didn't know about crypto currency before watching this.
1	1525779199	8	Probably none
0	1525756781	-10	Gilfoyle totally kills it this season. I love this show but You need to be working somewhere around IT, programming to fully appreciate it.
1	1525760200	27	Anyone can fully appreciate this show. 
2	1525761089	6	Not anyone, but also not exclusively IT people.
2	1525762067	-3	I have to disagree. There are tons of jokes and scenes that someone unrelated to IT will not understand at all.
3	1525767758	9	And plenty that anyone will get.  Mike Judge has broad appeal.  You don't have to have had a shitty cubicle job to appreciate Office space. 
1	1525772403	5	Does this mean I can put New Yorker, professional boxer and WW2 veteran on my CV? I have watched How I met your mother, Rocky and Dunkirk, and enjoyed it.
1	1525775213	3	/r/gatekeeping
0	1525758877	-8	Lol did you guys even watch she episode? They get fucked In The end with an ICO 
1	1525760447	16	Google translate did not help me on this one unfortunately 
2	1525764800	4	Didn't help OP either
0	1525757964	-2	Too bad their ico is failing. 
1	1525761618	14	Are you kidding? Pied Piper Coin only has 440,000 tokens. Their dev team is amazing. Have you seen their stallions? Not to mention all their partnerships and most importantly, the mind of Richard Hendriks. On a serious note: they say that their coin needs to be worth $68 dollars to be worth the $30,000,000 that the VC offered. That’s roughly 441k tokens. Honestly that’s so few, it should have been 440m to get close to what other ICOs do. 
2	1525783942	1	If simply issuing more coins is a solution to anything, why don't they just issue a gazillion conis? Surely that would make them infinitely rich?
1	1525760693	10	They fail on everything they do. That’s how the show works. 
2	1525776037	5	More like they “fail forward”. They were at least offered a Series B term sheet for several million. If that’s failing”, sign me up. Most startups never leave the Ramen noodle phase. 
1	1525778268	3	That’s the point of the show. It’s like Top Gear used to be: everything they do ends badly.
0	1525795913	0	Where is the ico project he is starting cant find anything about it ?!
0	1525757683	-7	no
0	1525763145	-12	God, I fucking hate that guy and everything he stands for. 
1	1525765217	4	Sounds like you're on team Gilfoyle my dude! Yeah! Fuck God! 
0	1525785257	-7	Just what we need. Another foul-mouthed weirdo touting crypto in a way that will make any mainstream investor turn and run. Sorry to be the naysayer, but this is marketing for bears. We need people like Andreas selling Bitcoin/crypto, not people like this driving people away from it.
1	1525789143	3	You must be fun at parties.
2	1525797316	1	You seem very original.
2	1525801072	1	Depends on the party ;-)
1	1525801545	1	You sound like you're 90 years old. 
2	1525803988	1	In most cultures that would be a compliment.
3	1525804293	1	You know what I meant, and it definitely was not a compliment.  
0	1525753793	-44	This is funny, but the fact that it's on this show means it's part of the silicon valley bubble, imo. 
1	1525754007	31	...part of the Silicon Valley revolution, imo. 😬
1	1525755766	7	Lots of folks in the valley hold crypto buddy.  I'm not from SV but I know plenty of crypto enthusiasts from there.
2	1525755885	-7	Yeah, I get that... Woosh...
1	1525758131	3	Yeah I'd hate to be part of the most technologically advanced and wealthiest "bubble" in the world. Better not follow their lead on things. /s
