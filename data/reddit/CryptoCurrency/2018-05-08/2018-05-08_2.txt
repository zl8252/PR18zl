0	1525724532	270	"I agree I would short it if there was an easy way to do it," he said.Roflllll  Yea you helped create Microsoft but can't find it easy to short Bitcoin. Parade of dinosaurs now.
1	1525735803	40	If only the Chicago Mercantile Exchange offered futures contracts for Bitcoin...
2	1525758855	5	Not enough liquidity for ol' Billy. Who'd be on the other side of his bet when he shorts $1B?
2	1525750761	2	Los Angeles Oil Exchange
1	1525736489	221	To be fair to Bill, he’s a philanthropist that has agreed to help those living in poverty by giving away 99% of his wealth when he dies. The Bill and Melinda foundation has saved thousands if not millions of lives.He might be old school and classed as a dinosaur, but he did found the biggest tech firm on the planet and has regularly topped the Forbes rich list.He might be wrong about Bitcoin and we may see it succeed, but he’ll always have my respect for wanting to help others. Compare that to other similarly wealthy people that want to see their wealth continue to grow and remain in the family after their passing.We need more people like Bill on this planet. 
2	1525740281	80	I can’t stand it when people act negatively towards people like Bill Gates just because they said something they don’t agree with. He’s an exemplary person, and his stance on Crypto doesn’t change that.
3	1525745389	34	Nobody is perfect. Bill is not perfect. You are still allowed to criticize people if you think it's a valid criticism, even if the person you are criticizing is a nice guy.
4	1525746781	27	Everybody is just totally shitting on him and calling him a dinosaur, though.
5	1525748824	9	It's reddit, here's what happens any time there's a valid critique of someone: As soon as a negative comment gets upvoted everyone else thinks its safe, then they hop on the hate bandwagon and start writing nasty comments to pander to the people voting. That's just everyone's monkey brains trying to pick on the unpopular guy to be accepted by the group.
5	1525782675	0	C'mon, in the crypto world, everyone over the age of 35 is a dinosaur automatically. Nothing good ever comes from old people.That will all change, though, once the crypto generation gets older. Then, all of a sudden they will be praising age and experience and criticizing young people for being foolish.
5	1525757795	-3	Well he's acting like an asshole in this case running his mouth on subjects he has no clue of. What should we do, suck his dick? Why are you crying for him like he's an abandoned puppy and not one of the most powerful men in the world?
4	1525793458	0	hah, yes, nobody is perfect, exept people who dislike bill, according to r/cryptocurrency.  member when bill said that btc is better than currency and everybody was *yeah this guy gets it, 100% adoption is around the corner*
4	1525753589	-4	If we're judging 'nice guy ' status based on the amount of good done in the world by that person Bill gates is hovering about 6 inches off the ground melting everything around him with the intensity of his niceness. The dude is a saint.
5	1525754116	7	Yeah, but an equally nice guy with no money wouldn't be able to positively effect the world very much, so that's not a very good measurement of nice guy status.
3	1525744603	-2	FINE.He's a charitable tech dinosaur. Stop being offended about nothing, people aren't hating on his philanthropy, we're saying he's not being genuine about Crypto.
4	1525753035	15	>Stop being offended about nothingthe irony
5	1525755004	-8	fuck ur mother
5	1525761621	-6	What's ironic about it?
6	1525764745	3	The guy is offended because his current craze got a knock (and likely he thinks that the price of it took the knock too), while at the same time telling people to not be offended.It is not amazingly high on irony scale but it is still up there.
7	1525764979	-2	Is that really irony? I would think hypocrisy would be a better suited term.
8	1525765251	1	Why not both.He's being hypocritical, we therefore find it mildly ironic as per the following definition:"a literary technique, originally used in Greek tragedy, by which the full significance of a character's words or actions is clear to the audience or reader although unknown to the character."But of course it's all up one's own interpretation anyway.
9	1525781960	1	I still don't think that definition applies and I also don't believe definitions of words are open for interpretation. But i'm being downvoted, so I guess people want me to stop being a pedantic asshole. 
3	1525786636	1	A billion can buy you a lot of PR
3	1525756293	1	What? We're acting negatively against his dumb statement. That doesn't make people suddenly anti-Bill Gates. You can disagree with someone without becoming their enemy. At least that's what mature, intelligent people do. 
3	1525743958	-3	Amen. The man needs a sainthood or something. He gives away like 500mil a year or more to make the world a better place. Winkelvos is now on my shit list, though they basically already were.
2	1525744418	8	So overpopulation is Bills fault.   Got it. 👨🏽‍💻 Sarc. Sarcasm just in case I was being sarcastic in case your still not clear (Its Reddit you gotta drive it home to some) 
2	1525737340	6	His foundation uses XRP. Did you forget this?
3	1525737803	10	Actually, it's more in favour of FACTOM which is all about data integrity and recently released M3
3	1525750965	1	This is a good litmus test for what the crypto community should be against. If they use XRP, there's a good chance they're making tangible attempts to kill crypto, just like XRP.
3	1525745226	-2	> His foundation uses XRP. Did you forget this?XRP gonna make it faster than all of the shit you shill here, pseudoexperts for 5 cents.
4	1525751006	2	Ripple xcurrent already made abroad payments free for my bank and many others. What "faster"? It's already lightning fast lulz without XRP
2	1525752173	2	That doesn’t mean when he says something stupid people shouldn’t point out how stupid it was.
2	1525786769	-2	His philanthropy is all PR and no proof.His closed source lock in system has held us back.He created Microsoft, never forgive never forget.
3	1525791470	2	Stop talking bollox.
4	1525791562	-1	You're the one spreading Bill Gates' bullshit PR for free.Onus is on you to show any of this amazing not for profit philanthropy.The foundation website looks like an ICO web page.Knowing his legacy with Microsoft, assuming it all to be absolute horseshit by default is the only option.
5	1525791624	2	Again, stop talking bollox.
1	1525758436	4	someone give bill a link to bitmex
1	1525727707	13	Maybe he prefers Bitcoin cash XD
2	1525728048	-50	Who doesn't?
3	1525730101	36	Agreed, everyone wants to short bitcoin cash.
4	1525732679	8	Ah the old reddit [crypt-o-roo] (https://np.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/8he1l6/humor_what_did_i_just_see/dyjd208/?context=2)
5	1525735157	6	Hold my portfolio, im going in
5	1525735164	-1	Hodl my portfolio, im going in
6	1525751434	1	pic or didnt happen
4	1525751070	1	I dont think anyone has the balls to do so though. Go ahead, put a short order and show us. I will gladly accept the risk of downvotes and being wrong for what is about to fall on that poor guy in the next few days lulz
4	1525755359	1	Ah the circlejerk continues. I love how this sub loves to criticize /r/Bitcoin but this sub is literally infiltrated with them to control the narrative.Learn to think for yourself every now and then, it's actually very liberating
4	1525731933	-19	One of the defining characteristics of Bitcoin shills (aka victims of their own greed) is these elementary-school word games in lieu of argument. It's how I know you know you're losing.
5	1525736426	4	FWIW I'm self-employed as a Bitcoin shill but it's less greed than pessimism. I don't short anything ever; I'd err on the side of too bearish and lose money. It's much more challenging and rewarding to point at the ideas one thinks _should_ work.
6	1525741522	-2	A shitload of people have gotten lucky rich with crypto and a lot of them appear to think it was straight skill and wisdom. I don't doubt anyone's ability to pull the right card out of the deck, but the idea that there are experts and amateurs right now is just lunacy. The only guide is common sense and avoiding all but objective truth.
7	1525782440	0	That's anti-intellectualism.
8	1525784991	0	It's anti made up horseshit from a bunch of self-interested amateurs who aren't even trying to see the larger picture. Intellectuals ask good questions to find correct answers. What they don't do is speculate pointlessly without context.
5	1525732231	3	“Lol who invited this guy?”I bet you hear that a lot
6	1525732690	-14	You don't understand the internet and I don't give a fuck about what you want
3	1525728723	-13	Yeah it seems most likely to rise in value given its adoption and old school BTC vibe. It's like a second chance at the moon train for those who missed BTC :)
4	1525729849	5	> old school BTC vibe. It's like a second chanceThat's a [cargo cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult).
5	1525729856	5	**Cargo cult**A cargo cult is a millenarian movement first described in Melanesia which encompasses a range of practices and occurs in the wake of contact with more technologically advanced societies. The name derives from the belief which began among Melanesians in the late 19th and early 20th century that various ritualistic acts such as the building of an airplane runway will result in the appearance of material wealth, particularly highly desirable Western goods (i.e., "cargo"), via Western airplanes.Cargo cults often develop during a combination of crises. Under conditions of social stress, such a movement may form under the leadership of a charismatic figure.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
5	1525731241	1	Sounds like the perfect thing for a quick surge in price XD. In all honesty I think more of it than that but I don't mind the speculative bubbles along the way up to increase my holdings :)
4	1525729240	-12	BTC is not going to the moon. It could have, but that time is over. It'll do fine, but no moon. Sorry
5	1525729455	7	Yeah I know but BCH is not BTC
6	1525729665	-4	Correct. BCH still has a chance to moon, as does Ethereum. They stuck by their stated principles. Bitcoin, on the other hand, self-sabotaged and then whined about it. You've dominated bad news about crypto since late 2017, and barely appeared in the good. You missed your chance.
7	1525737491	1	BCH is really the only ppl I see whine about it. Take one look at that sub it’s a shit show of delusion and desperation to be the “holy one” whatever the fuck that means. Bitcoin (BTC) is just getting started with more money flooding the market coming up. Bcash isn’t a bad investment but bitcoin is far from dead. Although I which alts could just fucking separate Fromm bitcoin already
8	1525739393	0	The sad truth is there is no innovation in BTC..LN is neat but is not a scaling solution. All the business and innovation is on the becash side. Your focus on "money coming in" doesn't amount to anything. Money came into BTC 5 months ago, then what happened? Utility is what matters for products in the long run.
9	1525741583	1	LN isn't neat, it's a grating embarrassment. A betrayal of Bitcoin's own principles.
9	1525739994	0	I agreed that why I’ve been hard in ethereum and other alts. That’s where the innovation AND the money will come from not bitcoin or BCH 
8	1525741653	-1	Your whole post is about your feelings. You're literally whining for a whole paragraph about how you're not whining.Stop lying to yourself, if no one else: Bitcoin is a fucking disaster, self-inflicted, and your reaction is to lash out. You are pathetic children, and you deserve what you're going to get.
9	1525742795	-1	Cool story. I have no horse in the race when it comes to the bitcoin/bcash debate. I just find the delusion and hypocrisy in ur “home group” petty. TBH it’s not much better in the /r/bitcoin sub. Honestly alts are the way of the future, bitcoin and bcash will still be around for a long while. But alts are where the innovation is happening AND where the real money is to be made I feel. They have far greater potential for ROI. Good luck 
5	1525729667	3	Im sorry but 100k by 2020 is looking likely dependent on how many people shift over to alts.
6	1525732152	1	Why are you sorry? This is pure conjecture. Not that you have any other choice: there's no meaningful history to any of this stuff. You're guessing. So am I, but I'm basing my guess on how well different platforms do what they say they will do, and how.Bitcoin is failing in a way that may well be correctible, but I don't think we'll ever know one way or the other, since none of you seem interested in addressing Bitcoin's serious problems. You just screech on Reddit about how unfair it all is.
5	1525733176	4	> it could haveThat is such a bizarre thing to say about a coin that one year ago was trading at $1,600 and trades today at $9,300
6	1525741306	1	The question is whether it will hit six figures. What you just said has literally nothing to do with that.Do you not get that all of this is unprecedented? If you're not returning to first principles, you're giving yourself zero chance of seeing the future. If you are you may have 5% chance. Make at least that amount of effort.
7	1525742420	0	> The question is whether it will hit six figures. Says who? I’m just responding to a comment you made. I looked through this chain again to see if anyone mentioned 6 figures, they didn’t. 
8	1525743315	1	You think the goal of Bitcoin was to make it to $9300? You need remedial reading classes
1	1525742731	1	I think this further proves his lack of understanding of Bitcoin / crypto if he didn't even know about cboe btc shorts 
1	1525733875	-13	The only thing Bill Gates knows how to short is his dick.
2	1525737636	4	Based off ur username u must watch Rick n Morty? Is that why no one understands wtf ur talking about?
0	1525728246	28	Well, Microsoft runs a node for Ripple, so...
0	1525724378	30	I know Bitcoin is the recognizable name brand but gates is tech savvy, why hasn't anyone asked him his thoughts on ethereum or any of the other cryptocurrencies that's not about store of value... And I'm not talking about ICOs either.
1	1525727588	64	Bill Gates isnt the leader of technology he once was. He retired from Microsoft and now runs the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation with his wife.His main focus now seems to be the eradication of a couple of diseases and generally improving healthcare in 3rd world countries.I honestly wouldn't be surprised if he just didn't give a shit about cryptocurrencies and doesn't know anything other than a cursory Google of Bitcoin.
2	1525727838	40	>Bing of Bitcoin
3	1525745508	6	Gates actually taught Buffet to use Google in 2010 when Buffet was still using Altavista. Steve Ballmer would get the credit for releasing Bing in 2009 since Gates wasn't even with the company at that time.
2	1525731706	7	I'm going with this answer. 
2	1525796795	2	So then why is talking about shorting it?  If he didn't care, he'd just say "I don't really pay attention to that tech" instead of taking a negative position against it.  
2	1525728950	5	"We will never make a 32-bit operating system," Bill GatesAlbeit in 1983, still a ballsy level of short-sightedness.
2	1525743474	-7	Bill Gates doesn't care about the 3rd world he is a euginicist just like his daddy don't be so niave.
1	1525734653	7	I'm pretty sure Bill knows a lot more about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology than most people that frequent this subreddit.He's big on stuff that helps the less fortunate. So if there's a tool that can give these people financial independence (being their own bank), he's all for it. I believe their foundation even supported Factom a while back (2016 or 2017?).What he doesn't like is the mining, volatility of price, et cetera.
2	1525768911	6	I don't think he (or Buffett) like that crypto has simply become a speculative way for money-grubbers to make cash. It's not a way to 'bring down the banks' anymore or a social 'movement'; it's a get-rich-quick scheme with a series of shady individuals holding the most of it. It's not going to help or change the world.... at least not this incarnation of it. That's what most early blockchain supporters like myself wanted. Gates and his foundation are on a mission of world betterment now, and I think he is only concerned with things that will help the world. 
3	1525779536	4	Nailed it.
2	1525737070	-1	He might know more about cryptography, but CC is quite far out of his area of expertise as he has proven time and again.
0	1525745024	7	Bill Gates could literally create the biggest pump and dump crypto has ever seen
0	1525722147	29	Oh boy. New generation, new heroes. 
1	1525728108	-31	A tiny fraction of the new generation will survive, much less be heroes. Stop smoking your own pole
2	1525749589	6	Smoking your own pole? That's the only way these coins have any value! If every coin stopped doing that, then people would realize they're worthless!
0	1525724126	67	Wtf is this guy thinking? Can you imagine billions trying to move the price down? We can't even stay at 10k and that's just us and the bots/whales/every crypto miner. If BG gets recruited, it's gonna be like son goku joining the bears' fight.
1	1525725843	116	Wtf are you thinking? Shorting is great for true price discovery. By all means he should short it. If Bitcoin has legs it will rise. If it fails, it was a bubble all along. Let the market settle this 
2	1525726631	58	But my lambo...
3	1525727344	7	This is so much worth reading https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen/short-sellers-make-vw-the-worlds-priciest-firm-idUSTRE49R3I920081028
3	1525752192	2	If Bitcoin is meant to persist then one day there'll be the short squeeze of a lifetime if billionaires start shorting it. The it'll really be lambo time.I'm a patient man, Bitcoin has gotten us this far, I think it'll get us much farther.  I think we have a 50% chance of 1 BTC=1 Lambo by 2021. Probably a base model Huracan but still.
2	1525733114	15	I'll buy after that dip
2	1525745646	4	Shorting is only great for market discovery assuming no one entity has market power. Otherwise it's not shorting it's bear raiding. 
3	1525758644	1	Exactly. Classic way to generate profits is to push the market (up or down) until people's stops kick in, then the group trying to push the market leave when they see their is self-sustained movement in the direction that they were trying to push it. 
2	1525741114	3	Couldn't agree more. 
2	1525732005	0	Maybe he doesn't trust any of the exchanges that allow this. mathematically it's safer to short bitcoin when positions are paid out in BTC, I'm bullish right now but as soon as we're over 11k I'm going to start DCA a short. very sensible thing to do with a small portion of your portfolio, if btc does go to liquidation prices over 27k then the rest of my portfolio would  more than outweigh any $ lost hedging myself against the dips, September is coming and it's going to be an absolute bloodbath even if Gox doesn't sell 100's of millions will still be taken in profit out of fear 
3	1525732529	1	Agree with you on the Gox part. If 160000 BTC enter the market, they will cause mayhem. Specially as they are locked away at sub 1000 prices. I will be buying
3	1525745471	-8	[removed]
4	1525758655	4	binance doesn't allow shorting. 
1	1525725143	15	shorting barely hurts the price and if anything we'll just get a short squeeze like before.
2	1525761731	1	I would consider Bill's large short order might just be one of his greatest charitable acts.
2	1525741045	0	You clearly don't read reddit enough... Don't you know that shorting is the whole reason we had the January dip!?!??!
1	1525726547	16	Bill doesn't know shit about Bitcoin just like he pretended to not know shit about the internet in the 90s because he knew it was a threat to his business model. He's a smart guy, but he's very clearly lying and Winkletinkle is calling his bluff.
2	1525783368	2	Didn't know shit about the internet? The same Bill Gates that wrote a long memo to his company in 1995 -- when there were few web pages and very few regular people had access -- that the internet was an unstoppable tidal wave of the future and that Microsoft would focus itself on being an internet company? That Bill Gates?
2	1525734881	6	You know his business is philanthropy these days right?  He is trying to promote health and education throughout the developing world.  I don't think he is lying, but I also don't know how knowledgeable of an investor he is.  Plus cryptos are probably just not on his radar.  Why would they be?
3	1525734998	5	He definitely has very strong opinions on where society is headed in every regard from improvement of humanity to technology to agriculture to disease control. I just happen to think he's either bluffing about this belief or uneducated, the latter of which I would never expect from someone as intelligent as he.
4	1525735499	6	I don't think he is much of a bluffer, my guess is that he has not looked too deeply into cryptos.  The guy has been past having to worry about money on a personal level for a looong time, so why even bother researching or thinking about it?So, if you are in that situation and your buddy Warren (the greatest investor in history) tells you to short, smart money would short.  Like I said, just a guess.  I happen to disagree with them.  
5	1525756360	1	Warren also said the internet was a fad and struggled to explain his recent purchase of Apple shares in terms other than pure business sense. I agree with his views on Apple as a brand's perceived value, but it was obvious he didn't understand the how or the why of said value. That's to be expected of someone his age, but it's still disappointing nonetheless. Him and Bill are brilliant guys, but they're a bit past their prime of relevancy imo and mostly give out fairly obvious advice whenever they appear on CNBC imo.
5	1525761841	1	In 2014 he said he liked bitcoin because it was cheap to get funds into the hands of those without banks \- those in developing countries.
1	1525745907	2	Push the price down till those in underwater longs fold and push the price down even farther. Then the billionaires close their shorts in profits once they liquidate the longs. 
1	1525725011	3	Yeah, he's really poking the bear here
1	1525727921	2	LMFAO at the goku analogy. Bill Gates has much much much better things to do with his time than to prove some point. Plus, he is way too high class to do such things.

0	1525754000	10	Bill Gates. Don't be evil. Microsoft just put the recycle old computer dealer to the federal prison for 15 months and $50,000 fine with the felony charges for the rest of his life. Bill Gates and Microsoft put ten thousands or hundred thousands of American people to the federal prison with his copyright infringement laws. You go to China and enforce your crappy copyright with the Chinese government.
0	1525736239	3	Remember that Bill Gates was never into cutting edge technology.Microsoft had the last OS to support the internet and didn't want have anything to do with it. Almost every other common computer at the time supported it.Microsoft was at war with cloud computing and preached profusely about how it sucked as a technology, while Google and everyone else perfected it.Of course now Microsoft will tell you they were a pioneer as they will in the future when they find a way to make cryptocurrency work with their business model.
0	1525736598	3	He won't because its a manipulated market. His short will be REKT by the exchanges.
1	1525743598	4	His net worth is around 50% of the market cap. If he really wanted to, I imagine he'd do just fine.
2	1525753810	1	Really? Even against an exchange that can print USDT as much as it needs?

4	1525757579	-4	Not sure what delet ti means ?
0	1525726741	4	Gotta LOL at people like Gates and Buffet bagging on crypto for being "speculative", as if these arch capitalist creeps haven't made their billions doing exactly that: SPECULATING.
1	1525727686	66	Bill Gates made his billions by running an extremely successful company though 
2	1525727926	12	He made billions creating a key piece of software at a critical time. Running the company was kind of a by-product and he got out of the day to day operations quite early.Smart guy, but also a combination of right place and right time.
3	1525728880	34	Literally every successful company/person ever is 'right time right place' that's not a helpful addition to the conversation.The entire point of being an entrepreneur is marketing a solution to an existing problem in a timely fashion.Similarly, I know everyone loves to think that these Global CEO's do fuck all but sit on yachts, but running an international business is hard and is literally your life, at no point can you relax. If the CEO of an international publicly traded company was sitting about doing fuck all the shareholders would throw him out in an instant.
4	1525735171	1	Always thought I'd end up in a nice management position. Then I realized I like fucking off with my free time more than I like grinding out 60+ hour weeks. 
4	1525730585	0	Bill Gates is retired though...
5	1525731323	2	He wasn't always though..
3	1525728423	14	Gates *speculated* (accurately, it turns out) that if he bought DOS cheap from the guy who wrote it that he could license it to IBM for lots of money. 
4	1525729436	1	Yep. Literally flipping.
5	1525729848	5	Damn, he dares. That is literally business -- seeing an opportunity, and exploring it.
3	1525728253	3	~~creating~~ *buying the rights to*
3	1525735597	2	Also his business tactics weren't exactly praiseworthy in the beginning.
3	1525735004	1	If anyone wants a really good book to read about this sort of thing, take a look at [Outliers By Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book). With regards to Bill Gates, if I recall correctly, he had a lot of luck in his early years having access to a university's computer lab because his mother - who luckily got the position in that particular area where one of the first computers was - happened to work there, which started him off on that road. I'm not trying to take away from Gates' hard-work, of which there was/is a lot, but to show that there is an element of luck to it all. 
3	1525728083	1	This time it's US at the right place, right time (crypto), and Gates at the wrong place and time. :)
4	1525730150	1	When Bill says it, that's his expertise talking! When cryptocurrency experts say anything like this, Reddit calls it the "hot-hand fallacy".
3	1525743187	1	He created a monopoly trying to have complete control of how the world interacted with computers and the internet. It was so bad the govt had stop him and msft. Basically he embodied the opposite of everything blockchain is about. 
1	1525731715	1	This thread has literally more “literally”s casually thrown around than literally any other thread I’ve ever read.  
2	1525735936	2	Rob Lowe is literally replying to himself
1	1525728020	-2	Buffett also said that bitcoin has no value, when he knows damn well that value is determined and assigned by the market. 
2	1525728784	18	I think anyone with a brain knows that when he says value he means intrinsic value. And he's bashing its speculative value because it has no intrinsic value. I'm not saying I agree with him, but your comment makes no sense.
3	1525730681	2	Pretend Bitcoin was never invented for a second.If Folding@home didn't solve protein folding, and instead just generated extremely secure time stamps, would those stamps be useful to anyone?
3	1525729294	3	I understand that. Companies have intrinsic value if they go under- Free cash flow, equipment, real estate, etc., and crypto does not. But, the statement as he said it isn’t true. Literally anything is worth whatever people are willing to pay for it. 
3	1525737118	0	Being able to transfer value securely is intrinsically valuable signaled by every one charging a fee to do it. But i agree that Buffet probably doesn't think bitcoin is the best way.
2	1525729323	2	>Buffett also said that bitcoin has no value, when he knows damn well that value is determined and assigned by the market. Buffet's whole investing philosophy is finding value in stable companies that are undervalued at the price assigned by the market.  He obviously doesn't see value in Bitcoin at current prices because it goes against how he made the majority of his wealth.
0	1525724086	3	Not to be that guy, but he said he would short bitcoin in specific. I would too if I was that rich and wanted to prove a point. He mentions that Bitcoin and ICOs are speculative things, which they are. The thought of Bitcoin staying as #1 coin as new and better solutions come into the light, is dim. Blockchain in general will find a foothold, but in my eyes, obtaining and maintaining BTC is simply too advanced for average joe/jane.
0	1525729810	2	Why is it always about shorting ? Why not long ?    Is it more risky to short ?
1	1525731361	4	Because shorters make money when price drops. Going Long implies you’re holding it/ believe the price will rise over a time period. Bill Gates doesn’t believe it, so to prove that, winklevoss is saying short it.
1	1525731229	5	A long is a buy position and your total possible loss is limited to your initial investment and your profits are theoretically unlimited. A short is a sell position and you total possible loss is theoretically unlimited, with maximum potential upside of 100%. So yes, a short position is much riskier than a long generally.
2	1525741496	3	This is incorrect. You'll get liquidated either shorting or longing once the position moves against you sufficiently, and won't lose more than you invested. Also, you can easily make 100%+ profits while shorting with leverage (which everyone uses).
3	1525746037	1	I suppose we are both correct. If you aren’t using a large proportion of your portfolio you can still lose more than you invest when you short, provided you still have enough in other holdings to stay above the maintenance requirement. But yeah if you use your whole portfolio you will get closed out before you lose everything(assuming there’s enough liquidity in whatever asset you’re trading).
2	1525733048	5	You can leverage a long position as well and get liquidated once the price drops too low. It is no way less risky then shorting

2	1525796377	1	Thanks but really that just leaves more questions than answers. First off, is the person borrowing it today under the assumption that it will be worth less in the future when they re-buy it to return it?Why would they borrow bitcoin instead of cash?and wouldnt there be a loss selling bitcoin due to taxes and transaction fees? And why would Bill Gates want to do this exactly? For what purpose?

0	1525794750	1	You've got two individuals who made billions upon billions of dollars at new-market entry points, holding positions which may be jeopardized with new technology and operating systems... telling you that new market ideologies and new technology is bad. Let me know how much that makes sense. On top of everything, Warren Buffet's advice was "Stay away from Bitcoin*s* and keep to Index Funds". Let me just slam all my money in index funds as world economies slowly crumble under corporate greed and poorly regulated government agencies while approaching an economic crash reminiscent of 2008 while they have the ability to short the fucking market and make a killing. Sounds good champ. 
0	1525800632	1	Bill gates has been wrong about a lot of things, but he listened to smart advisors and did not put his money where his mouth. I'm sure bitcoin is also one of those things. He is just trying to misdirect the public.Also, if pirates of the silicon valley is any proof, his whole company is based on a lie.
0	1525801382	1	Tyler is right for calling out GatesMicrosoft is part of Ethereum Enterprise Alliance and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has ties to the Ripple corp so its not surprise him attacking BTC only
0	1525727996	1	Guess what? Gates is right. Not that Bitcoin will fail; it'll do OK. But it has no chance of being #1 any more, because you abandoned your own principles. Just staying on the board will be a challenge, but there's plenty of room in Crypto. Even for dumbass Bitcoin.You abandoned your platform. How the fuck do you abandon your platform?
0	1525768413	1	Bill Gates says BTC doesn't have any value then goes on to say that the technology has value. That's a contradiction.Warren Buffet sees the value in & invests in rail roads to transport physical assets but fails to see that Crypto is rail road for digital assets. Warren Buffet missed out investing in all today's leading tech stocks Bill Gates and Microsoft missed out on boom in the mobile sectorThese guys are clever but not infallible
0	1525726964	1	I would not bet against one of the nost brilliant engineers and businessman ever, even if they look past the underlying tech not currency. He could probably just recruit a few of his pals to short it to oblivion. It's like  Zimbabwe daring the US economy.

2	1525771868	0	He is not even qualified to be a janitor of Bill Gates. Not accomplishment wise and not even money wise. Investing early in BTC is not even close to what Bill Gates has done.
