0	1525756175	139	In other news, a tortoise beat a sloth in a race.  Also, a one-eyed kid solved a rubix cube faster than a blind kid.
1	1525764132	18	Correct. I m wondering when a feeless, high throughput network will pop up. My hopes are with iota in 2018.
2	1525797926	6	Ethereums roadmap has scaling coming in. Vitaliks sharding spec was released recently and with just sharding (before plasma or raiden etc) eth will be able to run 100 versions of its blockchain in parallel which hits above visa level at 1000+ transactions a second. Combine this with a stablecoin (dai or dgx) you now have a real crypto “currency”. The stablecoin part is necessary and requires smart contracts to stay stable. 
3	1525802371	0	There are now 15k ETH nodes, maybe 10k by the time sharding is ready. So if the blockchain is split in 100 shards, the address balances would be stored on only 100-150 computers. Not very secure IMO.
2	1525764908	73	There already is one, NANO.
3	1525773490	10	How come people still doesn't know this?
4	1525775145	17	People know, but Nano doesn't offer as much as Ethereum and Iota. It's 'just' a currency. Edit: Interpunction
5	1525779541	10	Outside of reddit and specific YouTube channels, regular crypto investors (those that know and hold btc eth and ltc) have not heard of Nano. I'm guessing it's because it's not on coinbase 
5	1525787212	3	And Ethereum (which I hold) is "just a smart contracts platform" which makes it great. IOTA is trying to be everything and that's why it hasn't impressed yet.
6	1525791981	4	Hasn't impressed yet but will impress you on 3. june 2018
7	1525795832	1	It might. I don't hate on any crypto project emotionally, anything good for one crypto helps legitimize the space. I just think the project is vastly overvalued for a solution that is still quite centralized, which is why I didn't invest. The tech didn't impress me. If they can make it work without the Coordinator it would be very interesting for sure.
8	1525797318	2	It can already work without the coordinator, and the network has worked perfectly with the coordinator shut down many times. the coordinator is just there to protect against the "51% attacks" before the network is strong enough on its own 
9	1525798935	0	I've seen this point made often, and it belies a misunderstanding of blockchain incentives. If a central processing node is announced to be shut down for a short-term period of time, there is no economic incentive to override that network as there would be in a fully public decentralized ledger, because the malicious entity trying to overpower the network would know that the IOTA company could "switch" back on the Coordinator node at any time and shut down their attempt. So in that situation there is only economic downside, no economic upside. That **does not** at all prove that this system works without the Coordinator. The only true test of that is when/if it's shut off for good. I'm thinking about making a full post about this because it's a common misconception.
5	1525777009	10	Bitcoin is “just a currency”. 
6	1525777689	6	bitcoin chain is used in more legit and real world usage techs and research than all shitcoins combined
7	1525786640	4	Yeah, like the on-chain social media platform Memo.And the paid seeding bittorrent client, Joystream.Amazing strides being made in adoption.
8	1525792264	0	I've got much higher hopes for Joystream than for Memo. Bittorrent use is censored, social networking isn't.
9	1525797285	4	how is social networking not censored? you live in the west? ask the rest of the world 
7	1525790653	1	Komodo adds hash signatures to bitcoin's blockchain to secure their own blockchain.
8	1525796509	1	yeah. zcash was a bitcoin fork wasn't it? Dogecoin, bitcoin dark, there are so many unnamed bitcoin forks used for academic purposes. 
7	1525780508	0	Any source? Or just a feeling?
8	1525783567	3	We're talking use *right now*. That's it. Many shitcoins are still being developed and thus has no use right now. 
6	1525777471	1	Exactly, that's why it has been losing ground to other coins in the last year. BTC Dominance is shrinking.
7	1525780124	2	Because people are recognising cryto’s potential outside of it just being a currency. Doesn’t mean it’s not useful as a currency. 
8	1525784441	2	Bitcoin isn't useful as a currency unless you want the person you're buying a couch from off craigslist to be able to see your net worth, or for your mom to see your membership payment to midgetfarts.com 
9	1525786702	2	Bitcoin isn’t useful as a currency because of the speed and fees, let alone that. 
5	1525799344	1	> Iotalol
5	1525802839	1	TrustNote !
4	1525793459	1	That's what I was wondering when I read the dudes question lol.
2	1525770317	5	XRP isn't technically feeless, but the costs are neglible per transaction (fraction of a cent, anti-spamming measure).  However, XRP is provable at scale.  It processes between 600K to 1M transactions daily.  
3	1525770825	4	Thats about 10 tx/s. XRP sounds good, if the tx throughput can actually scale up to such amounts. but can it go *much* beyond? and are there any smart contracts in the works?
4	1525775301	8	Codius is in the works. 
4	1525775673	5	Xrp can scale upto 1500tps.
5	1525788733	2	I read that PayPal is at 130 tps and Western Union is 30 tps so that seems pretty efficient in contrast
6	1525793718	1	Those don't really count. Its like comparing a Toyota to a Ferrari. Both are vehicles, but so much different beyond that similarity. PayPal  counts since it's a digital platform. PayPal and cc's would be the comparison. Imho.
4	1525784725	4	> but can it go much beyond?With the release of Cobalt this year, XRP can deal with 50,000 tx/s - with transaction times reduced from 4 seconds down to 1 second.   Codius is the name of the smart contract platform that XRP uses - this has gone back into production (was retired in 2015).  
3	1525777728	0	what are these 1 million transactions if noone uses XRP yet?
4	1525788785	2	XRP is in use by dozens of partners.
5	1525792510	5	Dozens!
5	1525796524	1	no it's not
5	1525802599	1	What can someone use XRP for? I see almost 1 million transaction per day, but have no idea what are those. At least I know that ETH is used for Cryptokitties and Ponzi schemes and other "smart contracts"
4	1525781176	2	> what are these 1 million transactions if noone uses XRP yet?How could there be 1 million transactions if noone were using XRP? Cuallix is already using the xRapid beta version, and the community believes xRapid will be released as a full product soon, as they pushed Rippled to their final stage on github this morning.
4	1525784636	1	Clearly people are using XRP.  xRapid is not live yet though.
2	1525804592	1	Iota is not "free" to use. The fee just manifests itself elsewhere, i.e., by the proof of work required to send the transaction.  Similarly, EOS transactions are not "free" but rather are paid for by all EOS holders through a 5% yearly inflation.  These networks are just clever at pushing the cost of the transaction to a different part of the network.  There is no free lunch.
0	1525747938	39	What subreddit is this from? I wanna have crypto conversations this good.

3	1525751833	4	Damnit you got me. I was literally on that other thread before hitting this one. Props, sarcasm usually doesn't fool me. Thanks for the hearty laugh.
1	1525757819	3	I know right? Isn’t it great being able to discuss both sides of this topic without getting insta-banned like they do on r/bitcoin?  Guess that’s what happens when Blockstream doesn’t run the sub you’re posting in. :)
1	1525753072	2	/r/ethtrader 
1	1525795447	1	Lol, its from this subreddit.
0	1525772084	12	Threads like these are awesome for tagging noobs/trolls who dont know the difference between eth and btc transactions.
1	1525799032	2	I want to know the difference bettwen eth and btc transactions.Can you explain?
2	1525802703	1	https://bitinfocharts.comSent last 24h1,104,890 BTC ($10,117,568,502 USD) 2,193,050 ETH ($1,617,998,634 USD) 
1	1525790716	-5	The amount of technical illiteracy in this subreddit is astounding. ETH is cool but not suitable for moving or storing large sums of money and shouldn’t be compared to bitcoin. 
2	1525794479	7	Can you explain why? Seems to me like you can store any amount of money and send that with eth just like you could do with bitcoin.. 
3	1525796060	-1	Sure, you can. You can also do that with Tron. That doesn't mean it's a great idea.Firstly, ETH has reversed transactions at least once in its history, and is currently considering doing it again. That should make anyone planning to send large amounts of money pause.Secondly, ETH's greatest strength \(flexibility and 'openness'\) is also its biggest weakness. The same things that differentiate it from Bitcoin and allow five different coding languages to run smart contracts on its architecture open up a \*massive\* attack surface for hackers. As you see every six months or so when some smart contract gets hacked on Ethereum. Ethereum is great if you want to run decentralized computing experiments. It's not a great medium of exchange for the same reason if you have millions of dollars at stake.
4	1525799269	5	No they are not considering reversing transactions again. If you're referring to the parity locked funds then, general consensus is no let's not unlock the them. And even if they were unlocked it's not the same as reversing transactions. The parity funds are stuck in a (not so) smart contract, it's not the same as a 'traditional' hardfork.Even so, Bitcoin has hard forked in the past where errors have occurred.Regardless, all chains are mutable by consensus - you just need consensus ;)
4	1525798536	1	Okay, thank you for the explanation :)
3	1525795219	-2	It is centralized and mutable. 
4	1525798069	4	And this is parroting at its best with no grounding in facts. Bravo. 
0	1525782418	4	That's why I switched from Bitcoin to Ethereum during that high fee period.
1	1525802839	0	There was a period when ETH's fees were higher than Bicoin's
1	1525793454	0	Smart!
0	1525753309	81	Except Bitcoin transactions are very different from ETH transactions and tend to be of much higher value. ETH transactions can just be claiming tokens or interacting with smart contracts whereas BTC transactions tend to move large sums of $. If you actually looks at fees paid vs $$$ moved BTC is actually the more efficient one.  Just look at the chart [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionvalue-btc-eth.html). Each of those 200K BTC transactions is moving an average of $62K while each of those 800K ETH transactions is moving less than $3K. So even with 1/4th the transactions BTC is moving 5-6X as much money around.But the two blockchains serve different purposes so you can argue that the fees paid for ETH transactions are still worth it. But number of transactions is a very silly metric to use, and when you look at $$$ moved for the amount of fees BTC is ahead, because that's what it's meant for. Interacting with a cryptokitty and sending $100K around the world shouldn't necessarily cost the same amount of money.
1	1525760208	17	Well  total transaction value is also around 4 times more  than btc
2	1525765344	-4	Also keep in mind that Eth is a centralised cryptocurrency controlled by the Ethereum Foundation which is a huge flaw and  weakens the security of the network. Transaction throughput is not everything, might as well use VISA instead then. 
3	1525769535	9	Easily more than 90% don't care if a network is decentralized. Look at IOTA, Ripple or EOS. Huge market caps and a lot of fans. Gains and promises are worth a lot more than decentralization for investors. Usability, speed and low fees are worth a lot more than decentralization for users.Oh and calling Bitcoin decentralized is also pretty naive when 2-3 mining pools control >50% of the hashrate.
4	1525770139	4	A mining pool is not a single entity, and it's not even a single mining pool but 2-3. The requirement for centralisation is that there is a "centre" and not 2-3 centres. :-)  And I think a lot of people do care hence Bitcoin is still number one.
5	1525770521	4	A mining pool is usually under the control of a single entity, if the owners of the 2-3 biggest minining pools (which are all located in a single country) collude, they can perform a 51% attack before people have the time to stop mining to that pool.How is that decentralized? Because it doesn't have "one center"? So if I make a crypto and I need 2 of my friends to agree in order to perform a 51% attack, it's decentralized?
4	1525773323	1	Luckily mining pools have no authority. It's the users (and nodes) that decide what rules the miners have to follow. If the miners don't follow these rules, the coin will not follow their blocks. Miners work for bitcoin, not the other way around. As an example, the S2X protocol had 80-90% miner vote, it didnt go through. 
4	1525789273	1	>Usability, speed and low fees are worth a lot more than decentralization for users.What's the point of having a blockchain if noone cares for decentralization? Why not use a database that's much more quick and cheaper to use?
5	1525791427	1	Because having a decentralized, permissionless, immutable and censorship-resistant payment network is very valuable for people in countries with hyper inflation, financial exclusion, dictatorships, or war. Crypto is useful to those people because they have experienced how it feels to loose everything or maybe they are so poor that they didn't even ever have access to banking.But in the western world, you won't find many regular people that you can convince to give up even a little bit of their convinience. People here have VISA, Mastercard, PayPal and access to choose from dozens of banks. Those services are fast, cheap, easy to use and your money is insured.I am not saying that crypto can't be valuable for people in the western world but for any significant adoption, crypto must be at least as easy to use as PayPal or your credit card. Else you won't convince the masses.
3	1525793149	2	What are you talking about? The Ethereum Foundation does not control Ethereum.
3	1525765572	0	True, but comparing it to visa is too much. I understand your concerns but people just don't care. Go ask ripple or eos fans how they feel.
3	1525788890	1	Seriously, why is that important to me?  Some level of centralisation is grown up. 
3	1525777346	1	Eth is a centralized cryptocurrency? What are you on, mate?
4	1525802972	0	At least Satoshi was smart enough to stay anonymous from the start
1	1525760558	25	The only thing I know: I moved btc from coinbase to binance and eth to binance, and I payed less than half for the eth-transaction compared to btc. I don't use ltc or bch for this since they don't have altcoin pairs and conversion cost more, but I think both are even cheaper in transactions.Edit: I am talking about 3 and 4 digit $ sums
2	1525760702	6	You are correct. Check them out here: https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/median_transaction_fee-btc-eth-bch-ltc.html#log&6mHowever, don't base the tx fees on exchange withdraws - they always charge more. 
3	1525760925	3	withdrawing from coinbase costs only the mining fee. You pay the "use"-fee on buying and selling with fiat. But yeah, binance is different. Have to look up what to use to send/sell back
4	1525762493	5	You don't even have to pay any fees to withdraw on Coinbase. Just move your funds to GDAX and withdraw from there. I have done a lot of $10 BTC withdrawals there :)
2	1525762953	3	And how much of your clonbase withdrawal fee translated to tx fee? Exchange fees != Transaction fees
3	1525775767	1	as I stated in another aswer: coinbase does not add fee to withdrawal. You only pay fees for buying and selling.Here are some examples:12.feb: sending ~0.17 btc were 25260sat fee12.feb: sending 3.5eth and ~1.06eth both were 0.00042eth12.mar: sending 1bch and 0.006bch both 226sat feeJust some numbers. Nowhere is stated that it has a coinbase fee. But when I bough and sold, there is a coinbase fee mentioned
4	1525794652	1	Care to share the txid?
2	1525798248	3	These guys are so elitist they want bitcoin only to move HUGE sums of money. Bitcoin is not for you, you peasant. 
3	1525800622	1	I am sorry to only invest sums I can afford to lose. And I have no btc left. All of it went in alts
2	1525762295	2	Never withdraw from coinbase they offer free withdrawals using gdax.com. And coinbase to gdax is free + instant. 
1	1525763401	13	this might be a dumb question, but why shouldn't interacting with a cryptokitty cost the same as spending $100K? Aren't they both just transactions? is there something in the Bitcoin protocol that says it should cost more to move more money? 
2	1525763683	14	Not a dumb question. A fee-paying transaction is a fee-paying transaction, full stop. I think it's irrelevant what the transaction is being used for, or else you quickly devolve into passing subjective moral judgements about what constitutes an "acceptable" use of the blockchain. 
2	1525771904	2	It's just the way different systems were designed with different economics / incentives to prevent spam attacks. For example, Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions both charge fees for every transaction regardless of the amount. Even 0 Eth transactions cost gas, which accounts the computational cost of all the transactions that are merely invoking a function within a smart contract. Even if the transaction fails, if it required a large sum of gas / computational power it makes sense to cost way more than a transaction moving a huge amount of Eth that required minimal gas. Bitcoin's protocol follows similar logic, except you're paying in satoshis based on the byte size of the transaction rather than the actual amount moved. The tx fee is purely about preventing spam, while also ensuring that miners will continue mining past 2040 or whenever the block reward depletes. Example of this in practice: A failed hack/exploit attempt on a smart contract the other day - Even though 0 Eth was actually transferred the attacker wasted $60~ in gas on the attempted attack. https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc27dffa105bfbd09c2f5705f6adf22248fa0fad4cc8dc8ab768f23b6f9484c4fContrarily, other systems such as EOS or NEO are designed with completely different economics / incentives to prevent spam. NEO you can move free, but generate GAS which is required to pay for fees, whereas EOS bandwidth caps you based on your percentage of tokens relative to the total supply. Thus at max you'd only be able to spam the network up to your proportion of the tokens, and dApp developers / users are incentivized to own tokens to use the network.
1	1525764549	4	This just shows that eth is more reminiscent of actual money. Tx value has little effect on cost, so no reason to take it into account.
1	1525763376	3	Ethereum transfers a whole lot more than just ether, though. 
1	1525754888	-2	This is the right answer
2	1525756836	21	>If you actually looks at fees paid vs $$$ moved BTC is actually the more efficient one.  Just look at the chart This is simply because fees to not scale with transaction $$$. Size has literally have zero impact on transaction cost \(other than what people are willing to pay\) so it's a silly comparison to make.  It's actually far more interesting to compare smallest transaction bucket size \($1, $5, $10 transactions, whatever you want to make your histogram\) because this shows potential size of the use case market. Literally every crypto that works can move vast sums of money for a very small &#37;.  Yawn.
3	1525757964	0	Then BTC could be compared to BitShares or Nano rather than Ethereum for example.
4	1525767243	1	Can't compare them really because they don't do even remotely close to the amount of transactions those two do.  You can say that theoretically they could but they don't and may never do them. I own a pretty good % of nano and I think it's an amazing tech but it's stupid to try to compare its transactions to eth as it's never been tested.  Iota failed when it got truly tested for the first time. Nano could easily do the same. 
5	1525767499	1	Fair point, but BitShares is still doing more. They had [over 1.5 million transactions](https://medium.com/@michaelx777/bitshares-reaches-record-transaction-overtakes-bitcoin-and-ethereum-in-transaction-volume-624a70212002) in last 24h and the data is also pretty new.I think Nano had some test by community and I didn't hear any negative feedback from it, tho.
2	1525759638	1	Yes
1	1525776038	0	You lot are arguing over how many angels are dancing on a pin head.   Back in the Real World^TM I can move $1m using Nano for absolutely zero fees. 
1	1525757769	-1	Thanks, Good Comment
0	1525753205	12	This is great in terms of eth adoption. It show how much it has grown since the flippening. I love it.I don't think that this is a comparison of "what's better" in terms of transaction efficiency or costs though. Bitcoin can achieve the same costs if they removed the blocksize cap if the demand was there. One could also say how many transactions in LN were done for free in bitcoin or how many transactions were done in iota or nano for free. The objective is different.
0	1525764191	4	In fact, most eth txs have higher fees than necessary, due to exaggerated exchange configs and high wallet defaults. GasStation always shows lower fees.
1	1525764402	-4	And you think BTC doesnt?Average transaction fee of $1.64 but Median fee of $0.40.       5% of transactions were over $5, even though paying under $0.50 will get it done quickly.
2	1525765274	12	$0.5 will get it done in 3 blocks, ie. 30 minutes.  In eth, $0.03 will get it done in 30 *seconds*.
3	1525766548	-7	As far as I can tell it would not take 3 blocks for Bitcoin.  And ETH always take way longer than that
4	1525767206	7	I don't care how "far you can tell". This is what specialized websites that track those things tell.  https://ethgasstation.info  https://bitcoinfees.info/
5	1525768528	-1	I know thats why I said as far as I can tell. Because based off this, 31 sat fee gets it done in the first block.https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/
6	1525769183	2	You're looking at constantly fluctuating value. But even if it does, $0.5 for 10 min conf is lame. Bitcoin will never be usable with that 10 min block time.
7	1525792718	1	Back in the day when bitcoin did not have replace by fee, the block time did not matter and confirmation count did not matter. 0 confirmation transactions were perfectly safe to accept, because every transaction was going to be included in the next block regardless. You could even safely spend a received transaction which was unconfirmed. Transactions were instant.Then blockstream took over development... 
8	1525799083	1	> 0 confirmation transactions were perfectly safe to acceptThat was never true, despite the BCH fans desperately trying to sell this. 0-conf is an extra-protocol scenario; it's up to the node runners to decide how to respond to it.    There was never a guarantee that a 0-conf tx will be confirmed; this is true with BCH as well today.
7	1525776755	-2	And youre not?  Also its really not. $0.50? Who give a shit. Your lose or gain more value than that every minute in crypto.   For the future and using it as a daily currency matters, but right now it doesnt.  10 minute sending. Once again for right now who cares. All I and most people do is sent from wallet to exchange. 
8	1525781622	4	> who cares.  Yup, this is exactly how Bitcoin reached its sorrow state.
9	1525790666	1	It's sorrow state of hitting it's all time high just 4 months ago?
9	1525785233	0	Lmao. You dont know shit.
0	1525769841	2	Didnt everyone know this?
0	1525765735	4	Nanos fees in last 24 hours? $0
1	1525769410	9	I love Nano. But what else can it do.  ETH has smart contracts and DAPPS.  
2	1525770438	7	"Do one thing and do it well" is nano's mission statement
3	1525792788	2	It goes back [a lot farther than that!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
4	1525792792	2	**Unix philosophy**The Unix philosophy, originated by Ken Thompson, is a set of cultural norms and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development. It is based on the experience of leading developers of the Unix operating system. Early Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of modularity and reusability into software engineering practice, spawning a "software tools" movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software, norms which became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the "Unix philosophy."The Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

2	1525798504	0	Nano is to BTC and currencies, as Taraxa is to ETH and smart contracts.
1	1525781321	0	Nanos privacy and fungibility in the last 24 hours?  0
2	1525781930	2	I guess you can't have it all... Nano has no fees and almost instant, Monero has privacy and fungibility but is awful for the environment and is slow.
3	1525782086	2	PIVX does it all.  Negligible fees, instant send, zerocoin privacy/fungibility, and Proof of Stake
4	1525782403	2	Not gonna like never heard of this coin before but from some quick research looks half decent...
2	1525795953	1	I hear you on the privacy though neither BTC nor ETH have this> Fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeableHow are Nano units any less interchangeable than BTC?
3	1525796730	0	They can be traced and therefore blacklisted.  From a hack like the bitgrail one for example
1	1525798980	0	Nano is what cryptocurrency should be -- fast and feeless! It's the crypto most positioned for real world use right now. You could use Nano in-store and have a confirmed sale within seconds. Nano is for real! Nano should be #1.

3	1525755237	1	Immutability is about censorship resistanceSee DAO (eth / etc split) in 2016See EIP-999 up for vote currently.Makes no sense now, eh?
4	1525756958	8	See the time Bitcoin minted a bazillion dollers, and then rolled it back.  Also don't bring EIP\-999 into this. It's an intellectually dishonesty move and not supported by the vast eth majority.

5	1525759378	-2	> See the time Bitcoin minted a bazillion dollers, and then rolled it backSauce meNot intellectually dishonest if there's a track record for Vitalik hacking his own coin to reverse transactions.  It's LITERALLY the same thing which caused a schism last time around, the only difference is that there was no fraud involved this time around, just a buggy smart contract.    And hey, I side with your majority ... it's my opinion the only reason this is even being considered after the last debacle is because those funds would be going into ETH development.  That doesn't make my opinion true though, I think some people are just really big VB fans who think he's some kind of savior.   Smart af, no doubt, but seriously lacks experience and isn't an economist.From that perspective, it's pretty irrelevant what the vast majority of people have to say in a dictatorship.  We'll find out if you're centralized or not soon enough.
6	1525763072	3	I respect your opinion. Eth did \(partially, see ETC\) roll back it's record.  A single act does not make a "track record", however.  There's a very significant difference between being a flip flop, and being able to admit / rectify your mistakes. In this case both extremes are a poor choice.  I'm also curious how long is long enough to prove decentralization for you? I'll absolutely agree ETH has not yet weathered the test of time, just curious what your limit is. I personally give it favorably but far from absolute odds.On a seperate note, I agree VB is very obviously smart af, and just as obviously inexperienced. I'm ok with that  though, which may be our difference.  I personally view stagnation as a greater evil than recklessness. 
7	1525763122	7	oh, forgot sauce, as requested. Hope you accept wiki. [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value\_overflow\_incident](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident)
8	1525769880	3	lmao i didn't know bitcoin was such a shitcoin, it's not even immutable... *code is law* or gtfo, amirite
9	1525794301	1	The "law" states that the longest valid chain is the official version, and that miners are under no obligation to include anyone's transactions. The ETH devs tried to stop the DAO hacker with a soft fork before they resorted to a hard fork; had they succeeded, no "law" would have been broken.
8	1525798494	1	Thanks for the link, and I do, it's a good starting point.   I had never heard of it previously, it's way before I became interested and isn't talked about frequently (unlike gox which was also before my time).   As far as I can tell, this wasn't done by a governing body (ethereum foundation).  Is this not exactly why they have miner consensus of blocks?   On the flip side, consensus is why a 51% attack on the network would work ... it's a legitimate reason people are concerned about centralization.I am curious what happened to the transactions between 74638 and 74691 .. will have to dig deeper at a later time.
8	1525790809	1	A bug was discovered in the protocal and fixed the same day. No funds were stolen, no one was affected, and the bitcoin protocol grew stronger.... Yea nothing to see here
9	1525793558	1	All transactions that where made after the bug where rolled back. So everyone who used bitcoin at the time where affected.Compare this to the DAO where all the affected funds where locked in a smart contract. The only thing the fork did was change that smart contract. Hence literally no one was affected except the hacker.See how the Bitcoin immutable double standard works?
8	1525770032	-1	Im sorry but care to explain the problem with this? There was a huge ass bug that was rolled back and fixed. I honestly don't see the problem with it. If some one finds and exploit and mints like a shitload of bitcoins would you be ok with that not being rolled back and fixed thus killing the coin?
9	1525794840	1	It's not a huge problem, but illustrates that "immutability" is one of those ideals that can never be perfect. No one even pretends like a single confirmation is immutable at all. There is no rule that can overcome a unanimous consensus to fork, and there will _always_ be the risk of economy-destroying bugs.
9	1525798611	1	The "one true chain" should solve this problem, not manual intervention.
7	1525796801	1	> A single act does not make a "track record"IRL I live by the the adage "past performance is the best indicator of future behavior".    Would never date someone with a history of cheating.  Would never do business with someone with a history of fraud.So from that perspective, I'm not sure there is a limit.   Tricky topic though as remorse is real, people (businesses) can (and do) make mistakes regularly .. and gain redemption after.  With reversal being brought back up currently, I'm not sure remorse would be the correct sentiment ATM.
4	1525793356	2	>On 8th August 2010 bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik wrote what could be mildly described as the biggest understatement since Apollo 13 told Houston: “We’ve had a problem here.”. “The ‘value out’ in this block is quite strange,” he wrote on bitcointalk.org, referring to a block that had somehow contained 92 billion BTC, which is precisely 91,979,000,000 more bitcoin than is ever supposed to exist. CVE-2010-5139 (CVE meaning ‘common vulnerability and exposures’) was frighteningly simple and exploited to the point of farce by an unknown attacker. In technical language, the bug is known as a number overflow error.So instead of the system counting up 98, 99, 100, 101, for example, it broke at 99 and went to zero (or -100) instead of 100. In layman’s terms, someone found a way to flood the code and create a ridiculously large amount of bitcoin in the process.>The fix was the bitcoin equivalent of dying in a video game and restarting from the last save point. The community simply hit ‘undo’, jumping back to the point in the blockchain before the hack occurred and starting anew from there; all of the transactions made after the bug was exploited – but before the fix was implemented – were effectively cancelled.>How serious was it? Bitcoin’s lead developer Wladimir Van Der Laan is pretty blunt about it, telling me: “It was the worst problem ever.”>Source1: http://www.coindesk.com/9-biggest-screwups-bitcoin-history/>Source2: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=702755.0
4	1525794765	1	You realize that the DAO split was voted on by miners with their hashpower (I was one of them). That is how consensus works, you know this. You really should do some research before you just repeat the same rhetoric you heard from others. It's really getting old, and you sound like people calling bitcoin a ponzi a few years ago. EIP-999 has already basically been buried, many people do not think that a bailout hardfork at this point is necessary. The DAO was in the early days of the ethereum network's life and made just as much sense as the Bitcoin fork that removed the buffer overflow Bitcoins. Still makes no sense to me why this nonsense is still around. What are you afraid of? Ethereum is not in competition with BTC, it has a completely different application. Crypto is not a zero-sum game, there's plenty of room in the space for others. 
5	1525798997	1	So how much ETH was owned by the Ethereum Foundation at this point?   Was there any self interest involved with the roll back.   Just because you voted doesn't mean that the election wasn't rigged.> many people do not think that a bailout hardfork at this point is necessaryBut it's an option, I think that's the point.  Bailouts are one massive reason crypto > fiat.  (side note: the inability to have sustained war backed by the printing press is another.)I don't see any of this as a competition, rather better and best solutions.   We can't go down the road of politics ruining our coin's value.   That's why code is law ... not whatever feels right at the moment is law.
6	1525800128	1	> So how much ETH was owned by the Ethereum Foundation at this point? Was there any self interest involved with the roll back. Just because you voted doesn't mean that the election wasn't rigged.You can't be serious. I voted with HASHPOWER not my ETH. The carbonvote was not a formal vote and more just to see where the community was. It may be hard to believe but many of us miners think for ourselves and decided that the DAO bailout was the best choice at that point in time with the network being still in it's infancy. Without consensus the bailout would not have happened, it doesn't matter how much ETH the EF had or where they invested it.> But it's an option, I think that's the point. Bailouts are one massive reason crypto > fiat. Consensus is all that matters, the rules of the protocol can be modified by miners just like BTC. Don't let fear of becoming obsolete cloud reality. BTC is here to stay, and so is ETH.> That's why code is law ... not whatever feels right at the moment is law.Seriously, look up the buffer overflow bitcoin fork and tell me that "Code is law" again. Consensus is law, the code is just the proposal to change the law.

Don't kid yourself, very political.> BTC is here to stay, and so is ETH.??? never doubted that, why do you think I'm here?> buffer overflow bitcoin forkDid above, I think we still have a ways to go before we have a truly great solution.  My hopes are with 3rd gen.   Alpha test, Beta test, RC.   That's not saying any of the previous generations are bad, but people should not be involved in decisions, we are inherently biased.
3	1525802858	1	With Buterin a very visible figure and one who acquaints with the likes of Putin, and who rolls back the blockchain at a whim I don't agree. Anyway it's definitely not AS censorship resistant as Bitcoin. What I had said.

3	1525802791	1	You notice I wrote: not AS. I didn't say it isn't at all. But with Buterin a very visible figure and one who acquaints with Putin and who rolls back the blockchain at a whim you have to wonder.
1	1525764383	0	lol why?
1	1525754483	-9	NANO can transact for free why would people use ethereum lmao
2	1525759537	8	Maybe smart contracts? lol
2	1525775706	5	I love nano but it’s hardly proven scalable yet and since that’s the only thing it does(as of now) it should do it better than anyone, which isn’t the case. Who knows what the future holds 
2	1525755206	3	Because anyone can spam for free
3	1525755495	3	It actually takes a small amount of POW to spam. Insignificant for someone sending a transaction, but significant for someone trying to send enough transactions to clog the network.
4	1525775340	1	Isn't the pow only to include two transactions?
5	1525793438	1	No the POW is for any transaction sent on the network. 
4	1525794998	1	It's the other way around because economies of scale are a thing.
5	1525795532	1	Economy of scale isnt very relevant here, because the value proposition of 1 million people sending 1 transaction each, in which they are actually sending value, is many orders of magnitude higher than the value proposition of 1 person sending 1 million transactions for the lulz, especially when he could have been using that processing power and electricity to directly make money by mining something like monero or some other asic resistant coin. Even with an economy of scale, its simply not economically rational to spam nano, and thats why it wont happen. In fact, with more economy of scale, your lost opportunity cost goes up because you're wasting all that efficiency on spam when you could be using it to outcompete other miners mining some other asic resistant coin.In the end its similar to bitcoin's security model. Because while nano isnt directly providing block rewards to miners to incentive them to not misbehave, the fact that there exist other useful uses of electricity and processing power at scale, means that there is a significant lost opportunity cost to anyone who is trying to spam the network. It simply takes so many transactions to meaningfully affect the network, that the pow cost of each transaction can be low enough for the user to process themselves, while the throughput capacity is high enough that trying to actually fill the capacity with spam is a significant detterent.
6	1525796233	1	It's not "for the lulz"; they'd open a short position and then attack with temporary (rented/botnet) hash power.
7	1525796654	1	You could do the exact same thing with bitcoin, yet that doesnt seem to be an issue there. Why would it be a problem for nano? Its simply more profitable and economically rational to use your processing power and electricity productively than it is to use it destructively to try to game short markets.
8	1525797268	1	* There's an _opportunity cost_ of block rewards. Nano pays next to nothing for its security, even compared to its market cap.* <51% of ASICs are available for cloud mining because it's not a good business model, unlike general purpose cloud computing.
9	1525798911	1	Why would it need to pay more than necessary for its security? Obviously its paying enough, or else we'd be seeing spam attacks.Nano pays next to nothing *for each individual transaction*. But the cost to cripple the network is actually fairly significant, as its been shown to handle at least 300 tps. Interestingly they couldnt test beyond 300 tps, not because the network couldnt handle it, but because it was too difficult/expensive for the dev team to generate spam at a higher rate than that, even for only a very short time. Seems like the POW is doing its job then, huh? Theres no indication that a block reward is actually needed for an individual cryptocurrency because the lost opportunity cost seems to be enough to deter hostile hashpower. If nano was the only cryptocurrency that existed, this security model might not work as well, since the lost opportunity cost of wasted hashpower would be less. In that world you'd need a proactive payment for good behavior (block reward), which is why bitcoin was designed the way it was....when it was the only crypto that existed.
1	1525776907	-4	Either that was sarcasm or you're forgetting that if Transaction Fee % is the hill you want to die on, Nano is your sword.

0	1525752503	-7	Shows the wonders that dangerous poorly designed software can do while it isn't completely broken yet.
1	1525753285	7	What are you referring to?
2	1525755680	2	I'm referring to the overly complex cryptosystem that is Ethereum.Bad design decisions have led to a difficult-to-use-safely scripting system. So difficult to use, that [the creator of the scripting system created a multisig smart contract which had a bug resulting in $300M of ETH being locked up permanently.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/08/cryptocurrency-300m-dollars-stolen-bug-ether). Keep in mind that multisig is one of **the** simplest smart contracts.In addition, Ethereums cryptosystem is designed in a manner which results in a large attack surface. To name a few examples, [use of proof of stake](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf), and the new sharding implementation, which if left unchanged will result in thin-client security for each individual shard. That is, if someone can compromise a single shard, they can move "fake" funds to another shard. Again, all other shards will only be validating headers, in other words they have thin client security.I could go on, but I'll just say the general fault derives from complexity and ignoring best practices. A cryptosystems definition should be minimal. A cryptosystem should be thoroughly reviewed. [A cryptocurrency should not be thrown together carelessly](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/alts.pdf).
3	1525757579	4	You're totally right a decentralized computer has a huge attack surface, just like the one you're typing on.  The complexity comes with the machine's capability, and the desire of the devs to stay decentralized.   These are tough problems.I think you should also read up a little more on how shards work. The theory is that they actually make issues with the protocol \(e.g. failures in incentive structure, double\-spends due to reduced security, etc\)  less of an issue, not more.
4	1525765314	0	>You're totally right a decentralized computer has a huge attack surface, just like the one you're typing on.Difference is, there's not billions of dollars in incentives to break my computer :)>The complexity comes with the machine's capability, and the desire of the devs to stay decentralized.In terms of development decentralization, Ethereum is lacking. For the Bitcoin client "Bitcoin Core"s releases, there must be consensus among all merge-request-approving developers to merge a branch. When a new version is released, you have signed gitian builds by dozens of developers, so you can verify rather than trust. Ethereum has still [yet to implement gitian builds](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/issues/338).>The theory is that they actually make issues with the protocol (e.g. failures in incentive structure, double-spends due to reduced security, etc) less of an issue, not more.Sorry, that's too vague for me to understand what you're arguing. Could you elaborate?
4	1525777176	0	This is why Nano will be a success - because it focuses on doing one thing, and doing it well. As a result it has a much smaller attack surface. 
3	1525757452	2	whoa
3	1525756998	2	All I’m hearing is complexity scares you so all the ground breaking developments going on with Ethereum should be given up on.You’re comment IMO is a prime example of anti-crypto shilling, luckily most people here are smart enough to spot these tactics.
4	1525795268	2	> complexity scares youWe call these people "engineers".
4	1525768464	1	>All I’m hearing is complexity scares you so all the ground breaking developments going on with Ethereum should be given up on.Yeah, well if you don't care about $300M lost nor other, even greater risks to $75B worth of peoples wealth, then yeah it probably makes sense that that's all you're hearing. To be honest, what I think I'm hearing is someone heavily invested in Ethereum not wanting to face facts.>You’re comment IMO is a prime example of anti-crypto shilling, luckily most people here are smart enough to spot these tactics.I'm not shilling, and I think you're being insincere when you immediately jump to that. I've been involved in cryptocurrencies since years before this subreddit was created, you should familiarize yourself with some of the research by the people working on the first cryptocurrency during those years. I linked some of said work at the end of my previous post.
0	1525751749	-12	The real competitor is Bitcoin Cash...
1	1525760260	3	didn't you know, BCH talk is shunned here. It threatens everyone's altcoins because BCH just works.
2	1525762160	4	Huh? Doge processes more transactions than BCH. That means Doge threatens every altcoin?
3	1525762916	5	I mean, I love me some doge, but it's not very widely accepted like BCH is with Bitpay
4	1525795738	1	So then _BitPay_ is widely accepted. Merchants who are already set up and still want real Bitcoin won't have to do anything to keep getting it (even from customers who pay with BCH), and [they'll be adding more blockchains in the future](https://blog.bitpay.com/multiple-blockchains/).Not your keys, not your
1	1525756606	-3	nope
2	1525758102	3	Actually he’s right.  BCH can scale.  BTC devs refuse to scale and force you to use Blockstream’s profit generating LN instead.  It’s no longer a peer to peer currency. ETH can’t scale very well but they’re working on solutions like sharding.  But BTC is no longer even in the running.  Bitcoin Cash is. And Ethereums founder [actually supports](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/930276246671450112?s=21) it.  
0	1525759008	-4	It just feels so stupid to pay to make a transaction, no matter how much it is cost
1	1525778143	2	You need to have some kind of transaction fee so the network doesn't get clogged with transaction spam.
0	1525760157	-6	Meanwhile BCH did 20k transactions today with average fees totaling 2k ($0.1), and by next week will have a greater transaction capacity than both bcore and Ethereum combined. 
1	1525768122	8	Yeah, fees are low because nobody is using it. 20k transactions. Happy to see its dying.
2	1525781869	0	It's growing actually, and fees are low not because of the number of transactions but because there is plenty of block space such that users don't need to compete to get their transactions included into the next block. Perhaps you should go look at the charts before spitting out mind numbingly incorrect statements.
1	1525760314	4	The average transaction fee is not the best metric to use. Some shitty wallets still use old Bitcoin Core fee estimation logic and seriously overpay transaction fees. The cost for inclusion in the next block on BCH is only 243 satoshis, which right now is ~$0.003 USD. Median transaction fee right now is $0.006 USD. https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin%20cash-median_transaction_fee.html
2	1525760770	5	I know I was being extremely generous, I can't remember when I last paid over $0.02 but there are so many core trolls on this sub who'll point out bitinfocharts says $0.1 (it spiked today) so I went with that figure. The extremely high fees (>$0.05, 5 cents) on Bitcoin Cash are a result of the terrible fee estimation set by wallets that haven't been updated post fork. In reality for those 20k transactions today, the total fees paid today for Bitcoin Cash should have been around ~$200.
0	1525753339	-5	Are Lightning txs included?

0	1525759915	-5	Of course you can have lower fees and/or higher transaction count when you dont mind bloating the bandwidth and storage requirements of nodes, by having more and/or larger blocks. Its the same trick LTC and BCH tout to claim their "superiority" over BTC. Its not a real solution or benefit though, because at some point you sacrifice the essence of crypto, ie, decentralisation when running full nodes on regular PC with regular bandwidth becomes unfeasible. Arguably ethereum is getting close to that point already, and its not for no reason they are working on sharding and PoS. Which brings its own set of compromises.
1	1525760474	11	> Its not a real solution or benefit thoughIf it solves the problem, it's a solution, and lower fees/more network capacity are always a benefit. I keep hearing all this talk about loss of "muh decentralization," but both BCH and LTC seem to have continued functioning just fine. Regular non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization. If they did, I could just spin up tens of thousands of VPS nodes at very low expense to myself and say I have the most decentralized network ever. 
2	1525763540	-5	> but both BCH and LTCNeither of them have achieved any traction, their blocks are so empty its laughable. The only thing that proves is that a crypto that no one uses works better (well, cheaper) than crypto's that everyone wants to use.>Regular non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralizationYes they do. If you dont run your own full node, then you are not a peer in the network, you are someone's client. Ordinary users running their own nodes to verify the transactions and thus enforce the rules, is what prevents a cabal of miners and exchanges from changing the consensus rules, like they tried with Segwit2x.If you think a small group of "trusted" nodes operated by miners and exchanges is good enough, then you dont need mining, or even blocks,  because you just reinvented Ripple's trusted node model.
3	1525763819	6	> Neither of them have achieved any traction, their blocks are so empty its laughable.Were you one of the ones laughing at Bitcoin five years ago and calling it irrelevant? Most people were... I was busy buying it up because I saw how useful it was and believed in the potential. Also, having empty space in blocks is a *desirable* trait. It means there is room to grow, room to accommodate spikes in usage, etc. Having consistently full blocks creates a terrible user experience.
4	1525764344	-4	My point is that BCH and LTC are not cheaper or faster than BTC because they have faster or larger blocks. Its because they have virtually no transaction volume. They could use 100Kb blocks and no one would notice a difference, fees would still be at their minimum. Its only if or when BCH would become popular enough to actually start filling its 8MB, soon 32MB blocks, that you'll begin to notice how hard it is to maintain a node. 
5	1525764919	6	It's not about absolute number of transactions, it's about if there is extra space in the blocks or not. If there isn't, then users need to outbid one another for inclusion, which drives up transaction fees.If BCH is consistently using 32MB of data per block, that's already at PayPal levels of usage and I'd say is a pretty good sign that cryptocurrency is winning.
6	1525765946	0	>If BCH is consistently using 32MB of data per blockLOL. No they are not. They are averaging ~80Kb per block:https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin%20cash-size.html#3mOf course you dont have bandwidth issues yet, running a BCH node is about 10x less demanding than running a BTC node right now, rather than 32x more demanding if/when their blocks are full.> PayPal levelsBCH: 20 thousand tx per day Paypal: 16 million per day.VISA: 150 million per dayGood luck solving that with larger blocks.
7	1525766336	3	I wrote **IF** Bitcoin Cash is using 32MB of data per block. That works out to around 13 million transactions per day. 
8	1525766630	0	But then your claim that "both BCH and LTC seem to have continued functioning just fine" will no longer be applicable, because no ordinary user will be able to run a node, and you'll have a system with a handful of centralized nodes you need to trust, more akin to Ripple than to Bitcoin or ethereum.
9	1525767308	3	Why do normal users need to run nodes? I've been using bitcoin daily for 5 years and have only ever run a node to experiment with and see what the process is like. I've never needed to run a node in order to use my bitcoin.
1	1525777046	2	Nano solves that with small blocks and network bandwidth composed of two (free) transactions plus vote propagation from a maximum of a thousand nodes. 
2	1525778293	2	Nano doesnt really use blocks, its more akin to iota's tangle, and the system it uses opens up a million other pitfalls concerning security, immutability and spam resistance.  Pretty much like iota, but iota hide their problems by relying on a central coordinator. There is no free lunch, no silver bullet yet.
3	1525779754	1	Nope - although both IOTA and Nano agree DAGs, Nano is closer to Bitcoin in concept, in that it still uses non branching single chains. It's just that each account has its own chain, and only the account's owner can 'mine' a new block on their own chain. Spam is prevented by a small PoW.
4	1525781322	1	> Spam is prevented by a small PoW.Really. That PoW is light enough that a phone or any desktop can solve it in seconds. A single asic can solve several millions of those puzzles per second. So the cost of spamming the network in to oblivion is a ~$100 per month. Its not because it hasnt happened yet that it wont. And I dont even think that is Nano's biggest problem.

0	1525786844	0	you folks need to learn to interpret statistics. also you need to be reminded that bitcoin is becoming a settlement layer. one transaction in bitcoin no longer means what you think it means.look at [http://cryptolights.info/](http://cryptolights.info/)what do you see? much more transaction volume on bitcoin. so much less fees for actual value transacted.now look at [https://outputs.today/](https://outputs.today/)what do you see? 1 bitcoin transaction is about 2\-3 batched transactions. ethereum almost does no batching at all.
1	1525794346	1	Ethereum doesn't need to do batching because the execution of a smart contract can do literally anything up to the block gas limit...Let's not forget that many token transfers or transactions involving execution of smart contracts that then move ETH or tokens are 0 ETH transactions...
0	1525790207	0	Well if that's what we're trying to accomplish just use Digibyte.  Send a billion dollars for a fraction of a cent.
1	1525793989	1	If no ones using it, fees are always dirty cheap.All this means is space in the digibyte Blockchain is worthless and no one wants it.
0	1525794602	0	The more transactions you have, the faster your blockchain grows in size. This leads to lower number of people willing to host a full node, leading to more centralization. Eventually you'll need so much space that only giant corporations are willing to host full nodes. At that point, they can allow or disallow your transactions at will.  Not that Ethereum is decentralized today, it is centralized by Vitaliks ability to hard fork and roll back the "immutable" blockchain.
0	1525795234	0	Cool, I'm going to set up and fully sync an Eth node so I can fully validate my transactions and the blockchain!  Oh wait...  Do you people really not understand what Ethereum has sacrificed to make this possible?
1	1525795532	2	I’m not sure I’m following, I fully synced my Eth node on my laptop a few days ago and it took 10 minutes.Try parity with fast sync.
2	1525804449	1	I synced my Electrum wallet today and it took 2 seconds

1	1525760226	0	didn't you know, BCH talk is shunned here.It threatens everyone's altcoins because BCH just works. 
0	1525750128	-16	digibyte’s fees are less than a penny and it has transaction speeds 10x faster than eth, and 40x that of btc.  Then will double in a year and then it doubles speed again every 2 years after that.All on one chain,  it’s the future.
1	1525753177	5	And would you like to compare the amount of transactions?If no one is using it, it’s always dirt cheap.
2	1525756928	1	the point is that btc in its current form does not scale.  I used to be just like you, until i used digibyte after that i was hooked.  bitcoins fees screwed me, waiting hours stressed me out, and it will again during the next bull run.
3	1525757243	1	Ah yet we’re here taking about Ethereum.
4	1525782192	0	ahhh you realize that eth’s current  growth is exponential and it’s it’s tech will only scale linearly.  therefore it can’t scale.   At least btc is a simple quotient being static, and he lightning network gives it a chance but fees are going to be an issue with greedy lightning nodes,  Eth is a hot mess.You may be talking about eth but it was compared to btc and with some dude talking about having a hard on(or chic with her lady wood[pc])for its speed.  Either way my point is they are both in trouble, look for proven tech.
5	1525793433	1	I’d hazard a guess you have no real idea what you’re talking about.
6	1525803021	1	i guess a degree in computer science and a minor in math makes my opinion nonsense.    Or does having no training and hodling make me a better resource.
1	1525753836	3	If it doubles in speed every 2 years it won't be that long before it has more computational capacity than the rest of the world combined. Sounds feasible.
2	1525756588	1	moore’s law will keep it going.  it is actually.  it’s been happening since the 70’s. it peaks out at 2mil trans/sec.  it scales to about what visa does, so it is feasible.
0	1525784435	-4	I love how XRP is the fastest and most reliable low fee crypto's but nobody cares because its not on coinbase and wont break $1 anymore...
1	1525792889	3	It's a token, on a centrally owned and controlled system. That's why no one cares. 
2	1525792946	-1	So a currency... good try kid 
3	1525793339	3	Ye it's a currency if people accept it as one. But a cryptocurency operates independent of any other platform. It has its own platform called the blockchain. Tokens are dependent on a platform. Ripple is closer to an erc20 token than it is to bitcoin.Enjoy holding your bags. 
4	1525796892	1	Enjoy all your fees :) 
3	1525793785	1	It’s not even a currency according to official Ripple documentation.
0	1525767178	-4	Lamden is offering 10K TPS and that top free, I think the project is undervalued whereas BTC and ETH are very overrated.
