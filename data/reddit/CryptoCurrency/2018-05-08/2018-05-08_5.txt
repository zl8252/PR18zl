His investments in institutional stalwarts made him one of the richest men in the world. Of course he legitimately believes in the very principles that netted him all that cash. If we ought to be able to explain our belief in the virtues of crypto without being branded as crazy, borderline criminal, tulip bulb peddlers, Buffet ought to be able to speak freely as to why cryptocurrencies alarm him without being branded an out-of-touch, fear-mongering, corrupt Wall Street insider. If fear alone is enough to bring down the value of cryptocurrency, then it doesn't really have any value at all. The goal should be to persuade Buffet, not to dismiss him. 
1	1525724932	56	You should make a post out of it. These pointless posts against rich people who do not believe in crypto are so annoying
2	1525759961	2	Like Tim Draper doesn't have an interest in crypto going up! If the sub was consistent it would be fine, but eh its a large group of people. what can you expect
2	1525750736	-5	And to build off this... Bill Gates has over 20% of his current net worth in Berkshire Hathaway. Makes sense he has a similar position to Warren. Makes up almost as much of his net worth as his Microsoft shares. 
1	1525755591	13	I love how this sub loves to act like the tulip bubble was real and knowing about it makes them experts in all things finance especially crypto."Hey hey look at me I know about tulip mania! Me so smaht. Also bcash! Lulz amirite?!"I also love how you guys like to bag on the old money and call them scared while acting like you don't care what they think, yet y'all are the ones constantly posting articles on them getting them to the front page. If cryptocurrency is the future then why the fuck do you concern yourselves with them. You don't need them to lead the revolution if the product is revolutionary enough
1	1525742076	7	Well said. I've been wondering if fellow redditors would indulge me and offer their discerning and considered points around value proposition of BTC specifically.That means, not talk about blockchain or ethereum or anything else but just BTC in particular. As I understand it so far, it's simply a tradable commodity that is purposefully devoid of real life value (as compared to gold for example which you can make jewelry out of), and therefore less susceptible to fluctuations due to those value aspects. I personally believe BTC is useful as a store of value in the abstract sense. Nothing more than a ledger. As a currency, I'm positive that there will be derivative tech that will be issued by whichever platform has the most users coming online, like FB or Apple or Chase or Visa grew to be standards over time simply by way of reaching the Tipping Point (see Malcom Gladwell). Really interested in learning other people's thoughts on BTC intrinsic value proposition. 
2	1525755016	2	[deleted]
3	1525764519	2	>Btc’s value comes from being about to move large amounts of money peer to peer, fast, to anywhere in the world.***Trustlessly***. Trustlessness is the key to BTC's value, imo. 
3	1525761343	1	the censorship resistance is the primary driving factor of BTC's value (it is stronger in this regard than any currency so far in human history). Beyond that it has more basic valuable properties such as being electronically transferable, cryptographically secured by a large robust network which has stood the test of time, it is scarce and deflationary. For these reasons it makes a good currency and people therefore assign it some value. remember, quantification of value is always perceived. BTC, as anything, is worth what people decide it is worth. Same as the USD in fact. "government backing" is just an influencing factor in people deciding to value the dollar what they do; the government isn't giving the dollar value (the community using it is).
4	1525767051	1	I still think the biggest "value" of Bitcoin is the software. What other piece of software (network) in the history of mankind has never been breached or compromised? That's priceless my friends.
2	1525744221	-1	I’m here for this.  BTC HAS NO INTRINSIC VALUE PROP but I beg someone to convince me otherwise

4	1525791838	1	Thanks for providing a well-reasoned answer
3	1525761139	1	Almost all value is collectively assigned by humans.  There is no such thing as intrinsic value, save for food, water, and shelter (the few items that most economists concede have intrinsic value).
4	1525791932	1	Agreed, I suppose I should have written “intrinsic economic value”A dollar, for instance, has the backing of the US Government.  Shaky though that may be, it’s to me less shaky than... nothing?
5	1525800380	1	Crypto does not have the backing of nothing (a common trope).  It has the backing of math and social consensus (e.g., network effects).
3	1525750680	0	What is the intrinsic value of a bond?
4	1525751781	3	The present value sum of the series of pledged interest payments the issuing entity has agreed to pay you.  Please provide answers not rhetorical questions designed to reveal your super intelligence, thank you. 
1	1525738634	3	Great comment. 
1	1525745344	2	Thanks for this. People don't seem to understand that he fears for those putting money into crypto, not crypto itself. 
2	1525761298	-4	He fears that because it will erode his legacy.  These men care deeply about what people will think of them when they are gone.  They've taken a pretty big gamble by hammering crypto as they have, and they keep doubling down because they fear that all they have built over long illustrious lives may eventually be supplanted.
1	1525747367	1	Yeah it's not fear. He is spreading the D though.
1	1525749933	1	It's extremely reassuring to see this at the top.
1	1525760782	1	Are you aware of any well reasoned arguments Buffet has made against crypto? To me it seems he is just railing against something he doesn't understand. I legit think he may have dementia. I'm sure his handlers are the ones running the show at this point. I mean really; wtf is "rat poison squared".
1	1525779488	1	What I don't understand though, why he seems very certain with his comments **against** crypto/bitcoin, but on the other hand openly admits that he has no clue what he's even talking about. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWMmd7hlwNI . He's 'almost certain' that they'll come to a bad ending, but wouldn't put any money on it as he even says he knows nothing about it. So, why such a strong (certain) comment against crpyto when you even say you know nothing about it? Just seems weird or no?
1	1525785665	1	Given that he has 6 out of his 10 biggest investment in institutions/banks that stand to be disintermediated if cryptocurrencies become standard I'd wager he's not going to be persuaded. If the bank owes you large sums of money you can't just show up and walk away with it so there's a clear conflict of interest.
1	1525729097	0	Well he is clearly out-of-touch with tech, this is not news. 
1	1525750594	0	The empathy is strong with this one.
0	1525740379	21	Cringe. Yeah sure one of the world's richest men who's like 90 years old and giving most of his fortune away anyway is terrified of digital shitcoins in a market worth less than him and a few of his buddies 
0	1525730237	38	That's cute, he thinks they actually are scared of crypto.They are already 2 of the richest people in the world and have pledged to give away their fortunes to charitable causes and are both pretty old. To think that they are fearful out of greed is pretty silly.On the other hand, as successful businessman, to think that they are worried about crypto disrupting their business is like someone worrying about the sun dying out. Sure it will happen but the consequences are so far down the line that it isn't a concern to them.
1	1525783968	3	I am working in one of the company that WB holds and we are hiring blockchain developers and have a partnership with crypto company. We didn't have ICO and we exist more than 12 months but we are not out of touch. We have departments designated to scout startups that we can buy and departments working on innovation. Several extremely smart guys doing it full time. Yet someone here will shit on us because we are old and legacy. Seriously do people really think that only few blessed guys know something about payments or blockchain?
2	1525797507	1	This is the thing, WB is very smart with money.  Even if he truly doesn't believe in them, it's not going to deter him from implementing blockchain technology if it's going to benefit the company as a whole.  
1	1525741083	-25	TheyShould shut up but insteadThey tried to mockAndBelittleCryptoHodlersSo they were likely told toDo it from their mastersOr they are afraid Ask why
2	1525750620	10	They *are* the masters. 
3	1525785450	0	NOPEthey serve the elite families and the banking systemfactshameless and overt
4	1525794984	1	You literally said they are doing things because their masters tell them to do it. They don’t serve anyone, they are the richest people in the world. Other people serve them. You are confusing your envy of their wealth with “facts”. 
2	1525758382	2	Their masters are the reptilians right? 
3	1525785363	1	fuck offthere are NO REASONS these losers should be bashing crypto unless they serve or are aligned with the central bankersfactyour repitlian BS doesn't stop that factmunger is also a psycho
2	1525766716	0	Oh hai Mark, are you sober?
3	1525785310	1	ask yourself is munger is soberthe whole world thinks he is pyscho today
4	1525790640	0	I think you are psycho
5	1525793933	1	munger is a complete POS like you?
0	1525719812	57	They are "fudding the hell" out of it because:1.  They believe in the value of potential future cash flows in a business.  They have no experience in investment of internet protocol layers2.  They highly value the decision making ability of top-management teams as it relates to managing a business. Not really sure why anyone here cares what their stance is on crypto.  Their investment thesis doesn't relate to this space.
1	1525725920	51	Seriously. I guarantee you Buffett doesn’t give one flying fuck about crypto he just has retarded reporters asking him about it all the god damn time so that’s why you see his comments. He isn’t actively seeking to discredit crypto, he’s giving his opinion about it when asked. I’m so tired of all this Buffett nonsense. He’s 100x the investor any of you neckbeards will ever be. 
2	1525728457	12	Agree and same thing can be said about Bill Gates. He's making a bigger impact out there with his wife. These guys don't have time for such FUD. You will see the same quote being used in masses and in so many real FUD articles out there. i.e. coindesk
2	1525727377	11	Yeah, I can’t believe people actually think he’s scared of crypto lol
3	1525745486	5	Exactlt. He'd scared for those putting their savings into crypto.
3	1525733288	-5	I don't think he's worrying day and night over it, but I do imagine that he's aware the potential threat it does have to his investments, not that i think he really gives a fuck how many billion he has at 80 years old...
4	1525733992	3	Even that is a stretch.  Those companies make most of their money on lending.  Does bitcoin eliminate the need to borrow money for a house?  Does it eliminate the need for a credit card?  The only valid argument there would be that Amex' bread and butter isn't poor people and they're using it for convenience and rewards/benefits, not because they need to borrow the money.  If bitcoin became more convenient to use than a card, then it might be a threat to those cardholders.
1	1525724797	9	The OPs of the anti-Buffett posts don't care about his stance on crypto. They are just whoring for attention and karma
1	1525738629	2	Exactly. Buffet's always said that he's not interested in anything he doesn't have a talent for analyzing. He has an eye for brands and banks. He's probably going to be just fine without hedging into the crypto space.
1	1525736368	1	If it doesn't relate then why are you saying they are "fudding the hell" out of it? 
2	1525783108	1	Sarcastically quoting the OP
0	1525742874	14	‘Scared AF’ good lord this is why crypto is still treated like a joke 
1	1525760088	6	but but... there will be no banks in 10 years right? right?
0	1525738495	16	Can we stop this nonsense. Jesus Christ I love crypto but people here are so fucking delusional. Warren Buffet is the richest man in the world. He is not scared of Bitcoin. He doesn't even understand it enough to be scared of it. Not every person in the world is going to love crypto, and demonizing them for it just makes this crowd look so immature. I've been in the crypto space for a while and the general maturity level of discussion is just dying.
1	1525746311	1	I hear ya and agree however, I wouldn’t call it demonize but keeping his judgment to himself would be a plus. There’s not a word from his mouth that doesn’t effect any market he speaks about. If he said publicly that he just dumped $100M into crypto tomorrow where do you think the market would go? The crap coming from his mouth is certainly not helping us right now. 
1	1525753547	1	Yea, millennials are more likely to be invested in crypto, so the space is definitely immature. But that being said If the youth is the future, then it seems like crypto is the future as well if millennials continue to support.
1	1525740374	-7	>Warren Buffet is the richest man in the worldNo he isn't and just because he's rich it doesn't make his opinion more valuable especially when he admitted to not know how to use a smartphone in an interview let alone investing in tech companies
2	1525745950	7	If you don't think his opinion is valuable then you'd agree that people should stop babbling incoherently whenever he says something about crypto. I respect Warren Buffet as an investor and I ignore his advice on tech companies.
2	1525750721	4	Whoops, only the 3rd richest with $84,000,000,000. That's about half of Bitcoin's market cap. 
1	1525740483	-5	Its not  nonsenseBuffet is invested in the old paradigmMungerIs a sick person
0	1525733483	4	I would leave the Oracle of Omaha alone.  He did not make his millions until years into his adulthood. Patient and shrewd. 
0	1525744113	3	You say “legacy” i say “extremely successful profit machines with proven business models” - let’s call the whole thing off! 🎶
0	1525751099	3	Warren Buffett acknowledges legitimate risks to Berkshire Hathaway - for example, in 2017 he acknowledged that self-driving cars will harm his Geico business.The blockchain is not going to disrupt Berkshire's core businesses - which are insurance (Geico/Gen Re), aerospace manufacturing (Precision Castparts, acquired for $32 billion), railroads (BNSF), and energy (Berkshire Hathaway Energy).The aggregate valuation of the stocks you list is around $70 billion, which is only 14% of Berkshire's $484 billion enterprise value. Assuming those bank stocks go down to $0 tomorrow, Berkshire will be worth $414 billion.  It won't be the end of the world for them.
0	1525761537	3	This post is just another example of why crypto is not taken seriously. 
0	1525736444	2	You guys make it sound as if he can't sell these shares in the open market.
0	1525753433	2	It is one thing to disagree with BTC as an alternative currency and investment, it is another to have your right hand man saying it is "evil" and one notch above selling baby parts. It is very troubling that Mr. Buffet sees Bitcoin this menacing. I understand that stocks have a company backing them, while BTC just has faith, but how is that different than fiat currency?
0	1525750908	2	He's just pissed because he waited 50 years for some billions and the others can just print billions in ICO's.

I'd be more surprised if they believed in crypto, because it doesn't make sense to people who haven't grown up in a digital age, unless they're willing to study and learn.  Old people don't do that, generally.  They dismiss outright, ignore, and insult.  They don't need to study, because they already know, or so they think.
1	1525769162	1	Warren Buffet does not learn? Lmao!! Best comment.
2	1525784139	1	People idolize anyone who succeeds, and assume that expertise in investing means he'll have a good understanding of investing in everything, including bitcoin, but he's 87, and he doesn't use technology or understand it.  Hell, if people read any of his books or the books on him, or even just watched some interviews with him, they'd know he doesn't use computers or the internet.  Of course someone who doesn't use technology wouldn't understand bitcoin.  This is why Warren buffet isn't known for making great investments in the tech sector, his rule is only invest in what you know, and he lives it. 
0	1525726439	-9	Buffet and Gates are dinosaurs who don't see the meteor coming.  The meteor being crypto in this case.
