0	1525740028	23	The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by The New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still confidential.The news of the virtual exchange, which has not been reported before, came after Goldman Sachs went public with its intention to open a Bitcoin trading unit — most likely the first of its kind at a Wall Street bank.Wow. Couldn’t be more bullish. Buckle up boys

0	1525768654	3	Traditional stock market is overbought . Any time world stock markets can crash like hell. So this might be reason, big tanks will start pushing money into Crypto. 
1	1525772543	1	Why would reg folk risk investing in crypto? Most ppl are still ignorant and scared.
2	1525773240	3	Normal people are scared or ignorant. But these are market makers, like in cryptoworld, so called whales.   
0	1525755362	7	lets get ready to trade BTC/FB and ETH/MSFT bois  
1	1525755819	7	No ETH if you read the article. They're concerned the SEC will slap it down so it's all Bitcoin all the way.
2	1525755888	4	if they are adding **real** btc trading desk, you can rest assured they will add eth too. (not talking about derivatives) 
3	1525800878	1	ETH is highly centralized, uncapped, mutable. It makes sense they will start with bitcoin and then expand into shitcoins 
0	1525745979	5	Keep upvoting this so BTC price can spike up with the good news. 
1	1525784537	2	Because when Bitcoin spikes up, Altcoins get rich. For how long do you see that dynamic play out in your way, considering the fact  Bitcoin slowly becomes heavier to push and less interesting everyday to the average person? Clearly as seen by dominance, it's ICOs now. Sadly, ICOs have no legs. Because of this we're in a really dire market stage. Because many have money in Altcoins and thus do not support pushing Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin no longer receives the pushes it requires, Altcoins bleed, although as should also be said, no longer in a 3x leverage fashion, but seemingly 1.5/2x leverage if anything. They're growing stronger it seems. Tell me I'm not crazy, does any of this make sense to you?How does that relate to growth though, because spiking Bitcoin over time just becomes more and more difficult. The only thing that would destroy this pattern is if some ICOs were to explode, which might/might not happen.

I'm a trader by heart. and while I'm up quite a bit, a break past $10k would put it back in the news. Crypto needs new money if it is to go up in value. What gets new money involved? The price action.

0	1525772565	2	Is this good news? Won't it get shorted to hell and manipulated?
1	1525779861	1	It isn't really good news but it will pump the price and that's what of the people are here for sadly.
2	1525779927	0	Ya, pump before down. This whole market is very immature and silly IMO.
0	1525782059	1	Is it LedgerX ?
0	1525785646	1	Lol after the whole SEC ruling sham today you people still post this crap.
