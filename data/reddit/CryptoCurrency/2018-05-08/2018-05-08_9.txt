They own 90% of the market and 90% of the growth of the market together both Facebook and Google. (Microsoft is a small third with Bing Ads and linked in) Snapchat has already tried to seize the growth of the market and failed with the acquisition of instagram by Facebook. If a decentralized currency wants to over take them they will need to be a social media software with a massive audience. That will lead to them likely being bought out by either of them. Google and Facebook are already hiring blockchain developers so I wouldn’t get your hopes up about any decentralized currency that is trying to combat them from the currency side and not the social media side. In order to win the growth of the market the software would need a ton of users to make ads profitable and draw ad buys away from them. I just don’t see it happening without a different strategy or Google or Facebook just doing it themselves.Another few things to keep in mind is that their targeting algorithms are proprietary and allow them to charge whatever they like for ad buys based on demand. If that information was made public on a ledger people could audit their ad buys and see if google or Facebook are ripping them off which is bad for business but honestly kind of cool for us advertisers.Remember just because blockchain is a revolutionary technology that will likely be implemented across many industries doesn’t mean there will be an accompanied crypto currency taking over the market of that industry. Blockchain can be implemented without the currency. So be careful investing.
1	1525783247	2	Very rare and senseful opinion. Experience speaks for itself.
1	1525769389	2	Heard of flixxo? Blockchain + BitTorrent . 
2	1525777031	12	I really like the economic model of Flixxo and think their product really stands a chance. I'm not suggesting they'll have the capability of seizing I sizable portion of Googles Ad revenue, but I think they'll get some scraps(hey, scraps of $20B is still a lot).They're also going up against Googles video platform, Youtube. Flixxos platform is run on Bittorrent protocol meaning they don't have the large overheads of server and bandwidth costs - this technology works(as proven with Popcorn Time). Their token has actual utility and a circular economy where advertisers buy tokens, content creators sell them, viewers earn tokens by watching ads.You're probably asking why would someone upload to Flixxo > Youtube? Well, because of Flixxo being decentralized and running on bittorrent protocol they only keep 10% of ad revenue, the rest goes to content creators with the aim of providing them a more fair revenue for their content.Platform goes live first week on June!
3	1525777364	10	> ir content.Want to know more about the economy of Flixxo? https://medium.com/@SuperCoolSats/the-economy-of-flixxo-d5e2523142d1
3	1525780825	5	Flixxo only needs to move a single youtuber with a million + active followers. That's it, snowball effect afterward. TOnce a big one moves, the others smaller ones in the hundred of k's will be able to move without losing their audience, then onto the 5 digits followers, etc.
4	1525785031	1	its all nice in theory but when i go on their website i see no button to register or upload a video so it seems like they are still far away from even having the platform you need to do what you said.
5	1525786203	4	Early- mid June is release
5	1525789030	1	Platform Release ist first week of June. There are already sneak peeks on their Blog. It will be here faster then you think.
6	1525789479	2	will be interesting to see what comes of this. current flixxo marketcap of 10 mil is a joke
7	1525797603	1	glad i got a sell wall at 4mil cap..sad there's no decent walls of 15k+ since then.. well when theres one it goes away in 5secs.. never have time to buy them.
5	1525786689	1	One of the co-founders is the creator of popcorn time. They know what they are doing!
1	1525792868	1	What do you mean "if"? It already is. 
1	1525794192	1	[deleted]
2	1525794269	1	Already addressed above I wrote the language a bit weird. I’m aware of this :) thanks.
1	1525797341	1	Exactly this. Good comment.
1	1525791568	1	I think you underestimate the changing times we're in, and the ability of Brendan Eich and his team to gain market share. To assume Google and FB are immortal, and unbeatable enemies is very naive. 
2	1525794413	4	Anything is possible I’m not dismissing it. I’m dismissing the strategy that an investable ICO and digital currency can make any sort of splash in this particular market. Any decentralized solution will have to have millions of active users and be serving ads to those users and sell their own ad buys just like Facebook or Google. The power of Facebook and the Google Ad network is their reach and targeting.
2	1525801306	1	if it bleeds, we can kill it
2	1525803329	1	I think its naive to believe thats Google and Facebook will just bend over and let it happen.
1	1525775602	-2	Snapchat didn’t acquire instagram, Facebook did.  
2	1525794093	3	I know. I said Snapchat failed with the acquisition of instagram by Facebook. Sorry I should have been more clear.
2	1525776249	2	He never said it did.
3	1525776755	-2	“Snapchat has already tried to seize the growth of the market and failed with the acquisition of instagram” Maybe read before you comment? 
4	1525777288	3	Ye it tried to seize the growth with acquiring of Instagram, which it failed to do. English is my second language, so I might have understood that wrongly. 
4	1525785126	1	Reading comprehension rip
1	1525774320	1	It's a winner-takes-all kind of game too. For example, advertisers won't pay for your slots if you don't have a lot of reputable publishers serving your ad units. And reputable publishers don't want to serve your ad units unless you have a lot of big advertisers paying top RPM. It creates a chicken and type problem that keeps the top encumbents fully entrenched. 
1	1525779960	1	Ditto to this. I’ve actually been in meetings recently with digital advertising teams at Google and they’ve confirmed that they’re working on a blockchain solution. 
1	1525781261	1	When you say ton of users, how many are you referring to? Brave has, for example, 2.2 million monthly active. 70% of those on mobile. In January they anticipated 5mill by end of of year.How is your opinion impacted by this fact?
2	1525794742	2	I see that as very promising. I’ll have to check out their plans for media buying and targeting. But media buyers if anything will just add them in as another channel in addition to Facebook or Google. They won’t replace. 
1	1525771383	0	There is no doubt about the fact that google and facebook controlling most of the market revenues, but there is still a place for another small player to try and decentralise it, and even if google and facebook will implement a blockchain based solution, it still doesn't mean it actually going to bring any benefits for both advertisers and users.On top of that you should remember that with the latest things that happened with facebook, people are increasing their awareness for everything that is related to their privacy and data protection. Coming up with a blockchain based solution that doesn't directly relate with these companies can actually look more likeable and refreshing, than having another in-house solution that is built by those giant advertising whales. 
2	1525773887	7	This is one of those cases where you're trying to fit a square peg (blockchain) into a round hole.  There is no reason to utilize a blockchain here.
3	1525785142	1	so much this!everyone here seems to think the blockchain is the solution for basically everything which it is not only absolutely not but also it does not matter if it is, now you got a solution for a problem that doesnt exist because there is already a working solution.Unless you offer massive benefits there is no reason to change.
4	1525788681	1	If there is no benefit, all you're doing is slowing shit down by using a slow blockchain rather then a simple sql query.
3	1525794283	1	You are crazy to think this and obv haven't done a lick of research. 
4	1525797106	1	completel agrre, i would say this is one of the biggest areas where blockchain can help
1	1525786633	0	Legit question, why does advertising pay so much money? Are these many people legitimately being affected by these ads? I almost never purchase anything that I am aggressively marketed because I find the over-advertising quite irritating. 
2	1525790382	3	You might want to read a bit about advertising, especially the psychology. It affects you too. The fact that you think it doesn't means it probably works extra well for you.
2	1525795113	1	Its a numbers game at this point. A really good Facebook ad campaign gets anywhere from 3% to 5% click through rate on ads which proves you are one of the 97% or 95% who don’t. Then you apply a 20%-30% qualified lead capture onto those people and a 5%-10% lead to sale rate and you aren’t reaching many people but the reach is extremely scalable. At those numbers I work with people who spend $100 grand a month on Facebook or higher and are profitable in a month after spending. If you spend the money the numbers shake out. You may not be clicking but someone else is who is their target audience. There is also a common strategy that you are trying to break even as soon as possible so you can invest more into ads so some business are content with breaking even on their adspend quickly just to generate buzz and lead capture. It all depends on the strategy for the particular business needs.
1	1525792318	0	How can Google and Facebook improve on a monetizing strategy where they already make 90% of the revenue. First look at it form this point, when Eich came onto the browser game he was told that "we already have IE , your idea will never work." And now he's being tested again, and I believe he will be massively successful. Brave is faster than chrome, will eventually pay the user, integrate TOR tabs, and overall provide a much better experience.  I will agree that facebook and google will still have no problem making money, when you deal with a company that makes money on the level that google and facebook do. They have massive massive amounts of data on people, and they will always have value. Data is the new oil, and Facebook and Google will continue to grow. Even though they violate privacy something awful, as sad as it is to say- people will still use it and not really care. We know the NSA tracks everything we do, but most people still live their lives just the same as they did before. If we would have found out the government was spying on us in the 80s, we would have had protests like in Vietnam when we found out the government wasn't the friend we thought it was. But now a days, finding out how much these companies track you is just par for the course. Sure a little blip in the radar left using facebook after the Cam. An information came out. But people really didn't care, ma and everyone I know still use facebook. I tried using other search engines after I found out about google, but they just weren't as good, so often I cheat back to using google. The data google collects is valuable, and data is only going to get more valuable over time. With that being said, I still think that BAT is an absolutely monster of a crypto project, I think that it will hit a minimum of 5% google's market, which is enough to be an insane return. I think BAT is going to smash through that goal. Simply as a browser, I think there is a big market for people to watch porn on without 80 different companies getting a front row seat. People Ctrl Shift N on chrome and sure nothing saved on the local device's history, it doesn't compare to the blocking that brave can offer.  I believe this product will face mass adoption one day for sure. Between the CNBC partnership and Townsquare partnership this will face mass adoption, not to mention the strong likelihood of a coinbase addition and integration of other browsers like Firefox and Opera. 
2	1525802397	3	> , when Eich came onto the browser game he was told that "we already have IE , your idea will never work."Eh? He worked for Netscape, they were around a long time before IE and they were eventually wiped out by it.
1	1525779694	-2	I work with the same people - I believe the reason for you guys using Google and Facebook is because its proven to work and easy to hit your audience. However I work with technology and the understanding people have of blockchain as of now, they would NEVER trust such a system. When they understand a marketing campaign can be done cheaper and more efficiently while not making a 3rd party rich af. Then yeahh.. it will come like a breeeezeee...edit; one thing to keep in mind is data, you will have the customers deciding where the companies can get their information is just a few years.
2	1525794631	1	I agree. Media buyers will run to the cheapest ad buys that’s why Facebook messenger ads are so popular is because they are getting 50% cheaper leads at the moment. Media Buyers will move to an ad network where their audience is especially if it’s cheap. Keep in mind too that Media Buying is about multiple channels and while they may use a decentralized solution they will advertise on Facebook and Google as well. 
1	1525783782	-1	I think that would be a start, but at the end of the day these corporations are greedy as all fuck... that means that even if they did implement a blockchain, it wouldn't mean that advertisers are going to pay less, that people who click/watch ads get paid, and will not take a profit loss (especially deliberately). I think blockchains like BAT are 1 big step towards really decentralizing the internet and stopping these mega billion dollar companies from ruling the free WWW. 
0	1525769772	33	Go r/Oyster 
0	1525771985	11	No chance you're competing with the best engineers from Google and Facebook, putting blockchain on it doesn't change anything imo
1	1525774126	6	The point people don't get...  If a blockchain doesn't solve any problems, why the hell would you utilize one?  Facebook and Google have the audience, why would they decentralize and how?  Let someone else manage their ads just to bloat the cost and lose revenue?  Nothing about this makes any sense.
2	1525795163	1	> doesn't solve a problem-google and facebook make 70% of every ad dollar sold for content that is created by someone else-privacy is being invaded everyday by these companiesI don't know about you but these seem like big problems to me. When can you have a content creator like cyanide and happiness; which has 8 million subscribers, actually lose money on the clips they put out, In my opinion thats a problem. This isn't some dinky little art start up, its a well established company, that isn't able to remain profitable through the current monetizing practices of youtube and facebook.  That's why this product is different. 
2	1525798203	1	Thats the point, they wont decentralize. Theyre not in it for the "people" vs the "government", they are the government. Theyre interested in blockchain because of its value, not to bring the banks down.Not to say that they are against the people or anything but Google is for sure the 1%. The top guy just said 90% of all ads is owned by facebook and google.For sure the bigger companies will adapt to new technology.
2	1525787996	0	Look into BAT, it actually does sort of work with blockchain.
3	1525788615	2	ok, and what does that do about decentralizing facebook and google ads?  Their audience, their platform.
1	1525792095	3	Best engineers? What about [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich), or [this girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_Zhu), or [this guy](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ben_Livshits)? This is part of the Brave/BAT team. These aren't amateurs. Additionally, if I earn money and improve my privacy by maintaining the exact same browsing habits I already have, than it doesn't matter which engineer they have. Money talks. 
2	1525800428	0	'Speculation' that all it is until 'they' delivered most are scam to me.  That is the reason you see shitcoins come and go every year.  Shitcoin they come and go Monday to Sunday yo
3	1525801901	1	Brave browser is not a shitcoin. Firefox is not a shitcoin. Javascript is not a shitcoin. Your shitcoin radar is broken. 
4	1525802679	1	Yeah good luck with your investment I'm all about prococol/platform coins such as Neo Eth and Icon a little gem called Tau from Silicon Valley high risk but high reward if they can deliver.  Mainnet is 3rd quarter with zero fee, 10k tps, a Dex, fiat solution and atomic swap.  
1	1525790090	2	Huh? Put money in peoples pocket and not Googles pocket and your telling me it won't work? Money moves mountains man. Otherwise, you won't be here. I bet there will be a hit to the centralized ad models of today and decentralization will take some share. Initially it might just be a very tiny fraction, but over time, it will increase. I am not predicting doomsday for Google and FB. They are far too big for that. I am just stating the obvious that when people smell money, they'll run to it.
2	1525801266	1	I've been here long enough to understand that you can come up with anything any ideas any speculation throw blockchain on it ICO then get rich.  After rich the project slowly dyeing off then new ones come along with better ideas better whitepaper better team etc... Old shitcoin died new one get pumped rinse repeat. 
0	1525767317	6	I don't think they have a chance because Google is a big giant and they are very untouchable.
0	1525763952	10	How are they planning to do so? Google is a monster and one of the most strong organization there is
1	1525790202	2	Its not a question of organization strength. Its a question of who takes the money. Give the ad revenue to 1) the content creators 2) the people participating in the network (staking, mining what have you) 3) reduce cost for advertisers and 4) make it transparent and trustworthy - you've got a cocktail that is irresistible. The thing missing is the viewership and for that a clever company can come up with something.
2	1525797750	1	You're missing the main component of advertising and that is intent. How will a blockchain advertising network provide ads in an intent-based channel like Google does? Unless there is a blockchain search engine that beats out Google in market share, that's not happening. Reduce the cost for advertisers? How? That is a highly general statement when "costs" for advertisers closely tie back to return. It goes back to intent, the reason why Google and Facebook have the biggest share in Advertising is because they both provide different intent signals (Google with search / browsing data, Facebook with personal data).BAT has a shot, but it's predicated on adoption of Brave. Even if that is the case, do they have a lookalike model for client's merchant lists? And if they do, can the cost per acquiring a customer beat out Facebook and Google? The answer has to be yes to both those questions in order to get a large share of that 20B/year. That can happen, but that will not happen within the next 5 years. 
3	1525800233	1	>> You're missing the main component of advertising and that is intentI said it differently as "viewership". Context is surely important I agree. The blockchain is part of the puzzle only. The other part will be provided by layers on top of the blockchain. I think of it as http over tcp. Who will provide the http is something that we have to wait and watch. Today, both http and tcp are provided by the same company. The split will happen at the lower layers with incentives associated with it. >> Reduce the cost for advertisers? You think there isn't margin for cutting costs? The DoubleClicks of the world are monopolies and where there is a monopoly (or oligopoly), there are high margins. Just like mining, you could imagine advertisers wanting to advertise on a few web properties that suit their business needs. The publishers can then pick the ones that they find attractive. The facilitator is the blockchain.>> That can happen, but that will not happen within the next 5 years.Of course. A thousand mile journey starts with a single step.
4	1525801401	1	I mostly think we're on the same page here if we don't see this coming into fruition within the next 5 years, or even 10 years. I think your previous comment made it seem all too easy for the market to shift. Advertisers will do what they've done in every new channel, try it, test it against their current cost for acquiring customers and then grow it if it's lower. Of course, there is a margin for cutting costs, but if we're referring to Google's bulk of revenue, it's not in Doubleclick/GDN, it's in its search revenue. The search costs are dictated by the market and not by the company. Everyone seems to be thinking of display marketing and how publishers get paid their cut, where most of the market share is done through their native platforms (search and in facebook app). It's not as simple as which web properties suit your business needs, digital advertising, especially for display, has become about who your targeting, instead of where you are advertising. So the real change will be dependant on blockchain companies hiring the people needed to create algorithms that can beat Facebook's and Google's lookalike engines, with less data points to function off of, it's a long and uphill battle for any new "advertising company". If and when there is a blockchain company that can completely introduce a new way to either advertise or harvest data from users, (exactly the same way Google and FB did during their growth), then we can start talking about a gigantic shift in the advertising market share. All current iterations of advertising networks are just "blockchained" versions of currently running ad networks, and that just isn't enough to move the market. 
2	1525801900	1	Exactly this is a "worth a shot" risk on all sides. Even if the numbers are small to begin with. The incentive is there.
1	1525791823	1	By creating a better browsing experience for users, content creators, and publishers. By handing both the users and the publishers more control, more privacy, better metrics, and cost benefits. In any event, the "how are they going to beat Google" question is hyperbole. No one has to beat Google, they just have to gain some market share. Brendan Eich already did this with Firefox. Case closed.

2	1525771547	1	Exactly, Still there is a long way to go but in the end it happened
0	1525773099	4	Is blockchain technology going to be used in the online advertising industry? YesIs the online advertising industry going to become decentralized? Highly unlikely
1	1525776401	2	What does blockchain technology do for the advertising industry? 
2	1525800196	1	Zero knowledge proofs do a lot, but you need to understand online advertising very well to comprehend how it’s useful
0	1525786580	4	I don't think BAT will have some chances....
1	1525788284	1	they only need one chance though
0	1525763863	4	Which of these project is doing the best in your opinion OP? I'm extremely interested in this subject, since I work with google advertising on a daily basis. 
1	1525767760	-5	BAT, I invested in January when they were lesser known (yes I feel very cool because of this lol) and ever since the partnerships and updates have continued flooding me.
1	1525781817	0	Brave/BAT recently announced partnerships with the Dow Jones Media Group and Town Square. One example of a strategy of adoption is - if you download Brave using the link provided by Barrons or MarketWatch websites, you will receive a 2 year subscription to the sites. *Note Dow Jones Media is owned by News Corp.
0	1525767154	6	There's a rule which says, if the title of an article ends with a question, the answer is always NO
1	1525793054	1	Uh... do you have any idea how many articles have asked "will bitcoin survive?" Over the past 4-5 years? 
0	1525774457	2	Should we prepare for FBANG?
1	1525781958	1	Yes
0	1525776225	2	Clear Coin aims to make every ad buy on their platform completely transparent, thus reducing fraud. I know that there’s other tokens out there aiming for the same goal. It’s not going to be a small task, but with time, I believe that Google, Amazon, and Facebook will lose a large amount of their market share.   If advertisers see that they can get more value on another platform, best believe that they’re going to use it. Especially with smaller companies that don’t have $100,000,000 advertising budgets. 
0	1525782793	2	That's a lot of income from advertising only and imagine they banned crypto without a second thought, so they are not striving for clients that's obvious.
0	1525762965	3	The title is false. The revenues of Fox and CBS alone in 2017 were a combined 27 billion. They either mean profits (which would be right) or they blatantly quote wrong amounts. 
1	1525773252	2	I think they mentioned profits. Great heads up!
2	1525777535	1	Ye, it's about the profits. 
0	1525762105	7	I think they do! Specially BAT/Brave. It’s going to take time though and people to stop using companies like google services for it to really take off. I stop using all google products a long time ago. 
1	1525764939	8	What did you switch to for mail, calendar, maps and search?
2	1525767810	1	What do you mean?
3	1525772305	3	He's asking what software is he using instead of google services for calendar, mail, maps and search.
2	1525776015	-1	Mail: use no Gmail, use another mail provider Calendar: use no Google calendar, there are enough alternatives Maps: Don't use maps, there are enough alternatives Search: Use another search engine (duckduckgo.com, bing.com, ...)
3	1525779432	3	Yeah but the alternatives suck? Gmail automatically iterates with calendar and puts things on it. Maps and Waze are both google products. Gmail also integrates with android/Google app to pull tracking data for shipments, weather for travel, plane arrival/departure delay warnings, etc.
3	1525779259	4	Thanks for your detailed and helpful answer /s
4	1525785656	3	Maybe I can expand because I've also done the same. Email: posteo, mailbox.org, protonmailEmail Client: K9 Mail Calendar: Obtained through one of the mail providers, synced through something like calDAV on F-Droid Maps: Bing is all right, OSM+ for maps and gps on android (definitely not as good, but is well enough to get you by) Search: DuckDuckGo + "bangs"
1	1525766358	5	so naive
0	1525762734	6	Projects Like BAT, Adex, and KindAds deserve a lot more attention from the community. Competing Google and Facebook most precious source of income is not an easy task, and decentralize it is an amazing, challenging idea.
1	1525774586	8	This statement shows a gross misunderstanding of how this works.If I am facebook, and I control a massive audience, how are you going to decentralize that with basically yet-another-ad-agency that happens to utilize blockchain for some stupid reason?  The only way to "decentralize" it is to dethrone them as being top sites.  Nothing to do with how the ads are managed.
2	1525777385	1	I actually agree. Didn't thought about it before.Sometimes I'm just too furious about the big companies without any reason. 
2	1525791875	1	Are any of these platforms trying to decentralize Facebook though?
2	1525796396	1	BAT addresses that by integrating with the Brave browser. I doubt we'll see BAT take down either one, but it could grow to be pretty large in its own right. Furthermore, BAT could complement Google and Facebook. It's definitely not an either/or situation.
0	1525770691	2	BAT has no chance, there are too many loops the user needs to jump through to see adoption. PRL however is just one click for the user and works in conjunction with adverts, giving the host another means of revenue which is currently lost. 
1	1525776477	10	The CEO behind BAT already won the fight against Internet Explorer back in the days with Firefox. He was the co founder of Firefox. So why shouldn't he create a competitor for Chrome?
2	1525781727	0	He also created JavaScript which is sort of a big deal I guess.
1	1525775962	5	1. Download Brave. 2: credit account. Done. Wow, the hoops. If you're talking about publishers, that's a different story but it's not like that's so much easier with Google and the likes. Everything needs to be set-up. 
2	1525779317	6	That's actually a massive barrier. Most people will just stick with what they know and already works. Why do you think IE had huge market share for so long? It took MS completely screwing it up with IE6 for anybody to switch. Google hasn't made chrome unusably slow so 99% of users won't switch and the ones who do are more likely to switch back to Firefox or switch to Safari because they bought a Mac. On mobile Brave may have a slightly better shot because Android doesn't integrate adblocking but it's extremely unlikely anybody will pay for anything.
3	1525780270	2	Not really I've had friends I suggested use brave browser it's faster and they'll pay you to browse eventually. Boom people switched because it's faster. 
2	1525777011	3	That's the biggest hurdle of all, getting people to switch from chrome /ie /Firefox. 
3	1525789507	1	I think this hurtle is massively overstated. Why? Because there hasn’t been any good competition that is actually better then what has been put out. I got my parents to use Brave, my boss who is a chrome loyalist, friends, and really almost the people I’ve mentioned it to.“Hey, the guy that made Firefox made a new browser, it blocks ads and trackers automatically.” Brave is already at over 2 million active users 🤷‍♀️ 
1	1525781549	2	What are the two biggest loops?I anticipate you saying switching Browsers as one loop but history has shown users can and will switch Browsers.I started with IE, moved to Firefox, moved to Chrome, moved to Safari moved back to Firefox and currently use Brave. I also use EDGE as my employer dictates this.
1	1525772295	0	I have my doubts about BAT as well.
1	1525793142	0	What are the loops to using the Brave browser? It's a one click install, and I don't have to let someone's mining script run on my computer. 
0	1525777433	1	The Kin Foundation actually has another interesting solution to use cryptocurrency instead of advertisement to bring in revenue. They're using the Kik messaging app as a springboard to see if it actually works this year. They tested their idea on the dapp with a digital currency called Kik Points and saw movement 3 times more than Bitcoin. Kik has millions of users already.Howdoo is a current ICO that features a decentralized social media platform with one feature that allows users to sell data to advertisers for a token.There are some interesting ideas out there.
0	1525782385	1	The best way they can do is to make their own ICO, have the token burned or stakeable or just buy a lot of BAT and ADX. Their marketcap still fairly low compared to FB's revenue.
0	1525791335	1	No
0	1525791433	1	I don't know much about KindAds or Adex, but I do believe BAT has a chance. They are bolstering their abilities by onboarding BAT with the Brave browser, which I think many people underestimate. Brendan Eich already proved he can compete when he developed Firefox, so it's not a question of "if". 
0	1525791769	1	>Do they stand a chance? IDK, if I'm an advertiser why should I use BAT or whatever else blockchain related?
1	1525793220	1	Ask DOW Jones. They're a Brave/BAT partner. 
2	1525795169	1	But they're only "partnering" to test the network. So in a sense they wouldn't know either. Which is why they're testing the waters.
0	1525793413	1	If they dont try, we wont know.
0	1525797297	1	No. Just no.
0	1525801340	1	Obligatory PRL/SHL mention!
0	1525778196	1	I believe in BAT, it's one of the best projects out there. I think people are wrong when they are trying to make it "fight between google/facebook and BAT/Adex/KindAds". I can't tell much about Adex and KindAds, but the bat is more like a competitor of the Adblock extensions and direct donation to authors. They have very specific auditory (people who don't want ads and tracking but want to reward authors), and I don't think they are in conflict with Google. Auditory of BAT is the same people who donate for open software they download and authors for content, while Google AdWords auditory is all users who don't use Adblock plugins. Edited: I think I found a good example, I believe BAT can coexist exist with Adwords like Bandcamp existing while Spotify has basically all market. 
0	1525779452	1	AdEx will explode in price eventually, they have been teasing about some news for awhile. 
1	1525781980	1	Holy moly, that's pretty big.
0	1525776235	0	Yes they do stand a chance and I'm kind of dissapointed by how little attention these projects get and the negative sentiment I see in this thread. "Google and Facebook are too big, let's just go home". Wtf ? Are all the banks not so big ? Are all cryptos gonna fail then, because they can't dethrone the banks ? For example if everyone starts using Brave and more and more publishers hop on board, that can very well lead to real change. If it can't,  neither can Bitcoin or any other crypto used for payment. People simply have to adopt it, then anything can happen. 
1	1525778341	3	There is literally no point in the average user Downloading brave, it's doesnt solve any issue. if the user doesn't want adverts they can just download an ad block extension with less hassle than switching browser. Noone cares about earning pennys, only third world countries. 
2	1525782065	0	Aw man, come on. Do more research on Brave. 
2	1525792593	0	You are misunderstood. If you've never given it a chance you have no right to say this. Brave is actually a more sophisticated browser than chrome in its infancy. 
3	1525796151	1	That's because it's built on chrome lol. Not a good claim to make there, seems you know less about BAT than me.
