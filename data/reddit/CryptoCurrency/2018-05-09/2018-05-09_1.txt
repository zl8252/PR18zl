1	1525886870	1	Gotta catch’em all!
0	1525866435	14	Try Etheremon for actual "pokemon! gameplay
1	1525867197	2	What's that?
2	1525877187	5	An on chain Ethereum game with Pokémon as I understand it
0	1525868432	5	Very nice, do you make Android icon packs by any chance? I LOVE the theme.
1	1525868913	3	sure, write me an e-mail when you like: lukasz.adms@gmail.com
0	1525863718	5	If I was a web-developer and had my crypto related website then I would put these icons there for sure.
1	1525864362	1	Thanks man, I appreciate it!
0	1525875408	4	Where is my Ark badge? Nice work.
0	1525872763	4	Any chance you'd be willing to make a Vertcoin one? I would like to see it as an emote in their discord :) 
1	1525873938	6	sure, I write it down
2	1525878905	3	I would also very much like to see a vertcoin one 
0	1525867713	2	Beautiful 
1	1525868105	1	Thanks so much!
0	1525873003	2	This is awesome!!
1	1525873958	2	Thanks man!
2	1525874895	1	Youre welcome. Hope to see CND (Cindicator) in the next art piece :)
0	1525875141	2	Neo and ethereum in. I want Lisk added too :)
0	1525887262	2	Can someone make these into stickers? 
0	1525861759	11	I want my XRP Badge
1	1525891139	6	XRP needs to be here.
1	1525862168	5	I’ll add it as well ;)
1	1525875485	3	I find it odd how it's not included in any of these. As if it's simply ignored due to the corporation with banks and being backed by a company. Doesn't make it any less of a cryptocurrency... Stellar is there though, and is basically the same thing.
2	1525879538	5	Ripple is the dojo gym in saffron of crypto.
3	1525889265	2	Hahahahahahaha lmfaooooo this is so perfect!
2	1525878265	3	I find it odd that you dont like that someone did not include ripple in their own personal crypto art piece. 
3	1525882784	1	replied to the wrong comment? I never said I wanted a fucking XRP badge. Also, start saying XRP, so you don't confuse it with Ripple, the company.
4	1525882882	1	Lmao don’t get your panties in a bunch. Stop overreacting to everything kid. Like they told you before RELAX 
2	1525876941	2	lol, why are you whining about someone doing a fun thing? RELAX.
3	1525882683	-1	I think you replied to the wrong comment. The one above me could be considered whining, I simply added some points. Oh, and don't tell me what to do, I relax whenever I want, alright?
2	1525876883	-10	All the ones shown are decentralized unlike Ripple. 
3	1525882367	3	Ripple is a centralized company. Xrp is a decentralized digital asset. Not saying that he should have drawn an xrp coin or something like that. Really cool work by the way.
4	1525882535	1	Was just about to write the same thing... this guy bringing Ripple into everything going on with XRP.

1	1525874106	1	haha true, I'll add Ripple soon
0	1525875340	1	Back in the 90s, a close relative of mine thought pokemons were demonic and didn't want any of that merch in the house. So I guess crypto is damned too now. 
0	1525876019	1	No BNB?

0	1525880318	1	Repost.  I'll ask again where's dogecoin. 
0	1525880351	1	I'm 99% sure someone posted this before because i remember the NEO was originally brown and he reposted it with the changes a month or two ago unless you're the same person. Otherwise i hope you're not stealing someone else's work.
0	1525880399	1	Poketron, no? ok :/

0	1525883376	1	This guy is the bomb diggitiest! I highly recommend him if you ever need any kind of design done by a professional. Even when something is out of his expertise, he consistently produces quality work for his clients. Can't praise this dude enough! ❤️ 
1	1525889243	2	Haha bro you’re the bomb! I appreciate this so much. Thanks brother much love
0	1525884421	1	This is awesome. Any way you'll make a UKG one?

0	1525890895	1	FYI, the Japanese name of Ash Ketchum is Satoshi.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Ketchum
