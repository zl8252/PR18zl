1	1525896823	1	Hahahaha laughed way to hard 
1	1525870233	-3	They wouldnt listen when I said HODL applies to bitcoin only and 99% of alt coins die. 
0	1525848610	139	Morons
1	1525855993	25	Correctamundo. Id anyone touched that shit, sorry a fool and his money are soon parted 
2	1525877277	3	Well I did try to do some arbritrage trading from Polo to Binance and got burned with a hundred $, but it was worth the try. If the transaction had gone through the reward would have been handsome
1	1525862705	6	This was even worse than TRX pump and people still fell for it.
2	1525873698	11	I'm 50% trx 50% bcn rate my portfolio?
3	1525874903	5	Lip bitting sexy my dude.
3	1525887258	2	When lambo?
1	1525870167	3	This is how I feel reading daily threads. 
0	1525853473	320	"Damn this is worse than when I lost 6k on TRON" I lold.The idiots strike again!
1	1525856190	164	A crypto-idiot's walk of shame:1. Lose money on XRP -> Lose money on Tron -> Lose money on BCN 2. Blame the media ->  blame the exchange -> blame the devs. 
2	1525858700	113	 3. Continue buying random shitcoins       4. ???       5.  ~~Profit~~
3	1525872173	35	Dont do research, buy big green candles!
4	1525883709	12	And get big red dildos in return! 
2	1525866838	44	I never lost no money on XRP lol, one of my biggest gains!
3	1525882410	9	Same here. Bought lots at .27
4	1525886957	3	Me too.. except I forgot to sell at ATH :(
3	1525873889	12	tsame. I sold it all, never liked it... but i will never forget the gains it blessed upon me. 
3	1525882459	1	i sold 7079 XRP for 10$ cuz i didnt believe in that shit :P i still dont but ez no gainz :)
2	1525874953	25	Only people who has lost money on XRP bought between dec 2017 and feb 2018. The rest of us are still green.
3	1525880901	9	this can be said to almost all top coin in coinmarketcap I think
4	1525883203	4	if you remove the ones that didn't exist yet, then yes. It is unfair to compare XRP with TRON and BCN, as BCN is shady af and TRON is still an ICO with no product
4	1525885477	4	Bitconeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeect
3	1525881521	1	Lol I love this post. Got my 45k XRP in July of last year. Sold a measly 2k worth in October to get 995k Tron at .002, sold 2/3 of both at ~$2 and ~$0.25 and diversified. Now I got coins out the ying yang. Hysterical seeing people with weak hands lose money on my best plays.
4	1525883610	5	Not to be that guy, but be careful where you post numbers... people have been assaulted for less
5	1525888037	1	I mean someone with ill intentions would be better off grabbing 90% of the other people in San Francisco on the streets than getting all my information. Shit, my neighbors on either side have a million dollars in their garages. I ride a bike. My holdings compared to many people in my office... Pennies. If I lived in Idaho I'd heed the warning though.
6	1525888426	2	It doesn't matter what car you have, as long as you stay on public roads in good neighborhoods. Personally I prefer a bike over a car in a city anyways as I can just skip ahead of the traffic. I'm not telling you what to do with your holdings, hell, braging a bit has never hurt anyone, and when you get in early it feels even better, but I just hate seeing posts where people have been knocked down on the street and had information stolen leading to cryptocurrency theft. Also, you're becoming a target for hackers, as they know you have money.
7	1525888920	0	I was in no way, shape, or form touching on the practicality of owning a car in the city. I'm saying I can't afford to own one when parking spots are $500/month, but my neighbors both have multiple cars, some over a million dollars a piece. My coins are split between 2 nano ledgers, one in a safety deposit box. If they want to risk/ruin their lives breaking into a 4th floor unit to have a small percentage chance of finding one to steal half, have at it. I don't carry it on my keychain.
8	1525893400	1	He’s on the fourth floor. We’ve got em boys, move in. 
9	1525898280	1	Lol reminds me of talking to my GF's dad. Asks me a few months back how I can ever feel safe in my home without a gun to protect me (he lives in Tucson... I get where he's coming from). I'm like man, if you somehow got in our front door you would then be facing 42 steps straight up to the bottom floor of the unit. Good fucking luck stealing anything from a unit with 6 guys in their 30's in it and getting away scot-free. There's a golf iron at the top of the stairs just for that lol. It's a long ways down. 
4	1525882518	4	If you don’t mind me asking, how do you get in so early on these coins? Anyone in particular you follow? Thanks!
5	1525884195	3	This guys asking the right questions!
5	1525887049	2	Umm, you get in early, like last year early.
6	1525887620	1	Tell that to my roommate who bought 50M KIN early lol. You can buy early and still be clueless.
5	1525887664	1	Reddit is my only source of information. No FB groups, no Telegrams. Key is to not let what anyone else says about a coin influence your decisions. For instance, still absolutely love what Tron is doing. If you can't get behind a project aiming for an entirely decentralized internet because they plagiarized a few lines of a whitepaper (that's not illegal in China), well, you're free to miss out.But I did get lucky initially because I live in SF and a friend got hired by Ripple early on in July. So I talked with him and read up for 2 weeks then got in. 
6	1525888624	1	Awesome thanks for the info!
5	1525890493	1	It's actually luck even with research . Just means he heard about crypto  before u
2	1525860750	28	> 1. Lose money on XRP 2. ~~Blame the media~~ Try to legally prosecute Ripple.
3	1525864363	16	How is ripple liable if people lost money trading? 
4	1525864914	14	You have to ask Ryan Coffey for an answer.
5	1525865249	30	> Ryan CoffeyLoses money on trading, then loses money to lawyers... Lol. 
5	1525874816	6	Wasn't he confirmed knees deep with a rival company of Ripple?
6	1525882279	4	Yep R3. He's a complete... stupid person one might say.
2	1525856773	12	Lose money on bitgrailThat's blame the devs
3	1525858686	-10	Well, it is kinda strange EVERY exchange nano gets listed it has troubles... dont you agree?
4	1525863783	7	Same with several coins, IOTA in the past has been offline for weeks on Binance IIRC... its not talked about often because it did not have a toxic exchange like Shitgtail. Even PoW coins like Siacoin are suspended or have wallet issues half the time...
4	1525868374	6	Nanex had not a single problem with protocol. Weird? Exchange that os run by a single person has 100% run time while binance closed deposits for almost 1 month
4	1525867519	8	lol. 1 exchange basicly stole all your nano.The others have had minor deposit/withdrawal issues which are fixed.  how can you even compare them?
4	1525871205	2	Nanex has no problems :)
4	1525867659	1	Nah. It's a young coin that suddenly saw its volume rocket up. It's also designed for peer to peer. The main way they protect against dos attacks is by making sends more expensive than receives, which is fine for almost every use case except exchanges. Exchanges need to adapt to this new approach, like they do with other different wallets like iota. Thats partly on them, but will also improve as the docs, api and examples mature
4	1525861542	1	link to problems besides bitgrail?
5	1525861842	-3	Nano deposits got halted on binance and kucoin aswell, im on my mobile right now so i cant provide you with any links but im 100&#37; sure its not only bitgrail. \(not saying bitgrail isnt absolute shit btw\)
6	1525864212	15	Both were fixed, the Nano teamhad asked exchanges to suspend withdrawals for a week or so because of some issue with rebroadcasting transactions. Its fixed in the latest version v12.  And Nanex never had any issue because they implement Nano in the correct way using salable nodes, instead of kucoin or binance which try implement Nano like they implement btc/eth 
7	1525866621	2	This is the right answer.
6	1525864272	-1	Yea but didn't it get halted *because of the bitgrail shit*?
4	1525874966	0	Don't bring up honest discussion about that
2	1525872905	6	I know a few people that made huge sums of money on XRP and TRON - the key is to know when to exit.
3	1525898232	1	No, I think best method is the Darwin method - let the market decide their exit for them. 
2	1525881760	1	It's starting to look like a joke right now.
2	1525883118	1	Don’t forgett bitconnect
2	1525892734	1	ripples up over 500% over the year. losing money on investment that has gone from 17 cents to currently 85 cents in a year makes the crypto idiots even more impressive. granted buying ath would have major losses at 85. 
1	1525863039	15	> The idiots strike again!Hey don't talk like that. Those idiots make me a shitload of money and i love them.
2	1525877269	1	Ha ha ha. At least  an Idiot with a lots of money.LOL
1	1525866562	8	This is actually good, when money flow away from these people it might actually stay in other more reasonable projects
1	1525869243	5	The only people who lost money on TRON are the idiots who FOMOed in during the run to ATH. Everyone else is still way up! It’s just like the people who lost on ripple when it went over $3. NEVER FOMO!!
2	1525870885	8	Just remember if everyone took your advice "never fomo" you would never make a cent in this market. 
3	1525877697	2	You wouldn't as a trader, but you would as an investor.
2	1525880282	1	>NEVER FOMO  Some people need this written on their monitor with permanent marker
1	1525874810	2	Bit like the XVG show at NYE, so many people trying to get rich quick but their inexperience got them burned to a crisp! 🔥 
1	1525879179	2	[deleted]
2	1525892582	1	Same with storm for me, made $15k in 4  hours. The problem with these pumps is that you need to have enough brains to actually sell the asset once it's appreciated in value. Most of these idiots are happy just sitting back, watching their theoretical profits and waiting for the price to drop back down to chump levels. 
1	1525874989	1	episode 574827230?
1	1525874152	1	Absolutely no sympathy from me
0	1525851322	112	"This is worse than when I lost 6k on Tron" - How can you not learn from that...
1	1525851973	25	It’s easy, you blame the Russian hackers and Macedonian meme farmers: 
1	1525874936	11	It's not his fault when the whales...
1	1525877790	3	~~TRON Lambo~~~~BCN Lambo~~Dude should just flush cash directly down toilet and save the heartache???
2	1525881079	3	Go out back Let me kick him in the nuts and take half his stack?Ynot?
0	1525856375	50	That bytes
1	1525865066	11	+100 sick dad joke, man.
0	1525849557	219	Falls for an obvious pump, then wants binance to take responsibility for their own stupidity. 
1	1525865339	15	But it was up +600%! It was obviously going to the moon without stopping, so I did the only smart thing and went all-in!
2	1525870147	8	"BTC isnt going to have 100x gains like SHT."- November NoobBTC also isnt going to 0.  
1	1525861594	19	That’s why there is a security law that only the rich can invest. Because then any retard can take his parents money and lose it in a scam then blame the government because they’re fucking losers, it’s a massive headache. 
2	1525866654	9	Couldnt rich people do the same mistakes? I dont get why rich/non-rich should be treated as responsible/irresponsible. 
3	1525867374	11	Because the rich can afford to do stupid mistakes. Unlike the guy that put his Bytecoin purchase on his 20% interest credit card.
4	1525897108	1	Like the rich banks who gambled with ppl's money? Rich is definitely not the accurate term. 
3	1525867107	18	You don’t get rich by being a retard
4	1525868591	17	Yeah usually you are just born rich
4	1525869747	5	What if I inherit it and I lose it all? Why is that different?*for the downvoter... I am just trying to have an open discussion here. Good?*
5	1525870778	5	Come on mate. Obv people can be born rich and win the lottery but you know what I’m saying. Generally stupid does not get rich.
6	1525872406	2	I know what you are saying. But this is not a fair system. Because obviously there are also smart non rich people that could use their smartness to invest but are not allowed to. This is generalizing. Make everybody „suffer“ because someone else made bad decisions.
7	1525873946	2	There are more stupid than smart. We could debate on this for ages. It is what it is. 👍
8	1525875965	4	True we could. Still unfair and overly protective in my eyes. 
7	1525886749	2	The person without money that is smart enough to invest it is also smart enough to make and save enough money to invest.
5	1525880292	1	Rich stupid people pay someone to be smart for them. Poor stupid people get lucky or stay poor (and generally get poor again when they get lucky).
4	1525870580	2	Never heard of the God Emperor from the United States of A?
4	1525877010	1	Lil pump?
3	1525869483	1	No, they couldn't.
2	1525880698	3	But anybody with any amount of money can gamble their entire savings at the casino while chain-smoking and drinking booze. Personally I think those “only the rich can invest!” Laws are to keep the middle/lower class in their place. A fool and his money will always be soon parted. 
2	1525873820	1	What? Anyone can invest. I bought my first stocks with a couple grand. 
3	1525873976	1	Yes but not everyone can invest in ICO especially America.
4	1525874017	1	Do you mean IPO? That has absolutely nothing to do with the government. 
5	1525874111	1	I said ICO...
6	1525874154	1	So what are you talking about, then? There’s no government restrictions on ICOs (yet). 
7	1525874300	4	What country are you talking about? For Americans most ICO are not available unless your accredited and some won’t even allow that.
8	1525874492	1	That’s anticipating an SEC ruling that hasn’t come through, though. There’s been no actual ruling. 
9	1525878845	3	Not sure about other coins, but I tried to hop on the SingularityNET ICO and got declined as I am not an accredited investor per the US Government.
3	1525874381	1	Only after IPO. https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/23/the-sec-could-change-the-requirements-for-investing-in-startups-and-thats-not-good/
4	1525874702	1	Ok but that’s really different than saying only the rich can invest. Of course normal people can invest, it’s what our entire retirement system is built on. That law isn’t to make it so only the rich can invest, anyway - it’s to protect people from shit like the scam in this thread, because retail investors are retarded. 
5	1525875346	1	I agree with you and understand that the law is there for protection of regular people, who fall for schemes like this. But the side effect is, that most people are denied the high risk/high return opportunities. 
1	1525854609	36	Binance had something to do with this scam
2	1525857302	65	I'm amazed by the fact that everybody who questions Binance is downvoted. How did a community as skeptical of financial institutions as this one become so blindly loyal to a goddamn exchange?
3	1525866659	8	Reddit is not 1 person = 1 vote
4	1525867378	2	True. It definitely helps to remember that. 
3	1525859208	28	BNB has created a loyal army of fools frothing at the mouth to defend every last action they take.Utterly pathetic on their behalf, genius on Binance's part.
4	1525872728	3	Sorry youre blaming 1 exchange lol
5	1525872978	1	Pardon? Blaming who for what? What are you even talking about?
3	1525870922	9	It’s not a compelling conspiracy to me because binance is already making money hand over foot, there is little incentive for them to intentionally manipulate markets. (The marginal benefit is less than the cost of losing them steady business)
4	1525871452	3	Bitmain is making more revenue in a year than Nvidia.  Doesn't stop them from doing scummy stuff for even more money.
4	1525897216	1	They are not risking anything. 
3	1525879873	2	The difference is a history of banks getting caught defrauding their customers and the world at large, vs an exchange that has never once had any such event occur. Binance is literally one of the most profitable companies in the world right now. Why on earth would they jeopardize that for some chump change on a PnD?They wouldnt.This isnt about blind loyalty, its about common sense. Your conspiracy theory is just not well thought out at all. No decent business person would ever take the risk-reward, on something like what youre describing, in the position that Binance is in.
3	1525872231	1	It WAS a community skeptical of financiel institutions. Now it is a community of those people + those wanting to make a quick buck. I think these people are the latter.
3	1525870028	-4	bnb shills. Its a chinese company after all and I believe they create even false narratives ("hack" for example) to boost their positive PR.
2	1525866826	6	How?
3	1525867049	2	First of all they knew it was a shitcoin but probably got paid a lot to list it.Second, insider trading  (coinbase gets hate here when they listed bch. Binance probably did the same)Third, after people bought and skyrocketed the price, now they can't sell. Binance halted trading. That's shady and scummy af
4	1525867383	10	"probably got paid a lot to list" & "Binance probably did the same" are just assumptions on your end, also what do you mean halted trading \(BCN is still trading atm\)?
5	1525870384	4	It'd be impossible to prove. What we can prove however is Binance's strict listing process. Many legitimate coins still struggle at getting listed because they don't meet  some of the numerous conditions they apply.  For BCN to sail right through the process and get listed like this, that reeks of corruption.  
4	1525873959	2	The fact that your comment and all similar ones have a bunch of downvotes is rather proving your point. Not sure if it’s a bunch of sockpuppets or just idiots holding BNB doing so, but this move by Binance was one of the shadiest things I’ve seen in crypto in awhile. 
5	1525879683	1	It could be that all 3 of his points are bullshit and he has no proof of anything even close to showing Binance was insider trading a shitcoin.
4	1525875036	2	Okay, but there are many other shitcoins on Binance (I'm calling Verge). I don't like this either, but it's nothing new.Is there proof of insader trading? That would be devastating.And a lot of people even requested the trading stop. To be honest, the people that jumped on this pump'n'dump train probably would have lost their money regardless the stop.
4	1525879634	2	First, any coin can pay to get put on Binance. That's literally how it works. Second, unless you have proof of some insider trading, you're just speculating. Third, that happens with most shitcoins when they get listed on big exchanges. Blame bytecoin for the congestion. 
1	1525853849	-3	Binance is no better than BCN to begin with.
2	1525858821	35	I like Binance, but this was pretty damn shady.
2	1525855591	5	Then it’s doubly stupid for the guy to jump on it. 
2	1525856094	14	Yeah im considering taking my business elsewhere. This kind of manipulation is not healthy in the long run. It makes me wonder about all the volume on Binance, if that is even real or just more fake/manipulated shit? 
3	1525857207	16	It's manipulated as fuck.
3	1525871880	2	when in doubt assume the worst when it comes to crypto exchangesif they can do something and make a lot money, they probably are
3	1525864184	2	Kucoin is really fixing their shit lately, especially the customer service which was terrible before but great now. Starting to think this will be my new favorite once volume rises.
4	1525868194	3	Hmmmm....No option to set a stop loss. Sometimes the site is slow, or getting stuck loading. Everytime you open a new tab you get logged out. I have not used the support yet, so can't say anything about it.I mean Kucoin is ok. It's not great, but it works more or less well. If they could fix the loading issues (happens every other day) and random log outs I'd be happy already.
5	1525869761	1	I've never had those new tab log-outs. But yes sometimes a few things a slow in loading like the orderbooks. Other than that at least they are improving fairly fast. Stop-loss would be great too.
3	1525859536	1	Extremely highly manipulated, one of the worst exchanges I've ever experienced in that regard.So bad I will never use them again, I moved a couple of weeks ago and will not be returning.
0	1525861711	28	So I have a weird story. I've had BCN for a year now, yesterday I saw it was about a penny a coin on HitBTC where I left the small amount I invested and forgot about, 19900 BCN. I sold it for around .21 ETH and went on with my day because I was recently fired and needed cash. Well I then hop on Reddit after a nap to see BCN pump and dump stories and how no one can sell, withdraw, or deposit. I counted my blessings.
1	1525873434	15	In the middle of the bitgrail problems, before news broke of the exchange being a scam, theft, etc.....I deposited about 500 nano to sell on the exchange.  This was early Jan. or late Dec.  Couldn't list it because the website was glitched.  Decided to withdraw it the next day.This was the same time people were complaining about withdraws being down for days.  A week later, the withdraws were locked and stories about the owner stealing came to light.I literally threw like $5,000 into a fire, and managed to pull it back out 24 hours later.  That was my crypto blessing.
2	1525881768	6	There are definitely some coins I want to grab but won't touch because of the exchanges they are on.
3	1525897612	1	Ughh dude this is so fucking true
0	1525848681	88	AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHASHAHAHAH
1	1525870205	8	I got a feeling these threads will be extremely common over the next 3 years as alt coins begin to die. 
1	1525870689	5	Likewise brother HAHAHAHAHA.
1	1525893954	1	Laughs in Italien 
0	1525856637	20	While on some level I do feel for them, they ultimately have to take responsibility for poor decisions. Anyone could have done 5 minutes worth of research and understood the conditions which caused that massive pump were 'stay the fuck away' signals. I only wish I could have shorted it.
0	1525850738	44	While I hate to see people losing money, this is one of those cases where it is someones own fault...2 minutes of research could have told you that the value of this coin was inflated beyond belief. I mean come on...20x value because of an exchange listing...a marketcap of ranks 10-20 combined...for what? An old privacy-scamcoin? Let this be a lesson for new people investing...please do at least A LITTLE research...
1	1525857440	17	There's a lot of dumb money in crypto. People can't even understand marketcap, let alone understanding how liquidity and arbitrage can have a huge impact on prices.
2	1525858549	4	I know. Hopefully this will trigger some people to educate themselves before they start to use money they cant afford to lose
3	1525859230	10	I doubt it lol. I'm in a crypto facebook group that pretty much uses one small local exchange. The whole group was up in arms about the exchange not allowing withdrawals of BCN because they wanted to send it across to Binance to sell. It completely goes over their heads that if they were able to send the coins across, there wouldn't have been the huge price spike in the first place.
2	1525860668	0	I scream this at people all the time... CHECK THE DAM SUPPLY AND MAX SUPPLY. 
1	1525851206	12	And dont forget to never FOMO.you'll always get a chance to buy at a better price once the dump comes through(assuming its a good project)
1	1525861093	4	>do at least A LITTLE researchThat's what I did for NAV, for example \- and I've been losing money ever since despite it's a great project.No wonder these scams attract lots of people.
2	1525862061	5	Yes, research doesn't guarantee success, it only limits failure. I also researched a lot of projects and am currently heavyly invested in POE because of their vision, the great team and realistic and professional approach. Right now it is also not performing as I hoped for but I will keep it just because I know it's time will come 
2	1525874360	4	Lol. “I did a little research and I’m not rich yet!”C’mon, man. Nav has some glaring issues if you did enough research. Mainly, it has opt-in privacy and the “masternode” issue, where the owner of a masternode can potentially see all your activity.  Or, you know, the feds who have subpoenaed them.

4	1525876367	2	I don’t have a source, I just read over their white paper and saw these issues. Look up “dash masternode criticism” for a bigger coin that has the same problem. 
1	1525861586	4	Right. Of course I looked at it when I saw the gains on Binance. But after checking it out on coinstats and seeing two simple things: it was less than 2 cents on poliniex, and all wallets and exchanges were unable to send it. That’s not an investment opportunity, that’s a popcorn opportunity. I sat and watched this mother fucker build and Crash like it was a YouTube video.
1	1525871152	3	I was surprised to see it rising. Now I'm almost tempted to buy some for shits and/or giggles
1	1525860587	1	it's not a scam coin - it has been highly manipulated... all anyone had to do was check coin market cap and realize that the price for it was obviously bloated. apparently, people were buying it at .20c? I mean wtf it has been sub 1cent for months.  
2	1525881166	2	BCN is not a scam coin? But it’s development is nonexistent and has ties to minergate who objectively steals hash-rate, last I checked. 
1	1525856266	1	I just dont get why an exchange listing pumps a coin's value so much. Its just not a sign of healthy market. This shit needs to die before people start seeing cryptocurrencies as anything more than a joke 
2	1525856740	5	Depends on what you mean by "much". A 5-10%,  sometimes even a little more, pump is normal for the entry on a big exchange simply because you now have more possible buyers because not everyone has accounts on multiple exchanges. Anything above this will only be a short pump and will lose you money if you FOMO in...
3	1525856881	0	10% is perfectly fine, I mean all the 50% pumps you see on listing on Binance, and especially Bithumb I have a varied portfolio and sometimes its silly seeing some shitcoin up 100% on the day only to find out it was listed on Bithumb 
0	1525850140	18	This is gold.
0	1525851714	18	so beautiful. these are the idiots that FOMOd in and pumped BCN by 300%+ in the first place. these are the idiots you dump your bags on. i have no sympathy.
1	1525856112	15	Some Bought in at over 5000 sats on Binance 
2	1525867027	10	According to the ATH on Binance somebody bought at 10k sats. Imagine being that idiot.
3	1525874620	5	that was a market buy that was trying to clear the sell side of the orderbook.(10k buy was on purpose). By doing that the buyer essentially became the owner of nearly all the bcn on binance. Then sold at 25x.
4	1525881203	3	Can you explain the last point? If they are top buyer, how did they sell all of it at a higher price? (I'm not in front of any charts and out if the loop on bcn)
5	1525885592	3	The orders that would have been around the 10k mark would have been so insignificant in terms of value when comparing it to the bulk of coins they bought at the bottom end of the scale. When you then meet in the middle and control the demand the outcome probably ended up making them tens of millions.
5	1525884250	2	If noone is able to send any coins to binance that means that there is only a limited amount on the exchange. If you control all the supply you can set whatever price you want. Basically they bought up all the bcn on the exchange and sold at whatever price they wanted to. And as for the top buyer part, probably only a small part of the order executed at the top, most of their buying was at lower prices. Pretty genius actually.
5	1525883861	0	Well if it's true the point is that whoever made the 10k buy order bought every sell order and cleared out the supply so it gave the person who bought everything control over the supply. Thus they can control the price. While they will have made a big loss at buying the 10k order they may have made up the loss and gained a net profit from selling the overall supply.It's something I hadn't considered, but that seems pretty likely now that I think about it. 
0	1525855216	7	Fool and his money are soon parted.
0	1525855900	6	Why the hell would you buy a coin pumped over 600%. Obvious your going to  get rekt don't blame Binance for your own stupidity
0	1525858958	6	"this is worse than when i lost 6k on tron"man i hope that one is a joke
0	1525855947	10	how bout this one https://imgur.com/IJ6xcHS
1	1525864817	5	> Username: when moon? Pure gold
1	1525864398	5	Hahaha, never go full retard
1	1525882293	3	With that profile photo I can't decide if they're a troll or not.
0	1525888026	5	Now, I'd just like to start off by saying that I did not partake in the pumps (and dumps) of yesterday, but, I was a spectator. It really is quite shocking to see the reactions of some of you....how can you get joy and pleasure from watching people lose money? We as humans are impulsive, desperate and irrational. This is why games such as the lottery among others are so popular. People crave a change, something new...something to grasp on to; this is why people chase these pumps. A lot of new investors get into crypto for the chance of a better life and when they see a moment like this, most will think "this could be my time".We shouldn't be insulting them, or laughing at them - we should be educating them, consoling them and helping them to move on. We're not all fighting against each other. A prosperous community requires more than a few, more than a thousand...it requires everyone. It is for this reason that we need to not be so toxic - by doing so we are only exacerbating the perpetuated problem. Think of it from a new investors perspective...it's not that thrilling to watch a thread consist of pure insults, laughing at the misguided or the unfortunate for their choices. This alone will be enough to turn some people away.Help them to learn. Build a better future for the crypto community that is ever growing. We don't want to be seen as a cult.
0	1525853569	11	BCN is a scam
1	1525861085	-22	NEO is a scam. I can say words as well. 
2	1525864274	6	Great argument there
0	1525876016	3	It is good to see that there is a place where these complete fucking morons can come together and be one.Idiots deserve to lose their money for buying a coin that was many many times over priced compared to the other exchanges.   And they blame binance for their own ineptitude.
1	1525876423	3	To add to the above:  if these fucktards took a couple minutes to check coinmarketcap and did a modicum of arithmetic ~  they would have quickly realized that the binance price would mean BCN was 3rd in total market cap ahead of ripple at over 40 billion....Then again, perhaps they would shrug and say time to buy more before BCN overtakes ethereum.......  Fucking morons.   Complete fucking morons.
2	1525888213	1	Thats all just FUD. BCN is the real bitcoin.
0	1525866765	4	You forgot XVG
0	1525858514	4	Coin went 100x within 1 hour. I mean. Wasnt it obvious enough? You see new coin on binance and you go balls deep? Atleast look up the price on coinmarketcap before buying ico bags
1	1525860889	2	check supply/max supply Vs price, dev team, coin history. invest accordingly, it's not rocket science. literally shocked people were buying it 100x the previous ATH... :/
0	1525852307	2	I can't believe people sill thought buying into the pump was a good idea, it was so blatant. The price was steadily dropping throughout the day if you were paying attention. 
0	1525856024	2	Who else to blame? Really...
0	1525856106	2	When will ppl learn?
0	1525856869	2	Like how tf a regular investor with a little sense fall for that. 
0	1525869038	2	These guys are working on some thorough technical analysis 
0	1525870665	2	Amazing. This is how I got into GRS and Vertcoin. To think I'd still be waiting in there if I held... glad I found Icon (ICX)
0	1525871678	2	I have no sympathy for anyone who touches bytecoin.
0	1525874971	2	'binance better do something for us' LOL how many flatbrains are out there
0	1525882759	2	Hey Hey Hey!
0	1525883774	2	What the fuck was binance thinking listing Bytecoin? It's a dead premined scamcoin? Were they in on it? Can we still trust this exchange?
1	1525894805	1	They list anything that pays them $$$$$
0	1525860742	3	Can someone give more context? I know bcn and the pump but don't understand the whole thing now?

0	1525867462	1	If you took that screenshot, can you send a message of mine to them - "Thank you for better defining Stupidity & Morons."
0	1525870883	1	Out of the loop. Who is BCN and why are we all hating on them?
1	1525871818	5	Who? BCN is not a person, BCN is bytecoin and it was last years pump and dump that somehow people got fooled into again.For a little reference, Monero is a fork of bytecoin, but Monero is a serious project and bytecoin is worthless bs.There is absolutely no reason to ever buy bytecoin.
0	1525873728	1	well let me buy some shady coins,hope to make sick gains for lambo, get rekt by my decision made on everything but study and research myself into the coin, rinse and repeat..Aprox 90 &#37; of ''cryptotraders''
0	1525873745	1	I bought some @ 190 SATs for a bounce..its way over sold..tight stoploss 
1	1525886071	1	Did the same this morning, bought at 187 and sold off just shy of 250. Feeling pretty good. It was kind of obvious that it was going to be stretched out.
2	1525886669	1	yea I got out at 230..
0	1525874004	1	I'm not sorry for the people who lost money on recent BCN pump and dump because they are to stupid to be in crypto space. The same people who jumped from Bitconnect then into Verge and now into BCN.
0	1525874672	1	FOMO is a bitch. 
0	1525875456	1	Sheeps
0	1525876114	1	people fell for this bcn shit?!  
0	1525877259	1	Anyone who bought into this deserved to lose money on it.Stop backing shitcoins.  Start backing legitimate projects.  You are not going to 100x overnight EVER AGAIN.It's long, steady gains from now on.  Stop being idiots.
0	1525880177	1	They thought it was a cheap coin and couldn't resist.
0	1525880699	1	what is this BCN even?I can't find it in coinmarketcap
0	1525881246	1	"... Until they fuck up." Lol
0	1525882647	1	RIP to them
0	1525883105	1	Where can I join one of these group chats. Need to know what I should avoid investing in 
0	1525884006	1	BCN a.k.a. "The FOMO Hell"
0	1525884249	1	so how many of these people do you think were on here and were chasing the pump and dump? Get fucking rekttttt
0	1525885605	1	Oh yes!! BCN is such a shit coin. Good thing there are no forks of it.....oh wait, Monero is a fork of it. Damn it! Monero is a shit coin to by default. Ffs
0	1525885978	1	These scams are getting out of hand! 
0	1525887376	1	Accept it that not all can win in this game. So pick the right coins and invest for long term instead of chasing moon, lambo. 
0	1525888730	1	OMG so many people buy from the top. 
0	1525889059	1	If any of these people did 10 minuets of research in BNC they would realize it was a scam from day one. Not saying the protocol isn’t legit or sparked legitimate projects, it’s the original repo was pretty much abused by scammers. 
0	1525889806	1	scam
0	1525891681	1	want to not end up like these people? STOP CHASING PUMPS STOP LISTENING TO FOMOSTOP BUYING RANDOM SHIT YOU HAVENT THROUGHLY RESEARCHED 
0	1525891716	1	Someone get Seven Doorknobs in this group. We need answers. 
0	1525891905	1	Lol I like how the one dude blames binance. If they would have told him: "no, we aren't letting you buy this pump and dump scam" he would have raged so hard Honestly what does he expect them to do? Pay his dumbass losses out of their own pocket? 
0	1525893054	1	What happened to BCN?
0	1525893669	1	We welcome you at bittrex. 
0	1525895684	1	tldr; don’t jump on(in front of) hype trains.
0	1525867822	1	Tron is the Andy Dick of crypto
1	1525871010	1	You can cross out the Andy part.  ;)
0	1525852181	1	Ho ho ho, who wouldn't pump,Ho ho ho, who wouldn't puump.Up on the housetop, dump, dump, dumpDown through the chimney with good Saint Nick. (Saberhagen)
0	1525858989	1	BCN??
1	1525865502	2	Bytecoin. It’s a scamcoin that got pumped on binance. If anyone took 5 minutes to go to their website they would have never touched it. 
1	1525867716	1	the thing is no one pointed a gun and said they had to go buy BCN, but these new BCN bagholders are now trying to find someone to blame =\)
0	1525867683	1	1: just stop your fomo shit  2: This is why im invested in DEX and LRC
0	1525886612	1	Lol any fucking dumbass who lost money with BCN 100% deserves it. So glad they lost their money, hopefully they were dumb enough to all in  
0	1525886790	1	Sure sucks to lose money but in this case I'm not even sorry for the bagholders, one has to be completely retarded to buy this coin with such a large supply and an interesting team at 2000+sats. Its marketcap was over 40b at the very peak and clueless pump chasers still bought it. Expecting it to keep volume though and become a third go-to crypto for dumb money after tron and verge. The amount of bytecoin shill posts from bagholders will surely increase.
0	1525887932	1	I lost 27k on tron and now 8k on BCN, fuck me
0	1525889606	1	No sympathy. They opted to buy something that was up, what, 1000% in a day? How dumb can you be?
0	1525892882	1	Hahahah what a bunch of idiots holy shit, they deserve to go broke for buying into that pumped shit lmao
