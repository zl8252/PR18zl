0	1525846255	194	It may be \*the\* biggest problem in crypto. Just watching this sub makes it pretty clear that it's a very real issue.
1	1525849259	244	Fuck you say about my coin?
2	1525851734	38	I said zcash is garbage! Jk....but am I?
3	1525852094	37	Fucking tribalists. You're all the absolute worst. Non-tribalism is the path to success.
4	1525855826	53	Can I join your tribe of non-tribalists? Fuck those other guys. They're way off!
5	1525860431	13	TribCoin launching soon - join our exclusive club of non-tribalists NOW for 50% pre-ICO discount!PS no Bcash soyboys allowed.
6	1525860522	4	Good luck finding bagholders. 
6	1525861517	3	Lol. Nice shitcoin. You might have luck with the Lightning Betas and their soy lates.   BCH Gang lives off highballs and pure animal based protein. But nice try. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

5	1525852786	3	Pretty sure you missed his joke too. Above poster was making fun of tribalism by claiming to be in a superior "non-tribalism" tribe. 
3	1525884562	2	Fuck zcash and its trusted setup.  Use trustless only!!  I'm not even saying that out of tribalism,    Snowden is probably paid off to shill it so certain people can monitor things. 
3	1525859012	1	z or b? 
2	1525876504	1	"brothers, we should be struggling together" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHHitXxH-us
2	1525898222	1	Delete that flair !!! yours not better than mine !
1	1525858367	10	My impression is that it's a small vocal minorty, a part of which are paid shills. It makes sense that if you're somewhat serious about investing in crypto, you're spreading your risks and invest in at least 6 different coins/tokens.
2	1525860771	5	In 2017 people started using subreddit subscribers / telegram / social media community size as a valuation metric & proxy for potential  size of dumb-money available for pumps - I think shortly after that came the rise of the "Comunity Manager" marketing service a.k.a. pay us to automate the shilling process for you.
3	1525866551	2	Yup. I know people who made bots that would use social media stats to buy/sell stuff. 
3	1525878557	2	I started a *Community Development* service at the beginning of this year and have had to learn a lot about the state of this "Community Manager" stuff. It's actually a bit of a complicated problem as it stands.Problems:1. Actual entrepreneurs (or wantrepreneurs going for it) are looking to raise money for their arguably interesting project need to have certain "investor metrics" to compete and raise2. The users following early stage ICOs have turned into their own type of tribe or userbase which has no real desire to learn or support the project itself. You get a ton of users in a chat but no one stays. Telegram itself is terrible for community development.3. All of the bullshit ICOs have pushed the boundaries on airdrops, bounties, etc which has set the bar very high for legitimate companies4. None of you (including me) would take a truly startup looking project in this space seriously. (Similar to how I look at video gamers expectations being very high) This incentivizes the cheap tricks5. ICO startup founders have *very* unrealistic timelines, fueled by a need to get through quickly before the laws change again half-way through your raise6. Thinking outside of the box or breaking the current ICO marketing "formula" as it were carries a ton of risk and a lot of these people are putting their livelihoods on the line to go after an ICO raise (it's expensive!)My issue is all of the fake bullshittery that has already come to plague the industry. One thing that is great about Reddit and similar types of platforms is the pseudonymous nature of it which has enabled people to be more "real" or candid in discussions. We have taken a hard stance against shilling and shills - I won't make it but my team is handing out **"Stop Financing Shills"** shirts at consensys - and hope to help guide the industry towards more transparency. If it makes you all feel better, I have good reason to believe shill companies have (or probably will) receive subpeonas. Good luck explaining your financial shill business to a judge.
2	1525874805	1	Not exactly - if you’re a bitcoin maximalist it doesn’t make much sense to invest in other projects. But that’s fairly unique to bitcoin. 
3	1525887108	2	"But *my* coin is different" 
3	1525882194	1	I think this only pertains to those who are too ignorant to spread amongst the alt coins or those who got in so early on btc that diversifying wouldn't even be a worthwhile blip on their radar
4	1525882997	2	No, I don’t think so. Bitcoin, the argument goes, is roundly destroying every other crypto currency at “being money.” You can make a pretty good case for this - there’s no competitor that improves upon anything bitcoin is doing without trade offs in other areas (usually security or decentralization). Thus, there’s no point in diversifying and all these coins will be nonexistent in the end. There’s lots of great arguments for why this would be the case. Many of them come from people who aren’t personally invested in bitcoin. To be honest, the only crypto that exists today that has a strong argument for being better than Bitcoin is Monero, in my opinion.I still hold alts, personally. 
5	1525883675	1	I mean...I can see why they might think that, but advocating such an opinion is like saying the first generation of the automobile is the best because it had the most sophisticated, knowledgeable and largest financial backing behind it. Eventually, new automobile manufacturers come to the scene, making significant improvements to not only the standards but the tech. To say bitcoin will be king forever is to bury ones head in the sand. I, however, am not sure if we will prevail with a single global currency, or (what im more leaning towards) have half a dozen highly adopted global currencies. A new standard could unify the world, but it could also centralize our fears along with it. 
6	1525884898	1	No, it’s not like that at all. An automobile is static, while bitcoin is software. To say that bitcoin is “first generation” crypto currency and that other altcoins are “v2” is to *profoundly* misunderstand the entire space. I’m happy to elaborate if you don’t know what I mean. Bitcoin receives regular updates. It could easily do what Ethereum is doing, or almost any other crypto, but those changes weren’t made to bitcoin for very valid reasons. That doesn’t mean that they couldn’t be added in some form, some day. 
7	1525885393	1	But the fact that it hasn't, you just proved my point.No shit its not an automobile. It was a simple analogy, but it still holds true. While the 1910 Ford may be static, the 1911 may have had some improvements to its model. However, it is still very much a Ford. A Mercury 1911, however, could be significantly different from a Ford. I'm afraid you're taking this way too literally when this is a figurative conversation.Bitcoin minimalists view is flawed regardless of if bitcoin is an evolving, dynamic platform. Sure, it is growing and improving with time, but those daisy chain improvements can be superseded by a leap-frog in technological advancements from an alt coin achieving something beyond the capabilities of Bitcoin. The DAG, Tangle, Hashgraph, or any other variation of chaining confirmation capabilities could push well beyond bitcoins capability and they likely will.Oh, and altcoins being a V2 is exactly what they are...or at least, what they started out as. Bitcoin was the fundamental blockchain idea that sparked the revolution. *Everything* in this space is version 2.0 until proven otherwise as its own next generation.I will agree that bitcoin is probably the most well supported and secure chains there is and will be for a good long while. But, no. It simply cannot ''easily do what Ethereum is doing'' and to state this vastly overstates your understanding of this space...
8	1525888220	3	>But the fact that it hasn't, you just proved my point.Not at all... Bitcoin is essentially nuclear\-grade software. It's going to be really slow to make any changes. Ethereum's whole mantra is 'move fast and break things.'>I will agree that bitcoin is probably the most well supported and secure chains there is and will be for a good long while. But, no. It simply cannot ''easily do what Ethereum is doing'' and to state this vastly overstates your understanding of this space...Comments like this are what I meant when I said that most investors seem to not understand what they're investing in. You could literally hardfork the Bitcoin blockchain onto the Ethereum software, if there was consensus. Do you know what Ethereum is? It's just a Bitcoin fork, with a scripting language added and some algorithm tweaks. That 'virtual machine' capability was *proposed and rejected for Bitcoin.* The only reason it was done as a separate project is because people didn't want to be experimenting on the main Bitcoin chain.Have you heard of Rootstock? It's a dapp platform built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain \- except no hard fork required, and it won't clog the main chain with smart contract transactions. Nivaura? Already settled a real security, from start to finish, on the Bitcoin blockchain. You just don't hear about these companies because they didn't do an ICO, but many of them are a lot further along than anything on an altcoin network.Like I said, I hold a ton of Ethereum, and some other coins. I'm not a maximalist. But new investors don't understand that most of the "new" tech isn't really new at all. Proof of Stake predates Bitcoin. Smart Contracts were proposed for BTC first, rejected, and then Ethereum was born. DAG doesn't really work yet, and seems to give up decentralization anyway.
3	1525875160	1	Wouldn't that be the case for Ethereum maximalists too?
4	1525876409	1	Not in my opinion :) Ethereum is still an alt coin. 
5	1525878360	1	and Facebook was an alt social media site to my space.. doesn't change the fact that it was way more practical and more appealing for mass adoption.
6	1525887928	1	You're comparing cryptocurrency protocols to websites instead of other protocols like TCP/IP, though. The plausible arguments I've heard for both forms of maximalism are:* Any feature can be implemented on a Bitcoin sidechain, once they exist* Any feature can be implemented on Ethereum directly, because of Turing completenessObviously they can't _both_ take over, and it might be _neither_, but the definitive book on blockchain economics has yet to be written. We don't know if the number of viable long-term blockchains is one, many... or zero.
1	1525869297	4	no, the "very real issue" is that the crypto\~ space is strewn with manipulative marketing, pumps, and plain scams. snowden isn't deeply enough familiar with what's going on to know about that.
1	1525880242	1	It's depressing seeing honest to good coins that have existed for years, being shat on because they aren't the new hotness of the last 6 months.
1	1525880418	1	It comes from people not having diverse enough portfolios, or ways to easily buy lots of different coins. Having an exchange that offers every coin would help a lot.
1	1525885702	1	Competition is good no?
1	1525877644	1	VeChain is one of the most underrated, valuable projects out there.
0	1525845732	59	Definitely agreed that tribalism is a huge problem in crypto

1	1525892329	2	Not all heroes wear capes
0	1525847577	106	People need to have more goddamn respect for these "leakers" that put their lives at risk (quite literally, chelsea manning was facing the death penalty) in order to let us know what's really going on in the world. Snowden had to drop everything and move to russia, Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison and served out 7 years, and there are a ton of other patriots that we slander and treat like criminals. (I get leaking is bad, but at a certain point it's all you can do.)When it comes to stuff like this, I trust them. I mean hell, Snowden used to work for the CIA! These people have the inside knowledge, and the balls to say what that experience has taught them. If we were smart, we'd listen up. The (former) director of the FBI doesn't put tape over his webcam for no reason...
1	1525851019	40	I'm a whistleblower of sorts, and it's absolutely fucked my job prospects. Assange and Snowden have built platforms for themselves out of their experiences because they have something to say, but they, as well as Manning, will forever be shunned by institutions. Whistleblowing is also the death of one's career, so even without the threat of imprisonment, it's a fucking high price to pay.
2	1525852779	13	There is nothing that says you can do it without having it tied to your name. What he did on the other hand was epic. A straight finger in their face, saw the bigger picture and ignored the money. Well done.
2	1525868392	4	Yeah. The problem is that workplaces are totalitarian institutions. There is a lone dictator megalomaniac at the top, and a slew of lesser psychopaths beneath him. There is no democracy in the workplace, or in government itself; it's a top-down dictatorial hierarchy, and those kinds of people are petty and vindictive. And every organization/corporation out there has the same type of megalomaniacs and psychopaths in power and they know full well they too have things to hide, so they blacklist people at the drop of a hat.The problem is endemic to capitalism and any other competition-based system that isn't egalitarian and anarchic (in the original meaning of the word, ie "without hierarchy"). 
3	1525886336	1	There can never be true equality because people have fundamental differences which determine their capabilities and potential, resulting in different levels of competence which inevitably create a hierarchy. Life is an unfair competition with no sentiment for the individual. You cannot change that without compromising the human condition and life itself.
4	1525893186	1	I have no issue with a hierarchy based upon capabilities and potential (meritocracy), I have issue with the hierarchy of most human history that favours greedy sociopaths and the blindly obedient. 
3	1525873830	1	I agree with your point about megalomaniacs and psychopaths (being more often) in executive positions, but how would you structure an organisation otherwise? No matter if it's with or without profit, someone needs to lead and direct the whole thing.
4	1525876542	-1	Personally I'd love it if we had [prediction markets](https://hackernoon.com/corporate-prediction-markets-a-roundup-of-the-major-players-3632b5d3cf09) for _nearly everything_ and there were fewer specific humans in charge. So for example let's say everyone in town likes fireworks, so they bet that there _won't_ be fireworks tonight. Once enough money is bet against it, someone places a huge bet that there _will_ be fireworks and launches them at a profit. No need for homeowner association or town hall bureaucracy. As total transaction costs (not just monetary) go down, companies will get smaller. But I think these changes are more likely to come from smaller competitors than be embraced by big corporations whose managers might be embarrassed.
5	1525879230	1	> fewer specific humans in charge So put more power in the hands of less people? This doesn't seem to line up with the rest of your goals. > prediction marketsWhich will rapidly turn into assassination markets. > As total transaction costs (not just monetary) go down, companies will get smaller.What is your source / evidence for this? If companies spend less resources, they'll get smaller? Is that really your argument? That makes no sense.
6	1525880496	1	>> fewer **specific** humans in charge>So put more power in the hands of less people? This doesn't seem to line up with the rest of your goals.No. Put more power in the hands of more people (a market), which allows easy entry/exit; not designated managers.>> prediction markets>Which will rapidly turn into assassination markets.If you'd like we can contrast this to assassination voting, but I'm talking here about legit economic use. The link I provided is for permissioned prediction markets that shut down anything illegal, not 100% P2P prediction markets that don't exist yet.>>As total transaction costs (not just monetary) go down, companies will get smaller.>What is your source / evidence for this? If companies spend less resources, they'll get smaller? Is that really your argument? That makes no sense.I'd recommend [The Nature of the Firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm). Basically, high transaction costs (on everyone) give larger organizations an advantage (vs smaller ones) because they don't need to make those transactions internally.
7	1525882213	1	> prediction markets that shut down anything illegalthis is a really tricky definition to nail down. and even then, 100% legal use of your prediction market can still turn into an assassination market. It will be difficult to distinguish bad actors from legitimate swings in public opinion, which in the age of the internet can be rapid and without warning.> Basically, high transaction costs (on everyone) give larger organizations an advantage (vs smaller ones) because they don't need to make those transactions internally.I would still be skeptical that this will cause organizations to grow smaller. Smaller fees would simply result in lower barrier to entry, but not necessarily smaller organizations. The established larger organizations would have no pressure to decrease their size, it would only make it easier for smaller organizations to grow theirs. 
8	1525884268	1	* Here in the USA, who can buy life insurance for whom is _very_ tightly regulated. I suppose one could say that Tesla futures are _like_ an assassination market for Elon Musk, but then we're getting into a critique of markets in general.* All [transaction costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost), not just fees. If those were zero, then it would always be cheaper to contract out than to hire.
9	1525884275	2	**Transaction cost**In economics and related disciplines, a transaction cost is a cost in making any economic trade when participating in a market.In Transaction Costs, Institutions and Economic Performance (1992), Douglass C. North argues that institutions, understood as the set of rules in a society, are key in the determination of transaction costs. In this sense, institutions that facilitate low transaction costs, boost economic growth.Douglass North states that there are four factors that comprise transaction costs – "measurement," "enforcement," "ideological attitudes and perceptions," and "the size of the market." Measurement refers to the calculation of the value of all aspects of the good or service involved in the transaction.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
2	1525852954	1	I'm sure they don't care looking how much BTC they purchased back then.
1	1525850707	41	Snowden is a hero in my eyes
2	1525884583	4	Literally sacrificed his cushy, wealthy Hawaiian lifestyle for an ungrateful populous and permanent exile before turning 30; likely facing torture and a life sentence, because he thought democracy was at stake and he couldn't live with that. 99.9999% of people would never do that; myself included.Snowden is one of the most patriotic heroes in all of American history. IDGAF if most people are too stupid to see it; that fact will never change.
1	1525852457	5	I mostly agree, but being a whistleblower schouldn't automatically validate your opinion on everything."Celebrity-status" is a bad thing, also for whistleblowers.That being said, I believe he knows what he's talking about in this video.
1	1525849199	5	Thank you for speaking truth to power.
1	1525871873	1	I wont judge the moralities of these actions (there are countless arguments for each side) but it takes guts and disdain for personal harm. For that, people like you and Snowden deserve respect. To the point, yes tribalism is to ridiculous levels. It is devolving the credibility of this sub and slowly that of crypto space. Personally i' ve been consulting crypto endeavours on how to isolate shilling and tribal like behaviour and focus on the actual product (if any).  If you look at my post history you can see some tribes going wild. 
1	1525890621	1	Agreed.  I respect Snowden so much.  I couldn't do it myself because I'd be too afraid but mad respect for him.   
1	1525870768	0	'used to work for CIA'He had a hell of a lot of access for a subcontractor and got away like a smooth bond villain. Seems more like a useful idiot.

0	1525847981	21	Judging by the controversy here, we cant even agree on the fact that tribalism is retarded?
1	1525865988	6	Nope, just look the parallels with atheism. Some don't believe in organised religion, some treat atheism as a religion in itself. Get enough people together against tribalism and a subset form a tribe themselves. I'd argue that getting everyone to agree that tribalism is bad is self-defeating.
2	1525867010	5	Humans love to group up to hate things together. Human Psychology 101.
2	1525883524	2	Tribalism is in everything, period. Social Justice Warriors, politics, religion, sports, TV shows, movies, everything.It’s human nature to want to belong.The issue in crypto is that it stalls the progress in certain instances. A downside of social media is the increase of tribalism. You can find a group for anything in an instant
1	1525885753	1	You prefer a hivemind?
2	1525886469	1	Because that's the only other option?
3	1525889902	1	Obviously there will be fighting and infighting. Each of these supporters' coins is trying to survive.
0	1525856212	18	Agreed. Healthy criticism is one thing, but constantly bashing projects is another. I'm guessing it has a lot to do with the fact that a lot of younger people are involved in crypto.
1	1525866241	14	It’s literally the only thing that scares me about crypto. I believe in it as much as everyone else here but reading the daily thread in r/cryptocurrency I can’t help but think 50% of the community here is 16 or younger or 35 year olds living with their parents based off the intense downvoting of innocent comments, toxicity, and tribalism. It just makes me think, am I really investing in the same market as these people?
2	1525874898	7	I joined the Bitcoin subreddit in 2011. It had about 3,000 members. I’m absolutely astounded how far the quality has fallen in that time. I feel like I now spend all my time here correcting people who don’t even understand the basics of how this tech works :/
3	1525882124	3	When moon lambo? /s
4	1525891187	1	I came here to ask this.
2	1525878882	1	There is certainly a lot of what you describe because of the technical hurdles there are in place that prevent adoption from “non-geeks”.If and when the average person can log onto to their discount brokerage and buy a bitcoin ETF in their 401k, things will start to change.At this point, everybody is at least curious about crypto. Most just don’t have the will/ability to go through with buying some.
1	1525868529	3	People treat cryptocurrencies like they were their favorite football team or something stupid like that. And as always, people are completely fact-impervious. The most obvious example being BTC vs BCH. Few people argue about technical aspects, it's all 100% highly infected emotional high drama. 
1	1525872109	1	> Agreed. Healthy criticism is one thing, but constantly bashing projects is another. I'm guessing it has a lot to do with the fact that a lot of younger people are involved in crypto.Assuming that idiots gonna be wiser when they'll be 30-50 years old.

0	1525871576	6	It's definitely not going away anytime soon. Some people here actually enjoy the idea of other people losing money if they aren't in the same coins as them. It's unhealthy as fuck.
0	1525857416	3	the tribalism stems from conflict of interest. people shill their bags to death.
0	1525857898	9	Isn't tribalism shilling everywhere around us?* Religion* Language* Country* Culture* Skin
1	1525858964	4	It's human. We fundamentally can't help it. I mean some can but others don't because it's in our nature.
1	1525868627	2	Sure, but we make it much worse by using competition as our basic paradigm in just about all walks of life.When "everyone against everyone else" is the basic paradigm we use in the world, it's not just tribalism anymore, it's a direct incentive to treat other people like the enemy. Because in capitalism they basically are. 
0	1525870966	3	Can people stop reposting this?
0	1525877339	3	Right, if we all just bought tron we wouldn't need to have this conversation.
0	1525882018	3	Humans are hilarious.  Many young people in 2018 impress me with their ability to look past borders, lines on a map, political parties, and religions.  It's a very fair, and live-and-let-live generation.  However, then I am reminded that they just channel the same effing crazy gene as all their ancestors, via one heavy crypto bag. People get so tribal for their top coin and so angry towards their least favorite coins.  It's embarrassing and it hurts the legitimacy of the entire market.  If someone wants to make a private investment with their own money into Verge or Tron, let them.  Who cares.  If someone likes WTC over VEN, it's their money. Who cares.  Invest, get a life, and quit hating.  Do whatever you want to do and move on.
0	1525890235	3	NO YOU! TROOOOONNNNNNN!
0	1525844322	4	Everyone needs to watch this
0	1525856773	4	I love this man! Sh*tting on other projects seems like some kind of sports - scepticism is vital here, there are many scams, no no no - but the community of projects that have proved themselves shouldn't be hating on each other.
0	1525861438	2	It will never go away unless you change the DNA of humans.
1	1525868730	1	Whenever you see someone arguing that "it's human nature", it's pretty much a given they're either pushing an agenda and/or have spent about zero seconds on ever really studying and reading up on what is and is not human nature.
2	1525870706	1	Your saying tribalism isn’t part of our DNA? Ok
0	1525861786	2	2:08It's interesting that he has used both Monero and Zcash and his favourite coin is Zcash, not Monero.

0	1525868798	2	I have an axe to grind with Ripple for the fact that they dump monthly on their hodlers. I don't want hard-working people giving their cash to billionaires.That may come off as tribalism, but at the end of the day, I would hold hands with Brad Garlinghouse and sing campfire songs if they used some of their slush fund to influence some positive legislation on crypto.

1	1525872805	2	This is part of the issue... the majority of garbage products in crypto know that and try to push hard and fast.  If they can get that quick pump and dump, that's really all they were looking for to achieve that get rich quick scam.

0	1525874671	1	so he's telling me to stay away from this shill coin called Tribalism coin eh?  gotcha.   will not buy.  
0	1525876875	1	Isn't this the same guy that called Monero "amateur crypto" on Twitter, while on multiple occasions proclaiming how great Zcash is?  Seems like he isn't practicing what he preaches.
0	1525883418	1	There's a difference between tribalism and pointing out scams

1	1525857335	7	You will, one day, mature beyond this mentality of adolescent superiority, and realise how absurd it was for you to make statements like the one above.
2	1525862019	2	This just became front runner for my put down of the day; I mean, sure it's still early but looking good so far 
1	1525858625	6	This guy is someone who actually put his life at risk for the public of America. He ruined his entire comfy life so the public could know what was actually going on behind the scenes. I can't even come close to comprehending someone like myself doing that. It's clear that tribalism is a real thing in the crypto sphere, whether or not this man says so.
