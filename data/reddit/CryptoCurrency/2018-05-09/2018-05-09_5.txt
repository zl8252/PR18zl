0	1525872043	39	I wonder where they're buying from.
1	1525894837	7	Wakanda 
1	1525886556	5	OTC
1	1525886117	4	Switzerland. 🇨🇭 
1	1525897845	1	There are a couple of small local exchanges you can buy from with Iran's fiat, but mostly people walk to exchange centers and buy it from them.Exchange centers are very common and you can find 100s of them in big cities, they used to only convert fiat to fiat, now they do BTC, ETH and some others too.
0	1525866268	110	I'd buy cryptocurrencies if I was Iranian right now too considering what Trump just announced.
1	1525867387	40	I think it would be smart for most people in countries that the US sanctions to stock up on cryptocurrencies.. 
2	1525876314	9	Cryptocurrencees.

4	1525888876	3	Cripto, for all the gangsta investors out there!
5	1525889156	1	There needs to be a youtube series about this...
4	1525894115	1	Cryptocurrentseas
2	1525875989	16	Cryptocurrencies.Edit: the fucker ninja edited his typo
3	1525878110	7	this guy gets it ^
2	1525883403	-1	I think it would be smart for most people *IN* the US to buy cryptocurrencies the way this president\* is playing fast\-and\-loose with our economy.
3	1525888362	0	Im a fan of trump in that he seems intent on making the US less relevant to the rest of us.Ofc I know there are a lot of decent Americans  , it feels like they're in the minority sometimes though .
1	1525877948	1	What did he annnounce 
2	1525878137	2	uhm, did...did you hear about that iran nuclear deal mumbo jumbo? that's what's being referred to here. 
3	1525879078	15	Nope I don’t watch the news I’m super uninformed with that kind of stuff 
4	1525893298	2	Dude I wish I could do the same, im almost addicted to the news. I love it, but at the same time I would prefer if i didn't. The world goes one with or without you knowing. 
4	1525879690	-2	Badically Trump backed out of a Nuclear deal with Iran thats been worked on for the better part of a decade and threatened them with more sanctions. Pretty much left every party (UK, France, Germany, Russia and China) involved standing there dumbfounded wondering what the fuck just happened.More sanctions for Iran however will impact their economy but crypto is a way to get around economic sanctions imposed by the US. So if you are Iranian, wealthy and believe in Crypto then putting some of your wealth in crypto is a solid idea. Its also great for moving money across borders circumventing US sanctions.
5	1525883377	29	Dumbfounded? He's been openly talking about how terrible the nuclear deal was ever since it was put in place. It's been one of his main campaign points. But it's probably dumbfounding to politicians to see one actually attempt to fulfill his campaign promises, whatever you might think of the guy.
6	1525884431	-3	Dumbfounded because it's difficult to imagine any benefit to taking those actions.   Seems just kind of like a "undo everything Obama" action with no intelligent thought behind it.Like if someone has been shouting that he'll hit himself in the dick with a hammer.... It's still kind of surprising when he actually does it.
7	1525884976	19	It was a stupid deal.It's like paying someone not to share your naked pictures. They'll have a blackmail opportunity against you forever. The world's most powerful nation paying another nation billions not to develop nuclear capability. It both diminishes US status and it funnels money to a country that might eventually spend it on nuclear capability anyways and you're never 100% sure that testing ends anyways, as they might continue in secret.I would say there are plenty of intelligent reasons to end that blackmail deal.
8	1525894655	2	Btw this happened to north korea, we paid them to not make nukes then found out they were making nukes anyways.  Im glad Trump pulled us out of this horrible deal.
8	1525886664	7	More accurately, it would be like allowing someone access to their money, and paying them back money you owed them, in exchange for them not to share your naked pictures, with an incredibly easy way to make that money effectively worthless if they don't hold up their end of the bargain, thus incentivising them to follow through.  It wasn't a perfect deal, but not for the reason you're implying, and certainly not to the point of being bad or stupid. 
9	1525891395	1	here's the correct answer. 
8	1525888527	0	Erm , American companies will suffer from the sanctions too .You weren't paying Iran, just allowing for us companies to do business with them , and buy their oil .Boeing had a huge deal with Iranian oil companies , now they're a bit fucked .
9	1525889386	2	If it is a mutually beneficial trade without the nuclear component, then there would be no reason not to continue them.But that's not exactly the case, is it?
8	1525889285	1	> The world's most powerful nation paying another nation *Trading*... And why wouldn't we want to open up trade there? 80 million people, largely middle-class and educated and wanting to buy Western goods. We were going to make bank from this deal.
9	1525889714	-1	Funny how people cheer for EU trying to make trade with United Kingdom harder when they don't comply with every minutious detail of European Union directives, but when it comes to the milquetoast iran deal (where iran really was barely bringing anything to the table) people want the trade to continue for trade's sake.I'm generally for more trade, but you have to be careful into who's pockets you are putting money.And you know it is serving Iran's financial interests more than the US's financial interest, or Iran wouldn't have had to agree to things in return.
7	1525885692	8	Obama couldn't even get the senate to agree on this, hence why it was so easy for him to rip to shreads in the first place.It was a bad deal. Another deal (similar to paris climate agreement) where we give loads and loads of money, and say "now promise you won't do this" but they were very obviously going to do it anyway. Now they just won't have our money to help them.Their "congress" literally burned american flags and chanted "Death to America" after yesterday's announcement - what wonderful people we were giving a bunch of fucking money to! Do you think reasonable people would react like that? If they were as moderate as Obama claimed, they would have behaved in a way which showed us they were serious about what they were doing. Instead they did chanted death to america, and promised to fund terrorism (but they were doing that anyway so it's not like they changed their policy)
8	1525887930	5	Every society has its extremists. The vast majority, like everywhere else, are moderate.Source: I'm half Iranian.
9	1525893723	1	Salam bruh
8	1525886611	3	[deleted]
9	1525887480	1	do your own research dumb ass
9	1525886881	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu-cash1ypUComment deletion incoming.
8	1525887715	1	Maybe you should wonder why the american flag is a symbol of oppression in half the world. 
9	1525888672	5	Anyone that thinks letting Iran continue their nuclear and ICBM programs is ok is crazy. If we left the middle east they would kill every Jewish man, woman and child in Israel.
8	1525892605	1	Your comment is really ignorant in so many ways. And even if we take into perspective what you wrote, the first country you (usa) should oppose is Saudi arabia which is trully funding terrorism and was the main suspect behind 9/11. But i guess that's not happening any time soon huh
7	1525885753	2	Most people that have strong opinions on it have never even looked into it or bothered to look up why anyone would think it's a shitty deal. But if Trump does something, they'll automatically hate it.From the little I've bothered to look into it myself, it did seem like a pretty shitty deal for US taxpayers that guarantees very little in genuine oversight.
7	1525896832	1	Yeah he really hates Obamalike, get over it bro
7	1525886830	-3	There is this "undo everything Obama did" mentality, but I think it's more about "do whatever Putin says", because pee pee tape.
8	1525888706	3	Imagine being this dumb

8	1525890849	0	Fine by me. Oh and Muller still hasnt found jack and shit, a waste of time.
9	1525892502	2	Then why have two people pled guilty?
6	1525887491	-3	Trump is dumb puppet of Neo\-cons looking for their next war treasures. He's playing right into the hands of Saudi Arabia like a good pet. He's a moron and his supporters blindly following him are even bigger morons.
7	1525891781	3	I agree. All presidents are puppets. And that I'm glad Trump is in office over Clinton says a lot about how I think of her. Learned too much of her history in politics and the Clinton foundation to ever want to see her in such a position of power, and that was before all the recent scandals. The only sane choice at the end was Sanders, but the US wasn't ready for a socialist in office :) Didn't help that the DNC was cought sabotaging his campaign in favor of Clinton either. Or feeding her questions of the debate against Trump.Yeah Trump lost a lot of support from his own supporters over his foreign policy specifically in the middle-East. He ran on a strong non-interventionalist platform in the ME, as opposed to Clinton. Not to mention Clinton's incredibly divisive platform. Demonizing half the countries supporters of which many previously voted for Obama. It was funny that Trump, a lifetime democrat and Clinton supporter in the past, ran as a republican against Clinton :DI wouldn't call Trumps supporters morons though. Nor would I call the blind Clinton supporters morons. Opinions and priorities can differ, and further polarizing society helps noone. Although I do find it an interesting shift that these days it's the right/conservatives promoting liberal ideas, open debate and free speech, and the left seems to be pushing for regressive ideas like extreme poltical correctness, identity politics, and censorship of differing opinions. Not to mention calling everyone who disagrees with them stupid. That doesn't help. It seems most of the violence comes from the left these days too. Violent groups like Antifa and BLM were even protected by the mainstream media and kept out of the news. Fast forward to today where they are now being seen as domestic terrorist groups after shit keeps getting out of control.Hell ... even the youth is increasingly turning more right leaning/conservative. (although I think the left has just gone way too far left that right is the new center) Seems like a logical reaction to things going way too far left for a long time, and it clearly hasn't made the US or the world a better place.I'm a European but fascinated by US politics :)
5	1525895537	1	Do you actually have any idea what you're talking about or are you just another blind liberal trump hater? I can tell you clearly have no idea the damage this deal did and why we backed out of it.
6	1525896865	1	Im not American so no I dont give a flying fuck about Trump, his supporters or his political competition, the liberal agenda, being a hater or what this deal does for the US. I didn't say anything positive or negative about it at all just the facts. Trump killed the deal, UK, France, Germany went along the lines of "huh its like that bro?".
4	1525893823	0	You should probably start informing yourself. 
1	1525892019	1	You can't really buy it though, since government blocks credit card and bank transfers out of the country.
1	1525867602	-2	Exactly 
0	1525885895	9	Is there any left to buy after Wall Street bonuses? /s
0	1525875942	49	haram if true 
1	1525876264	29	Axshully; crypto currencies were recently deemed halal. 
2	1525876310	32	big if halal
2	1525885021	2	They overturned the previous pronoumcement?
1	1525891436	3	They made crypto halal few months ago ;)
1	1525876740	8	Cryptocurrencies are 100&#37; halal than any other currency like dollar and euro are haram because they are created from nothing and controlled by jews to wage war and slavery 
2	1525894353	1	Just because interests. 
2	1525889360	0	That is the most retarded comment ever.
3	1525890344	6	Both of these comments are fucking hilarious
1	1525893628	2	they better go Allahu! (all in!) before it moons
1	1525879524	3	Shalom
0	1525864533	19	Didn't think there would be much whales in Iran.
1	1525865840	23	They should be called sturgeons
1	1525870377	3	Lol
0	1525865602	30	lmaooooooooothese "bullish" posts man
1	1525867624	-19	Get off your high horse bro. 
2	1525869018	21	But CryptoGod, don't you agree the general consensus is a little over optimistic over here? Billions of Dollars worth? This is just stupid.
3	1525894490	1	You could read the article before commenting...
4	1525894921	1	An article that doesn't mention sources isn't  to be called an article. It's trash. Anyway, that statement alone should allow you to deduct I actually read it.
5	1525896504	1	its "deduce" bro
6	1525898022	1	I don't think your control of your 2nd language is better than my 3rd (English) but thank you for your in-depth response.
3	1525869161	-11	I mean the article is simply stating facts it’s how you interpret it. If they are truly buying billions worth of crypto then so what? 
4	1525869916	21	Sensational journalism is just bad business (MORE WHALES ARE COMING!!!!). The fact that the author does not even bother to give sources for these statements (fact checking) does not make things better.
5	1525870033	-13	I can agree with that. I would like to see sources as well. However there is nothing wrong with reporting facts if they are in fact true. 
6	1525878232	5	facts - point us to them, please?!
6	1525890370	2	Uh
7	1525890758	0	Uh what

0	1525882807	3	This is part of how I know that crypto has a future, despite what the FUD says about it all being a worthless fad.Darknet stuff and governments of heavily sanctioned/rogue countries who want independent cash will be there--North Korea is possibly one of the world's biggest holders of BTC and ETH right now.  People in 3rd world countries who need a more stable currency than their nation's highly inflationary fiat junk will be there.  People doing international business want a faster and cheaper way to transact currency across international boundaries.  Now the big banking and capital firms are trying to take advantage and build their own industry around it.Even if it BTC itself drops like a rock and sends the market into a panic, crypto itself will live on long-term.  You just have to hang on, don't put everything in one basket, don't go into debt to buy it, and don't sink your life's savings into it.  Buy the dips.  We're still in the early adoption phase here.
0	1525872303	10	This is bs
0	1525889695	2	The fact that all these millionaires/billionaires are buying so much bitcoin etc and yet the price doesnt move makes me pretty uneasy
1	1525895734	1	I know you probably have to come to expect seeing huge buys are coming meaning the price is going to moon, but that's not the way it works with large whales. They don't buy like retailers, flooding the exchange with bids driving the price sky high. They buy OTC. 
0	1525877210	1	I am seeing some Iranian export companies adopting cryptocurrency such as this [zinc export import company](https://www.exportid.com/index.html?id=44232&name=hamid_zendeh_del)
0	1525888191	1	Nice! Trending news in /r/CryptoCurrency is actually a buy signal, better than CNBC
0	1525888335	1	Then why the fuck is my portfolio going down. Maybe they are investing only in the sheckel coin?
0	1525889300	1	Their fiat currency has gone to shit
0	1525889355	1	The real question is : Can you eat this stuff?
0	1525891995	1	Now every major banks are trying to get into crpyto, what does that mean for crpyto price? More stable or more trading(ups and downs)
0	1525893676	1	Well... Iran might see some serious hard times in the future if other nations jump on trumps sanctions! 
0	1525893937	1	They have a) high rate of inflation currently and b) a constantly depreciating currency (esp when compared to USD). It most likely will get worse too. It only makes sense they'd be buying cryptocurrencies as they can get around capital controls. Iran skews young and the young are more pro-western and technologically savvy than the average person gives them credit for. 
0	1525894046	1	Of course there would be a thread about Iran today in the cryptocurrency subreddit. Of course discourse would turn political. Of course this thread would turn cancerous.Any other “credible” sources for this need?
0	1525894174	1	no shit
0	1525895088	1	OTC from where? There still has to be a seller?
0	1525896918	1	I already sold my prl at a discount because I am a kind person
0	1525874186	0	Thats not good news.
1	1525877339	3	Considering the reason would be to circumvent sanctions, it could lead to regulation, criminalzation, NSA transaction monitoring and all sorts of other 'not good' things.
2	1525877567	2	Exactly.
1	1525888236	-2	THIS need to be upvoted more. People are dumb and don't realize that this is the fastest way to convince the public that Cryptos are evil and need to be banned. 
2	1525893884	1	Right, because everyone in Iran is a criminal who doesn't deserve democratized access to financial instruments./s
0	1525872836	1	Well crypto isn't haram at all is it
1	1525876819	-2	>Cryptocurrencies are 100&#37; halal any other currency like dollar and euro are haram because they are created from nothing and controlled by jews to wage war and slavery
0	1525883156	1	Hope Trump sanctions them!
1	1525888179	1	If the EU do not pull out will the US sanction the EU :-)
0	1525874805	-4	If all jihadis start dealing in crypto that would make the world a better place  .... because they will get a new infatuation to focus on  rather than 72 virgins ... namely when moon.
1	1525879423	-4	I dont know why anyone would downvote this.
2	1525879813	4	Iran doesn't equal "jihadist"
3	1525879902	-4	Where did he equate one to the other, he just mentioned jihadis buying crypto as a seperate thing...
1	1525880571	-1	and when it goes down it would make them even more suicidal
2	1525880909	-4	loool...That's what I was thinking also. 
0	1525878298	-2	You don’t want a tyrannical regime getting involved. 
1	1525885273	3	That is the drawback of decentralized currency- it doesn't matter what you think, it is true neutral; from pedophiles, jihadis, North Korea, ordinary people, US gov't workers all can have cryptos. You cannot discriminate, or you violate the principle of free trade and if don't like where free trade gets you, you're better off with your Freedom Bucks.
0	1525885551	-3	A nation that stones women to death and throws homosexuals off of rooftops whilst being the largest state sponsor of terrorism doesn't deserve any celebration or support.
1	1525888842	-1	How the fuck is anyone downvoting this? Are there people on this sub FOR stoning women and gays?
0	1525876577	0	doesnt look like its doing much...
1	1525883608	1	There just waiting for their bank transfers to go through theyll be here in a few days /s obviously
0	1525881609	0	they should buy substratum
1	1525888056	3	Why?
2	1525888748	1	they can access facebook and other state-banned websites. also they will earn higher hosting payments since they aare hosting in a censored country
0	1525882892	0	They aren't buying them through exchanges though, they are probably buying them OTC in bulk.  Meaning the only way they can affect the market is by selling 😜
1	1525888129	1	Not everyone will buy OTC, could you imagine $500 OTC
0	1525886367	0	Bullshit, if they were buying billions in bitcoin right now the prices would be increasing.
0	1525885921	-2	Currently cryptocurrencies are banned in Iran.  This is wonderful shilling. 
0	1525863248	-16	[removed]
1	1525884824	5	I trust Iran more than the US.
2	1525890040	-1	Then you're certifiably insane.
1	1525863420	2	[deleted]
2	1525865579	-1	Was that a nuke?
1	1525865368	1	Saw this coming a mile away.
0	1525884966	-1	Maybe they're the ones buying that hot new BCN coin?? Iran mooning in no time!
0	1525874948	-3	huge, if true
1	1525879367	2	Dead if horse.
0	1525887939	-5	I don't think there are a lot of whales in Iran....
