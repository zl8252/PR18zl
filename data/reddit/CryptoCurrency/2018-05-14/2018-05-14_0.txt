0	1526281531	95	Lately, a Big bank in Israel lost in a lawsuit involving crypto( he refused to accept the payments due to the fact that the company gets it in crypto) The fact that they lost makes me happy, but It implies what the banks think about this " revolution"
1	1526289576	17	>  but It implies what the banks think about this " revolution"There is, and will always be those who cannot see the use in new technology before they actually try it. There's a lot of banks pro-crypto, but you don't see them mentioned here, do you? Didn't I see a post where $360b+ was being invested from banks or something? That's all forgotten already?
2	1526304624	7	But blockchain is enormously beneficial to banks for auditing and security, not because they want to start stocking up on Bitcoin and Ethereum. This has no effect on the value of other cryptocurrencies.
2	1526311853	3	investing in blockchain is not the same as buying btc and driving the price up, lol.  These banks will use blockchain but will be creating their own.
3	1526313897	1	I do not see the reasoning behind this statement. Why would bank A trust bank B's product? It is more reasonable that the two banks agrees on an already existing product issued by a third party, and develops this to further improve their systems. In the case of Ripple, the product is xCurrent/xRapid/xVia (or even interledger protocol). I sincerely doubt any coin being created for this purpose today will stand a chance against XRP or XLM. Maybe if IOTA has something in development, they could be a third competitor, as their network is free to use, and scales pretty well.
4	1526314429	1	Well they sure as shit aren't going to be using a highly volatile, highly speculated on token/coin to move funds around, you gotta be stump dumb to buy that line of bullshit xrp shills are pushing.
5	1526314651	1	The only reason it's so volatile is due to the market being infantile. Stability will come with maturity.
6	1526314780	1	Not the kinda stability banks will be looking for in a blockchain coin/token for their use case.  Tether is probably too volatile, if you want a current example, and that shit stays very close to 1 almost all the time.
2	1526310118	1	So if banks buy* crypto behind the scenes that means they are friendly to us? That's not a good line of thinking 💭, considering how often we've been lied to by banks. (Edit spelling)
2	1526312148	1	Don’t see them mentioned? There are threads every day that make it seem like banks are going all in. Circlejerk at this point. I’m a strong believer in the tech, and change is coming, but I don’t have high hopes for 2018 
3	1526314094	1	Fundamental work is being done, tests and pilots are being completed, and crypto becomes less distant to the average person every day. Maybe not 2018, but I believe we are still in the beginning of a very long and eventful journey. 
4	1526314147	1	I agree
2	1526300453	1	exactly what perpetual motion machine 'inventors' crap on about
1	1526282162	1	And the court ordered it to rectify 
2	1526282461	18	https://news.bitcoin.com/israeli-bitcoin-mining-company-sues-bank-for-closing-its-account/
3	1526283122	5	Justice is served
1	1526282103	-1	What is the name of the bank and how I never heard of it? :0
2	1526283270	7	Union Bank. Not sure how you never heard of it.
3	1526294038	1	Wasn't that Prescott Bush's bank?
4	1526296171	2	When ever I see Bush I see a red flag
5	1526300950	6	Or False flag
6	1526300996	2	Hahaha, true
5	1526300962	3	Than you'll love Prescott Bush. He traded with the Nazis even after the US declared war
0	1526285400	66	If you think the manipulation and cynicism that pervades the crypto markets right now is bad. Just wait until these assholes sink their teeth into this shitshow.
1	1526307050	12	I take a somewhat more optimistic view, and see blockchain like the internet.In the early days, it was the wild west.  Anything went, which was both fun, for tech enthusiast, but also intimidating for someone who didn't understand what was happening.Then the internet got popular and the facebooks, instagrams and reddits moved in, and made things easier to access and safer for the average person.   This made things **better**.  The world does match what the dream was way back in the early 90s, and a lot of that is due to the fact that people could build things without fear of losing their shirt.  And the wild west still exists.  You don't need to stay in the safe areas, if you don't want to.  I think that blockchain will follow the same path:  as it gets safer, it will get more useful, but there will still be a frontier if that's more your speed.
2	1526311837	3	Corporate interests successfully undermined net neutrality through regulatory capture. Internet isn't the best example. Big business entered a level playing field and made it favor them, just like they do with everything else. 
3	1526314016	6	I'm not saying that there shouldn't be any checks and balances on big companies, I'm saying that thinking big companies having no role in the future ecosystem limits what the world could become.I was a cyberanarchist in the earliest days of the web, thinking we could rebuild everything, but as I've gotten older, I realized that not every improvement can start at the grassroots.  You need funding and interconnectivity with existing systems to improve on.  You need infrastructure.  Blockchain is no exception to that.  The trick is striking a balance.
4	1526315637	0	The trick is decentralization. We don't need most of these companies anymore. They're only relevant today because they were useful at some point and gained a massive advantage. Social classes need to converge and wealth gaps need to close, and they will always stand in the way of that. We are capable of creating a system that doesn't require them. Looks like you were right about the internet but not the timeline. 
2	1526314153	1	The internet analogy is used a lot and it initially beings me optimism but then I remember how dystopian things have become.  Making a fast buck aside, we may not likewhat we see in 10 years if crypto continues to flourish.  
3	1526317102	2	Your children's children may one day rage against the creation of blockchain tech as a nightmarish totalitarian immutable record –used by corrupt banks and their massive global military, surveillance, and prison systems– of their inevitable mistakes in life that follows them like an unshakeable curse from cradle to grave.It is written precisely nowhere that this technology must be used for purposes of human liberation and happiness. And the Goldman Sachs's and Morgans Stanleys of the world are here to make sure it never will be.Blockchain: the strongest bars to your cage ever built.
1	1526291663	13	yeah, it's going to change the crypto landscape quite a bit and I'm not sure we are going to like it. Then again, I won't care by then because I'll be on my moon....
2	1526316207	2	Yes. Not just THE moon anymore...Now you have YOUR OWN moon.
1	1526314795	1	Does a bear shit in the woods, and does a Catholic priest shit on the hopes and dreams of little children?
1	1526314815	1	They are going to attempt to inside trade but will soon realize what happens when you short a global and deflationary currency. I now LOVE first inflation since that too will only increase Bitcoin's price. 
0	1526291856	60	“Save them from financial crisis” does not sound good at all. It means that they are seeing ways in which they can continue to make enormous profits even if everything else around them crumbles.
1	1526294867	16	Oh good, just like last time. =|
2	1526301647	13	What if Satoshi's wallet is the bailout?
1	1526305758	6	Aren’t we all?
1	1526318683	1	It's worse than that... It means they're WILLING to make things collapse to benefit themselves further. I'll go further and say that they will intentionally collapse the dollar if it benefits them to do (which it would under certain circumstances).I do worry sometimes what would happen if the USD - as an example - was intentionally inflated to practically 0 value.
1	1526311797	1	Banks going under is what makes a bad market worse. It’s good to have banks not go under. 
2	1526313399	0	Cool so let's just hand them all our money.
3	1526315584	2	Well I didn’t say that, but if banks can save money using crypto while inflating prices for you and me, why be opposed?

0	1526297461	40	Banks being "pro crypto" is just another way of saying "we will hire our own team of blockchain experts and develop our own way to improve our systems" it doesn't necessarily mean they're will adopt Btc/eth/nano etc
1	1526301898	13	And that's fine. 
2	1526307692	3	Better than outright bashing everything crypto related, if it's centrally regulated after it's publicly adopted then at least we'll have more chance for a "revolution" and satoshis dream of decentralized currency can have a chance of becoming a reality
1	1526308678	0	There's only one token I can think of 
2	1526311944	0	nope.  at best theyll use ripples protocol, xrp is a diff thing.
3	1526316470	0	XRP is different but there's a protocol that takes specific advantage of it to increase profitability and settlement speeds, xRapid.  So it would make sense that if you use Ripple protocol, you might as well take full advantage of it and use XRP.
4	1526319036	1	Why wouldn't a bank just develop their own.... I have yet to hear a coherent counter argument to the major issue here, which is a volatile highly speculative asset is about the worst possible thing to use for value transfer in a bank system, you want that shit flat as a pancake so the value doesn't change on you.
0	1526280614	26	I wish that old system will be replaced... but I think it will take ages. How they will make their money without those fees:/
1	1526296247	37	Bitcoin has far higher fees than a credit card
2	1526307703	4	Please use the worst coin as an example.
3	1526308104	4	>Please use the most popular, most used, most famous coin as an example.
4	1526308914	3	Still takes education to wake people up.  Yahoo used to be the most used engine.
5	1526311991	0	no ones dethroning btc, deal with it
6	1526312297	1	You really believe that? Curious, which industry leads you to believe that the biggest stays the biggest?  Remember, it has to be an industry.
7	1526313156	0	microsoft.  Plus, almost all cryptos are essentially a copy/paste of btc, it's pretty unique in the sense that it IS the tech, it was the birth of it.  It's not like the internet or email which were techs developed and then companies started utilizing them.
8	1526313450	1	Are you referring to microsoft, who toppled IBM(bitcoin)?It's more like email when it cost money per month just to send emails, until a free one came out.
9	1526313532	2	Are you ignoring all the points I made after that...?I'm not a btc fanboy I like other cryptos but you gotta be delusional to think btc is going anywhere anytime soon, like those ETH fanboys parroting "the flippening" annoyingly every 3 seconds who then got rekt.
2	1526298097	9	Wrong sub buddy. No rational takes or criticism allowed here.
3	1526301841	11	This is r/cryptocurrency not r/Bitcoin
4	1526304230	3	Bitcoin is a ledger-based electronic asset.  Credit cards are the payment end of a lending platform.  Very different beasts.   Credit cards have higher fees in aggregate due to interest on credit generated across all users, but we should expect that - borrowing money should be more expensive than using money that is already yours.Anyway, fees may be comparable now, but when second-layer scaling solutions are live and stable (1-2 years) it won't even be close.
5	1526304591	2	Bitcoin and most crypto are just alternatives to debit cards basically.I don't think theres any credit card type product yet which I see banks bringing to the table since theres a whole real world enforcement aspect required for very short term loans like credit cards to actually work.
1	1526294061	9	Simple! They will keep charging customers the same fees while keeping the difference they save from using cryptocurrency! It's a win-win for investors and banks, the only loser is the consumer. 
2	1526295856	-1	Customers no longer have to keep using banks. 
3	1526296311	7	What’s crypto’solution for safe storage?Do people really want to carry their net worth in their house/phone?
4	1526298253	-2	Hardware or paper storage for savings account, balance on phone for checking account. I've had zero problems with this arrangement. It's pretty easy desu
5	1526299034	4	But now you are doing a bankworkers job. You pay fee's to your bank to let them handle it.
4	1526296429	-7	Yet again, simply remembering ur private key!EDIT: FML this sub is epic.... By remembering your private key, you have a non\-physical trustless store of value, tell me one other way you could achieve that?If you store ur priv key somewhere, you will also have to remember where u stored it, so any argument against remembering the private key instead of storing a them physically somewhere is invalid.Also any argument against tortue is invalid too, for the same reason and also because you could create multisig wallets and remember enough of the priv keys, so that you need only one from a bunch of people you trust, and you can also make sure that those people all together can not steal from you´!
5	1526297953	8	so essentially storing your money under your mattress but even more exposed
6	1526304057	1	"even more exposed"you gonna have to be paranoid afxD please tell me how that is "more exposed"
7	1526304334	1	You can forget your keys, I mean I guess you can forget you put the money under the mattress, but a 24 word pass phrase is harder to remember 
8	1526305221	1	Remembering a 24 word pass phrase should be easy to remember.Just because you cant remember it, does not mean that other people are unable to do so too,but yeah if you don't think you are able to do that, you should probably use another way to store it\(, or try to improve ur ability to remember it\).Also it might be harder than remembering where you stored them, but it is way more secure.Also no one said that you should derive the priv key\(s\) from a 24 word  pass phrase, you can simply generate a priv key randomly and remember it the way you like, or use a \(secure\) way to derive a private key from any other information you remember.
5	1526298619	6	I've never forgotten anything before.
5	1526304564	2	> create multisig wallets and remember enough of the priv keys, so that you need only one from a bunch of people you trustMy friend died, I lost all my money.  Yeah much better than a bank 
6	1526304992	1	Yeah, sorry but seriously, I am pretty sure you are either a troll or dumb.I did not say that you need to create a multisig wallet, but that would be an option if you do not trust yourself enough.Also I said a bunch of people, and the probabilty that all of them die at the same time is pretty low.If you want the maximum security without relying on anyone else, like I already said, simply remember your private key.But you are obviously misunderstanding it, maybe on purpose.
7	1526305246	1	yes remember you private key, so when someone sticks you up you lose your net worth. Yes I'm sure millionaires are just waiting to store their money in this fashion.I can't tell if you're just delusional about security or if you're just so poor that losing all your money won't mean much to you.
1	1526316672	1	Banks make plenty of money off of interchange and interest differences from deposits.  Fees just increase profitability; banks could 100% survive without them.  But they saw large banks pull it off and not lose customers, so everyone else followed suit.  The biggest factor with fees sticking around and increasing is that there's almost nothing a bank can do that will lead to mass amounts of customers leaving for someone else, i.e. the fact that Wells Fargo still exists.
1	1526301545	0	The current system is really fast already. The only advantages of using a distributed ledger for inter-bank transactions are:-	security (not a big concern from what I understand)-	cross-border payments would be much fasterIt's not worth the hassle. If anyone has another reason I'd be interested to hear it
2	1526312073	2	"really fast", waiting days for a check to clear.  Pick one.
3	1526315888	1	From someone working at a bank, there's reasons for that other than what you perceive from the outside.EFT's and wires are what you're looking for to compare to crypto payment solutions, and they could technically be faster, but computing power and security aren't free (even when the sending service is).
0	1526307737	5	Uhhhh no. A revolution would be if people were using crypto _without_ the approval or support of these guys. What you're seeing here is a bank working to regain control over a system. 
0	1526305625	14	This is why I invest in XRP.
1	1526312107	1	banks won't be using xrp, at best they'll rip off the ripple protocol and setup their own internal blockchains.  
2	1526316824	2	Pretty sure the Ripple protocol would be protected by copyright or IP laws. I can't imagine a company based around a protocol not protecting it.
3	1526318947	1	Then the banks will throw money at ripple to use it, you get my point...
2	1526317073	2	But we won't buy into jpMorgan coin... Or Barclays coin... They have shown their true colours now let crypto$ show ours!
3	1526318916	1	They won't be public.... think you guys are having a disconnect with the actual use case for blockchain with banks

0	1526308664	3	As pointed out above, the articles authors are missing that Morgan Stanley is talking about cryptocurrencies issued and backed by governments and central banks. It's referring to E-Fiat rather than BTC, ETH, etc.
0	1526308909	3	For those of you in front of the paywall:LONDON — Central banks could use cryptocurrencies to allow them to aggressively cut interest rates in the future, mitigating the impacts of any future financial crisis.That's according to a new report from Morgan Stanley, which dissects the possible central bank applications for digital currencies in future.A Morgan Stanley team led by strategist Sheena Shah identified several areas of possible central bank use for crypto, but made clear that their research was "not intended to suggest where we think a digital fiat currency could be implemented or all the reasons why."Perhaps the most eye\-catching potential application is in the area of monetary policy, where Morgan Stanley argues that digital currencies could allow central banks to take interest rates into deeper negative territory than ever before should they need to in the event of a major financial crisis.During the last crisis, global central banks cut interest rates aggressively to protect consumers and lenders from the worst impacts of that crisis, with a handful of central banks in the likes of Sweden, Denmark, Japan, and the eurozone, plunging rates into negative territory. Negative rates remain in numerous states, although no central bank has cut rates below \-0.5&#37;.Several European countries have rates in negative territory already. Morgan StanleyDigital currencies could change that, Shah and her team suggest, saying that: "Theoretically, a monetary system that is 100&#37; digital may enable deeper negative rates.""This appeals to certain central banks," the team continues."Freely circulating paper notes and coins \(cash\) limits the ability of the central banks to force negative deposit rates. A digital version of cash could theoretically allow negative deposit rates to be charged on all money in circulation within any economy."Such an idea could be a major reassurance for central banks, with UBS Investment Bank arguing late in 2017 that when the next financial crisis hits, rates in major economies could be forced to drop as low as \-5&#37; to mitigate its impacts. Using traditional monetary policy tools to do so would be virtually impossible, but the advent of central bank digital currencies may provide an outlet for such a possibility.Of course, as with any experimental idea, there are potential drawbacks, with Morgan Stanley saying that "deep and long\-standing negative rates eventually are problematic for banks.""Central banks would then have to go direct to currency users to implement monetary policy, reducing leverage in the system significantly and cutting GDP growth."Central bank interest in the crypto space has increased significantly over the last 18 months or so, with the likes of the Bank of England setting up specifically focused task forces to examine the benefits of digital currencies. In Sweden, the Riksbank is considering the introduction of its own digital currency, the eKrona.Some central bankers are more sceptical. Last year, for example, Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany's Bundesbank warned that digital currencies like bitcoin have the potential to make financial crises in the future even more devastating.Weidmann said he believes that central banks will eventually create their own digital currencies to reassure average citizens that such currencies are safe and stable, but in doing so could increase the risk of bank runs in future crises.

1	1526295886	5	I swear, I see this comment everywhere.  Is this the crypto equivalent of yelling 'WORLDSTAR'?
2	1526307613	4	Except it has utility. 
3	1526308169	5	It was the only crypto I invested in.  I’m glad now. 
2	1526296199	-6	No, Just getting everyone used to seeing it :^)
1	1526308232	0	When banks are talking about crypto it means that they are talking about Ripple and XRP and nothing more. #XRPTHESTANDARD
1	1526298125	-10	I thought so too, until I listened to the latest episode of Unchained, where they discuss Ripple & XRP, 'partnerships' and banks using crypto for cross-border money transfer. TL;DR: Get out while you can. 
2	1526298588	12	They have close to 200 partnerships with banks and FIs...they have so many they only announce every 100 milestone now.  xRapid is about to go live.  Yeah, get out while you can - if you hate making money.  
3	1526300411	-3	And that's impressive, but they almost bribe their way into some of those partnerships, as they did with R3 when they offered them a option to buy XRP at under a penny. The partnerships is what I genuinely like about XRP but if you listen to the Unchained episode it's pretty clear that Ripple employ very questionable tactics in order to obtain these partnerships - such as the R3 option. 
4	1526301435	5	What would Ripple bribe Santander, Amerian Express, Western Union, Bank of England and Moneygram with? I don't really follow the logic here. 
5	1526302093	2	Options to buy XRP. They offered R3 an option to buy Ripple at under a penny, in 2016. Time passed and as the price of Ripple skyrocketed, Ripple nullified the option contract with R3, as that very same option now represented some 10% of all XRP, worth billions of dollars. I *highly* suggest reading [this Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-25/ripple-wants-xrp-to-be-bitcoin-for-banks-if-only-the-banks-wanted-it), it really puts the partnerships with banks in a new perspective. 
6	1526305150	8	I read it, but it's simply inaccurate - partly due perhaps to developments that have happened since January (when the article was released), but mostly due to the fact that it doesn't understand the underlying technology of Ripple Labs.> The problem is that banks say they have no interest in using XRP. This is not true.  xRapid (which uses XRP) is being piloted by many banks (remember, it's still in beta).   Heck, they [just released results of tests that showed remittances were settled in 2 to 3 minutes](https://themerkle.com/ripple-releases-first-pilot-results-for-xrapid-and-they-are-impressive/) (including local payment rails, not just XRP ledger) rather than 2 to 3 days.  xCurrent cannot settle in that fast a time (it's described as "intraday", not a few minutes), nor will it do away with nostro accounts AND it's a good 30% more expensive than xRapid. The article does not mention xCurrent nor xRapid ONCE - not ONCE.  It's a fluff piece that doesn't even pretend to understand the tech Ripple are using. The article does not mention anything about bribes.  I mean, either xRapid actually saves banks time and money or it doesn't.  Either:-- xRapid cannot save banks time and money, therefore you might have a point that Ripple need to bribe banks in order to use their useless techOR- xRapid actually does what it says it can do - [tests show it can](https://themerkle.com/ripple-releases-first-pilot-results-for-xrapid-and-they-are-impressive/) - and therefore Ripple do not need to bribe banks (which would surely jeopardise their entire venture if they did such underhand - perhaps *illegal* - tacticsBy the way, Ripple are in talks with 40 to 50 **central banks**.  I think they'll be fine.
7	1526305604	-2	It's being piloted, which is a long way from adoption. It's an impressive feat, no doubt, but there are still questions to be answered. >XRP has fallen 55 percent from $2.92 in early January. Swift’s Newman says such volatility is bound to turn off bankers and their clients. “If the value of a cryptocurrency is going up and down like a yo-yo, this isn’t a serious medium of exchange,” he says. “It adds unnecessary complexity. The solution is worse than the problem.”No bank is going to completely overhaul one of their biggest and most profitable businesses (cross-border payments), substantially reduce profits by using XRP and replace a stable fiat currency with a cryptocurrency that oscillates up to 10% any given day. 
8	1526307050	3	Volatility isn't an issue if you use liquidity providers who carry that risk (and profit from it too).  Banks and FIs don't need to hold a single XRP.  From their point of view, they don't need to care about its price or its volatility - they don't touch XRP - liquidity providers have that job.  Even saying that, we're talking about a 3 to 4 second window of time compared to 3 to 5 days of time in the Forex markets.> No bank is going to completely overhaul one of their biggest and most profitable businesses (cross-border payments), substantially reduce profits by using XRP and replace a stable fiat currency with a cryptocurrency that oscillates up to 10% any given day. Ripple are signing up banks left, right and centre.   Their next announcement is when they pass the 200 banks/FI milestone signed up, so already the Bloomberg article you linked to is hopelessly out of date (only 3.5 months ago!).I understand that you think Ripple's products are absolutely useless, and won't save banks time and money.  Meanwhile, Ripple will continue to make progress and they will continue to add to their impressive client list.

Skimmed through their website but I couldn't find anything regarding liquidity. Also, why is the token necessary? Checked out xRapid in the brochure on their website but it's really light on info. Surely not for decentralization as Ripple own what, 70% of all XRP? 
8	1526306124	5	Do you even know what the difference between a PoC and Pilot is? Pilot has success criteria that when achieved guarantees it into full blown production. A Proof of Concept is a science project with no guaranteed deliverables. You seem very uneducated about this industry as I work in Banking/Finance in the tech sector. Pilots have guaranteed deliverables, once met they go into production. 
9	1526306629	0	>Pilots have guaranteed deliverables, once met they go into production. And what if they're not met? What do you think happens then? I mean I get it, 90% of your post history is you aggresively defending Ripple so I probably have 0% to convince you to take a even *slightly* critical look at the asset you're no doubt heavily invested in but oh well. 
8	1526308154	2	> It's being piloted, which is a long way from adoption.  It's an impressive feat, no doubt, but there are still questions to be answered. This is absolutely true.But the crux of it is, if there were no questions to be answered, the price of XRP would be in the hundreds of dollars (at least) because it would be a sure thing.In order to get ahead of the curve, I'm looking at how Ripple is performing, to see their chances of success, and, as you said, it's _impressive_.I expect that the majority of banks aren't interested at this point (which, as a consortium of banks, SWIFT represents).  We are at the earliest stages, and banks are (needfully) very risk adverse.I want to see Ripple to start getting banks to start getting banks to just try out the products, and then deliver on the promises that they presented.  This is where we're currently at.  Then I want to see them continue to sign new banks as they reduce the risk.If that happens, the price **will** rise.

2	1526298386	9	TL;DR: you don't know what you're talking about.
3	1526298936	3	Have you heard the episode, by chance? It's a great discussion of XRP by some very knowledgeable people, Ryan Selkis of Messari and Matt Leising, Bloomberg reporter. 
4	1526304863	3	Matt Leising is considered the laughing stock of journalists covering Cryptocurrency. Go check his twitter history of him repeating that bitcoin/etherium will fail. He shits all over blockchain. Ryan Selkis is the ultimate twitter troll, you can look at this twitter feed and see him saying "fuck u" to the CEO of the largest blockchain company. He has no clue how XRP works and thinks if a $100 dollar transaction in Ripple will only use a fraction of Ripple... Seriously. 
5	1526305356	1	So what if he shits all over crypto? Are you only allowed to have an opinion if you believe in the tech?>XRP has fallen 55 percent from $2.92 in early January. Swift’s Newman says such volatility is bound to turn off bankers and their clients. “If the value of a cryptocurrency is going up and down like a yo-yo, this isn’t a serious medium of exchange,” he says. “It adds unnecessary complexity. The solution is worse than the problem.”This argument holds up, whether or not you like Matt Leising. No bank is going to completely overhaul one of their biggest and most profitable businesses (cross-border payments), substantially reduce profits by using XRP and replace a stable fiat currency with a cryptocurrency that oscillates up to 10% any given day. 
6	1526305840	3	Keeping money in Nostro/Vostro accounts is not profitable. I have no clue where you got that from. "No telecom is ever going to overhaul one of their biggest and most profitable business (Voice over landline), substantially reduce profits by using VOIP..." See how retarded that sounds? And you know who said something similar to that quote? CTO of AT&T in the early 2000'sI can go on and on about C level executives saying a technology will not take off, you want me to go find one of a C level of a fortune 50 company saying the cloud wont take off? Matt Leising is a joke.  
7	1526306230	1	>"No telecom is ever going to overhaul one of their biggest and most profitable business (Voice over landline), substantially reduce profits by using VOIP..." See how retarded that sounds? That's not even remotely comparable? Could you stick to the topic instead of spouting moronic analogies that you think makes you sound smart? Why would ANY bank replace stable fiat currency with an incredibly volatile cryptocurrency? 
8	1526306543	2	I guess you must be very uneducated then, you must have never heard Brad Garlinghouse, Jed McCaleb, or any of the Silicon Valley leaders use that analogy. "Why would any Telecom replace stable Land over IP with an incredible volatile IP based technology."
9	1526306808	0	Is your only recourse calling me uneducated? It's pretty telling that you resort to condescension when you run out of answers. Why would a bank use an extremely volatile cryptocurrency instead of a stable fiat currency? Why would a large corporation trust a bank to transfer millions of dollars between countries in such an unstable asset?
6	1526317960	1	STABLE FIAT CURRENCY !!! the UK£ the US$ has lost so much value around about 98% to date. As an old man now I know my £ does not go as far these days... Next you will be telling me the Bolivar is stable!
4	1526302075	3	Bloomberg pile out FUD against Ripple all the time so I'm not listening to anything that involves them.
5	1526302345	-2	Check out [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-25/ripple-wants-xrp-to-be-bitcoin-for-banks-if-only-the-banks-wanted-it) article. Still Bloomberg but sourced at every turn, writted by someone who's balls deep in Ripple and XRP. I'm sure you'll also brand that as FUD and prove once again that crypto is infested with all-encompassing cultism rivaling even the most hardcore religious societies, but if you consider yourself an intelligent investor then all perspectives deserve attention, right?
6	1526305204	3	These guys are not balls deep into crypto. Brad Garlinghouse had to do their job and provide references for them. xRapid was launched into Beta of August last year, these guys have no clue how Pilots or the technology behind XRP works. 
4	1526301313	2	>Matt Leising, Bloomberg reporter.or>knowledgeable people
4	1526301328	-2	Could you link it? I'm travelling atm and can't find it through the yt app (might be my Google Fu lacking)
5	1526305041	6	It's garbage, its a pure hit piece. The lead developer of Ripple and creator of XRP had offered to come on the show and they flat out denied him.Think about it, if you are running a large Cryptocurrency podcast and one of the most well respected cryptologists of all time offers to come on your podcast and you flat out deny him... hmmmm.... seems a bit sketchy. 
6	1526306058	-5	They address that whole thing in the first 15 min of the podcast. She asked for the CEO to come, they offer those two instead under the condition they both would go. She refused because she only wanted one person. Also they offered to send the tech guys while she didn't want to talk about the tech but the economics and organisation behind it. It didn't seem unreasonable to me, I suggest actually listening to the podcast.
7	1526306258	3	Tech guy? It'd David Shwartz, he is on the board of directors. WTF... A tech guy that is on the board of directors for a $30+ Billion dollar company. I'm sure he can only talk about tech. 
8	1526307185	-1	Dude, I just barely finished listening to the podcast and admittedly don't know too much about ripples dealings. You seem eager to have an argument about this, for that I am the wrong person since Im not up-to-date on ripple. But the outright dismissal of the whole podcast based on that Twitter drama they actually spend quite some time to address feels disingenuous to me.That being said I'm open to hear your critique on the issues brought up in the podcast, as long as we refrain from cherry picking.
5	1526301441	2	[Here you go.](http://unchainedpodcast.co/ripples-xrp-why-its-chances-of-success-are-low-ep58) Super interesting listen. 
6	1526301789	1	Merci!
0	1526285639	4	For the big banks it's a game, they have so much influence over the market that with each announcement they release billion of $$ are moving.I seriously don't want them to get into crypto, but I guess that's the most important step of adoption 
1	1526306247	2	Yeah I'm worried about them getting their greasy hands on it along with wall street parasites and corrupting it for their own gain.What worries me more is that I've seen plenty of people here who are fine with that because they'll be in their stupid Lambo. When did greed perverse this community? 
2	1526309084	1	Oh, that can be pinned on Ripple.  They convinced kids that it's ok the banks fucked us in 08' and let"s forget satoshi invented this show because of the 08' crash.
0	1526299458	2	If Morgan Stanley is saying that, then figure the opposite.  Banks like cryptocurrency cause now they won't be regulated.
0	1526305463	2	Why would we even need banks with crypto currency?
0	1526306028	2	Where we are going we don't need banks.
0	1526289072	10	Time to stop being general cheerleaders and actually start reading the articles posted here. From the article:“Freely circulating paper notes and coins (cash) limits the ability of the central banks to force negative deposit rates. A digital version of cash could theoretically allow negative deposit rates to be charged on all money in circulation within any economy,”What she is saying is that in a scenario where all cash are electronically held *and controlled by central banks*, negative interest rates will have larger impact. However, is the central bank controlling all cash a scenario that this community encourages? The idea is that you, and only you, control the currency you own. In that case, negative interest rates would have even less impact than today and (according to MS) the impact of financial crises could be larger.So a very, very disappointing message, if one bothers to actually read it.
1	1526296424	4	Don't know why you are getting voted down for this. This same MS research analyst recently concluded that BTC and others are still in a bubble and will crash and burn even further this year. They are not at all bulllish on crypto as people in this redditt think about it. What this Morgan Stanley team calls "cryptocurrency" is a digital version of the U.S. dollar run by the U.S. government.
1	1526300113	4	The disappointment is going to come when the big banks acquire and/or develop their own coins and ask they buddies in DC to outlaw all other coins for transactions ..  thinking the bankers and money changers are on your side is a huge miscalculation 
1	1526294546	1	I dont really think its a dissapointing message at all. What is going to happen will probably be, that multiple cryptocurrencies will be accepted around the world and there will be one or a handful used by banks as interbank currencies. So you will hold BTC, ETH, OMG, ARK, ADA or whatever in your wallet and dont need to communicate with banks at all. If they want your shiny electronic money they WILL have to offer you something you dont get while holding them in your own wallet. They cant decide what Cryptocurrency will be used if the Governments arent complying. Nobody can force us to use a cryptocurrency issued by a central bank.
1	1526293836	1	> Over the years, there has been an increasing global interest among central banks and financial institutions. While some countries have created their own currencies, many more are looking into that direction.  >  >However, some central banks are still in doubt about the credibility of cryptocurrencies. They do not support these findings and suggestions from Morgan Stanley  >  >In particular, the head of Germany’s Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, had earnestly cautioned that cryptocurrencies would only aggravate the impacts of financial crises in the future. He argued that if central banks create their own cryptos to reassure users that their currencies are secure, it will increase the risks of having a financial crisis.  >  >Now, the big question is: would [cryptocurrencies](https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-weekend-headlines-may-13/) really help in mitigating the impacts of a future global crisis or would they make financial crises more devastating as cautioned by Jens?The message was clear, the understanding may be different regarding what might happen, since it may or may not happen at all to begin with.  So, the verdict still depends whatever the situation might be, in the future.
1	1526294211	0	More than happy to profit from this! 
1	1526301453	0	You read the message, but don't understand economics. In your defense, the articles author doesn't either. [Regardless, since I'm so helpful /s, the ZNLB would like a word with you.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_lower_bound)
2	1526301461	1	**Zero lower bound**The Zero Lower Bound (ZLB) or Zero Nominal Lower Bound (ZNLB) is a macroeconomic problem that occurs when the short-term nominal interest rate is at or near zero, causing a liquidity trap and limiting the capacity that the central bank has to stimulate economic growth.The root cause of the ZLB is the issuance of paper currency by governments, effectively guaranteeing a zero nominal interest rate and acting as an interest rate floor. Governments cannot encourage spending by lowering interest rates, because people would simply hold cash instead. Miles Kimball suggested that a modern economy either fully relying on electronic money or defining electronic money as the unit of account could eliminate the ZLB.The problem of the ZLB returned to prominence with Japan's experience during the 90's, and more recently with the subprime crisis.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
0	1526282049	1	“Save them from financial crisis”That resumes it all, if you see them entering crypto market massively, something’s getting short..
0	1526297104	1	Lol I think you dropped a “. 
0	1526298206	1	Banks will embrace and adopt crypto for their own purposes but will keep fees or create new ones. Remember that and remember too that some cryptos are free to transact with. Even the high fee coins will be cheaper than Bank fees.
0	1526298663	1	Governments, banks, and regulatory organisations should work in tandem with the cryptocurrency and blockchain space and not against. The effort should be to be to grow together in a holistic financial and technological eco-system which puts everyone involved in a win-win situation without opposites. 
0	1526303622	1	We are not because with the public block chain banks can’t control anything and they will become virtually obsolete. They do not want that let’s not forget how much money they have and operate with. This will be an uphill battle because many rich and powerful people will be out of a job and earnings!
0	1526303696	1	Banks are obviously going to move in on crypto currencies at a much greater rate, once they have their models in place. The money will go where it can earn more money. 
0	1526304180	1	Nope, our revolution is about to be hijacked by the banks 
0	1526304760	1	I think the banks will be split but it will most likely be a case of: adapt or die.
0	1526305421	1	which revolution? you meant crypto as normal cash usage?
0	1526308901	1	Good stuff that Zoe Cruz, a former co-president at Morgan Stanley is on Ripple's board.
0	1526310165	1	Im 100% sure they;ll be using our favorite coins!
0	1526310685	1	hello? mr. stanley? this is not for you. please leave us alone thx
0	1526310934	1	hehe "verge"
0	1526311572	1	Lol crypto ded. Move on losers 
0	1526312283	1	According to this article digital money created by a central bank can be manipulated much more (impose higher negative interest rates or higher rate if money supply) than it is possible right now, when cash is still available. With a interest rate of for instance -10% everybody would try to get cash back from banks resulting in banks going bankrupt.  The most important value of a currency is trust. Who/what is trustworthy? Mathematics and open source software. 
0	1526312398	1	Yes! So just HODL.
0	1526313566	1	Not to be a downer, but isn’t this similar to the thought process that surrounded derivatives? 
0	1526316043	1	Did someone say verge? (Xvg)
0	1526316667	1	It means they're about to take all your hopes and dreams.
0	1526317156	1	I don't think you understand how quotation marks work.
0	1526317725	1	Great news. Banks partnering with crypto will be great for us all. 
0	1526318254	1	>even save them from a financial crisisI assume this refers to ease of liquidity to get toxic shit off their books in the event they have to do so expediently and also better ID ownership via fast settlements \(if assets become crypto\-assets\), and also receive quick injects of liquidity. Generally, both would have helped '08. But if they keep securitizing bad debt, tranching it, and creating incredibly complex derivatives \(CDOs are still around folks\), then they'll keep getting into trouble. Only benefit I suppose is that bc of Dodd\-Frank, the crisis would start on someone like AIG's books. 
0	1526297562	1	Interesting read, but Morgan Stanley is not one of the biggest banks in the world, because it is not a bank at all. It is a financial services firm and uses CitiBank for banking aspects. 
1	1526298487	2	It’s an investment bank. Not a commercial bank.
2	1526301800	2	correct, sorry I thought people would see the headline and think its a retail bank reducing fees.
1	1526299265	2	A financial services firm? Don’t think so buddy - clearly an investment bank without the traditional retail banking aspect...
2	1526301756	1	I feel like people see this headline about fees and think traditional retail banking. you are correct, it is an IB
0	1526296253	1	I get hesitant hearing about banks wanting to qdopt cryptocurrency though, seems to fly in the face of decentralization
0	1526297912	1	Verge eh? Bullish!!!
0	1526305469	0	**So now we are helping the middlemen instead of removing the middlemen?**
1	1526309278	1	Looks like it.
0	1526306718	0	Great statement, its gonna be a booster for crypto
0	1526308667	0	Good for xrp, xlm, cas holders.Note that these companies were the only blockchain companies invited for GMTS Dubai
0	1526304100	-4	Big banks are starting to take crypto seriously. Time to buy a little more bitcoin, monero, and bitcoin core.
