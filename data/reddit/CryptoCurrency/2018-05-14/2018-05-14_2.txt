0	1526305608	92	Isn't it hilarious that they don't accept bitcoin/eth as payment?
1	1526305969	59	Coindesk is really scum. 
2	1526306262	11	Never used coindesk so can't comment on it, but I don't think they decided not to include crypto payments while drinking their scotch and laughing histerically just to fuck people over.
3	1526307572	6	Im just waiting for r/Buttcoin to post about the biggest crypto conference not accepting crypto as payment 
4	1526313697	1	Was already mentioned on John Oliver during their crypto episode a while back. It *is* a little funny.
2	1526307581	-8	Because they donâ€™t accept crypto? Totally rational statement. Perhaps they donâ€™t want to deal with the headache related to accounting?(I dislike them too, but saying theyâ€™re scum for that reason is just plain idiotic)
3	1526314155	3	Why is this being downvoted?
3	1526307765	1	I didnt specifically state why they are scum, so you are arriving at your own conclusions which is also "just plain idiotic " 
4	1526310708	-1	Exactly, you didn't state why they are scum, but you replied to a comment stating that it's hilarious that they don't accept btc/eth, which gives the impression that the context of your statement is based on that comment. Using your brain is difficult, isn't it? (Just looked at your post history, you're the idiot that made the comment "Good luck with those taxes ðŸ˜…" on that one thread about someone selling, then went on to say that taxes are the same in most countries. LOL, jesus christ).
5	1526312531	2	Coindesk has a bad reputation, lets leave at that. 
6	1526317990	1	Fully agree with you.
7	1526318294	1	I would however like to hear their reasoning on why they arent accepting crypto as payment. 
5	1526312175	-4	Must really hurt getting all those downvotes. Dont worry, your kitty probably still loves you ;D 
6	1526318047	1	Not everyone cares about fictive internet points.
1	1526312098	1	Ridiculous. And that isnt even a reason that vitalik is boycotting it
1	1526313258	1	Iâ€™m not sure how we can be moon boys when the biggest conference doesnâ€™t even accept crypto. Itâ€™s kind of a joke.
0	1526304233	19	Wait, how expensive are those tickets?
1	1526304247	34	$3000 each
2	1526304660	16	Well fuck, are the tickets bought with cryptocurrency tho?
3	1526304774	17	No.
4	1526305043	33	Coindesk is a joke.
5	1526305181	18	The no Crypto part I agree. But tickets were not always 3K, this is the beyond late-bird pricing. I think tickets originally started around 1K.
6	1526313004	8	wtf that's still insanely expensive. fucking FIFA World Cup tickets are about $300 per game, and that shit happens once every 4 years.1k-3k for one three day event? that happens yearly? and they don't accept crypto? Jesssussss talk about a rich boys (and girls) club
7	1526316834	2	Tech conferences being very expensive is not unusual. Prices are inflated since most purchases are by companies, not individuals.
8	1526317170	1	Agreed, I believe my BlackHat conference ticket was $3k 
7	1526315346	1	lots of people made bank on crypto in 2017
7	1526319053	1	Open Source Summit in L.A ran by Linux Foundation had $1200 tickets. Don't forget that this is THE crypto conference. It's also the location of the event etc
5	1526318299	1	Why would it even matter, if oyu paid with Crypto or not? The tickets are expensive, which is something I really don't like. However, space is limited and I don't know, is the venue full? Could it have more people? I hate to be that guy, but ... if the ticket were to cost 100$, then how many people can sign up? What's venue capacity? Everyone allowed? Investors only? You see what I'm saying? Maybe, it's somewhat related to the kind of people they want to attend, people with ... money. In that respect, a 1000$ ticket is a gateway, for medium rich people to enter and it's a barrier for poor people. When you write it down like, I don't know. You could always make a case of ... why not simply get a bigger venue then, if capacity is the problem? 1000$ for a ticket is scummy. I would never attend this, with that pricetag. Others however ... will. I don't know. If it works, why change? Why don't you create some better meetup, for the more average person, and attract all these important people to your meet, to hold good presentations and speeches about their products. If they really sucked so much, why is there seemingly noone willing to do better? Cryptos been around for nine years, why has noone shown initiative? Hope that makes sense.
3	1526305004	1	I have no idea but I would hope they can be.
2	1526304332	9	So this is basically for rich people
3	1526304474	19	Industry leaders is another way to look at it. I can't imagine renting all that space downtown NYC is cheap either.
3	1526309483	4	early "investors"
3	1526317083	2	Cryptocurrency is the ^^^^rich people's revolution!!!!
3	1526317184	1	I imagine its to prevent the conference being filled [with people like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hR4rDbJPM4) which is quite a large majority of people. 
2	1526306560	1	You can watch live. 
0	1526306325	15	Oh good, now they can afford to step up their fake crypto news game!
0	1526311826	12	coindesk jumped the shark last year.  Those attendees are all going to be really pissed that they wasted their money and all they got was a cool tote.  
0	1526307882	5	Funny how this was loved last year
0	1526308790	6	Not to mention sponsorship money, even sponsoring pen and notepad costs you 50 grand
1	1526316519	4	ayeee VeChain lmao
2	1526317265	3	If that's what it cost VeChain I can't imagine how much money Ark spent. 
3	1526317717	1	I imagine a few hundred grand with the total package-- IRL ads, pamphlet ads, website ads, twitter and other social media marketing etc... 
0	1526313217	7	Yeah definitely more than 4,000 here.Source: sitting in the presentation ballroom right now
1	1526316143	-2	Why though? What benefit are you getting?
2	1526317355	3	He gets to interact with a bunch of people that have the same interests as him. Theres good food and drinks, new tech being discussed around people that understand it.I can't believe I answered such bad question.
3	1526319216	1	Yeah, these are perfect events to network with people. I have attended some of the meetups here in L.A and I've found myself meeting people who are in their 40s and 50s asking me, a 28 yr old, what I know and explain the market/tech. I've managed to bring new people to my local meetup.
2	1526316577	1	moon
0	1526314958	9	Why is the biggest industry event hosted by the worst industry news sight?It's like having TMZ host the Oscars or something.
1	1526315498	3	Exactly this
0	1526310221	5	SponsoredCONSENSUS 2018
0	1526314678	4	[deleted]
1	1526316562	1	Doesn't matter, if they paid thousands, I don't think CoinDesk cares if they actually attend... no refunds bitches!
0	1526310081	2	Was trying to watch stream but wonâ€™t load on phone :(
0	1526313085	2	Isn't it more like 8500 attendees?
0	1526313617	2	Rip off... shitsensus..
0	1526318963	1	This type of events should be accesible for everyone. That's mainstream. Tickets for $2k is just ridiculous and opposite to what blockchain is... 
0	1526319262	1	Fuckkkkkk Coindesk. Itâ€™s been along with many others such a scourge to the crypto space.
0	1526306323	0	i no longer hav time to read coindesk tbh. 
0	1526317136	0	Who gives a shit. Coin conferences are worthless shillfests. Anybody that pays for them is some kind of moron speculator looking for the next shitcoin to pump. Not like theyâ€™re learning anything there. 
1	1526318275	4	damn man i took a quick peek at your post history and i must say.. life is too short to be pissed off all the time. relax a bit and look around, take a deep breath, realize its a miracle to be alive. hope you have better days ahead, you pessimistic mfer
2	1526319244	1	Probably lives alone and is an incel. 
0	1526313775	0	4000 people isnt very much
