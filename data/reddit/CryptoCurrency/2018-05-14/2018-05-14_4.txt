0	1526293842	19	This is absolutely a great sign of things to come second half of 2018.
1	1526309557	3	I wouldn’t be so sure, actual crypto adoption cuts them off from their biggest money spigot, The Fed and destroys their business. I’m very skeptical, I would imagine the scenario they are looking for is eventually having their own crypto or choosing one they can somewhat control and lobby the government to adopt regulations cuz terrorism and drugs and Wall Street having full control of crypto. 
2	1526311421	1	What if Goldman Sachs is playing every money spigot?United states is cool, but a worldwide currency could mean getting significantly more money.Sure they will play by the rules, but they will make sure the rules benefit them. And if they are trying to get more crypto adoption, it will benefit us too. 
3	1526313232	2	Americans seem to be missing this point. The world is much bigger than the USA, and big banks are fully aware of that fact.
4	1526315224	1	How are "Americans missing the point"He literally is saying that if US banks can get  in the ground level of crypto that their profits could be much much higher because they could control a global currency instead of just a regional one. You seem to be missing the point, not "The Americans"
5	1526317582	1	No I’m not missing the point. You are not seeing the context of the comment, I agree with the guy. 
0	1526299648	11	Weren't they the guys saying that crypto was a terrible investment 2 months ago?
1	1526300507	24	It was a terrible investment 2 months ago.
2	1526300887	8	It was a great time to accumulate. Terrible investment period was end of December/start of January where the FOMO was insane.
2	1526303611	2	no it wasnt - most projects are up 100% since then.
3	1526308895	2	Not sure why the downvotes. You are correct. I am up almost 100% on all investments I made about a month and a half ago
2	1526311487	0	Speak for yourself.Ive been around long enough to believe in Bitcoin despite a few month drop. I cant speak for alt coins, those are still a terrible investment IMO. Until someone offers to pay me in alt coins, I have a hard time believing they are needed. 
0	1526305395	2	We need to keep track of where the ex-Goldman guys are going. Fusion definitely has some former employees on their team, anyone else?
0	1526311048	1	Can't wait for June to start the madness.
0	1526315438	1	“CHANGE TEAMS”
0	1526305823	0	lolololo how they switch sides!
0	1526303091	-2	They own Poloniex.
1	1526313310	2	No they don't. Circle owns Poloniex, and Goldman Sachs invested in Circle a long time ago, I'm not sure if they still have a portion in it or not as their financials are not public.
2	1526318923	1	Circle is basically owned by G.S as they injected most of the money to fund the venture. 
2	1526314346	-1	Who owns you?
3	1526316878	1	my mom
