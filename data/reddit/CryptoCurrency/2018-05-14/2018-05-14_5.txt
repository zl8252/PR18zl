1	1526300274	18	They're also running ads on coindesk today.
2	1526300674	14	Yep, added the screen to main post.
0	1526303592	26	If the team delivers as they promised, with Core V2 and ARKVM, ARK could be the most technically advanced platform solution.They have to play it right to attract start-ups that would naturally look at ETH or NEO first,
1	1526307740	13	I haven't always been excited how they handled marketing, but I did always commend how they targeted developers first. I've talked to a couple of people that program and asked them about blockchain, and their main comments have been that they don't want to have to build a system themselves. Ark fits that, and if anything wants to be adopted, it needs to be fluid and accessable.
2	1526307874	11	This is true. It was a clever way to show it off to talented devs during these hackatons they sponsored. They play the long game.
2	1526310528	7	I know they are a lot of moving parts but just as a consumer, when I think of platforms that control and restrict certain attributes and speeds being inherently built on main-chain,   And conversely Ark allowing clones to be completely independent but all of the available features and tools, change your complete algorithm for your PegasusCoin or whatever , And Ark being available and needed to communicate across all blockchains (child or foreign).  Unless I'm missing something this is the direction adoption would take.

0	1526305270	14	They say to not fall in love with your holdings, but I couldn't resist the beauty of ARK.
0	1526301903	11	Man this feels nice, I can’t wait for V2 release!
0	1526309132	11	I'm at the hotel where this is happening. Apparently 8000 attendees and as a result rampant overcrowding. Lines for elevators are 1hr+
1	1526315536	4	nah that's just the US, the stairs should be empty
0	1526305570	8	V2 will be revolutionary. Very excited for it. 
0	1526305661	7	Good one, the codes is def highlight
0	1526309797	5	Everything looks good.Bark for Ark
0	1526313345	4	Consensus 2018 is targeted more towards tech and less about investing. Still upvoted this though. 
1	1526317593	1	Think the two go together. 
1	1526315924	1	So many people bought tickets with their moon gains from last year, that have no idea what they're going to be looking at. When we crypto "investors" buy tickets at consensus, we take a spot away from someone who could actually benefit from the conference. 
2	1526317450	0	Like who? Tickets didn't  run out. It's something like 1% of attendees are developers. 
3	1526317710	0	tickets don't run out, no, but rooms in the area are limitedIs it really 1%? It used to be majority developers...
4	1526317764	0	Don't get your point but Ok.
5	1526318038	1	Basically my point is unless you're a developer, or looking to work for a project as a non-dev, then a ticket to consensus is a waste of money for you.
0	1526305124	5	Just epic ! - After core V2 release real fun beggings.
