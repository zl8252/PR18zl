0	1526259278	25	I'd hate that bullshit. They want everything recorded. Cash will forever be king for privacy
1	1526283449	20	Yeah, we wouldn't want everybody's entire payment and income registered on something like a public ledger right? That would be bad.
2	1526293414	13	not on this ledger, baby! 
2	1526316351	1	o shit
1	1526282731	8	are people here really TOTALLY forgetting or ignoring that this means literally nothing for the average person but is more aimed to stop criminals or at least slow them down?when was the last time you spend more than 10000 bucks on something?for me this was buying my car, for this purchase there exists a bill and all the other document stuff needed to register the car in my name afterwards.Why would i care one single bit that i cant pay in cash for this car?All that means for me is that there is another proof that i paid and it completely takes out the risk of having over 10000 bucks with you physically.the only reason people brought up here why this is bad is the most upvoted post that literally says he doesn't like it because he cant commit tax fraud if everything is tracked.what the fuck is wrong with this community?
2	1526289908	3	I still work in a business where a lot of trading is done in cash (used machinery/engines) and this kind of regulations can seriously harm it. Cash is (for now) the only way to get an instant payment; in a few years time something like REQ can fill up the void but for now nothing comes close to the speed of cash.
3	1526292159	5	Online bank transfers aren't instant? I live in Korea and online transfers are literally instant. Like maybe 2 or 3 seconds but they are always there by the time someone refreshes their app or whatnot.I am all for crypto and less government control of the financial sphere, don't get me wrong, but I see this narrative so often with cryptocurrencies about being instant and how that's such a benefit but I've never had to deal with non-instant transfers except for remitting money overseas (and even then it can be pretty much instant using paypal, I know it has fees etc but the option is there).
4	1526294808	1	Here in west-europe most transactions are 'near' instant if the transaction takes place in the same bank. As soon as 2 banks need to communicate, it takes between 1 hour and 1 week, depending on which banks need to communicate. If one of the banks is from a different continent, it could take even longer.Cash is still king in my business
5	1526295125	1	That sucks. I'm from Ireland, so west-Europe, and enjoyed instant transactions there too but I'm guessing that was within the same bank, also pretty sure it was during office hours.That said, in Korea it's instant between banks so it's definitely possible.
6	1526296169	2	Korean here.Korea is NOT the norm for banking.  It is also why cryptocurrency is such a boom-- the current banking infrastructure really works well to support crypto-exchanges.Instant bank transfers 24/7/365 is pretty crazy.  Keep in mind that most countries don't support bank transfer during non-business hours.  Also note the insanely cheap fees for bank transfers (if not free).  Take for instance in USA.  If you use Bank Of America (huge bank) and want to deposit into GDAX, you'll have to pay $40 to get the deposit completed same-day (yes, same-day, not same-minute).
7	1526297711	1	True, I've lived in a few countries but generally hadn't done many bank transfers until I moved to Korea (Probably for that reason).My main point is that instant transfers are possible with banks, if they are willing to put the infrastructure in place. Cryptocurrency isn't necessary.Although, that said, cryptocurrencies could be the backend infrastructure for those banks in the future (Stellar Lumens is a good example of being in the background so the consumer doesn't even realise that it is powering their transactions). I knew the states was slow with banking etc but 40 dollars to make a transfer? That's disgustingly blatant taking advantage of people.
6	1526295273	1	Ow for sure it's possible. It just doesn't happen (as often) yet. Just look at the US; still working with paper checks, etc. Seems utterly ancient to me and totally not efficient. It 'just' needs to be implemented. Anyway, I hope they won't pass these kind of regulations in Europe.
5	1526317563	1	Wrong. Here in west europe \(Portugal\) transactions are instant to any bank since 1980. If it is a bank from a different country it is within the next business day.
4	1526298503	1	There is an instant bank xfer option (RTGS) in Australia that is like $30 per transfer, but it still takes like 1-24 hours depending on the banks involved.
5	1526309485	1	Sorry what is xfer option? Transfers are instant with the NPP (and Pay ID) between all big banks at least (not sure if small banks have joined yet).And what's the $30 fee for. I assume you are talking international transfers?
6	1526312091	1	I've never heard of anyone talking about or using a NPP. RTGS is the main instant transfer service the banks offer to customers and that companies use to make large quantum commercial domestic payments asap.
7	1526316478	2	NPP only started this year so maybe that's why you haven't heard of it.
2	1526288389	12	Because it's a start. Like starting with censoring the real bad stuff. It will not end there. Whenever your gov starts to limit your freedom, you should be worried.What the fuck is wrong with you?
3	1526289261	2	so you worry about speed limits as well?or limits to how drunk you can be behind the wheel?Limits to weapons?Or why am i not allowed to drive on the sidewalk? where is my fucking freedom?you see how silly this is? laws are there to protect you and if you feel like this doesn't do anything for you go vote and vote for someone that support what you stand for.
4	1526298363	2	It sounds like crypto isn't for you my friend. It's a matter if principle. It's a slippery slope."They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety." - Benjamin Franklin
5	1526303160	3	Life should be a matter of pragmatism, not principle
6	1526307856	1	Generally I would agree with you but the nanny state people really drive me nuts. I don't want or need the government to protect me as the guy up there goes on about.
7	1526316365	2	I guess my point is if crypto is to go mainstream, it has to be palatable to mainstream viewpoints, a lot of people are happy to pay taxes for schools, roads, policing etc.Where I see crypto being very effective is governments providing similar services as today, but at much higher efficiency.  Look at Mannabase, welfare without the need for thousands of civil servants to administer it all.  SolarCoin is another cool example, government can outsource incentives for clean energy generation.  All a government needs to do is divert money from bureaucracy and buy some tokens or even just officially support such intitiatives.
4	1526291977	-2	> so you worry about speed limits as well?> or limits to how drunk you can be behind the wheel?Yes, owners of the roads should decide those.> Limits to weapons?Of course. That's one of the biggest things.> Or why am i not allowed to drive on the sidewalk? where is my fucking freedom?That's not how freedom works. Someone owns that sidewalk and he should be able to decide freely how the sidewalk is going to be used. You're free not to use it.> you see how silly this is?It's not that silly if you spend more than an hour thinking about it. You've been brainwashed. You believe something so much that you can't even think about alternatives. It's the same as with religious people, it's impossible to change their mind even if the evidence hits them in their face.>go vote No thanks. I want freedom, not to chose a different slave master.
5	1526299757	2	The government owns the roads.
4	1526292414	0	I get what you're saying, but how is someone killing someone with a transaction over 10k in cash? I get that you can make the claim that easier finances in the black market leads to possible violence, but it's not the same as someone getting behind a wheel and killing someone. The act of paying more than 10k in cash isn't a dangerous act in itself. I see both sides of the argument here, although I feel like I'd lean a bit more towards keeping things more free and open. If there are studies presented with solid evidence that allowing large cash transactions is objectively a negative for society then I'd like to read those and then I'd be much more likely to agree. 
2	1526293182	1	Do you live in Aus? humble question
2	1526299158	1	That would be true in most cases however some people invest in lump sums or dollar\-cost averaging therefor those who invest that way will suffer.
2	1526309103	1	You have to see the long game here. It’s clearly a big step towards a cashless society, something goverments all over the world are pushing at the moment. A cashless monetary system forces you into the banking system. Not only can a goverment shut you out of your funds at any moment, it also can impose negative interest rates without you being able to keep your money in cash to escape it.Fighting criminal activity is just an excuse. This is about total control over every citizen. There is a word for it: slavery.
2	1526282886	-1	It's not about the amount but the restrictive nature of the decision.Additionally, if they are forcing this upon people they should offer some incentive to the people. It's not right to not get anything in return while having a "right" taken away
3	1526283070	3	that's literally what laws do, they restrict something and since this has zero impact for the average person i dont understand the outcry here and everyone making a big deal out of it, especially here on this sub like this decision would instantly push cryptos to the moon in australia.its merely a "Meh" from the average person and nobody is going to consider using cryptos to go around this decision.
4	1526285299	7	Because slowly you lose your freedom and decision making, rules decide for you.
4	1526288539	3	It's a "Meh" from obedient slaves like you.
4	1526292169	1	It's a slippery slope.
4	1526297329	1	"First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—Because I was not a Socialist.Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Trade Unionist.Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Jew.Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me."
4	1526299155	1	I mean I wouldn't say it has zero impact. I know a lot of people who have bought or sold cars or other sub $50k type items in cash. Think about some random person selling their RV or speedboat in the country. Probably going to be a gumtree ad, buyer comes and checks it out, and settles there and then in cash.
2	1526300088	-1	No individual, organization, or government needs to know how you spend your money. It is called privacy, which also happens to be a large focus of the blockchain community. Quit trying to dog everyone because you believe in safety through living in a statist nanny world.
1	1526296763	1	> Cash will forever be king for privacyDepends what kind of privacy. Cash gives you privacy from third parties. But unless you're doing dead drops, cash has a distinct lack of privacy in that both parties get to see each other.That's why we have cryptocurrencies: to give us both kinds of privacy.
0	1526281494	13	We can't take any news as a step toward bitcoin. So you have to pay someone 20,000$ for a car. You get your Bitcoin, leave a meet up for tomorrow when you wake up and check if you have your money for meeting up you see you have 19,500$?
1	1526306081	2	I don't think this is going to be the case. Let's say you need to buy the car for 20k, if the transaction is using OMG's backend you could potentially never even know that crypto was used. You pay them 20k in the currency that you own.OMG would convert it to virtually any form of currency the receiver wants, whether it's 20k worth of btc, or yen. This is all on the backend so you potentially wouldn't even know what type of currency they will want to receive  
1	1526282839	3	i also dont get it, any sane comment here gets downvoted and the most upvoted ones could be copied from /r/conspiracy while also having a strong lean towards tax fraud....
0	1526253062	32	This is why we need a cryptocurrency system that exists outside of the clutches of the crooked global political system. They want to track our complete spending through credit and debit cards so that they squeeze out every inflated dollar from our pockets through taxation. They justify it by claiming it's their way of fighting syndicate crime but in reality the end goal is to be able to freely bump taxes higher without fear of individuals wising up and retreating to a physical currency or commodity.  
1	1526253448	12	They'll start in a reasonable fashion, here at 10K, then when the ripple flattens and people become accustomed to that level of government/world overreach, they'll come down to 5K likely and will eventually end it where cash is outlawed or unredeemable, because a government can do that, such as China in the last century switching from one currency to another over night. 
2	1526293344	5	not to mention that 10k isn't as much as it used to be since inflation and all that. I used to work at a bank and saw 10k or more quite regularly in cash. Doesn't phase me at all anymore. 
3	1526304825	1	Very interesting input. 
1	1526282471	2	so you rather have easy money laundering for the criminals so you can not pay taxes when you dont feel like it?
2	1526299547	2	This spurious argument is always thrown into the mix - but the crims are laundering billions of dollars using the global  financial systems. The large corporations and banks operate with impunity & pay very little tax or offshore their profits to the detriment of the country in which they make them. This will not change with this govt initiative - it is about control of the common person.
2	1526304346	1	It's important to have the option of breaking the law in the scenario when the law is not just. Without cash, you lose that option of tax evasion. 
3	1526306530	2	they are not banning cash anyways so you could still break the law by simply paying with more than 10k if you wanted to and the other side wants it as well.
1	1526257117	4	Why does everyone make such a big deal about paying taxes? This isn't 'murica, roads need fixing, hospitals need funding etc.
2	1526261382	24	This is the same government that spend over  $120MM asking people a yes or no question.
3	1526275442	5	Yep, a bunch of fucking twats that could have just sent a god damn email for a fraction of that. I live on the gold coast where they spent 2m on a bunch of stupid lights, I never even knew what they were until a few days ago. They are supposed to say "Gold Coast", but nobody can even see the sign while driving alonside it at 110km/h on the motorway., Will never understand why people are so compliant with getting higher and higher tax rates and giving their hard earned money away to a bunch of absolute wankers who will plunder it ineffectively. 
4	1526305187	1	>Will never understand why people are so compliant with getting higher and higher tax rates and giving their hard earned money away to a bunch of absolute wankers who will plunder it ineffectively.I'm not. What am I supposed to do about it? Vote on the nonexistent party that will lower taxes and shrink ~~government~~ its own sphere of influence?
3	1526278132	-4	Not to mention the millions (billions?) wasted on dole bludgers, welfare cheats & everything else. The salary of these crooks is exorbitant too; they achieve next to F*ck all in their term then as an election approaches they buy votes with more handouts. Rinse and repeat for next election    Gee - i wonder why people don't like it...
2	1526258618	14	Because a good chunk of taxes don't go to what they're supposed to, at least that's the case here in the USA. It hurts when you get taxed at every turn. 
3	1526259773	-5	Then vote in people to change it. That's how a republic works. 
4	1526261524	10	On paper that’s a good idea but that’s not how it works here. The system is corrupt and there’s a lot of idiots in power that are only in it for personal benefit.
5	1526265048	7	Here's another problem- you and I are not that different from the corrupt idiots we vote in office; you are not more good, nor are you smarter, and if you think you are good, and know what's best for everyone, you'd be in the same position as the people you hate now minus the self-awareness that comes with having a life that forces you to question why it's so shitty. Seriously, all these mythological people like Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot, Stalin, are all very mundane and do not have supernatural powers- they are just like you and myself, and we will always have a system that can be exploited by people who are just a little bit more ambitious and talented but not that different from you, 
6	1526268650	1	You bring up a very intriguing under point, one that I agree with. Ultimately, the majority has to be complacent in under for the minority to become what most would consider corrupt. 
7	1526269922	0	One of the things that made me arrive to that conclusion is the example of economics; you have all these people complaining about bad movies that keep coming out, and how "The rich keep getting richer"- as if they're always rubbing their hands to think of how to steal and rob people of their money rather than, say, coming up with something people would readily give up their shekels for, and then when they're no longer satisfied (read: bored) with what they bought, suddenly it's the rich man's fault- but regardless of that point, we've given these people enough power and influence that they can realistically try and force people to give them their money from dependency if not outright coercion. This is where cryptos step in. 
8	1526272444	1	I'm super worn out atm, so i didn't quite trek your analogy to well but to add to your last line, crypto is controlled by humans, who can invariably be found and "touched" by powers above them and with how the IRS has already begun reaching out to major gate keepers like Coinbase, it's difficult for me to rest assured that cryptocurrency isn't going to ultimately turn out like other digital formats like credit cards and PayPal, in the sense that they are controlled by controlling bodies that offer little to nothing in comparison . At the end of the day, these formats of payment are all based on numbers and require power+computers+internet, all variables that again, can be easily touched. I'm not purposely trying to cast a pessimistic outlook on this matter but am merely voicing my current concerns and views.
9	1526311714	2	I agree with you, the bitcoin counter culture I feel In love with during the Silk Road days is gone. Crypto is the future of finance it’s the natural evolution, but it’s not the future many of use envisioned, where a deflationary asset could help the regular people hold their value. Instead we’re going to get a new ultra billionaire class that have got huge bags and are going to accumulate more and more of the coins that will last in the long term. When crypto takes off it’s could very well creat the first trillion-air, and that person will have deflationary assets that will solidify their families power for the foreseeable future. It’s not going to fix the problem we all hoped it would, and that bums me out. But I can atleast secure my family with a good life if keep paying attention and do what they are doing but on a much smaller scale.
4	1526264597	2	It works with educated people, but then we'd have an aristocracy now, wouldn't we? It would've worked back when "reddit" was a bunch of farmers at a tavern talking about politics every night after work. Now, you get to choose your echo chamber, and it wouldn't matter how your republic is perfect- it would be just another construct of the past than anything that could handle random things life throws at it. 
4	1526261531	1	It's beyond voting. 
5	1526265102	1	it's too early for bullets. 
6	1526288950	1	And too late.  Australia already gave up that freedom  
2	1526262500	5	Ya, so the Australian government needs more ways to extort people of money so they can continue to fund their failing public systems and waste more money on initiatives that are never completed, don't work right, and waste billions of dollars.
1	1526280352	0	> the end goal is to be able to freely bump taxes higher without fear of individuals wising up Well in the budget last week the federal government cut taxes (mostly on the upper classes) instead of using the money to pay off the debt. So I don't think they're planning to raise taxes any time soon.
2	1526304205	1	Good, is this in Australia or?
3	1526306060	1	Yes, where politicians are obsessed with lowering taxes because it buys them votes.
0	1526280192	5	I live in Australia, I hate carrying cash around but a majority of our restaurants and shops have a "minimum $25 for eftpos payments."  Fix that then we fix cash.
0	1526278260	6	Australia has some very worrying legislative trends. 
1	1526295606	1	Maybe, it's still by far one of the safest and best countries to live in though.
2	1526301170	3	>by far one of We're leading the pack of obnoxious English speaking white cultures.
0	1526253504	8	Yeah i am in Australia and i think this will help crypto . Melbourne has a huge greek and Italian community who love to deal in cash . If we could just show them how it works i think it could be huge
0	1526255979	5	Time to buy crypto 
0	1526252516	5	Uruguay banned cash for all purchases over $5000, you can't even get your wages in cash, the "left-wing" government is pushing the banking industry interests hard.
1	1526292218	3	India did the same a couple of years back so people started hoarding cash. Welcome to more black market/unaccounted transactions. 
0	1526292050	2	In Greece the limit is 500euros
0	1526279590	4	When did this country decide to become prudish cunts about everything?

0	1526296566	2	You need a permit to wipe your arse in Australia, what a joke of a country
1	1526301992	1	Where are you from, out of curiosity?
0	1526268080	2	Absolutely disgusting. The goal of all these governments is full control over their citizens, which the vast majority hand over willingly. 
1	1526268886	2	Labor and Liberal are equally good at eroding our rights. They can both get fucked.
1	1526280702	2	I left 15 years ago for the UK. Since then it’s become a complete Nanny State. Sad. 
0	1526317356	1	Its forbidden in Portugal for payments above 3000€ as well.
0	1526293163	1	lol what the hell? Nanny state at it again. I feel for you, poor Aussies. Meanwhile, I am sitting here holding my gun and paying with my cash and eating a hamburger with no nutrition information needed. Oh and playing my M rated games without any censoring. hahaha :) You guys are still pretty cool. I am just taking the piss.
0	1526287799	1	I laughed when the article read that the fabled $100 Bill is a rarety and not often seen. Also Nick named the kermit. I live in Australia  $100 bills are optional on request not regularly given out unless you ask. We aussies call that bill a green back I have never heard some one call it a Kermit. Haha that was pretty funny. 
1	1526289506	3	Very true, they would be more common if ATMs issued them. We called them cabbage at a place I worked at because USD 100 dollar bills were greenbacks. And a combination of 50, 20, and 100 together was a fruit salad. 
0	1526282042	-2	This is why we need Graft.Network. Anon open source decentralised crypto Point of Sale.
1	1526282886	11	10 buzzwords and zero actual content in the comment beside trying to push another shitcoin.
2	1526283229	-2	Right lovely fellow redditor.It addresses the problem of anon spending at your local store. What other project you know that does that? Do tell - I will support it.
3	1526283485	3	the thing is i dont have any problem with that, i can spend money in stores all the time without giving out any info.if i spend so much that there would be a law stating i need to pay electronically i would be happy to do so because i want to have a proof that i paid.
4	1526284018	0	What’s your stance on net neutrality?
5	1526284454	1	thats a totally different and unrelated topic but anyways, i think its important to keep net neutrality, if we dont we will open up the doors for the big players while small internet startups will get throttled to oblivion.And obviously also on the consumer side we see how it goes in mexico where you buy internet packages that come with certain websites unlocked and unmetered depending on how much you pay.
