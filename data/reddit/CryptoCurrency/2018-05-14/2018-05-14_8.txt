0	1526316200	6	That is so NOT a title to be proud of.

0	1526308695	3	This reminded me of an old xkcd. [This is how blockchains proliferate](https://i.imgur.com/b9SF78dl.png).
0	1526306164	-7	Is this supposed to be FUD? Because Wordpress is shit.
1	1526306437	21	And yet. It’s the dominant blogging “platform”. 
1	1526309680	11	30% of the web is powered by WordPress. At Least. I use it and love it. I don't have coding skill, but it allows me to do what I want fairly easy. 
1	1526310163	9	Basically 50% of e-commerce stores use WordPress. It's like the Android of websites. You can pick & choose exactly want you want your website to look like, with zero coding skills required. 
1	1526308554	6	It's great for people who don't know programming but just want to create a simple website. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's shit.
0	1526306175	-12	no, please do something less complicated.
0	1526298092	-28	300 words to describe "ARK creates a platform for connecting different blockchains"What a waste of time 
1	1526307934	12	Ahh forgot you had the "Verg fanboi" tag did you?
0	1526309578	-29	Cardano will be the only project that survives. Every other coin will get hacked  or have its governance system completely collapse the network. Delegated proof of shit
1	1526314597	2	Cardano has the track record doesn't it?.. oh wait
2	1526318561	-1	Irrelevant when Ark doesnt have much complicated tech yet either
