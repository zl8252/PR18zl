0	1526797494	439	If BCH is a big threat that can single handedly take down a fragile BTC, then BTC deserves to have it happen to it.
1	1526798634	53	It sucks really, because as Satoshi designed BTC, who ever had the largest chain would adopt the BTC name. He was very open to the idea that Bitcoin would continue to change, drastically. Over time The Bitcoin that started would be a faint memory of the much better Bitcoin that is. However, BCH, while it was a great change to Bitcoin and actually addressed many of the presenting problems, the figure faces behind BCH made it untrustworthy. So now, instead of Bitcoin adapting it created this 'us vs them' mentality. I don't think Satoshi could have predicted that, but it is human nature and ultimately why Bitcoin will never live up to Satoshis vision.
2	1526805454	91	>	However, BCH, while it was a great change to Bitcoin and actually addressed many of the presenting problems, the figure faces behind BCH made it untrustworthy.I thought the idea behind crypto was that no one person or group has control so how do figure faces make it untrustworthy?
3	1526816530	33	Exactly this. Anyone can audit and see that the code is not nefarious by any means, and in crypto the code is essentially law.
3	1526806056	52	Because people think it does.
4	1526818958	14	This is so frustrating to everyone who just wants to support a PROJECT (like BCH) but gets shutdown because you get labeled a sockpuppet of some controversial figure.
5	1526837869	6	That’s because of the tactics people like roger are using... when bitcoin.com sells BCH under the name bitcoin. Anyone on the fence will think that’s as shady as it gets. If you believe in your project then you should t have to lie to get people to buy it. This is the sole reason I jumped off the fence and decided I will never buy BCH again
6	1526845021	1	hey dude u still collect silver?
5	1526838174	-1	Casual bcash supporters aren't too bad, the "sockpuppets" are the people who come in here shouting about how blockstream is evil and then calling bitcoin "bitcoin legacy" while calling bcash "bitcoin (bch)".
4	1526813969	12	"Perception becomes reality" is a truism for life.
4	1526818928	2	It does what?
5	1526827413	1	Perception becomes reality. 
3	1526821833	6	That's a problem in both BTC and BCH. Blockstream on one side and the Jihan&co on the other. Both projects are controlled by very few hands and that's their biggest risk for both. A couple of missteps and they will be doomed.It's natural selection. Time will put each in their place as well as the alts. 
4	1526837178	2	That's wrong about "Jihan&co". They don't control BCH, BCH development is very spread out.
3	1526823928	4	That is the idea of it. Which is why it's poisonous when people like Roger Ver go on mainstream news programs and be made out to be the 'CEO of Bitcoin' and 'Bitcoin Jesus'. The general population doesn't know that crypto is supposed to be decentralised, and so actually believes that he is the CEO of Bitcoin and believe everything he says. Which is not a good thing when he uses that influence to aid his pumps and dumps and give crypto as a whole a bad name. He is part of the reason casual people call crypto a Ponzi scheme and don't take it seriously. 
4	1526842683	2	Roger Ver *is* Bitcoin Jesus and denying that is creating an alternate revisionist history where his role in the adoption of Bitcoin is diminished. The personal attacks on him amount to libel and need to stop, they diminish those who traffic in them. Listen to Andreas.
4	1526826418	7	Tbh that's the media's fault for not doing at research, also he _is_ the CEO of Bitcoin.com isn't he? So that's probably correct 
5	1526836794	-2	But people will think he is the CEO of Bitcoin, which he isnt. Its misguiding investors.
6	1526837478	2	theres no misguiding, ceo of bitcoin.com does not equal ceo of bitcoin, no1 claims that he is. bitcoin jesus? that man has done more fot BTC than anyone other than satoshi himself. Rogers a hero. That man stick up for whats right, even if that means supporting a hard fork that saves the integrity of bitcoin while being labeled crazy like many other minority positions in history. but if history teaches us anything, the majority is usually wrong.
7	1526838245	0	>but if history teaches us anything, the majority is usually wrong.oh i'd love some examples
8	1526839955	1	too lazy, just google it.
9	1526839976	2	oh and here https://www.blockpress.com/you cant be censored here :D
9	1526839995	-1	lmao exactly
3	1526821890	-3	Satoshi never saw massively centralized miners becoming a thing.
4	1526824728	15	He mentioned in the white paper that mining will naturally move from desktop computers to server halls. So it was expected. As long as no one miner owns \>50&#37; of the hashing power, it's per definition "decentralized".
5	1526831642	1	There's been some close calls in the past with the 50% attack. So long as the community stays alert, we should be ok.
3	1526824423	-5	you think bcash isnt controlled by the mining chinese hitler guy?
2	1526805795	31	> it is human nature and ultimately why Bitcoin will never live up to Satoshis vision.You can switch the word Bitcoin with any religion and Satoshi with any prophet and you'll get the reason why we have religious wars of people who claim to serve the same God. 
3	1526806596	7	Amen.
4	1526806961	19	Ramen.
2	1526808202	33	> He was very open to the idea that Bitcoin would continue to change, drasticallyWas he also open to the idea that a couple of people would start controlling the main discussion places and force their opinion about Bitcoin on to everybody and then ban people? Yeah I am looking at you /r/bitcoin. -
3	1526809835	7	This is dumb.  Satoshi never programmed Bitcoin to rely on what people say on centralized forums.  These forums are examples as to why we have something like bitcoin.  The "main discussion" is what's happening between nodes.
4	1526815845	14	Bitcointalk is under the exact same censorship
5	1526830391	-1	What does that have to do with his comment?
2	1526801544	15	Well it was probably envisioned to have an evolutionary ecosystem of competing cryptocurrencies... Since without competition, there would be no trying out different approaches and the best one winning in the end.And currently as I see it, Bitcoin is definitely not the best approach. By a longshot.
3	1526803936	-10	Roger ver is the problem. Not bchThat's sad 
4	1526826531	1	He isn't even a developer how can he be a problem? He's just famous and rich
5	1526835133	1	He makes it look bad. At least from. My pov
3	1526822721	-2	This idea is flawed. Experimentation and mutation happens without competition all the time. The never ending ideal to make the best product you can is mutually exclusive. This idea is spoon fed to people so that the agendas of corporatism can continue to pushed without resistance. Competition absolutely has advantages... and disadvantages. And it is not an end all solution by any stretch. 
4	1526823443	1	Well yeah it is obviously a terrible system, since it was in effect in nature for billions of years and has resulted in humans.
5	1526824780	1	Firstly, you seemed to have a reading comprehension issue since I didn’t say anything like this, Mr. Strawman. Where did I say it was a “terrible system”? It absolutely has been in effect in nature for billions of years. And character displacement (evolutionary trait derived from competition for resources) almost assuredly played a role in human evolution. But it is not the only trait that evolution has. Nor is character displacement the sole reason that “resulted in humans”. This is also wrong. Evolution is not solely based on character displacementCooperation also plays a major role in evolution. As does just the randomized mutation from natural progression of a species. Such as this huge study here:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24362572/They found little evidence that character displacement was responsible for differences in the species if the ages of the species are taken into account. That is, given enough time, species tend to diverge, or become more different from each other, even without interspecies competition.But, getting back to the original point. I didn’t say it was “terrible”. No need to turn into a drama queen. I simply rebutted your notion that it is the alpha and omega. It is not the ONLY path to progression. Just one possible path among several. All with their advantages and disadvantages. 
6	1526845320	1	Well I was obviously being facetious. Kind of.
2	1526801461	12	> instead of Bitcoin adapting it created this 'us vs them' mentalityIt is really crazy, isn't it? I guess it was bound to happen, there was in-fighting as early as 2015 about how to scale Bitcoin, and no 'consensus' was made, and BCH became a thing. Now the free market is deciding. The market shows us true consensus. 
3	1526820677	2	There was in fighting as early as 2013. People were discussing LN in 2011. 
2	1526813278	10	You act like satoshi had some grand vision of exactly how everything would play out. Dude probably just thought "hey this could work, let's see where it goes"."Satoshi's vision" is a joke. He couldn't have predicted any of what has happened e.g. BTC at >$1 probably. You all give him too much credit, it's embarrassing. 
3	1526837613	1	or, its divine intervention to guide the human race in the right direction.not that it hasnt been done before in history.
3	1526819385	0	Exactly. The whole point is that the idea stands on its own merit and consensus takes it from there. The "Satoshi's Vision circlejerk" is getting out of hand
3	1526819521	0	The irony is that this is the precise reason why Satoshi avoided becoming a public figure in the first place.  But I guess fools will find someone to place on a pedestal regardless.
4	1526839450	3	Source?
2	1526811814	4	Your two paragraphs are at odds with eachother. If Satoshi thought that whoever is running the biggest chain is BTC, then that must account for exactly this situation. 
2	1526803582	8	This fight proves that bitcoin has already lived up to his expectations. If we had bent over to the Core tactics that would have been the an irreversible defeat for him. This fork proved that satoshi leaving the project was justified in the way that these changes then organically and democratically took place. Bitcoin is noone's and has to survive with all the burden that comes with that statement, that's why he left. And the real bitcoin looks to be doing quite well these past few days.\>  the figure faces behind BCH made it untrustworthyISIS supports medicine, hence medicine is badOK brother I will not even attempt to untangle the convoluted fallacy in that statement. BCh is still a p2p decentralized community that has no "figure faces". It just betrays your centralized approach towards bitcoin. If you saw it truly as it is, you would know that forks are disagreements. They would be scams if you were dealing with shit like Ripple or Apple.  And you've got to respect disagreement until you research and find out they aren't respect worthy. Have you done that? Come back when you have.
3	1526807344	12	It's clear that it was "decided" by certain people very early on that BCH had to be attacked. The "bcash" slur was created well before Roger started getting so much hate for "scamming" people. 
4	1526813252	-7	Bcash is not a slur. Roger Ver is trying to convince people it is. It’s one of the many strange things he is doing.
5	1526814466	11	It is not so much a slur as it is social engineering. Take the "bitcoin" out of the name to distance it from the bitcoin project. BCH is 2 less letters to type and the vast majority of people that actually uses BCH and ALL of the developers call it Bitcoin Cash or BCH. The only people that use the name bcash are people that either don't know/care any different or people with an agenda to discredit the project. Edit grammar.
6	1526814763	-8	What an odd narrative.
7	1526819147	9	So then why do you take the time to type out Bcash when BCH is so much easier?
7	1526826821	3	Who's pushing a narrative? You can just type BCH instead of bcash
5	1526816900	5	It is a slur, don't try that "its easier to say" bullshit. Ethereum Classic gets called by it's proper name just fine and yet it has double the syllables of Bitcoin Cash. It was just another play by small blockers to try and retain their power over bitcoin. Bitcoin having a hard fork and taking part of the community with it threatened their hold on power and so they came up with Bcash as a way to try and delegitimize it.
5	1526814005	3	It is a slur, it's to detract from the significance of Bitcoin cash. Regarding Roger, not too sure what you mean. He's the straightest shooter you can likely get. 
6	1526814286	-10	No, btrash is a slur. Bcash is easier to say. That’s why it’s bizarre that roger convinced people it’s a slur.Other strange things roger has done include screaming about dying babies, being upset about bcash while constantly calling Btc bitcoin core, and booking himself on CNBC as bitcoin Jesus.
7	1526820482	3	Bcash is a full node implementation of Bitcoin Cash. Do you seriously not know the difference between a software project and a currency? https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcash
7	1526814395	2	There's Bitcoin core and Bitcoin cash.Both the main forks of the original Bitcoin. 
8	1526814687	8	No
9	1526815850	5	Care to elaborate how that isn't the case?Only thing I could imagine is you could define both Bitcoin core and Bitcoin cash as the most significant "chains" of the original Bitcoin. That however is a technicality of a word, and doesn't change the situation in the real world.
5	1526842692	1	It's not a slur in the same way the n word is an objective way to refer to black people in an isolated society. Unfortunately we're not in an isolated society, and slurs are always loaded with historical context. 
5	1526826213	1	The irony of you replying to a post that calls Bitcoin “Core” despite it not being part of its name at all, but calling those who say “Bcash”, a shortening of *B*itcoin *Cash*”, is laughable
6	1526826986	1	Ummm it is Called Bitcoin Core. Download Bitcoin wallet, the wallet version says: Bitcoin Core vXXXXX
7	1526838998	0	So why isn't BCH referred to as Bitcoin ABC?If I use Electrum wallet, is bitcoin called "Electrum"? Your point makes no sense.
8	1526839704	1	Ones a reference client, ones a popular client. 
9	1526840666	-1	So you acknowledge that the network isn't named after the most popular piece of node software?Bitcoin Core is only the "reference" implementation because the community agrees it is (i.e. it's very popular).
6	1526828341	0	Wow, I forgot how many bcash weirdos there are. Bizarre.
5	1526826794	1	bcash is the node.js implementation of bitcoin cash. 
5	1526841542	1	I just call it bcash because i don't like typing out the full name, plus it helps keep people from accidentally thinking bcash is bitcoin.
6	1526842125	2	> I just call it bcash because i don't like typing out the full name, plus it helps keep people from accidentally thinking bcash is bitcoin.HAAAAAAA!!!!  Dude that joke is totally not old and tired.  And still totally creative and witty. You Core trolls need some new material.  My favorite part is that you literally retyped it, verbatim. Any original thoughts in that noggin of yours?
7	1526843110	1	>You Core trolls need some new materialI hold no bitcoin, haven't since early 2017. I also hold no bcash. I just don't like bcash fans getting mad at people calling it bcash, but then they go around going "muh bitcoin (BCH)" or calling Bitcoin "bcore".Bcash will be Bitcoin when it has the larger chain with more accumulated PoW. Until then, it is bcash and bcashers MUST accept this.
3	1526806836	-12	The figure faces DID make it untrustworthy. There is no fallacy here. An angry ex con backed this coin using an untrustworthy website. Did you forget about the bch x coinbase pump?
4	1526807692	10	Again, ISIS loves medicine, so medicine is bad. Read that sentence againt his time and maybe it makes a bit more sense to you. Besides, did you forget Core censoring a huge section of the community into changing something that was always implicitly on the table? Did you forget the DDOS on Bitcoin XT? Did you forget a p2p people's system being converted overnight through shady meetings and dev conferences into a store of value bank bitch? of course you did, but you remember the coinbase pump of bch to a value it fully deserves.I actually loved the bch coinbase pump. Please let me know if you're under some delusion this is not a war. Coinbase declaring support for bch was one of the most important moments for bch, and I have 0 problems with it. 
5	1526810305	8	Probably wasting your breath. None of that matters because remember, one guy who isnt a dev, sold some firecrackers. 
6	1526810848	4	lol most expensive firecrackers for humanity
2	1526804252	1	really well put
2	1526818451	3	It wasn't anything at bitcoin cash that created an us and them mentality.It was several years of ejecting everyone who didn't agree with Blockstreams business plan from the community that created this divide.
2	1526801542	3	Wtf, no. I am in the party that believes alt coins will eventually gain dominance over both BTC and BCH, but at least I understand that it was BTC that was trying to evolve with the implementation of SegWit, as well as implementation of Lightning, whereas BCH was resisting change and only increasing the blocksize.If you believe that Satoshi wanted bitcoin to be ever evolving, he would have supported BTC over BCH (ignoring all of the other technical advancements that some alt coins are implementing).
3	1526810468	13	Do you even Satoshi bro?http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/485/> It can be phased in, like:> > If (blocknumber > 115000) maxblocksize = largerlimit> > It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.> > When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.
4	1526811883	11	I think most of the people fighting the idea of bigger blocks weren't around in the earlier days and just don't know any better since they've been mislead by the "core" developers. But that also shouldn't be an excuse when you can just look up what Satoshi has said in the past as you just did.
5	1526814770	5	Yes it is difficult when you hear and accept people who are your peers or people you respect say something and you take it to heart. Only later you learn maybe they didn't know any better or maybe they have their own agenda. I have no problem with people who think they can do better than Satoshi because (they) he was only human. But don't piss in my coffee and tell me its milk. If you want to change BTC to be some ultra payment network for banks and not to put banking in the hands of everyone in the world then just be honest and say so. You can not have it both ways. You can not say... we are following satoshi's true vision and in the next breath say bitcoin isn't for people who make less than $2 a day.
3	1526827858	1	I'm not against LN or SegWit, I'm against how it was implemented, blocks were full for two years and Core never even considered a temporary block increase, when that was the logical solution. After all it's the _max size_ parameter that changes, blocks wouldn't be that size unless strictly needed.
3	1526838954	0	>Wtf, no. I am in the party that believes alt coins will eventually gain dominance over both BTC and BCHright? Bitcoin and bcash are arguing over who can do what in a less shitty way, meanwhile most of us aren't blinded and just moved on to the future.
2	1526801942	4	Not sure what you mean about “trust”. I focus on the project. The technology. You focus on the people? I think it’s time to move on from that. That’s the whole point. Nobody is controlling BCH, unlike the obvious control Blockstream Inc has over Bitcoin Core (BTC). That whole narrative is part of the misinformation campaign they are using to discredit BCH as it poses a threat to [their profit model](https://youtu.be/cFOmUm-_DMQ).  BCH is a decentralized group of multiple independent development teams.  And if you were referring to Roger? He wasn’t even a BCH supporter when it was first being proposed.  He was backing a different implementation entirely.  There were MANY, because [the entire bitcoin industry was fed up with Core](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf) deliberately killing Bitcoin.
3	1526838756	-1	> their profit modellmao that link....interviewer: "so is the goal to make money, or make money?"blockstream guy: "well the goal for everything is to make money"yup total conspiracy 
2	1526830160	1	this is pretty much how i feel
2	1526814900	1	> However, BCH, while it was a great change to Bitcoin and actually addressed many of the presenting problems, the figure faces behind BCH made it untrustworthy.Clearly only a small minority agreed BCH was a great change and that's why it is being controlled by only a few figure faces. This is why Bitcoin is resistant to unwanted changes and it's the reason why people are able to trust the code instead of a few people injecting changes that have no consensus behind them.
3	1526826719	3	Well, the Bitcoin GitHub is _litterally_ controlled by 1 guy.Actually, on that sense, Bitcoin is in danger as 93% (I think) of people use the Core implementation so a bug on it could render 93% of the nodes offline.
2	1526825975	1	How is forcing people to download gigabytes of data per day a good idea? It increases centralization and lowers the number of people who can run nodes. It's not a great change and it doesn't truly scale. 
3	1526839733	2	Who's forcing anyone? Don't want to? Don't.
3	1526827593	1	You can't quite measure centralization, anyone calling centralization is bullshit.And I agree, on chain scaling isn't forever but hey ETH chain increases 5GB _per day_ and they're doing fine, that's 35 times more data! Seriously, a 2MB or 8MB increase is nothing, and the fact that Core failed to increase block size even temporarily for TWO YEARS that it was full shows- their incompetence - their motives (like if they _need_ small blocks)I like the tech, I do and I'm currently learning LN and SegWit, but it does feel like they're pushing an agenda when a block size was imminent.
4	1526828139	-1	Bitcoin is for everyone. Not just people who can afford or have available a solid enough internet connection to handle massive data downloads. 144 MB per day is already difficult for some people. So maybe excluding large swaths of humanity isn't "increased centralization" by whatever definition but we need to think about everyone. 
5	1526828453	1	Well that again contradicts Core, in 2015 50% of the world could handle **25MB** blocks (You only need a 5Mbps link).Also on chain means you can use remote nodes, for free, only when you need to spend. In LN you can't as you need to constantly be online or hire a watchtower service in case an evil party tries to cheat.
2	1526822288	0	*longest valid chainSatoshi did not design the system such that miners have the right to change consensus rules any time they want by mining a longer chain. If that were the case, you can say good bye to the 21m cap. Miners would prefer steady Keynesian style inflation to the "gold mining simulator" model we have currently with diminishing block rewards.If you want to change consensus rules you need to get the whole community including users and economic nodes onboard. You need a supermajority of miners, users, developers and economic nodes (i.e. shops and people who receive the coin).It's really, really hard to change consensus rules. That was intentional. In fact, that's probably the single main problem that BTC solved: how to have a p2p system with a stable set of rules that is very, very difficult to corrupt.
3	1526839530	1	As a matter of fact he did expect miners to be able to change consensus rules. Right in the white paper it says miners choose which blocks are valid by extending upon them. What keeps them from enlarging the cap or giving themselves coins is profit. Doing so would destroy their investments. This is v simple stuff.
4	1526839981	-1	There are a few problems in the whitepaper where he was vague and clarified later. He said "the longest proof of work chain" was bitcoin.There are a few problems with this: it doesn't specify "most accumulated proof of work" just "most blocks". This was an actual mistake he made in the code too, he fixed it in a later commit.The miner is limited to choosing a block to build on which will be considered valid by other nodes (i.e. it follows consensus rules). The usual BCH narrative here is "only miners are the 'nodes' mentioned in the whitepaper, users should be using SPV wallets".That doesn't matter for two reasons: you have to be sure you don't break the consensus rules so thoroughly that even SPV nodes reject your blocks (some, not all consensus rules are/can-be checked by SPV wallets). So even in this (incredibly distorted from original intent) interpretation, you are still restrained by users and economic nodes as to what consensus rules you can change, thus disproving the "it's a miner CPU-power democracy" argument.Secondly "the whitepaper" or "satoshi said" is a theological argument, not a technical argument, and satoshi himself would have despised being treated in this way. He put a huge amount of effort into not being a charismatic leader whose word was law.A whitepaper is not like a constitution. It is not an eternal description of system that cannot be deviated from. A whitepaper is a description of a prototype that states that, under some naive, conservative assumptions, such a system is feasible. It **does not** state that no tweaks which are more optimal can ever be found.We know a lot more now than Satoshi did when he designed the system. A lot of research has been done into the effects of tweaking various parameters.

This was an actual mistake he made in the code too, he fixed it in a later commit.It's quite clear what he meant, again, in the whitepaper:"The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence ofevents witnessed, **but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.**">The miner is limited to choosing a block to build on which will be considered valid by other nodesFalse.

Satoshi created Bitcoin. He wrote his whitepaper which provides a technical description/definition of Bitcoin. Especially he outlined the reasons for Bitcoin, what its goals are, and what problems it aims to solve. If Bitcoin Core no longer meets those goals or tries to solve those problems, it's not Bitcoin.>satoshi himself would have despised being treated in this waytangible arguments, please.
6	1526843595	0	> "The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power."Sure, but they have to follow consensus rules. Answer me this: if Ethereum ever reaches a state where it has a higher accumulated PoW than Bitcoin, would it *be* Bitcoin? Its chain would fit your definition. If you answer no to that question then you acknowledge that *valid* chain is important.> False. The miner can choose to build off of whatever block he desires. It's in his best financial interest to build off blocks that the majority of other miners will agree with.Doesn't matter if the users (even those running SPV wallets) reject his chain as invalid. The consensus rules are a real thing. Sorry. That's just a fact.> No you don't.Yes, you do. About the only consensus rule an SPV wallet can't check is block size. You can't include invalid transactions, spend coins that don't exist, etc. You can spend coins that don't exist, but only to other conspirators, as soon as you send it to someone whose SPV wallet back-checks the inputs that made that UTXO, then you're fucked.And even if you were correct, you've just proved why (some) users running full validating nodes is important for the health of the network. Your position is a catch 22 that destroys your narrative either way. The "SPV wallets are safe" narrative of BCHers is actually predicated on the fact that there are only a few ways that you *can* fool SPV wallets.> No it isn't. Satoshi created Bitcoin. He wrote his whitepaper which provides a technical description/definition of Bitcoin. Especially he outlined the reasons for Bitcoin, what its goals are, and what problems it aims to solve. If Bitcoin Core no longer meets those goals or tries to solve those problems, it's not Bitcoin.He's been gone since 2011. It's ours now. This isn't a company, just like the HTTP protocol doesn't belong to Tim Berners Lee.> If Bitcoin Core no longer meets those goals or tries to solve those problems, it's not Bitcoin.You just defined the longest proof of work chain as "bitcoin" and said that that was what Satoshi intended. This is a contradiction of that point. You stated that the "only" thing that defines bitcoin was the most accumulated proof of work on a chain with any set of consensus rules. Now you're saying that a lesser-PoW chain can "be bitcoin" if it meets your subjective criteria. That seems very convenient.> tangible arguments, please.Exactly how I feel about "Satoshi said x".
7	1526844240	0	> Sure, but they have to follow consensus rules. Answer me this: if Ethereum ever reaches a state where it has a higher accumulated PoW than Bitcoin, would it be Bitcoin? Its chain would fit your definition. If you answer no to that question then you acknowledge that valid chain is important.No because it isn't Bitcoin. It contains different PoW algo, different blockchain, doesn't begin at the genesis block, etc. you're reaching and the fact that youre reaching so far should say enough.>Doesn't matter if the users (even those running SPV wallets) reject his chain as invalid. The consensus rules are a real thing. Sorry. That's just a fact.does matter. if you cant move your coins on the chain you want to be on, then your chain is defunct. that said, miners certainly need to keep user sentiment in mind when making decisions because that directly influences the value of their coin and thus the return on their massive investments.>Yes, you do.no you don't. spv wallets can update.>He's been gone since 2011. It's ours now.yes. ours. not yours. ours. not mine. ours. you can't pick and choose what i consider to be bitcoin or not. i consider bitcoin to still be described by satoshi's whitepaper.
8	1526844764	1	> No because it isn't Bitcoin. It contains different PoW algo, different blockchain, doesn't begin at the genesis block, etc. you're reaching and the fact that youre reaching so far should say enough.i.e.... one could say..... it has different consensus rules that make its chain invalid.Your position is very confused. The PoW system (the difficulty rules and primitive hash function) *are* consensus rules. You said that miners can change consensus rules by mining a chain with more accumulated difficulty. They can change hash function then surely? We can compare difficulty across hash functions. The chain would just have to have more accumulated PoW to be valid.Bitcoin Cash already changed the PoW algorithm (they changed the difficulty rules, which are the other essential component of PoW, just as important as which hash function is used, maybe more important). Without the difficulty rules, a SHA-256 hash is just a number, you've no way of knowing if there's enough 0s to be a valid PoW solution.Also chain splits occur all the time where two blocks are found at the same time. At some point one chain ends up with an extra block though. If someone started a new chain (maybe aliens with huge hashrate) from a new genesis block and gave it more accumulated PoW, then it now *is* bitcoin even as per the current consensus rules (actually not quite true cos of the checkpoint system, but we'll ignore that for now). By your definition of "bitcoin", Ethereum would become Bitcoin when it was the chain with most work. The current BTC chain would be orphaned all the way back to the genesis block and past it.> does matter. if you cant move your coins on the chain you want to be on, then your chain is defunct. that said, miners certainly need to keep user sentiment in mind when making decisions because that directly influences the value of their coin and thus the return on their massive investments.Miners mine on the chain which is most valuable. Hashrate follows price. Sure, miners can split off and generate proofs of work on some other chain that users and economic nodes don't agree is bitcoin... but they'd lose a fuck load of money doing so.> no you don't. spv wallets can update.exactly, and miners can't force them to just by hard forking. This is the crux of my point.> yes. ours. not yours. ours. not mine. ours. you can't pick and choose what i consider to be bitcoin or not. i consider bitcoin to still be described by satoshi's whitepaper.There is not one single thing about BTC that doesn't match what's described in the whitepaper. And if you chose to view BCH as "bitcoin" then, by your own actions, you void your argument that "the longest proof of work chain is Bitcoin" since that is BTC. It's your choice whether to be logically consistent in your arguments.
3	1526825535	0	It's greatest strength is also it's greatest weakness.
4	1526827413	3	I completely disagree, but we're entering the realm of the subjective now, so there's no point continuing the discussion.
2	1526809738	-7	> However, BCH, while it was a great change to Bitcoin and actually addressed many of the presenting problemsIt didn't really - the idea of just raising the block size was never viable. Segwit was the better solution from a technological view. Which has born out in how fees are now low, and it enabled the lightning network to come in to solve the "bitcoin-coffee" problem.   Additionally, bitcoin clones with more space for transactions already existed (LTC). BCH was an attempt by rogue miners to take over.
3	1526824183	2	>BCH was an attempt by rogue miners to take over.I haven't seen any BCH supporters explain this yet. They always seem to ignore this fact: that bitmain threw in their support behind BCH because segwit removed the mining advantage they had with Bitcoin.
2	1526804056	-4	If Satoshi did not predict this, he was stupid - This is basic human nature and you need to be tabula rasa not to be able to predict that people will fight over something valuable :D This is psychology and sociology 101 - that people will force their vision on the things . So not expecting fighting over bitcoins future would be really really stupid a i do not believe that satoshi was a complete fool :D 
1	1526830121	2	this is exactly how andreas feels... he has said things similar to this many times
1	1526811377	3	BCH is a threat purely from a brand perspective (not technologically). They own Bitcoin.com and r/BTC. They muddy the water confusing users which causes further damage. That's why I will never support BCash, deception is an obvious strategy in their marketing.
2	1526828101	13	And that's why censorship is bad. You can't post anything even remotely accurate stating Bitcoin Cash in r/Bitcoin, where an informative post about both chains and their respective stances would clear things up for everyone.Also Roger Ver isn't BCH, if he's doing dirty moves well that's on him, there's a real community devoted to the development of BCH
2	1526814921	12	It is a question of perspective. For many of us the deception started years ago when was scaling methods were allowed to be openly discussed was violently silenced. I agree there have been some less than ideal tactics done on the BCH side.. but it pales in comparison to was has been done by the BTC side.
1	1526848547	1	All I can say is that I regret it every time I transfer via BTC because it costs more and takes a long time.  I've transferred with at least a dozen other cryptos and all were significantly faster and cheaper than BTC.  You would think that the Original Bitcoin, with the longest time under development, by far, would be way ahead of its competition.  But the sad, inconvenient truth is anything but.  It's literally the slowest, one of the most expensive, anxiety producing cryptos to use.   And it's the "King of Crypto".  Maybe if you analogize it to a chessboard, that moniker makes more sense.  Move one space every turn, trying not to get checkmated, while other pieces cross the entire board and destroy competition.
1	1526806082	-6	BCH genuinly isn't a threat to BTC, I've seen many altcoins come and go that are supposed to overtake BTC but none of them ever have the same network effect to take over.They may ALL be technically better, but that's all irreverent when you have a small network.My issued with BCH isn't the network, I welcome anyone to fork the BTC chain, as they have the right to do. I have my issues with certain individuals targeting, and playing the victim game to discredit BTC. All whilst milking it for all they can. 
1	1526837525	-1	There is a difference between BCH being the biggest threat and being the biggest threat that can actually do something. At the moment BCH is the biggest threat, even though they can't do anything, because they are the only ones attacking BTC at this moment. Once governments start attacking BTC, then we will have bigger threats. 
1	1526806008	-8	If BTC goes down then Ether goes down with it, and every other crypto
2	1526806691	7	LoL I didn't know everything ran on the bitcoin blockchain.
3	1526824536	0	It's nothing to do with the blockchain. It's everything to do with crypto's reputation. And it depends when it happens. If BTC price was to plummet to $1 tomorrow, do you really think that ETH would stay at $700? Of course it wouldn't. Investors would just lose faith in crypto as a whole and the news media would slate it as that. New money would be afraid to go into any crypto for a long time. Be that BTC or alts. 
2	1526813358	2	In the short term.
0	1526799840	60	I don't really have a problem with BCH the coin itself. If anyone disagrees with the way Bitcoin is headed, they're perfectly welcome to do a fork and do what they think is best and let them battle it out among users.While I think the various tactics employed by Bitcoin.com (and a few on the BTC side if I'm being honest) are underhanded, I think they're necessary and a good test for Bitcoin as a whole.Some Bitcoin maximalists like to call it a money badger or act like BTC is invincible, but really it's still very early days and it might have been battle tested more than other cryptocurrencies, there are still many more threats and tests that it should face before it could really become a bona fide world currency. I certainly wouldn't want Bitcoin to reach $500k then find out that it was easily dethroned or devalued and have many more people than already have losing their life's savings or worse.
1	1526806051	22	The reason for being a maximalist is that *you don't switch to a new ledger just because you disagree with the direction of a project*. Anyone familiar with the concept of sound money and its importance should immediately see why zeroing out the ledger is a non-starter. You cannot have sound money if it requires active management and constant research into the latest altcoins. This means that the kind of maximalism that matters is *ledger* maximalism. It's equivalent to supporting sound money. And ledger maximalism doesn't choose a side between BTC and BCH, as they both preserve the ledger as of the date of the split. Investors don't need to choose sides; their wealth is preserved no matter which is victorious. BTC doesn't need to be invincible for the Bitcoin dream to stay alive. Just one of BCH or BTC does. (BTG and the rest changed the ledger with their premines, and aren't serious contenders in any case. If they were, they would be included in this calculus, however. They would just be more options and ways for Bitcoin to succeed.)Investors certainly can choose sides if they want to, but the choice is on them. Anyone who slept through the split still has both. Bitcoin is BCH+BTC. In terms of the Bitcoin ledger, which is the Bitcoin money.
2	1526817815	17	Everything you said makes sense for people who got in prior to the fork, but any people who came after the split are forced to choose one side, or buy both and if one side dies, they could end up losing a chunk of money.
3	1526828617	6	But at this point both sides could die due to a yet-unknown alt coin so the risk is always there
4	1526833147	3	True.
4	1526837745	1	So I should buy no coins or all the coins?
2	1526815014	4	Well said.
2	1526823804	-1	Frankly you can never have sound money with any public ledger crypto. It will never work. And if transactions can be linked between senders you won't have sound money. Sound money comes from privacy on the blockchain and fungibility. The coins with a possibility of becoming sound money are privacy coins. They are really electronic cash. And the crypto which has the best chance of that is monero. But obviously even that needs to be tested and retested constantly to maintain its privacy and status as actual cash. No coin is perfect. 
3	1526828568	1	Money has become much broader than this.  It has mutated into a new concept thanks to bitcoin. Sure, if you want fungibility, you go for privacy. However if you want trust-less, privacy will only hinder this feature. Trust-less needs transparency to prove money went somewhere when someone claims they sent it. Fungibility's biggest con is it's a criminal's wet dream and this won't fly with every country, company, or person. At the same time,  this is why fungibility and privacy are important to protect your wealth from tyranny and use your right to privacy. This is programmable money and you can have as many different kinds that you want that also have the chance to be a good currency.
1	1526802394	-14	There was nothing underhanded about their tactics. It is a fork, and they strongly believe it is what bitcoin was supposed to be. So they are perfectly entitled, as per the free market model, to call it Bitcoin. There was no deception, dishonesty, or anything of the sort. They clearly differentiate between BCH and BTC. Even calling one bitcoin cash, and the other one bitcoin core.  So nobody gets confused.  The narrative that there was dishonesty involved is complete horseshit from people who have an agenda.
2	1526806532	21	Nobody calls the cryptocurrency Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core" except Bitcoin Cash adherents. As for clearly differentiating between them, that is demonstrably untrue with frequent references to "Bitcoin (BCH)" and Bitcoin.com not too long ago differentiating between them as [Bitcoin (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC)](https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2018/05/Dbf7z0RV4AEWvqU.jpg). To me, Bitcoin Cash is the superior cryptocurrency from a technical standpoint compared to Bitcoin. Especially with the latest fork, nobody can deny it. And people who want BCH to replace BTC have every right to muddy the waters, to attempt to claim the Bitcoin name etc. Not everyone does that, but some do. Really, it's just two (or more) very vested interests duking it out. But don't pretend that there isn't dishonesty involved in the struggle. And not just from BCH's side, there's plenty from BTC's side as well.
2	1526806731	10	>There was no deception, dishonesty, or anything of the sort. They clearly differentiate between BCH and BTC. Even calling one bitcoin cash, and the other one bitcoin core. So nobody gets confused. Wut. Can you say that again for the people looking at bitco.in.com and the Bitcoin Twitter?If you really wanted to differentiate yourself its simple. Just call yourself BitcoinCash everywhere. But its not happening. Because? 
3	1526808150	-2	Because Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin for some of us. I've been on this train since early 2013 and I believe it. BCH is the coin I was originally rooting for back then.
4	1526808263	9	there was no BCH back then.
5	1526828673	2	Technically... 
5	1526808366	0	[removed]
6	1526808885	6	Thats fine. You want big blocks, you get big blocks. But that was not what the majority of the chain wanted. So you're free to make a coin with a bigger block. no problems in that. That was never the problem.Do you know what the problem is?
7	1526809358	1	The majority of the chain just goes where the money is. It's dictated by a bunch of Chinese miners who couldn't give a shit about what they're mining as long as it's profitable. I fully expect either Ethereum or BCH be top dog in a couple of years from now once they've built up.
8	1526809906	-4	if you think BCH is not owned by Chinese miners.... I got some bad news for you..
9	1526810217	6	I never said that. If you actually read my comment you would see that I implied that they will move over to BCH when it is more profitable to mine. I'm saying that the longest chain is a false measure of legitimacy when the landscape is purely profit-focused.And neither coin is owned by anyone. That's the entire point of being decentralized in the first place.
6	1526811132	3	AutoMod removed my comment for linking to an external sub. This is what it said (with the link to my first comment removed)&nbsp;>It's the same transaction history. And you know I meant ideologically. And technologically for that matter.>Bitcoin was actually what got me started using Reddit. My old account was /u/GiveMeBTC. Look at the first comment I ever made. Would I buy one of the first ever ASICs if I didn't believe in the technology? >I didn't sign up for stupidly high fees, slow transactions, and the blockchain having to be on life support from an external "lightning" network.
4	1526810115	-3	You had an chance to take the network and community over via a proper consensus. You lost - that's how it works. You can't just afterwards say "but we're the real thing anyways" and then steal the name by buying domains and Twitter handles.
5	1526810707	2	I didn't have a chance to do anything. Nor did I lose anything. I actually gained money through the fork if you want to be technical. I still hold both coins (and more)There was a consensus, it was called Segwit2x. But of course it had to be called off before the other half of the deal was fulfilled. Bitcoin Cash wouldn't exist if the original plan just went through like it was intended to.Plus, neither the Bitcoin.com domain nor the @Bitcoin Twitter handle has changed hands after the fork.
6	1526814180	-1	There was no 2x consensus ... pretty much by definition else we would have 2x now. 2x were just bankers getting in a room on Wall Street and agreeing to something. Then one guy called it off - how is that consensus?  (Edit: Here is a [chart of the developers opinion](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support) on it.)Anyways, I think that was just a distraction, because the anti-Segwit group already had lost the argument. So I would rather speculate that without the 2x stunt, there wouldn't have been BCash.> I actually gained money through the fork if you want to be technical. I'm not clear on what that has to do with the topic. But I wouldn't be so sure about it - at the end BCash just took a big chunk out of the Bitcoin market cap (the cap animations recently show that well). So if you had Bitcoin, your $ wealth stayed the same. You only profit if you sell one and the other then takes over the cap again.
7	1526814848	4	IIRC the majority of nodes/miners were signalling for SegWit2X before "one guy called it off." And SegWit was only activated because the compromise was agreed to. Because the 2X never happened, SegWit should have never happened.And it's relevant because you said I lost. I didn't lose anything. I made a net gain.
8	1526815775	0	> IIRC the majority of nodes/miners were signalling for SegWit2X before "one guy called it off." And SegWit was only activated because the compromise was agreed to. Because the 2X never happened, SegWit should have never happened.Nodes and miners are not the same. The nodes did not support 2x. Consensus isn't only what miners signal. The [developers were completely against 2x](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support). As were the community/users. That one guy called it off should give you a hint that it wasn't a decision that a bigger community came together for.I think you're also getting the time-line wrong. 2x came after Segwit, not before. It was supposed to be the compromise.   I don't at all get how any of that would mean Segwit should have never happened. Pretty much everyone was for it (except the BCH people that thought it would technically not work, and the group of miners secretly using ASIC-Boost to make more profit).> And it's relevant because you said I lost. I didn't lose anything. I made a net gain.You lost the debate/consensus - that was the point. Afterwards you can't just steal the name/IP.So your financial gain isn't important here. Everyone gained financially (as I explained: at least if you don't think BCH just split the marketcap... and if you sell the right coin in time).   Also: In English "You" doesn't necessarily mean "you personally".
9	1526816510	5	Miners are required to run full nodes. So they are pretty much the same in this context.The developers are mostly from Blockstream who is developing Lightning, so of course they would be against 2X. They need fees to be high so people actually have a reason to use Lightning. I don't have the timeline wrong I said the only reason SegWit was agreed to is because 2X was also supposed to happen. Since it didn't, SegWit should have never happened. One side got what they wanted without having to follow through with the compromise.Also: In this context your "you" was directly referring to me. You said "You lost" as if I took some part in the block scaling debate. I did not. Besides, the only losers are the ones who are still emotionally tied to the neutered BTC.
5	1526822574	1	Bitcoin Unlimited had more mining support than segwit ever had, until the New York Agreement got people to agree to (what they thought was) a compromise. Wonder why the Bitcoin Core side sabotaged that one and directly caused the BCH crowd to fork off?
6	1526840590	1	I dunno - I just don't buy your setup on which you build your conclusion. Core sabotaged nothing. 2x was created by some rich people meeting up in New York. That's not how community consensus should work. They cobbled some idea together in a week and had no idea how to implement it - and ignored any input by the core developers.   Now you say the core devs "sabotaged" that... and I would say: It was never legitimate in the first place. So the core devs just ignored a silly side issue. Then one guy said "OK, well, then Segwit 2x is off" and that was the end of it. Clearly there was never any community process behind it - else one couldn't just end it like that.  That this effort got shot down by the users so clearly is one of the best things that happened to Bitcoin.
2	1526823851	-1	I don't see any H in Bitcoin. Curious choice of an abbreviation for being "Bitcoin".
0	1526804533	29	Finally something inteligent. I’m so fucking tired of seeing BTC/BCH hate posts that bring absolutely nothing good to either.
0	1526801861	34	As someone new to crypto, this in-fighting does not help the perception of crypto as a serious product looking for mass adoption. It's like two versions of OS DOS fighting it out. Be careful a crypto version of Windows may arrive and push these two fighting adolescents to the sidelines. 
1	1526819835	8	The fact that people are fighting over it proves it’s a serious product. It means there’s something worth fighting for. 
1	1526806377	31	Normal people don't care. They will just use what works. They won't even know they are using Bitcoin (Cash), they will just be spending "money" and getting paid in it. Investors will buy is because it is used and adoption is growing rapidly. Purse.io is about to switch to BCH. People will use it to save 30% on their Amazon purchases. They won't know what a scaling debate or a chain split even in.
2	1526808480	27	BCH has people going all over the world to tell everybody how great Bitcoin Cash is as money and to start accept it as money.BTC has people telling you that you should hodl it for 10 years and that it's not really money but more like a digital asset. Who do you think is going to conquer the world?
3	1526837721	5	BCH is bitcoin circa 2012.
3	1526828536	5	One thing I know is squuezed between the two, litecoin will die
4	1526830039	7	Litecoin has only one thing going for it vs BTC and BCH, the fact that it's viewed as a testbed for future BTC tech. Not the best value proposition imo.
3	1526828740	2	Boom! Nailed it!
2	1526806699	-5	I understand why it would be good to use it to save money on Amazon purchases, but what's the downside? What's the advantage of using it to buy bitcoin, at such a steep price? Isn't there possibility of fraud? Won't Amazon ban your address or account if they find out the purchases were made with stolen credit cards? 
1	1526804614	10	If anything it will drag both of them down with it and ETH will take the top spot quickly
1	1526824447	2	It is not infighting, the folks are battling for their coin  to be the market dominate because presumably it will be worth more and the winner will best serve the market. VHS vs beta, hddvd vs blueray, etc. Why would the two sides sing kumbaya when there are real impacts to either side winning out long term?
1	1526805677	0	My main gripe is bcash trying to market itself as Bitcoin and pushing Bitcoin to be Bitcoin coreI would have no problem if it gave itself another name like litecoin did
2	1526817232	9	>I would have no problem if it gave itself another name like litecoin didLitecoin is not a fork, its a clone, aka a copy paste of the bitcoin repository with a different hashing function. Its not entitled to the bitcoin name because it was never a part of the original bitcoin network.
2	1526818688	2	I understand your branding argument.   Your gripes have some merit but from there other perspective, here's why:Bitcoin core is the name of the development group who works on the BTC backend (google it).  It's the exact people who BCH are against because of forcing smaller blocks and other issues.From that perspective, it's an apt name.   More of a slur than an attempt to rebrand BTC.
2	1526806963	-3	It's not Litecoin, Litecoin is a clone of Bitcoin with some tweaks.. Bitcoin cash is a fork of Bitcoin which has good community support from what seems to be lots of early adopters of Bitcoin. Now there's two main forks of Bitcoin, Bitcoin core and Bitcoin cash. How they develop will have to be seen, but this is a decentralized process, no one owns the Bitcoin brand, what matters is the way the community goes about building the coin and it's fundamentals. 
3	1526829574	1	Bitcoin "core" is not a fork
4	1526836584	1	Why isn't it a fork?
5	1526837790	1	Because it's the original chain, it didn't fork from another chain.
6	1526838247	1	> it didn't fork from another chain.Neither did BCH. What is your point?
7	1526838762	0	Yes it did... It forked from the Bitcoin chain
8	1526838855	1	If you go from the latest BCH block back in to the past you will arrive to the bitcoin genesis block, how is that a fork of a chain?
9	1526839849	0	Exactly you go back to the *bitcoin* Genesis block, not the *bitcoin cash* Genesis block which doesn't exist because it's a fork of Bitcoin. Do you not understand what a fork is or are you being intentionally daft? 
3	1526817213	1	Yes and the coin needs to have a name so ppl don’t get confused with something that already has a relatively high barrier to entry already for the layperson. Hence *Bitcoin* and Bitcoin Cash. Core has no place in the name as it’s not the coins name. 
4	1526829148	1	One needs to be descriptive of coins. Bitcoin core and Bitcoin cash are more informative. Or would you prefer "Bitcoin non peer to peer for values less than $50" and "Bitcoin peer to peer electronic cash"?
2	1526817642	-1	So I have to ask you honestly why do you feel the need to type bcash when bch is 1 less letter? 
3	1526822927	1	It's 2 letters you friggin imbecile. SMH.Bcash rolls of the tongue and bch doesn't. Besides it's not even BCH universally - the biggest exchange (Binance) has it as BCC.When you have fucking criminals and scammers as your 'face' of your shitty fork, you deserve all the mistrust and shit that you get, it''s that simple.
4	1526823406	-5	You are indeed right! It is 2 letters. Glad you caught my mistake. I am sorry to hear that you have to type with your tongue though. But you also sort of proved my point. It is **2** less letters to type with your tongue. I imagine for someone in your... predicament... it would be even more valuable to save the extra time.

0	1526805012	27	Hi, I'm a crypto noob. So please don't flame my ass for stating my opinion.The truth is I've read some info about BTC and BCH and seems like BCH has good intentions.I just want to know why they're all fighting for the name "Bitcoin". What exactly do BCH people want BTC people to do? BTC peeps seem like they're making improvements on BTC, but different from what BCH did.Is this all just a "you do things your way, we do things ours" thing? If you ask me, it's getting childish. Is it really more complicated than "us vs. them"?
1	1526806117	11	It's really not that much more complicated. That 'us vs. them' started way back in 2015 between the small blockers and big blockers. Here is a very detailed document of the history between the two camps. https://hackernoon.com/the-great-bitcoin-scaling-debate-a-timeline-6108081dbada 
2	1526806622	3	Will read now . Thank you! :\)
1	1526837761	3	BCH wants to be left alone to grow to be perfectly frank. There is a heap of negativity towards BCH for no reason whatsoever. The most you'll hear about is 'bad actors' or 'jihan, ver, bcash btrash' blah blah blah. Never any actual arguments. The truth of the matter is Bitcoin Cash is a far closer representation of the Bitcoin whitepaper and should therefore have the better claim to the Bitcoin title. The private business called Blockstream usurped control over the Bitcoin Core network and are turning it into their own banking settlement layer, which means it's no longer Bitcoin. Bitcoin is peer-to-peer electronic cash.I remember struggling when I first got into crypto in 2015, I could not understand WTF the problem was with raising the blocksize by 1mb was. There is no problem, it was all just propaganda and FUD. They link you to those unfortunate Ver videos where a (naive) Ver was advantage of and BTC/Blockstream maximalists will lead you to believe Ver is evil, he's not. Ver is the one person in crypto you should trust, eventually with hours and hours of research (required to truly pan through all the propaganda and hate) you'll find out that Ver is pro peer-to-peer electronic Cash and thus pro Bitcoin (BCH).
2	1526839817	-1	your comment provides some content, not ignoring that, but couldn't help but notice this>There is a heap of negativity towards BCH for no reason whatsoever.>pro Bitcoin (BCH).a lot of the hate comes from the attempts to pretend bcash is bitcoin. It'll be bitcoin when it has a larger chain, and more accumulated PoW. Literally there would be no hate if the bcash fans just accepted they were a fork like bgold or bdiamond did, but they have to try and pretend they're bitcoin.
3	1526840160	2	hi I think you're confused. Bitcoin (BCH) is Bitcoin. Bcore (BTC) is not Bitcoin. Hope that clears things up for you. POW is irrelevant when Bcore (BTC) is no longer attempting to be peer-to-peer electronic cash. Bitcoin (BCH) is peer-to-peer electronic cash as described in the Bitcoin whitepaper. As per that definition, Bitcoin (BCH) is Bitcoin.
4	1526840319	-1	No, it is you who is clearly confusedhere's bitcoinhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/notice the ticker, you follow?okay, now here's bcash (Trouble finding it? It's the one that's not bitcoin, if that helps)https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/notice the tickerso it seems that you're wrong when you say bcash is bitcoin (of course you knew that already)>Bitcoin (BCH) is Bitcoin.you accidentally put "BCH" where you meant to put "BTC"...
2	1526838912	-1	Sorry but ver is a piece of shit. 
3	1526839493	3	But that's just like your opinion man. Also not an argument. I already spoke about morons posting baseless vitriol though. Nice try Blockstream.
4	1526839698	-1	Not blockstream lol. Personally I think they fucked up BTC along time ago and BTC/their community has a shit ton a self made problems.Doesn't change the fact that ver is a piece of shit. He's only looking out for himself but pretends like he's some Bitcoin Jesus. This is the guy that said insider trading benefits everyone lol.
5	1526841288	1	OK I agree that him saying insider trading was good was absolutely retarded and I hope he didn't mean it, he should not have said it either. But at the end of the day between BCH and BTC he's absolutely right, BCH is the true representation of what Bitcoin was/is supposed to be. 
1	1526810395	5	Read up on the ASIC-boost issue. Certain miners used this tech to secretly get an advantage for getting more blocks. That was their financial incentive to refuse the Segwit update, which would have stopped their extra income.  Pretty much all of the rest is noise.
2	1526822945	3	>  Certain miners used this tech to secretly get an advantage for getting more blocksEven though there is no proof that this ever happened, isn't it in the miners' best interest to find optimizations that allow them to be more competitive? Permissionless innovation, dude.
3	1526829776	2	Well the point was it was pretty much impossible to identify the covert form of asicboost, unlike the obtuse form where transaction choice/order were a clear fingerprint
3	1526828954	3	Yes! It came as a problem though, the _had to vote no_ on SegWit to keep their advantage 
4	1526831521	0	Then why did they vote yes for Segwit?
5	1526840171	-1	2x was just a diversion once Bitcoin Unlimited was essentially dead. It clearly never had solid support in the community - as it went nowhere. I mean ... the tactic worked. 2x is still brought up to delegitimize the current consensus.
3	1526839875	1	The existence of ASIC-boost is pretty solidly established. And if everyone has access to this optimization it wouldn't be a problem. But it was "covert" and created with patents - so only one manufacturer would get this advantage. That breaks the idea of equal miner competition.
2	1526811994	1	Okay so a number of BTC people didn't like certain BTC miners' disregard for further BTC improvements  because this disregard is driven by the miners' own financial interests. Thus BCH was created. Did I get it right?
3	1526817187	8	I disagree with Thomas. Asic boost is a tiny tiny issue compared to the block size debate. ASIC boost only affected certain mining companies and even then not a great deal (estimates vary depending on whose math you look at). The scaling debate started long before then. 2 of the original bitcoin devs Mike and Gavin proposed a block size increase. The problems pretty much started there. 
3	1526826982	3	Yes, but that's such a minor segment of the ecosystem that it hardly matters. If you extract the argument further, it's the same as GPU mining vs ASIC mining. Core made it a political issue to attack a group that supported larger block sizes. 
3	1526814530	0	Yes, that is correct.   The full picture is of course always more complicated than a one sentence gist of it. The rogue miners used legitimate issues to bolster their claim - the extremely expensive transactions at the time had to be solved. And once the discussion moved into the details of it, it often becomes hard to follow. The original [core developers were pretty much 100% behind the Segwit](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support) - and against the simple block resizing.
4	1526816240	4	You say "original core developers." How come Gavin isn't on that list?
5	1526818671	0	He wasn't an active developer anymore. Same is for Satoshi and others - where we don't know their stance. Since I say "pretty much", you can also count Gavin - it's still close to full Segwit support.
6	1526846296	1	I mean we theoretically know about what Satoshi thought about block size increases. Although that shouldn't mean anything in the debate.
1	1526808530	3	/u/tippr $0.5
1	1526807533	-2	That's pretty much it. Most of the fighting is because BCH wants to take the Bitcoin name for itself, even though they hard-forked with a minority of miners, users, developers and economic activity. 
2	1526807865	3	So it's just for the name/brand? Damn, did the Satoshi Nakamoto guy state his own opinion regarding Bitcoin Cash? I think he's the most legit person who can decide on who takes the name Bitcoin.Is Satoshi still active at all in the community?
3	1526808464	12	>So it's just for the name/brand?The fighting? Pretty much, you don't see anyone complaining about Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond and all the other forks, because they don't claim to be "the Bitcoin".>Damn, did the Satoshi Nakamoto guy state his own opinion regarding Bitcoin Cash? I think he's the most legit person who can decide on who takes the name Bitcoin.No one knows who Satoshi is, could even be a group of people. Satoshi has been gone for years, way before the scaling debate even started.Some think he may have been killed or captured by some government organization, or maybe died of some disease. Or is active under a different name to avoid becoming a central authority. No one knows.And by the way, Satoshi being gone is probably a good thing in the way that it lets the community decide instead of having some figure head with authority. 
4	1526811323	1	>you don't see anyone complaining about Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond and all the other forks, because they don't claim to be "the Bitcoin".Exactly. That's why I was so surprised that a simple name could start a war this big \(is it big?\). If it's all about the name, then Bitcoin Cash should just own their name and tell everyone that they're pretty much "Bitcoin's cash version in terms of transaction efficiency". This is just becoming a battle of egos.>Or is active under a different name to avoid becoming a central authority.  >  >Satoshi being gone is probably a good thing in the way that it lets the community decide instead of having some figure head with authority.I agree. This Satoshi entity is being true to his vision of a decentralized world, where people truly decide for themselves as a  whole. This is giving me some good\-ass goosebumps.
5	1526817469	4	Sadly it goes far beyond just the name. The name is just the most recent chapter in a fight between big and small blockers for years now. The community could not find consensus or even consensus on how to measure consensus and so the fork happened. Then the name battle started. No one cares about Bitcoin Gold or Bitcoin Pizza because they are not actual contenders for the digital currency of the world. But because Bitcoin Cash has an actual chance people opposed for whatever reason have tried hard to push Bitcoin Cash as far away from the name and legacy of Bitcoin as possible despite the fact both BCH and BTC are bitcoin.
6	1526824198	1	>But because Bitcoin Cash has an actual chance people opposed for whatever reason have tried hard to push Bitcoin Cash as far away from the name and legacy of Bitcoin as possible despite the fact both BCH and BTC are bitcoin.No, people just say that it should use the name "Bitcoin Cash". That's not pushing it as far away as possible, it's just avoiding a confusing mess. 
7	1526824543	3	There is nothing wrong with "Bitcoin Cash".  The issue is when people say it is an ALT coin and not a fork or use Bcash instead of the ticker Symbol BCH. We seem to all agree that BTC and BCH are neutral so like use those for shorthand instead of bcash and bcore.
8	1526834863	1	We're in agreement, then. It's not unreasonable to ask that it's named Bitcoin Cash instead of causing confusion by claiming to be _the_ Bitcoin.
3	1526824681	1	The hard fork when Bitcoin Cash came into being was seen by many as a reverse hard fork. There were irreconcilable differences between Bitcoin post hard fork that introduced segwit and refused to increase the block size and Bitcoin Cash that solely increased the block size as the supporters saw that as the better scaling path that followed Satoshis white paper, whereas Segwit and layer 2 scaling was not. The particular concern lay in the loss of decentralisation that may become even less with the lightning network because of the requirements Bitcoin has put on the sessions.I do think that there is an element of land grab too and the Bitcoin Cash team should have not muddied the water by keeping the bitcoin name to prevent all the subsequent arguments that have occurred, but I think there were also a lot of proud followers that wanted to honour the Satoshi vision which also meant taking back the name from corporations that had taken over like Blockstream.
3	1526814817	1	> So it's just for the name/brand?Of course it is. People don't like to hear it but no version if Bitcoin is competitive on a technical level - they all would completely crash and burn if any form of actual real world adoption happened. That's why the narrative changed from "revolutionary, fast and low fee currency" to "well, the actual use case has always been to store value(TM)". Name recognition is what keeps Bitcoin variants alive.
1	1526826647	0	The biggest difference between the two is rather fundamental. Do you want all transactions to be on chain, which was the original idea behind bitcoin. Or do you want a third party handling your transactions. It really is that simple.
1	1526811498	-1	The problem is "What is Bitcoin?" I disagree with people in the BCH camp that say it is the "real" bitcoin. I also disagree with people in the BTC camp who say BCH isn't a version of bitcoin and that it is only an alt coin. Any coin that is a fork of the bitcoin chain that goes all the way back to the first "genesis" block is bitcoin. Everyone can argue until they are blue in the face over which fork is the better fork.  But saying there is only one type of bitcoin is silly. It is not a trade marked brand owned buy a company. No one owns the brand and no one has the right to claim to be THE bitcoin. Only when only 1 fork remains will there be A TRUE BITCOIN.  Most people on the BCH side are fighting to not be discounted as simply an altcoin or scam coin, though some try to say it is the one and only bitcoin. BTC people just say it is a scam. It is not a fork. It is an alt coin. etc.  I personally think BCH has the better implementation and is far more focused on adoption and making it money for everyone. Not just the wealthy. If you want to know more there are plenty of people and myself who are willing and able to answer any questions you may have. If you have any questions please feel free to send me a DM. 
2	1526813050	1	> Any coin that is a fork of the bitcoin chain that goes all the way back to the first "genesis" block is bitcoinThere are only 21M bitcoins. If you start to add cash,gold,s2x it will be way more. So no, only 1 of them is bitcoin.
3	1526813734	2	Sorry but that is not how it works.There are 21 million coins on each chain. But once a chain forks it follows its own rules. There is no longer 1 version of bitcoin. However you are free and should be free to use whatever chain you like and their values are mostly independent from one another.
4	1526825982	1	They are bitcoin forks. They are not bitcoin. If they are all bitcoin, they share the same pool of coins. 
5	1526826378	1	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5185GJyI4LL._SL1000_.jpgWhich one is not part of the original?
6	1526826894	1	Code is not equal to a physical metal item -.-The word fork is just used to visualize a split with the same origin. Could have been called *tree* instead since branches grow out from the stem. The way you think no one is the handle and everyone is a "pin". So no one is original. Edit: https://imgur.com/CUwT6zI Here is my tree analogy. Forks grow out as branches and even they can have forks on them. But the long, thick, stable stem is the one with consensus always called bitcoin.
7	1526830021	2	That is exactly right. Everyone is a pin. The origin is the genesis block.  My original bitcoin address from 2011 works for both all forks. Which does not work on your "Tree" because the bch fork happened in August of last year.  I think it is more like [this](https://imgur.com/cfHHZeJ) .  The problem in my eyes is that Satoshi did not make things abundantly clear and then left before this madness began. Which ties into your other point about consensus. Satoshi said 1 vote 1 cpu. But obviously no one is mining with CPUs. So what else do we have to draw consensus from? NODES! Well yes of course. But at the time of the white paper everyone was running a full mining node. There were no asics... there were no non mining nodes. So who gets to vote? This is where people on the BTC side argue Community Consensus! But how do you measure that? How do you even define it? So here we are even today without consensus as to what makes bitcoin/alt coins. Without consensus as to who gets to vote.... what kind of system do we now how. If the developers agree on a proposal. But It is rejected by the  miners we have a hard fork. So in that case which fork is the 1 true bitcoin? IMO, both are bitcoin until one chain dies. 
3	1526829291	0	Only one is "Bitcoin" because having two things with the same name is very complicated.However, the one that becomes Bitcoin is almost arbitrary \(or at least linked to the majority\). If BCH actually had the majority they were looking for, we didn't "add cash" to make a different thing, we just modified Bitcoin. People who wanted to keep the original Bitcoin would have to change their name to avoid confusion, perhaps to "Bitcoin Classic" \(which should sound familiar\).The goal was never for Bitcoin to be a fixed product that can't evolve. That's literally the opposite of a decentralized vision. It should adapt to what people need as circumstances arise, whether it's a major hack that everyone wants to revert or modifications to the code to support continued growth. The limitation is purely the democratic process of getting people to switch with you.In this regard, the Bitcoin Cash supporters are in full belief they should be the "real" Bitcoin \(much how Ethereum Classic wanted to be the real Ethereum\), but aren't accepting they just don't hold the majority. If they \*did\*, though, then they would absolutely be allowed to be called Bitcoin, despite whatever additions or changes they make to the source.
2	1526812400	1	I think this is it. You pointed it out. The two sides are just acting spoiled. I'll keep you on my contact list since you offered already. Thanks!
3	1526814144	2	It goes a bit beyond spoiled. There have been some less than honest behaviors on both sides. I used to support the small block side until I dug deeper. Now I am really happy there is a viable other option with BCH because until last August it seemed to me like Bitcoin was going to just die sooner than later.  Anyway, take what everyone says with a grain of salt. The block size debate did not have to get as messy as it did. I suggest you look deeper into that aspect especially what happened starting 2014/15. It was a wild ride and I am really glad it seems to be coming to an end.

BCH community is pushing for actual adoption, the BTC community is lots of memes/hodl/moon lambo crap that has nothing to do with making it an actual usable currency.
1	1526823249	5	If you think there's been no news, it's because you haven't been paying attention. Purse, one of the earliest and most innovative Bitcoin companies just announced that they are imminently adding BCH to their platform: https://blog.purse.io/from-one-to-two-bitcoin-cash-bad5ec8539f4

1	1526819945	0	Yes, I do. I thought BCH was a shitcoin at first, but if I’m being honest I’ve spent far more through BCH than BTC in the past couple of months, because it just works better. I’ve been into crypto for 5+ years - BTC is still on the rise, but BCH is on the rise faster.

0	1526803837	10	I do believe that Andreas did great deal of work and am grateful for that. BUT i have listened to many of his lectures and he is mostly ignoring everything apart from bitcoin, BCH and litecoin. Sometimes he talks ETH - but in the way, that ETH is not up to task to be leading crypto. He has now been proven wrong about his ETH predictions when ETH can handle much higher throughput than bitcoin. Bitcoin is nice and all - but this technology is the first unicorn in the space and all that came after btc is trying to improve shortcomings of BTC - and they are doing really well and according to everything i see BTC is just not keeping up to the pace of these new projects. And I am talking ETH, NEO, IOTA for example. Andreas did really good job, but according everything i see there is no way that bitcoin is final cryptocurrency and in my opinion it would be like thinking that internet will only have email. Or that myspace is final evolution of social sites. There are better infrastructures being created that does not need to be patched and patched with new layers - but are created with this in mind and are better than pervious projects - And i simply do not understand why Andreas is stuck with just bitcoin. 
1	1526804259	4	He's stuck with just bitcoin for the same reasons a lot of big names in the cryptosphere are stuck, tribalism, and lack of knowledge.
2	1526805481	9	Not really. [Mastering Ethereum: Building Smart Contracts and Dapps by Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Gavin Wood](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook) “My book is not just about ETH, it is about any compatible EVM-based open public blockchain. I expect it will be useful to developers working on ETC and RSK, among others. I am hoping to offer a broad perspective on the Ethereum ecosystem.”
0	1526805874	6	A good objective way of measuring which side of an argument is more virtuous is by checking where the censorship is occuring. This is an especially important metric in a discussion surrounding censorship-resistant-money.

0	1526797699	15	Eh no.If you're constantly trying to shift a narrative towards your fork trying to be the one true Bitcoin, you dont deserve to be giving the same legitimacy as other projects. While it is true that other projects will co exsist, bad actors in the space only serve to slow growth as a whole.If you believe in blockchain, you believe in the model of consenses. period. This is something Bitcoin Cash has failed to do while trying to replace Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, they're all one and the same. 
1	1526798766	50	They're really not the same.There's been a huge scaling debate within Bitcoin since 2015. I could talk about it at length, but the basic points are: Satoshi put the 1MB blocksize cap just in case someone wanted to spam and bloat the blockchain because transactions were absolutely free. When he gave the project to Gavin, he told him to raise it at some point. Well, he tried with Mike Hearn with Bitcoin XT, and the censorship on /r/bitcoin and shady shit started happening. Long story short, the big blockers were never given a proper platform and were shunned about even discussing their ideas. Segwit2x was the last hope for a compromise between the two camps, and even that failed. Much more detailed summary here: https://hackernoon.com/the-great-bitcoin-scaling-debate-a-timeline-6108081dbada Why does the history matter? Because that same hostility against big blockers is STILL happening.Bitcoin Cash finally split the camps and now there are two different Bitcoins that have different scaling solutions. Saying Diamond and Gold (while still versions of Bitcoin, yes) are the same is just false, look at the community behind Bitcoin Cash and all of the new developments happening. The scaling debate is now in the markets. Some people think 'the one true bitcoin' is BTC, others BCH, even some others BTG. It's really just a subjective thing. 
2	1526809607	2	>Satoshi put the 1MB blocksize cap just in case someone wanted to spam and bloat the blockchain because transactions were absolutely free.Satoshi didn't publicly explain his reasoning for putting the blocksize in place, but if you want to play "[Satoshi says](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zohxn/what_happened_to_all_of_the_original_developers/durfu5u/)"...>When he gave the project to Gavin[Somewhat mythical.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7rr3uq/psa_take_everything_you_read_on_bitcoincom_with_a/dszi8xn/)>he told him to raise it at some point.Ah, "[Satoshi says](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zohxn/what_happened_to_all_of_the_original_developers/durfu5u/)" again, I see.> Well, he tried with Mike Hearn with Bitcoin XT, and the censorship on /r/bitcoin and shady shit started happening.Gavin tried to [jump immediately to 20MB blocksize limits](https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/commit/5f46da29fd02fd2a8a787286fd6a56f680073770) and unilaterally decided on [linear increases to over 8GB](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki) over time; these "out of a hat" proposals were assessed as "far too aggressive" by basically *the entire technical community* at the time. Disappointingly, [Gavin repeatedly refused to compromise](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8iswz3/the_story_of_how_bitcoin_was_compromised/dyvseqq/) when alternative hard fork proposals like "2MB -> 4MB -> 8MB over a couple of years" were suggested.Shortly afterwards, [a paper](http://bitfury.com/content/downloads/block-size-1.1.1.pdf) was published demonstrating that in mid-2015, limits greater than 8MB would be demonstrably destructive for the network in a number of ways. Gavin's original proposal (which, remember, [he was completely unwilling to compromise on](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8iswz3/the_story_of_how_bitcoin_was_compromised/dyvseqq/)) was proven to be a *fundamentally* terrible idea. By the time Gavin got around to supporting other, milder hard fork proposals (like the original "Bitcoin Classic" project), the larger Bitcoin development community had discovered and begun work increasing the blocksize with Segwit, designed to remain backwards-compatible, take elegantly into account the relevant trade-offs involved, and provide numerous other benefits for long-term scalability solutions.Furthermore, a little known fact about the "hard fork at all costs" method was that it was *known* to diverge massively from Satoshi's envisioned Bitcoin maturation plan (and the social contract that was already in place and agreed upon); the alternative plan that was supposed to replace it was a far-fetched [assurance contracts](https://medium.com/@octskyward/hashing-7d04a887acc8) approach, for which there *was not* and still *is not* anything remotely resembling widespread agreement or consensus. Most people didn't even realize that this was part of Gavin and Mike's long-term strategy, because most people weren't really paying that much attention. Oh, and by the way, part of the plan was to install Mike Hearn as the """benevolent""" dictator of the codebase (another proposal for which there was *not* widespread support).To summarize: a broken idea involving a radical deviation from the original Bitcoin formula (not to mention a total departure from decentralization) was rejected by the wider developer community, who later had their objections vindicated by further study.>and the censorship on /r/bitcoin and shady shit started happening.The alleged "censorship" [happens on /r/btc all the time](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dlyk4/censorship/duaqgxb/). You're just using the "trigger-word" form of "moderation" for a quick-and-easy emotional appeal. Bottom line: different subreddits offer different experiences, none of them are one-size-fits-all; if you don't like one because you dislike the moderation policies enforced there, don't go there. Whining forevermore about "censorship" just demonstrates desperation.>Long story short, the big blockers were never given a proper platform and were shunned about even discussing their ideas.Nonsense... if your plan is contingent upon a single subreddit, it's not a serious proposal in any meaningful sense of the word. >Segwit2x was the last hope for a compromise between the two camps, and even that failed.S2X was a garbage fire from start to finish. The audacity of assuming some random coalition of DCG-affiliated businesses (and co.) could in any meaningful sense represent "consensus" was bad enough on its own. Ironically enough, one "Big Name" behind S2X had [written an essay describing why it was a bad idea without realizing it](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/73mkir/shapeshift_investors_are_questioning_erik/dnrlg1t/). It totally lacked developer support, eventually culminating into [an epic flop](https://bitcointechtalk.com/segwit2x-bugs-explained-8e0c286124bc), and [oh](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery/status/931554003183431680), *[so](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery/status/931553682293972992)*, [very](https://twitter.com/oleganza/status/901952416622329856), [much](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery/status/931553723532406784), [more](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery/status/931553804109172736).>Why does the history matter?Take note of the history I've provided here.>Because that same hostility against big blockers is STILL happening.No one cares about how big the blocks of your altcoin are, but people who try to misleadingly pretend like their altcoin is "Bitcoin" are not going to be generally treated well by supporters of the actual Bitcoin.>Bitcoin Cash finally split the camps and now there are two different Bitcoins that have different scaling solutions. Saying Diamond and Gold (while still versions of Bitcoin, yes) are the same is just false, look at the community behind Bitcoin Cash and all of the new developments happening.No, see, this is you *pretending* like your altcoin-with-an-airdrop is Bitcoin, which it's not. There are only 21M bitcoins that can ever exist, by definition, and any blockchain sporting **months** worth of *orders-of-magnitude* less cumulative proof-of-work, all while using the same work algorithm as the main network cannot (again by definition) supply any of them.Like it or not, the market decided. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and "Bitcoin X" airdrops are altcoins. That includes your precious "Cash" airdrop.>The scaling debate is now in the markets. Some people think 'the one true bitcoin' is BTC, others BCH, even some others BTG. It's really just a subjective thing.Wrong, or else you're saying "there is no finite supply cap of bitcoins" which is definitionally absurd.This stuff is getting so irritatingly repetitive.
2	1526799540	-4	Except it isnt a subjective thing. They failed in gaining majority of the consensus, in which they are free to fork off to create their own coin, sure.But do you think the community hates Bitcoin Cash just because their an altcoin? Why arent all the other currencies and forks getting the same hate? Its simple. The ring leader of Bitcoin Cash has been constantly trying to push people into believing that his coin is Bitcoin. From propaganda on bit.coin.com to the twitter handle, you're tell me that the hate is subjective?They are one and the same. Some a little bigger then others, but all are forks which failed to get the majority to embrace their changes. 
3	1526800168	19	I think BCH more closely aligns with the original vision of Bitcoin, to be a peer to peer cash for the entire world. Those $50 fees in December were... not great. Sure, Segwit and batching are here, and the LN is ALMOST ready to go (if it can ever possibly scale). But everytime the BTC price spikes or drops the mempool starts filling and fees go up again. Someone living on $2 a day would never pay $1 for a transaction.So yes, I believe BCH is Bitcoin. And that my friend, is my subjective opinion. Did you know Roger invested 20k into Bitcoin businesses in 2011? He's been saying the exact same thing since then, that he wants Bitcoin that the world can use. Now, sure, some people think he's Jesus or whatever - but if one person can turn you off of a project, then, well, I can't help you there. He owns a private business and can do as he pleases. Permissionless is great isn't it?Did you know op_codes were just enabled on BCH to enable things like tokenization and smart contract on BCH?
4	1526801525	-1	Gosh if feels like I'm talking to sock puppets. You can downvote and justify it all you want.These are the facts.Fact 1. Bitcoin Cash Is trying to become bitcoin. Not just a peer to peer cash. Roger wants it to be THE bitcoin.Fact 2. He failed. He couldnt garner Majority consenses and he forked off as an altcoin.That would have been the end of it. He could have called it Ethereum Cash and no one would care. He could have done his own thing and people would leave him to do his own innovation and he would be free from all the hate. (relatively)Fact 3. After he failed, he trying to convince all the new users and people entering the market that Bitcoin Cash is the true Bitcoin. Through the Twitter handle as well as Bit.coin.comAm I getting this right? Stop me where Im wrong.I don't understand Bitcoin Cash Fans Boys honestly. Calling Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin is just delusional. Its like how I would imagine talking to the flat earth society would be like.
5	1526802208	11	I came into Bitcoin late and as such am neutral on the subject but the only conclusion I can reach is that BTC holders are concerned BCH will take over as the primary coins and devalue their investments. The whole drama makes no sense to me as it was obvious before the fork that BTC had become unusable and had to be fixed. The resistance really made little sense, though I understand a fear of betting on the wrong horse and seeing millions get devalued. 
6	1526817933	4	Yep. I think that is what it really comes down to. People who do not want t see their digital gold devalue vs those who want to fundamental change the world economy.... Place your bets.
6	1526805092	2	I dont hold either coins. And what the devs do I have little concern of. But the amount of people that support the fork is the baffling. I dont think bitcoin will ever be replaced, much less by Bcash. Its like if warren buffet decided to create Ethereum Cash and told everyone that this was the true Etherum and then spent his wealth to convince everyone that this was the true coin and that this was the creators vision all along.Anyway dont have much passion for the subject. Bcash holders are weird. 
7	1526808819	6	>	Bitcoin Cash HODLers are weirdPeople being okay with $50 fees because "it's good for bitcoin" are weird.
8	1526809126	8	Do you know what I do when Fees are high? I use litecoin. I use Ethereum.And you use Bitcoin cash.But does that make any of them the true bitcoin?
9	1526809718	7	I think a bitcoin that has above-cents fees is fundamentally broken.
9	1526846026	1	Stop dancing around the fact that BTC is broke.

The resistance really made little sense, though I understand a fear of betting on the wrong horse and seeing millions get devalued. This in nonsense, Bitcoin holders before the fork got the same amount in both chains, so there was nothing to lose if BCH took over the next day. That tells you the opposition wasn't about keeping their money but something else, like actually caring about Bitcoin's security and decentralization. 
7	1526817977	5	LOTS of people dumped one coin for the other on both sides after the fork. Smart people kept at least some of both... just in case.
8	1526824037	0	I did, some for Bitcoin and some for Monero. Glad I didn't hold BCH, both for the crappy return and the mess around it (community, devs).But that doesn't matter, the drama started before the fork, so the argument that it was about money doesn't hold up if people could just hold both. 
5	1526802109	7	>Calling Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin is just delusional. Its like how I would imagine talking to the flat earth society would be like.You don’t know how forks work. And I guess you consider Vitalik Buterin to be a delusional idiot as well?https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/930276246671450112?s=21*”I consider BCH a legitimate contender for the bitcoin name. I consider bitcoin's failure to raise block sizes to keep fees reasonable to be a large (non-consensual) change to the "original plan", morally tantamount to a hard fork.”*
6	1526806488	3	Eh.. did you not see when Vitalik called Roger out in person. On video, live at a conference? Stop trying to push your Bcash narative onto others. Just like how I dont say Nano is the one true bitcoin, it does all the transactions even better! and feeless! We all know its not true. Stop being delusional. 
7	1526818267	5	Vitalik called out Roger? LINK PLEASE!
8	1526823607	5	No, Vitalik called out Craig Wright. https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/vitalik-buterin-and-joseph-poon-call-out-craig-wright-deconomy-2018/
9	1526823646	5	Shhh Shhh I was waiting for him to realize he didn't know what he was talking about.
7	1526808261	3	Wow.. You're so far from seeing the light it's scary..
8	1526808311	4	yeah I know right. Nano is the true bitcoin.
5	1526802347	6	 1: True. 2: No. It's a hard fork. An altcoin is a different thing that isn't Bitcoin. There was a chain split on August 1st 2017. You still had Bitcoin, just two different versions. EDIT: Also Roger supported Segwit2x instead of BCH.  When 2x failed, he fully switched over to BCH. He wasn't trying to 'garner' consensus until after 2x. If BCH ever has more hashpower than BTC, it could theoretically catch up and pass BTC and become the Bitcoin with the longest chain (in both PoW and block height). Then, BTC would be the minority fork. 3: I don't think many new users got tricked. Please find me some solid examples of people buying BCH thinking they were buying BTC. Anyways, at the time this big scandal went down when he said Bitcoin (BCH), if you would have bought BCH then, you would have made more money than buying BTC. If this was such a big problem why did that lawsuit fail? Permissionless. The shape of the Earth cannot be changed, but there are multiple versions of Bitcoin.
6	1526806325	-2	1. He failed. And has is continuing to fail. But time will tell.2. What happens when you fork a coin? It becomes an alt coin. Etherium classic is not Etherium. Just like how litecoin Cash is not litecoin and is an altcoin instead. Maybe litecoin is the true bitcoin.3. When you have a website called bitcoin diverting users to a different coin, what do you call that? Why not call it BitcoinCash.com? Its Simple, thats his narative. He wants to be in power. He wants his project to be THE bitcoin. And all you little pawns are playing into his losing game. If you had bought bitconnect when Bcash was released you would have made money too. I don't own bitcoin and I dont push the bitcoin vs Bcash narative much. Yes Bitcoin is permissionless. You can fund terrorist if you so want. But that doesnt mean I should need to like it or support it or that its fundamentally right. 
7	1526808966	1	Ethereum Classic is actually the same as Bitcoin (Core) in this case. They didn't change anything when the fork happened.
8	1526809012	0	thats it. Ethereum classic is the one true bitcoin.
7	1526806553	0	Fork / altcoin. Whatever you want to call it. Time will tell. I think Roger is right with what he is saying, I think he's playing into the winning game, and I'd like to see it succeed and be money for the world. Maybe I'll make some money along the way too!bch = terrorists
6	1526806681	-3	If BCH ever has more hashpower than BTC, it could theoretically catch up and pass BTC and become the Bitcoin with the longest chain (in both PoW and block height). Then, BTC would be the minority fork.Almost impossible at this point
7	1526808602	6	We've only been playing together for 10months, if you consider the last Bitcoin is set to be mined in 2140, it's actually rather likely to occur.Economics will slowly determine the fundamental value of the coins over the long-term. In my view, Bitcoin core shows little economic utility and this will only continue to grow, or rather, not grow. 
8	1526809532	2	Well the discussion in regards to Bitcoin being successful is kinda irreverent seeing as I'm only comparing BCH and BTC rather than BTC vs the world. BTC has 9 months worth of work ahead of BCH and given BCH is only 10% of the transaction volume, and around 15% of the hashpower, BTC is steaming ahead every single block. BCH realistically would need BTC to stop dead for the rest of the year to catch up, never-mind get ahead, wont happen.
9	1526818220	6	Anyone who thinks you can see the future of bitcoin based on 10 months activity is mistaken. Did you sell after gox crashed the market too or did you buy more?
9	1526809778	5	This game keeps getting played till 2140, and then on wards.Long way to go.  We'll be dead by then.  
4	1526802308	-5	Did you know that op_codes also work on Bitcoin.Did you know that RSK is already launched on top of Bitcoin merged mined with a 10sec block capable to handle 1000tps, with sharding and a full DevKit.  Bitcoin is already able to launch dApps, and complex SmartContracts.
5	1526802657	8	op_return is 40 bytes on BTC.BCH just raised their op_return to 220 bytes. That's a 5x increase. What they did to the change was bring back in more op_codes that were already not on BTC.Where are these dApps and SmartContracts? Like for real I'd like to see some - I thought most of those were on ETH.
6	1526823645	3	> bring back in more op_codes that were already not on BTC.Well, they used to be, until they were intentionally disabled by the Bitcoin Core developers! 
5	1526815613	2	Rootstock is not here yet.
2	1526802816	-6	> Long story short, the big blockers were never given a proper platform and were shunned about even discussing their ideas.There were literally pinned threads for discussing blocksize. The only things that banned were promoting altcoins, brigading, and promoting contentious hardforks.You're leaving out a ton of nuance and painting and incomplete picture.
3	1526818416	4	That is not at all what happened. I had threads deleted for "discussing an alt coin" when just asking about XT and classic. That is pretty much when core started to lose me.

5	1526824298	2	I disagree with your premise. Alternative methods of improvements should be openly discussed. Core devs (especially as Luke recently as yesterday on twitter) have been openly discussing the need for a change in the proof of work. That would require a hard for. If the core team decided for whatever reason that the way forward was a hybrid POW/POS system would it then become an alt coin and no longer allowed to be discussed?  Edit: grammar.
6	1526824976	1	> Alternative methods of improvements should be openly discussed.Absolutely, and BIP101 was allowed to be discussed. Altcoins were not allowed to be discussed.> If the core team decided for whatever reason that the way forward was a hybrid POW/POS system would it then become an alt coin and no longer allowed to be discussed?There would be mass outrage if the core dev team decided to unilaterally make a hard fork change like that, especially for something as silly as adding POS. That's the issue with your argument, you're claiming that a client implementing an extremely controversial change, with a minority of support, **which breaks consensus and makes its tokens no longer equivalent to bitcoins**, is somehow bitcoin because a development team went forward and implemented the change and put "Bitcoin" in the name.Bitcoin Gold is not Bitcoin, and it wasn't Bitcoin before it forked.Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin, and it wasn't Bitcoin before it forked.Bitcoin Diamond is not Bitcoin, and it wasn't Bitcoin before it forked.Bitcoin XT is not Bitcoin, and if miners decided today to activate its fork, it would not be Bitcoin.
7	1526826122	3	I am claiming that consensus can never be reached if miner signalling is ignored in the name of "community consensus" which is impossible to measure. Especially when the community is banned from discussing ideas.. At what point does something become an altcoin? Is it prefork or post fork? If any fork makes an automatic altcoin and therefore censored from discussion no hardforks are allowed to happen ever. Not in the name of an emergency nor in the name of an improvement. 
8	1526828160	1	> I am claiming that consensus can never be reached if miner signalling is ignored in the name of "community consensus" which is impossible to measure.Miner signalling isn't ever ignored in the case of a soft fork. A soft fork is the mechanism by which a majority of miners can agree to update consensus rules. Community consensus is something completely different.>Especially when the community is banned from discussing ideas..Do you think if you say the same thing enough, it becomes true? I just addressed this:>>Alternative methods of improvements should be openly discussed.>Absolutely, and BIP101 was allowed to be discussed. Altcoins were not allowed to be discussed.As for>At what point does something become an altcoin? Is it prefork or post fork?It is an altcoin as soon as it is not using rules compatibility with Bitcoin consensus. If I wrote a client that uses POS starting in 1 year it would not be a Bitcoin wallet. If your wallet is designed to one day not accept the rules the vast majority of the Bitcoin network follows, then it is not a Bitcoin client.>If any fork makes an automatic altcoin and therefore censored from discussion no hardforks are allowed to happen ever. Not in the name of an emergency nor in the name of an improvement.Sure they can happen, in cases where there was overwhelming community consensus. Consider the database bug where 0.7 broke consensus with other 0.7 clients. Obviously a database bug resulting in consensus being broken is something that must be fixed. The overwhelming majority of the community was fine with this relatively small change that fixed a critical vulnerability in Bitcoin.This was a gray-area hard fork/soft fork, and the details are complex and can be discussed if you want, but it is strong evidence that a hard fork could occur if it were absolutely necessary.Other than that, all Bitcoin consensus upgrades have been soft forks, and soft forks have worked fine for Bitcoins consensus upgrades so far.
9	1526830626	2	 I was around for 0.7 and of course there was no major contention surrounding in the community (bitcointalk) as it was a bug fix. Though at the time bitcoin was low and the community was also small. If I recall correctly none of us miners took any issue with it either. Again with "community consensus". How do you measure that now? Who is in the "community?" Every Hodler? ACKS/NAKS on the github? Full Nodes? I don't think you and I will ever see eye to eye on even terminology.
3	1526803513	8	The thing is. Bitcoin XT wasn't an 'altcoin'. It was a software implementation. It was Gavin and Mike trying to raise the blocksize, not create a whole new coin. Hard forks can happen quite smoothly. BCH has hardforked twice already to upgrade its software. The hard forks that end up in two different coins generally mean consensus on an issue could not be resolved between different parties. BCH is around because it represents a % of people choosing bigger blocks. anyways, read this. there was censorship based on personal and political opinons of theymos and friends, no one denies this fact.https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43
4	1526804964	-3	> The thing is. Bitcoin XT wasn't an 'altcoin'. It was a software implementation. It was Gavin and Mike trying to raise the blocksize, not create a whole new coin.Similar to how Bitcoin Cash isn't an altcoin, it's Bitcoin, just a different implementation?Bitcoin XT had different consensus rules, which gave miners the ability to split the network. It is incredibly unsafe to have part of the network using incompatible consensus rules indefinitely. Bitcoin is a consensus system, and if people don't agree on the rules, they won't agree on the state of the balance sheet, and people will lose money.It's dangerous and fraudulent to claim Bitcoin XT is a Bitcoin client, because just like Bitcoin Cash (Bitcoin ABC), it breaks consensus with Bitcoin under conditions decided by miners.>Hard forks can happen quite smoothly. BCH has hardforked twice already to upgrade its software.Every time you hard fork you're invoking trust in an authority who is dictating consensus rules. Satoshi **never** used a hard fork and intentionally designed the system so upgrades could take place through soft fork (e.g. many opcodes which do nothing were created so a softfork could be applied to make them do something later).
5	1526811277	5	You do realize that in order to upgrade the blockchain (i. e. implementing new features) you need to change consensus and causing a hard fork (while the old branch will die off after everyone updates their clients)?
6	1526811892	-3	> You do realize that in order to upgrade the blockchain (i. e. implementing new features) you need to change consensus and causing a hard forkNo, that is wrong, and anyone with any understanding of the history of Bitcoin's development would know that. Bitcoin has had a ton of consensus upgrades without hard forks, through the use of soft forks. The process of upgrading blockchain rules though a soft fork has been standardized in [BIP 009](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki):>This document specifies a proposed change to the semantics of the 'version' field in Bitcoin blocks, allowing multiple backward-compatible changes (further called "soft forks") to be deployed in parallel^copied ^from ^a ^previous ^post ^of ^mine:Soft forks are a "blockchain upgrade mechanism" which satoshi has used a half dozen times, from his fix of the integer overflow attack, to his fix of the vulnerability which made it so anyone can redeem any transaction.Soft forks have been used by the core developers to introduce P2SH (used in whats sometimes called a "multisig address"), and the fix for the database bug in 0.7. It was also used to remove a critical vulnerability caused by open ssl not being consensus-compatible (libscpk).Then segwit was added through a soft fork to increase the transaction throughput, decrease the size of the utxo database, and to make malleability optional.The fact that you have a programmer tag tells me you should be able to research these things and figure out how blockchain upgrades have happened in the past. You shouldn't have to trust whoever told you that blockchain upgrades require a hard fork. You should be able to verify how they have worked in the past by looking at the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/), [mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev), and [release notes](https://bitcoin.org/en/version-history).
3	1526805452	5	This is completely false. The pinned threads were the only place in /r\/Bitcoin you were allowed to discuss bigger blocks, and they soon got rid of those threads as well. They called an "altcoin" anything that didn't agree with the Core developers. >contentious hardforksHardforks are the *solution* to contention. This was obvious even then to anyone with any economic sense, but it is especially obvious in hindsight after the Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Monero chain splits. Splitting and trading is a market solution to contention, and it works fabulously well. Each investor is auto-hedged and neutral until the decide to pick a side. Long term, the market decides a winner, or even mutual coexistence.

Personally, I don't want to be forced Into using a 3rd party (lightning) for my transactions. And you're kidding your self if you don't see the fee structure forcing transactions off chain due to prioritization fighting for limited ledger space caused by artificial limitations on the blocksize.

1	1526805722	7	I mean if it flips in price and hashpower then it could be considered the "real bitcoin" by many people.maybe someday! will be interesting to watch.
2	1526806650	2	Interesting indeed, but I think by the time that happens we will see far more advanced projects arise. Both BTC and BCH are nowhere near a 'final' cryptocurrency and probably never will be in their current state.
0	1526816171	2	It's funny how all the polls, the price, the node count, and just about every other metric you can look at shows favor and consensus to be in the bitcoin camp at around 85% except in /r/cryptocurrency. Whether it's brigading or some other type of scheme, it's shady. 
1	1526845825	2	Im not sure what your seeing because r/CryptoCurrency is not pro bch at all. Almost all posts regarding BCH are dwonvoted and brigaded on this sub. Any of the bitcoin related subs will just straight up remove content that has anything to do with BCH. All the twitter polls are so easily manipulated by bots that it doesn't mean anything. Also price doesn't mean that much because it is all based on speculation right now. Dentacoin was recently in the top 10 for market cap, and many other shit coins have had high prices before. 
1	1526827723	2	It's selection bias. Most people who are content with Core and r/bitcoin will just post there. The best part about this sub is getting in early on good alts, which they aren't looking to do.To most of them, cryptocurrency is Bitcoin and a bunch of short-lived goat shit.
1	1526833366	-1	A lot of that has to do with the fact that this subreddit is filled with anti-bitcoiners, majority of the people in this sub came on board in 2017 and only want to make quick money and really don’t care about bitcoin. No one really acknowledges here that bitcoin is the only crypto that has stood the test of time, and is the grandfather to all of blockchain. They would rather see it die so they could make quick bucks on their shitcoins. It’s incredibly ironic that the majority of crypto shilled here is based off Ethereum, the dapp platform who’s official foundation controversly hard forked and rolled back the blockchain to bailout a third party contract, yet official BTC is lamented for preserving decentralization and blockchain immutability. We will see though, this subreddit was dead before 2016. Hopefully a bear market like 2014 will repeat itself and will clean slate of all these moon kids.

0	1526821041	1	Is that the Reddit in-app browser?
0	1526825817	1	Infighting is a huge reason why so many people abandoned bitcoin and headed toward projects like Ethereum.
1	1526827926	2	ETH split even sooner than BTC did!
2	1526828032	1	 small group left eth for etc, nothing since. meanwhile there is always drama related to bitcoin core/cash. 
2	1526839969	1	and ETC isn't trying to do everything they can to trick people into thinking that ETC is the true ETH...
0	1526828149	1	Will ETH and ETC coexist and serve different use cases? Does anyone here actually use both of those?
0	1526828633	1	People still need to shed the brainwashing they received about the state having a monopoly on the medium of exchange.The fact that there is now competition for that is a significance that I believe is lost on most people.

0	1526831238	1	Tends to be common to think binary something is good or bad there's no in between. Obviously both coins have a use case
0	1526834461	1	Fighting with your ex is just as bad.  Ignore, and move on.  Do what you do and stop keep comparing yourself to the other.  It’s time to live and let live and stop fighting each other.  If BCH is really so great and BTC really that bad, or vise versa depending on who you are, then just fucking go with that god damnit.  Andreas is right.  The quagmire of “muhhh coin” and all this in fighting makes the people outside the space leary of both. 
0	1526841561	1	Have to agree with Andreas here. Regardless if you prefer bitcoin or bitcoin cash, the whole community would be better off if we focused on building up the community in a pairings light and brining more nocoiners into crypt. 
0	1526847226	1	I wonder how much Ver paid him to tweet that
0	1526847796	1	This would make sense except for there's nothing that Bitcoin can do that Bitcoin Cash *can't* do.
0	1526802074	0	I don't understand this rivalry. Really. I think it's just stupid kids fighting on "my dad can kick your dad's ass". They will consume each other eventually and, when the market decouples at a point, they will remain a thing of the past
1	1526808899	3	We did not start it. They(mos) did not let us speak freely. They(mos) kicked Gavin of the github that Satoshi gave him. They(mos) bullied Mike Hearn away. They(mos) ridiculed Jeff Garzik. They(mos) removed topics on bitcoin talk forum about raising the blocksize. They(mos) made false promises to the miners. They(mos) did not accept even the smallest of the smallest compromise. They(mos) told everybody at /r/bitcoin to fuck of if you think Bitcoin should have a blocksize ever a byte bigger then 1 MB. They(mos) banned people for speaking their opinion. They(mos) bullied Bitcoin TX nodes with DDOS, even at one point killing the entire internet in a small rular village. They(mos) mass flag you on twitter. They(mos) insult you all the time. They(mos) calls you names. They(mos) say Roger Ver is a criminal because he sold firecrackers illegally over the mail and went to jail for it. They do whatever they can to prevent people from using Bitcoin as money.Why? Because they(mos) are terrified their power will be undermined by this new fresh uncorrupted uncontrollable money. Money by the people for the people because of the people. Money by the internet, for the internet, because of the internet. That's why Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin because the people that control the other Bitcoin have shown over and over that they are not good people. They(mos) don't have the right intentions. They(mos) lie and abuse their power all the time. You can't be free on their platforms. They(mos) try to control what you think and how you think it. If you went to Consensus 2018 and you have a human heart and a mind that work, you can sense that. You can feel it. It was about the people taking back some control and to change things and to do some good and they compromised it and turned it in to the shitshow that Consensus 2018 was. If those people take over the planet, it will be worse then how it is now. Bitcoin Core devs and people like theymos have been bamboozling the entire crypto space for a long time and it's time that ends. There is only one crypto on it's way to become currency and it's Bitcoin Cash. If no crypto becomes currency ... the speculative bubble will end one day and it will be over. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin because Bitcoin always was meant to be cash. Not a speculative  digital beany baby that only the rich people can afford. If the Bitcoin you want is not cash or money or currency then even if I wanted to join, I could not. Because I can't afford it. And neither can 99% of the people on the planet. How can that go global? It can't! This is how Bitcoin was attacked. The math is invincible. The code is strong. The network to big to attack. The people are weak.They attacked the people, the community and split Bitcoin in to a million alt coins. Bitcoin fights back and becomes Bitcoin Cash, to remind everybody that Bitcoin is cash. They attack it, and attack it, and attack it. And they(mos) will fail. Because Bitcoin Cash works like Bitcoin was designed. Because people will find platforms free enough to say the truth. Because the past can't be altered even if they try. And we can put stuff on the blockchain now that no force on the planet can alter. That's why they(mos) will fail but I am very interested to see what the next tactic will be. Blowing up Tether and crashing the market? Good luck with that, Bitcoin Cash will be back because it works and has enough people that believe in it to make it a global success. Not as a speculative digital asset but as sound money for every person that has an internet connection or internet access. There are more people on the planet with internet access then people with access to banks. For Bitcoin Cash users it's an asset to have Ethereum around for the most complex smart contracts. To have Monero around for when absolute secrecy is needed. To have dogecoin around for the community behind it, and to always have some fun and not take anything to seriously.  And for all other crypto to have any chance in being successful long term, one of them needs to become a global currency.  Bitcoin Cash is the best fighter we have. It's that simple. Will we succeed? We don't know, but we are going to try anyway. Why? Because most of us never had the chance to be a part of something bigger then ourselves. Something strong, that might actually work. Until now. It will become the biggest non voilent protest in the history of mankind. The people will stop using the money of their leaders and start using their own. Enough is enough.  The only thing that can really stop us is if they disconnect the internet. 
2	1526824161	5	I am not aware of the whole story behind this rivalry. But the way you build your case you enhance my feeling that you guys are kids. I cannot judge who is right or wrong. This is not necessarily a bad thing but if crypto has to mature then you people need to mature first. Start by rebranding. There is no point on hijacking brands if what you have is strong enough.
3	1526844554	1	Bitcoin is not a brand, it's a word that Satoshi came up with in his white paper. The title of his white paper is  Bitcoin:A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash SystemBitcoin-BTC has been subverted in to something that is not electronic cash.So we forked. As if our full right to do with Free Open Source Software. Just look at the Bitcoin MIT License. >he MIT License (MIT)>Copyright (c) 2009-2018 The Bitcoin Core developersCopyright (c) 2009-2018 Bitcoin Developers>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included inall copies or substantial portions of the Software.>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

And once the price ratio between Bitcoin-BTC and Bitcoin-BCH changes, [so will the hashrate](https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate). Eventually we will have as much hashrate at Bitcoin-BTC. All of us have been in Bitcoin from long before August 2017. We tried forking with Bitcoin Unlimited with Bitcoin TX. We tried making compromises to get the blocksize just a little bit higher. We warned people since 2014 that eventually the Bitcoin network would stop working reliably and that transactions would get stuck. But the other side kept their iron grip on Bitcoin and did not let go. It was very hard to convince the chinese miners to run upgraded software with a higher blocksize. They are so conditioned to blindly follow authority.Eventually we got a fork that was succesfull after trying since 2015.

0	1526824012	0	One thing that really bothers me about the bch community is that they think it's okay to be on the btc subreddit. It's fine if you think bch is the "real" bitcoin (whatever that means) but imagine if bitcoin diamond had the bch subreddit? They always claim to be "open to any opinion" (because the bitcoin subreddit is very heavily censored) but you will not see a single positive opinion on anything btc related. That's fine to have that opinion but the whole coin seems disingenuous when that opinion constantly comes up on r/btc instead of just r/bch
1	1526830243	6	R/btc formed well before BCH, ad essentially a low-moderation sub that's pro-blocksize. It supported classic, XT, SW2X, and other methods of increase.When the split occurred between onchain (8MB BCH) and off-chain (segwit, LN),  most of r/btc sub was in support of BCH and it's stayed that way.Imo /r/bitcoincash exists and hopefully users shift towards that (or /r/bch) over time
2	1526834566	-1	Yeah, I agree the shift is important, not because I feel strongly about one over the other but r/btc just doesn't talk about btc anymore and so those people should go in the right place for their beliefs. Not to say you can't support larger block sizes on r/btc but literally every upvoted post is about bch and that's not congruent with what the sub is named for.
3	1526835307	3	 that subreddit existed long before bitcoin cash. It is where everybody went who was banned from  r/Bitcoin. It just happened to be most of those people were big blockers
1	1526832370	3	/r/btc has been the uncensored home of bitcoin discussion for years, long before the idea of BCH ever existed. Should we just abandon the entire subreddit? That wouldn't be very productive. 
2	1526842205	1	r/btc is not uncensored. what a joke you telling here. I got immediately restricted after a few posts that weren't bcash friendly. secondly "trolls" are marked buy a bot for everyone to see, just to influence readers into bias. 
3	1526842573	1	Documentation please.  I have tried to get some extremely disruptive trolls people banned from there and been told to kick rocks by the moderators. They do not censor.  Unless you are an ***uber*** troll, you don’t get banned. Want proof? Every single thread is overrun with troll posts.>trolls are marked by a bot Oh you’re so mistreated 🤮 I really feel bad for you guys. That someone’s calling you out on your intentional disruption of the sub. The troll life is hard. ☹️
1	1526842141	1	hijacked a not trademarked name. nothing you can do appearently.
0	1526796135	-10	Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Private, Bitcoin Dark, Bitcoin Cash etc. All just forks of the only real bitcoin and all just as much scams. 
1	1526799848	9	Bitcoin is an open source project. Many research forks exist, many people fork it for academic purposes, and many other things. It belongs to noone and everyone. Just because a narrative has been fed to you doesn't mean you forget what this whole thing is. DYOR maybe one of these days. 
2	1526803165	6	This guy gets it.  Crazy how many people in this ecosystem don’t understand how open source / free-market projects work. 
2	1526802455	-3	And no one claims that they're the original bitcoin, like BCash does. Keep sucking Roger's and Jihans cock you unknowing shill.Increasing block size is a stupid and non lasting fix and guess who it serves the best. The miners who own the image, you retard. 
3	1526803830	3	so much hostility geez 
3	1526803130	-1	Yes, channeling tx through LN hubs instead of miners altogether is a better fix to the problem. Didn't even know about roger when I made my mind about bch tbh. Sure he was an enterpreneur and shit, but noone was actually going for a fork until it happened. So Roger was not the leader of the splintered community, only a part of it.
4	1526803777	1	Because you were too dumb to realize who conned you doesn't make you less of a con victim. 
5	1526803867	4	Sure my friend. Really crying with the con they pulled on me by giving me the real bitcoin at 2013 rates, that has already reached a price of what btc was in the beginning of 2017. 
1	1526799167	9	How is Bitcoin Cash a scam? It was created by the cohort of the bitcoin community that tried to increase the network capacity for years. When it became clear that the BTC chain would never increase the capacity with a block size increase, they created a minority fork. 
2	1526799362	-4	Just because you don't think there was no sign of progress, doesn't mean that the original chain can't reserve the option to wait out and assess their options. Increasing the block size wasn't done because it is the most simple and non scaleable solution, and was at best a quick fix.If you think that IOTA isn't quick enough to release plasma, do you just fork it and claim that due to the wait that your fork is just as much IOTA because they rushed it out?Why can't people get that you can't just fork a product and claim it to be just as real because you don't like the speed of development progress?
3	1526800301	6	so is BTC and the Core devs just gonna keep waiting it out and letting fees stay random as hell? No thanks. The block size getting raised has been a debate since 2014. 4 years ago. That's almost half the life of Bitcoin. Just keep on waiting for that Lightning Network!I'll take the always sub-cent fees on Bitcoin Cash.

1	1526827828	1	Once doing so is constructive for Bitcoin.
2	1526834840	1	So never most likely. 
2	1526839651	1	Constructive? This is not origami making class that youd be constructive to take everyone along lol. Bitcoin core needs to be destroyed, destructively. 
0	1526830343	0	So painfully obvious this thread is being brigaded by Bitcoin Cash shills. Disappointing
0	1526830897	0	The BCH community is so annoying I’m considering selling my bag just because of them. Sad.
1	1526839328	1	I'll take it off your hands for a buck
0	1526835652	0	I love Andreas, but I have to disagree here. Bitcoin Cash is a money grabbing fork-scam propped up only by Roger Ver who is attempting to pass it off as the “real” Bitcoin. No different than any of the other Bitcoin shitforks- Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, etc. All scams in my book.
0	1526802853	-1	I don't think it's same as Bitcoin and Ethereum but still a different shitcoin so I'm fine with it.
0	1526818034	1	Quite a good opinion, but the heads of BCH are shite so the product will be deemed the same.
1	1526818730	6	**Decentralized** projects dont have leaders, thats the whole point. 
2	1526819192	0	Well yea, that's sort of what I tried to say.
3	1526828146	1	So bitcoin core is also going downhill then
2	1526842474	0	means bcash isn't decentralized?

0	1526801966	-4	This forking aspect of crypto is proof of its infancy. I personally can’t wait until it disappears.
1	1526808119	4	Forking (chainsplitting) is the market governance mechanism. It will always be with us, or crypto is dead and we should all pack up and head home. Without the ability to split ledgers into two equal copies that preserve holder stake, governance is left to developers with no skin in the game, who can build a big moat around their software through complexity (\*cough\* Segwit) and code obfuscation.The BCH and BTC branches of Bitcoin are a great demonstration that will eventually show decisively whether micro-blocks or big blocks are better. 
2	1526813292	-1	Thankfully, I don’t believe we’ve reached a dead end with governance. Eventually, people much smarter than I, will figure out a solution that does not cause chain splitting. The splitting is in no way beneficial to mass adoption.
1	1526811576	1	You can‘t update blockchains without forkingEthereum switches to PoS? Hard-Fork  Coin X implementing Features like Smart Contracts? Hard-Fork
2	1526811706	0	I’m referring to chain forks. Why is ethereum classic crucial to crypto’s success?
0	1526806438	0	I agree with him.It's an important discussion to have, of course, but let's not forget that it's primarily us against the authoritarian government fiat system, not us against each other.The victory of any coin would be infinitely better than the domination of the authoritarian government fiat system.
0	1526831128	0	>biggest threat bitcoin facesOnly in the sense that new adopter looking for consise information have to wade through a shit storm of temper tantrums and childish vitriol. No wonder adoption is slow, it's enough to turn people off before they even learn the basics. 
0	1526803933	-4	Honestly, I'm tired of both BTC and BCH. So many more promising currencies waiting in the wings... Watching this fight is like watching two tribal communities behind the Commodore 64 and Apple IIe duke it out.Yeah I know BTC drives the market right now, blah blah blah. It's not very exciting though, and I don't think it will be the future. 
1	1526804321	6	Bitcoin Cash just enabled some more op_codes to its protocol. It gets kinda technical but basically it allows more data to be stored within a tx. This now enables things like tokenization and smart contracts / Dapps. Basically what Ethereum can already do.https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/may-2018-reenabled-opcodes.md
2	1526804991	0	But it's still stuck with a dismal transaction rate that cannot withstand mass adoption. Granted it's much faster than BTC... but it's not fast enough to survive prime-time.Even if you got the tx/s up though, you're still left with a coin that has no governance mechanism, nor treasury system that can ensure future development/enhancements to the blockchain.
3	1526805571	5	There are plans to keep raising the blocksize limit if blocks get close to being full (even half full!). BCH plans to onboard every person in the world. Plus, even we do get mass adoption, there is no reason why 2nd layer tech can go ontop of BCH. The LN does get shit on a lot but I think it is interesting, but there needs to be lots more work on it before it can handle any type of volume (BTC still waiting!)The governance is solved by the miners. If they don't like a change they can not mine and hard fork into their own coin. But funny you brought the treasury system up. Looks like the miners just had a nice little talk about that: https://twitter.com/georgelevy/status/997853877335740416
4	1526806813	1	Problem with governance only being given to miners, is that you're giving a heavily centralized group of individuals control. It's not like the good 'ol days where anyone with a pc or laptop can mine... it's an ever-shrinking group of individuals with a lot of capital to sink into mining equipment. Do these people really have the best interest of the currency at heart? After seeing what happened with Bitcoin last year, obviously not. Any change that threatens the use of their mining equipment will be heavily opposed by these miners (like a block size increase). Which leaves your hands tied when it comes to development and innovation.
1	1526807762	11	The fallacy you're making doesn't seem to have an official name, but I call it the Arrow of History Fallacy. It's the idea that any new idea is automatically better or more advanced than what came before. A good example of why it's a fallacy is when Soviet Russia and Maoist China thought their new social organization technology they called communism was a great advancement. The Great Leap Forward resulted in tens of millions of deaths. Why? Because they thought the whole "free market" thing was just old tech. They thought they had "smarter people" able to manage the economy better. They went messing with things they had no understanding of. Strong property rights and free trade weren't just one random shot in the dark that happened to be pretty good. They were extremely close to perfect because they understood economics and incentives. The same has happened with the altcoins, as well as Core's insane "full blocks" and "Lightning" experiments on BTC. Bitcoin was no shot in the dark. The parameters were chosen by someone who really understood and had deeply gamed out the network topology, game theory, statistical implications, economic incentives, and business realities of uncensorable cash money and even smart contracts. All these parameters like the 10-minute blocktime and long difficulty retarget are sneered at by altcoin developers who see them as easy fodder for change to make their own projects look unique. "10 whole minutes? Why not 10 seconds??" They don't see the long-term implications. The recent attack on Monacoin shows why short retargetting is a problem, for instance.Almost all the supposed "new tech" is breaking things Bitcoin fixed, thanks to misconceptions people have about Bitcoin - many of which have been perpetuated by the Core developers themselves (though never by Satoshi, with perhaps one exception).In truth, Bitcoin as originally designed, and as is being restored in Bitcoin Cash (BCH), is more powerful than any altcoin - not because BCH is special but because BTC and every altcoin are infected with silly ideas about scaling. BCH has the capability to do smart contracts better than Ethereum, without the need for gas, and in a *far* more scalable fashion. It can tokenize every single thing in the world for complete traceability, down to every little part in your PC. Most importantly, it can scale to terabyte blocks with no loss of decentralization, trustlessness, or security - in fact it will be vastly superior in all these areas, just because it embraces the original vision and doesn't fall prey to silly fallacies originating from Core and other people who don't grok economics, modern small-world network topology, business, or statistics.

0	1526833593	-1	I think that has changed significantly. BCH has tried to replace Bitcoin and taken on a bad actor role of spewing FUD, marketing it as the real bitcoin, and taking over domain and social accounts. Bitcoin and Eth have different purposes and can coexist as them selves but BCH has actively tried to confused users and take over bitcoin. Curious if he still things this way. 
0	1526836094	-1	I think the issue is that Bcash is pretending to be Bitcoin. 
1	1526842099	0	Bitcoin Cash is bitcoin.  It has the bitcoin genesis block, it has the same algorithm  and it's about to steal all your miners crippling your blockchain in the process.I don't blame you for panicking though.  You thought Bitcoin Cash was a fly you could swat at your leisure.  You are finding out that it's a giant hornet's nest.  Your panic and desperation is understandable.

0	1526830814	-2	Why would you choose bch or btc, when nano is out there.  Instant. No fees. Not bad for the environment. Scalable.It's like the idiots that kept investing in blockbuster.
1	1526831604	2	Because nano has no proven security model and is accepted nowhere. Has nowhere near the network effect that BCH has. It's is accepted in 100 thousand places via Bitpay, has the bitcoin brand, years of proven security, droves of developers and an awesome community with dedicated tools, conferences, snr exchanges. Also it offers instant confirmation and costs a penny/tx. Use whatever you want, but if you want to know "why do people use bch" ...that is why.
0	1526831156	-2	Bitcoin is just an international ponzi scheme slowly screwing tons of people all around the world. Only by thinking it has value does it maintain value, and it’s just wishful thinking to believe that anyone will, en masse, switch to bitcoin or any other type of online currency at any point in the future. I won’t be using it as a currency, ever. I would only use it as a get rich quick scheme, which I did and made a cool $300 bucks on the huge upswing at the beginning of the year and managed to sell before it all tanked. I won’t be ever investing in it again nor will I be ever attempting to purchase any online currencies because it’s literally the biggest scheme I’ve ever seen. Except for buying drugs on the black market or something there is no market for actually using it as currency and not just a way to make a quick buck, which I doubt you can even really do anymore.
