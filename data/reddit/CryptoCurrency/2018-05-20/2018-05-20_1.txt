0	1526827997	176	Some key points I picked up. Please add more in the replies:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BMW, as our new partner, is building up another solution on VeChainThor platform. More details will be announced directly from BMW later once it is ready to go.(refer to pg 87)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------VeChain and LogSafer are partnering to develop a blockchain solution for logistics insurance.(refer to pg 90)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------China is promoting its Agricultural Cultivation Management Plan by using IoT technology, agricultural planting process management, blockchain technology, big data and AI (artificial smart) to complete the management of the process before, during and after agricultural production. In this way, good currency drives out the bad to achieve a standard agricultural market.With this in mind, VeChain is cooperating with PwC, China Unicom and Liaoning Academy of Agricultural Sciences to develop a blockchain cloud project exclusively for the verification of the green organic agriculture(refer to pg 92)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The UK Government Office for Science has reported on the potential qualities and advantages of blockchain technology in its recent report ‘Distributed ledger technology: beyond block chain’: “Distributed ledger technology has the potential to transform the delivery of public and private services. It has the potential to redefine the relationship between government and the citizen in terms of data sharing, transparency and trust and make a leading contribution to the government’s digital transformation plan.”VeChain is partnering with the Administrative Examination and Approval Bureau of Gui’an New Area to provide a blockchain based information system to collect and analyze administrative data, offer privacy protection of data and to apply blockchain technology to reform business registration and cut red tape.(refer to pg 93)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MyStory is an off-the-shelf blockchain based digital assurance solution for the food and beverage industry combining deep industry expertise of prominent industry leaders and DNV GL, with independent physical audits, data collection, and verification services.The Italian wine sector is the first to use MyStory working directly with four wine producers, Michele Chiarlo, Ricci Curbastro, Ruffino and Torrevento who have partnered and collaborated with VeChain and DNV GL on this disruptive solution. These industry leaders will feature the MyStory label on their bottles in stores, using the VeChainThor Blockchain solution and hardware tags, by the end of the year. “MyStory illuminates products and their supply chain for the benefit of consumers, who will have instant and in-depth access to key product characteristics such as quality, authenticity, origin, ingredients, water and energy consumption and more, all verified by DNV GL along the entire transformation process,” says Luca Crisciotti, CEO of DNV GL — Business Assurance.The MyStory solution will not be a stand-alone application for the wine industry but will transcend this, to be an application accessible across a wide variety of markets.(refer to pg 83 & 84)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Oversea Liquor tracking platform for D.I.G., built on VeChain, can track wine from the very beginning of the process, including from when the bottles were still in the overseas winery. D.I.G. is a subsidiary company of the state owned company managing 30% of the imported wine market in China, WaiGaoQiao group, listed in the main board of Chinese Stock Exchange as 600648. This is the first successful Blockchain use case in production in China. Every detail about the bottle of red wine is marked and recorded at the beginning of the process. This way the regulator and D.I.G can use a smart contract to track the whole life period of the wine and log the ownership management, from the overseas winery, export, import, inspection, warehouse in the free trade zone, the distribution center and finally to all the different sales channels and retail stores.(refer to pg 82 & 83)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------VeChain started business engagement for use cases on Blockchain since early 2016 after the firstgeneration product and solution were built. In 2016 we began work on four use cases with major enterprises across the globe. In 2017, the number reached to over 20, including significant partnerships. Now, in early 2018, more than 210 opportunities are in the pipeline.(refer to pg 78)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Growth of the VeChain Foundation. This includes headcount increasing to between 100 and 150 for both technical and business development, and business growth of 20 billion USD as “VeChain GDP” running on VeChainThor Blockchain.(refer to pg 100)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------VeChain has worked with business partners Viseo and Microsoft France to initialize the vehicle passport project. In the project, the VeChain team is responsible for completing the blockchain deployment on Azure, developing and deploying smart contracts and providing standard API to the upper level applications including:6.3.1 Digital maintenance logs (refer to whitepaper pg 86)6.3.2 “Green Driving” (refer to whitepaper pg 86)(refer to pg 86)
1	1526829434	86	So difficult to comprehend that there are 15 cryptos with a higher marketcap lol. 
2	1526835048	66	Reminder that EOS is worth nearly 6x as much as VeChain despite zero indication that anyone is going to use it, and the fact that it is arguably more centralized than any of the top 20 projects, VeChain includedthe absolute state of the crypto market.  people would rather invest in fantasy than reality.  we'll see how that works out.
3	1526836576	27	This occurred to me the other day. VeChain, in much less time, asking for much less in funding, did what EOS is trying to do for well over a year, but *better*...
3	1526835795	-14	There are a lot of ERC20 but EOS is the most hated.... At least with EOS you can start to build your own dapp
4	1526836508	39	EOS gets the most hate because they're basically taking Ethereum, making it centralized af, claiming they'll kill Ethereum (while being an ERC20 token...), and then claiming they need a billion dollars to do it. Can't wait to see how big of a mess this mainnet is.
5	1526837591	1	I think EOS has more hate than other tokens because it has a high market cap
6	1526837802	14	well also all the scammy-ness but yes.
5	1526842985	-1	> EOS gets the most hate because they're basically taking Ethereum, making it centralized af, claiming they'll kill Ethereum (while being an ERC20 token...), and then claiming they need a billion dollars to do it.> > They get a lot of hate because every tech that  intents to replace the old tech is not accepted but later on when EOS gets more adoption and they bring out fine working product, people will Fomo into it.Also they're not centralized in theory they are but practically are they any more centralized than a network that is owned by 3-4 mining pools. How much role do you play in decentralization as an ETH holder, as an EOS holder I get to vote and play a very important role in it's decentralization. 
6	1526843269	3	ETH is more decentralized, since anyone could compete with these 3 pools. EOS is not decentralized. It may say it is, but hey, they also said they needed billions to do what VeChain may have already accomplished
7	1526843611	0	There are 121 nodes chosen by the community does that not make it decentralized? The community chooses to kick or keep them also It is believed BTC and ETH are decentralized but hey, ever heard of ASIC? and  EOS has been nailing in it's developer community it is in top 10 C++. I can't say anything about Vechain since I don't know much about it.
4	1526835914	8	VeChain chose to incorporate the Ethereum VM for exactly this reason.  You actually can start building something you want to ultimately run on VeChain right now.
5	1526843663	-12	> incorporate the Ethereum VMso they cant even create their own vm what a joke of a shitcoini bet they partnered with bmw by threatning to destroy all chinese bmw cars
6	1526845483	5	They are creating their own VM as well, which will allow for programming in languages other than Solidity. They chose to start with the ethereum VM so any dApp on ethereum now can be ported over and anyone who was developing on ethereum can immediately develop on VeChain without learning anything new.They are many moves ahead of what your pea brain is able to comprehend, your responses are very amusing to me
5	1526836243	-22	Ok, but I'm not shilling like a pig on Vechain, I don't like it, I don't invest.
3	1526844520	-9	Not like VeChain shills to attack other projects, lmao.
2	1526844590	-2	Yeah, I can’t work out why VeChain isn’t No1
2	1526830828	-67	not really...
3	1526832924	38	I was wondering what the haters would FUD with once the WP was out. Apparently, the answer is 'nothing', lol.
4	1526833075	28	Totally this, the hater comments here are pretty laughable, they cant even come up with proper criticism, it's just some random rants
5	1526833644	4	Haven't received the new talking points, but too early to clock out ;)
5	1526836794	2	well tbh their only criticism was "where's whitepaper?" 
5	1526835730	-13	It's hard to give a proper technical critic, not many of us here are blockchain experts. And the ones that are actually are, probably have better things to do, then try to convience strangers that they should be more skeptic. But you dont need to be a blockchain expert to have general common sense. If you're all in on VeChain based only on the stuff you have read on their medium blog or here, then you really need to learn to be more skeptical. They have no public mainnet yet. Most others above Vechain (based on market cap) have. That alone should be enough reason Vechain is not higher. They promise the stars, but that does not matter without seeing something anyone can verify. This space is full of scams, so if I see a project that is full of fluff, I'm gonna have doubts. I dont see a github repo, I dont see weekly developer conference calls uploaded to youtube, or a huge, open source community behind Vechain, where anyone can submit ideas to improve the protocol. All I see is marketing. And lot of delusional people here making outlandish claims. Vechain can turn out to be great, but what most people here call investing into this project, is laughable. I only started to look into their whitepaper, but I was not surprised to see it's 100+ pages, because it's full of fluff, and promises, and you have to fish out actual protocol details from it. Making it harder to have a complete picture. I could mention a few things I already find weird about it, but that would be nip picking because 1) I'm not even close to have a full picture (and I'm not gonna, just like 99% of vechain fans) 2) I'm no blockchain expert. Having a proper technical understanding of any project the size of Ethereum or Vechain can take many months, and of course I'm not that invested to sacrifise that much time.I know, solid contribution, let the downvotes come :)
6	1526836612	15	You're right. They make a lot of promises and you have to be skeptical about that, especially in the crypto space. However, having followed VeChain since december and having spend hours upon hours of research time on it, I can honestly say that they seem like they would absolutely be able to pull it off. The project is just so incredibly well thought out, which is probably because they have started the project years ago working together with all the right people.You'll see soon enough when you're done reading the whitepaper. Enjoy.
6	1526836976	6	>It's hard to give a proper technical critic, not many of us here are blockchain experts.

Most others above Vechain (based on market cap) have. That alone should be enough reason Vechain is not higher. These parts are pretty spot on, the rest though, you really just need to read up on it (as you said)
6	1526837027	3	Is DNV GL and PwC going to partner up and constantly gives update in a blockchain project full of promises and no deliver? How dellusional are you?It's even worse that you say you're not a blockchain expert, because it shows youre not expert in anything in this subject. Knowing PwC is basic knowledge for any investor in any area. All the companies that backs up Vechain shows clearly that they are one of the only trustworthy cryptos. I'm not even gonna respond to the rest of the post because most of those claims have been answered many times already.
7	1526837715	-5	> It's even worse that you say you're not a blockchain expert, because it shows youre not expert in anythingWhat? :D This sentence makes 0 sense. Throughout 5.5 years of university I read plenty of scientific articles on various topics, I have a pretty decent bullshit-o-meter. Them having big Chinese partners does not mean that much to me. Corruption in China, ever heard of it? :D There are even documentaries about it. Plus according to their whitepaper, many of the core members of the VeChain team worked at PwC before. It would be weird, if they would not have a partnership. That in itself therefore doesnt give more credibility in my eyes to VeChain. Having a mainnet with their new concensus protocol working for months without problems maybe will. Depending on the details...
8	1526838931	5	Your argumentation makes zero sense. You're basically saying that all Chinese are corrupt and therefore you can't trust them. Just because a few VeChain team members worked before at PwC it influences your view on the credibility?So I guess BMW, PwC, DNV GL (A Norway/German Company) and many more made an evil alliance to scam investors and token holders. Poor Jim Breyer :(
9	1526839491	2	You misunderstand me. I'm just saying I dont give that much importance/credit of the PwC partnership as others, because the project was already very well connected to PwC. And of cource not all Chinese companies are corrupt, but in general their business culture have a much worse reputation compared to many other countries.And partnerships announcements in general are relatively low significance to me. Big companies have a lot of branches and departments. A partnership can mean a lot of things, just from VeChain announcing it partnered with BMW, we wont know how significant that will turned out to be. When I will read an official BMW announcement that they actively use the VeChain blockchain in their production, to improve efficiency, then and only then I will care about it. Partnerships between companies can easily fail to be productive. I even have my own experience with that. And probably many other working people.
8	1526842326	2	Ok let me rephrase it, if you are not a blockchain expert and you dont know even about one of the big four companies, your knowledge regarding which crypto to invest is basically zero. Anyone that has been to college (including me with my also 5.5 years in engineering) has read a bunch of scientific articles, which doesnt add much in the crypto concern.
9	1526842581	1	I think you and I have a very different definition of what an expert means. Just because as a hobby I read, listened to and watched a bounch of resources about crypto/blockchain in the last 6 months, that does not make me an expert. I dont have the proper experience to evaluate the pros and cons between different cryptographic/consensus protocols and much-much more. Specially if it's something novel as PoA. You need years of hands on experience for that.But my electric engineering years in uni did teach me to see through the hype, buzzwords and empty claims in articles. And in my opinion, Vechain has a lot of those.
5	1526838417	-4	Btw if anyone here wants to give me an objective technical overview of Vechain after having read the whitepaper, I would welcome that. I see many Vechain fans saying "dont FUD, read up on it you moron", when criticism is mentioned on this subreddit, but I've yet to see articles, sources giving good technical details about the protocol on the level which can be found on Ethereum for example.And no, I did not try to go look for it myself that much (I've read most of the medium blogposts from Vechain that got to the front page here, but those did not hit that level, they were high on fluff), but thought for once maybe I can change the direction, and ask for details from others :) **I wanna see if VeChain fans can actually present in moderate detail, how the vechain protocol will work from June 30th.**
3	1526833836	2	Lol solid contribution Eth fan. 
4	1526834068	-8	Thanks, solid contribution from you too.
5	1526835217	11	I actually read the whitepaper and it speaks for itself, you come to this thread with the sole purpose of saying something negative with absolutely zero provocation or reasoning. I would love to hear and legit criticism of the project. 
6	1526836129	-6	I've come to the thread expressing my opinion of your comment. I'm allowed to do that, I dont need to give reasoning for it. I wrote some criticism [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8ksovw/unveiling_our_development_plan_and_whitepaper/dzag4xw/).
7	1526839203	7	ROFL!!!! You literally didn't say anything. Talking about fluff, and you right a paragraph of absolute nonsense that is prefaced by your lack of knowledge in regards to blockchain tech. Honestly, find something better to do, it is a bit embarrassing. 
8	1526839649	1	Looks like at least one of us (if not both) is very biased then.
9	1526839988	4	Not biased at all, there isn't a single legitimate criticism in that entire paragraph. Not to mention you claim ignorance, but somehow think your nonsense opinion is more credible then multiple billion dollar companies already using their services, as well as billionaire investors. If you had an actual criticism, that would be one thing, but you not buying it isn't one. 
5	1526834415	2	But your "not really" comment contributed so much, right?
0	1526830040	47	This answers so many of the criticism's and fud that has been thrown at this project. e.g.: Little spot I noticed from P79: "VeChainThor platform will be open source by end of June 2018"
0	1526830253	96	> **6.7 This is just the beginning**> The biggest challenge the VeChain team has been facing during the use cases development andimplementation in the past two years is not the technical concerns, but the business consensus ofhow to achieve new business models. However, we have been through the worst part already. Wegreatly appreciate all our business and technical partners who dare to step into this field with uswith great innovative spirit. This statement really sums up VeChain's business philosophy and why I am so heavily invested in them. They are saying that the biggest challenge in this space is not with the technology, but actually getting the right partners and business models to incorporate the technology effectively. Essentially, true adoption of the tech with actual use cases is more important than having the best tech with no true adoption
1	1526839096	10	>Essentially, true adoption of the tech with actual use cases is more important than having the best tech with no true adoptionI think NANO is a great example of this. Great technology with amazing potential but very lacking in terms of adoption. I like VeChain's approach of starting at use cases & business development and working from there before they started working on the tech. This is why they have many big partnerships and customers already. And why they released the whitepaper so late.
2	1526841715	13	I think you're being a little too critical towards NANO. It's just meant to be a currency and nothing else, so comparing adoption between these two crytpo's is wrong imo. Nano doesn't need to partner with companies, it would be lovely if they do, but they don't need to. VeChain on the other hand, I think they DO need to partner with the right strategic partners because of the objectives of their product. Adoption for Nano will come organically once everyday people actually start using cryptocurrency's as currency's.
2	1526847256	0	How is it that in every thread, no matter the topic, Nano shills manage to bring up Nano?
1	1526833275	-102	> biggest challenge in this space is not with the technologyyeah ok ethereum has way more adoption that vechain. nobody has even heard about this corporate shitcoin outside of cc and their local partners tech IS the biggest challenge right now.  EDIT: i love downvotes from vechain shills 
2	1526833826	25	Ethereum adoption in real life enterprise? Where?
3	1526839192	-1	https://entethalliance.org
4	1526840360	3	So which one of those enterprises have implemented ETH into their systems that has helped them in their work? 
5	1526840790	-3	Like all of them lol. Its one of the main reasons why Ethereum upgrades like casper and sharding are taking so long. The implementation is done, but extensive testing must be done because so many major enterprises are utilizing Ethereum.
6	1526841492	4	No tell me how it has helped them. Don't need much. Just give 1 example of a single company. 
4	1526840942	2	Have any companies in the Ethereum alliance actually adopted the public Ethereum blockchain? I looked into it previously and it seemed like all of the members were simply building their own Ethereum based platforms and not using the public Ethereum blockchain.
5	1526841132	0	The ones building “Ethereum based platforms” are doing so to test their systems on the blockchain while the public chain matures and scales.Eventually everything will be moved to the public Ethereum blockchain.
4	1526844870	1	Thats a research institute man
2	1526833803	39	I own zero vechain right now so understand my position when I say this...  but wouldn’t that make it the right time to buy?  Get in early on a project with little to no public awareness that shows enormous potential?I’m gonna buy a little ven today actually I think.
2	1526833673	33	cryptokittiesadoptionlol
3	1526833781	-44	name one vechain product i can use right nowoh wait there isnt any
4	1526834893	19	it hasn't launched you tremendous genius
4	1526835393	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtAqj0-OmYc
5	1526839796	-3	its a video poc there is no actual product to use right now
6	1526840421	-1	No, it's available to buy in Shanghai. 
7	1526840656	0	im not flying to Shanghai to buy a shitty quality alcohol from a local chinese 711
8	1526840809	1	Then why claim that there is no actual product? You're just straight up lying at this point. 
9	1526840989	1	because im not lying.the product is for sale but mainnet is still due. dont make sense does it ?
4	1526835730	9	Why do you dumb fucks always say this? https://twitter.com/bangcryptobang/status/986889797296795648?s=21
5	1526841557	-1	its not a blockchain product mainnet isnt live.anyone can use ethereum to do the same thing. i have went to many bars where they accept ethereum
6	1526845005	1	Ethereum being accepted by a Big Four? I dont think so. Different level of a game man.  
2	1526836466	14	No... You're being down voted for being ignorant af and editing your post to make it seem like you're less so 
2	1526834053	16	No you got downvotes because you accused VeChain of buying partners for millions without any evidence whatsoever, which you've since edited out of your post (and is why your sentence no longer makes sense - it was between the words "partners" and "tech")
3	1526834522	-23	you think bmw will partner with a company for free ?why not go with the top blockchain like ethereum with much bigger community and adoptionthese companies pay in form of tokens/dollars for advisors/partners
4	1526835708	16	Ethereum currently can not scale and has unpredictable costs and governance.  For those reasons, enterprises will not use it.  There is a reason that despite the EEA being formed, you've never heard of any its major enterprise members doing anything at all on Ethereum.The EEA got formed because Ethereum was the only game in town at the time, and all those institutions and enterprises were interested from an academic and educational perspective in smart contracts and blockchain technology.They evaluated it and they didn't use it.  They aren't going to use it.  It will be a public blockchain and get lots of use for fun things like cryptokitties, but it isn't going to be used by enterprises and institutions for the reasons stated above.  It really isn't hard to see.People continue investing in fantasy, not reality.  That may work for the short term, but it isn't going to play out well over the longer term.
5	1526840368	0	> Ethereum currently can not scale and has unpredictable costs and governance.>all those institutions and enterprises were interested from an academic and educational perspective in smart contracts and blockchain technology.vechain compromises decetralization for scaling which plasma, loom, solves.vechain has zero technical advantages over ethereum you sound like some dumb vechain shill with zero technical knowledge>That may work for the short term, but it isn't going to play out well over the longer term.Seriously? with sharding p4 ethereum will scale much better than vechain with 100 times more decentralized. p1 is already running in testnet
6	1526845581	3	Doesn't fix the governance problem or the cost problem. Good luck.
4	1526835095	10	Exactly... WHY NOT? You don’t think these billion dollar companies sent out their tech teams on a mission to explore all Blockchain options? Obviously Vechain is the winner. 
5	1526841283	-4	no the correct answer is when billion dollar companies asked for millions of dollars vitalik showed them the door while sunny lu sold out
6	1526841693	0	Lol 
2	1526833919	7	Got any proof of your claim of buying partners, or did you just decide to make it up?By local partners, I assume that includes Europe, USA, Australia? DNV GL (for one), is European.
3	1526834321	-16	> Got any proof of your claim of buying partnersi assume you have never created a startup before. Partners are mutual-relationship nothing is free. local as in branch not the parent actual companyits a whole different ballgame
4	1526835143	15	so I take it your answer is "no", you dont have any proof that vechains partners were "bought for millions$$$", and i assume that's why you edited your post, perhaps realizing you went too far (and then tried to blame vechain shills).
5	1526840828	-2	there is no proof needed its a known thing. its normal to pay and get partnerships in corporate world. burgers wont know that
6	1526841567	1	VeChain paid DNV-GL and PwC to purchase a minority stake? Seems like the opposite makes more sense..
7	1526841726	0	Vechain will pay them % of VET to get parternship get it ?
8	1526841968	1	Typically when you buy a stake in a company you pay that company money for equity, not the other way around. 
9	1526842465	0	they are not *buying* they are *partnering*. vechain will have to pay those companies in return of their services, it being auditing tech or moving their existing popular product to their platform.Vechain gets fame+service , others get stake/coins/fiat. hence **partnership**.nothing stops bmw to partner with neo or eos or eth. sunny lu gave them an offer they couldnt refuse
2	1526833375	-19	This guy gets it 
0	1526826475	85	"BMW,  as  our  new  partner,  is  building  up  another  solution  on  VeChainThor  platform.  More details will be announced directly from BMW later once it is ready to go." Page 87, Hype!
1	1526827114	26	Thats the you gotta work for it partnership announcement. Read 86 pages and you will see the BMW surprise. 
2	1526836863	1	Share some if possible, can’t open it on this phone 
3	1526837090	10	The OP above posted the quote/text from the whitepaper. Vechain basically just confirmed that BMW will announce the details of the partnership soon. Of course we knew to some degree that BMW was a partner but the garage program wasnt concrete enough to really get hyped. Vechain just reassured everybody that something real and concrete is coming and BMW will announce it. 
4	1526841193	2	I think I've read somewhere before that BMW's gonna announce something regarding VeChain. This whitepaper abstract made it now pretty crystal clear.
1	1526826538	13	Boom 
0	1526831008	75	I highly encourage everyone from the Crypto space to read this white paper. I have read dozens of white papers and VeChain has taken it to a whole new level. It clearly states a solid understanding of the past, present and future technical and businesses development.If anyone had any doubt of the future success of VeChain, I personally believe that this white paper clearly demonstrates the ability of this company to create real value for real world applications. We all know many of the blockchain projects will soon disappear and it is clear to me that VeChain will consume most of the investors which exit failed projects and become the world's leader in blockchain technology and innovation.  As a system engineer and software developer of 20 years, I can really appreciate their technical road map including VeKeystore, VeBaaS, VeSDKS and VeIaaS. There is no doubt in my mind that the majority of crypto projects are over valued and I strongly believe that VeChain is severely, severely undervalued!!!

0	1526824450	43	To all the bums who kept harping about whitepaper, now is the time for you to sit down and start reading.
1	1526825304	20	I’m on record supporting the VeChain project, but calling people bums because they wanted to see a white paper before investing, is childish. There should have been a white paper available at the time of their ICO. It’s similar to a traditional businesses, Business Plan. I’m glad they unveiled their white paper, but your comment is asinine.
2	1526831800	9	They had at business plan.   
2	1526825957	61	WHY? They had a solution in place prior to going public! A white paper is nothing more than a theory you'd like to try and prove... This market demanding one is what is childish.
3	1526826210	21	You took the words right off my fingers. Bravo!
3	1526840670	2	Besides didn't they effectively already have a white paper? It was just in very bad English.
3	1526829738	2	expecting a business to have a business plan isn't much of a reach. It's a public deceleration of the businesses goals, intentions and thoughts.
4	1526830913	15	A whitepaper isn't a business plan though. Whitepapers are technical documents that do a deep dive into a particular topic. They present the results of research or offer proofs. Whether a company has one isn't indicative of whether they have a business plan. Furthermore, most companies do not disclose their business plans or strategic planning in low level detail (for obvious reasons). The best you get is some high level discussion or statement to shareholders if its a publicly traded company.
5	1526834923	0	It's an analogy.
4	1526831823	8	They had a business plan. 
5	1526834011	5	And a road map, and a technical paper beating most WP out there, and a WP in Chinese.
4	1526830115	3	Which VeChain is constantly developing, anyone who did any research on VeChain and still complained about a whitepaper is not very bright. Everyone else is lazy.
2	1526826242	18	Because most projects have a white paper and no product. Vechain has a working product a long time ago. 
2	1526825442	-16	Ok, I admit that emotions got the better of me. I should not have used the word “bum”. Maybe “Vechain haters” or “WTC bag holders” would’ve been more appropriate. But I will not edit my original comment. 
3	1526825916	22	Or maybe "Skeptical investors who have a right to be wary in this scam filled market"? Chill out on the hate and name calling, especially when its against investors who just want to be informed of their investments. Makes this community look dumb.Edit: weary to wary
4	1526826299	11	They had a development plan... because you know... it wasn’t a theory any more? There was never anything to be skeptical about, the lack of “whitepaper” being an issue proves that most people here don’t know jack shit and got lucky. 
5	1526826805	7	See I totally agree with you which is why I had a majority of my portfolio in Vechain prior to the white paper release. But the reality is a lot of people who enter this space did so because they are wary about major corporation involvement. So getting to see the technical side of things instead of relying on enterprise involvement would be important for many and shitting all over people for demanding to see that side of Vechain is immature imo.Edit: weary to wary
6	1526826877	-2	You never even asked the question people are apparently shitting on you for?
7	1526827098	3	Lol what are you talking about? I don't have any questions and I never said anyone was shitting on me. I am just saying talking shit about people who just wanted to see the whitepaper before investing is immature...
8	1526836987	1	Asking for a whitepaper of a project before investing is immature. One should ask for demonstration of product or business/development plan. 
9	1526837264	3	Fair enough. I personally think the closed source nature of their project at this point should be peoples main reason for not investing. But again even if someone has a dumb reason for holding off on a coin they still don't deserve to be shamed or told their just "wtc bagholders". Instead open a discussion about what their concerns are, voice your opinion on their concerns, then move on with your life. All I am trying to say is no need to be a dick about it hahah
9	1526843758	1	Not when that product is blockchain. The technology itself is in its infancy so a good demo and a well written business plan doesn't imply good technology. And thus far, every blockchain has made compromises so people want to know for themselves what those compromises are and how this particular implementation is different from the others out there. The criticism about the white paper is overblown but I also think the criticism about the whitepaper critics is also overblown. 
8	1526832417	0	There is absolutely nothing immature about that. Your rationale makes 0 sense. I think you calling that immature is an immature thing to say.. I’m sure you also don’t care about the inability to see their code.. 
9	1526836973	1	>There is absolutely nothing immature about that.I disagree.>Your rationale makes 0 sense.How so?  Vechain is still at this point closed source and only just released their whitepaper. It may have proved itself to many who care less about the technology and more about enterprise use and real world adoption but there is still a large chunk of investors who rely on understanding a projects underlying technology and comparing it to the competitors. In this market technology is one of the only useful tools for valuation, because when you focus less on technology and more on marketing and partnerships you end up with a coin like verge. I think its fair for people to wait and see how the technology matches up against coins like Ethereum rather than go all in because DNV GL said it has solid fundamentals. And this is coming from someone who went basically all in because DNV GL said it has solid fundamentals lol. I am not bashing vechain (Although you might be because I don' really understand your point) I just want this tribalistic "WTC bagholders on suicide watch LOLXDDDDDD" to end because it is cancer and does nothing for the crypto community overall.>I’m sure you also don’t care about the inability to see their code..Don't make assumptions. The closed source nature of the code will be addressed soon but it is another aspect that may just keep some people from investing. Now while I think at this point Vechain has proven themselves enough and anyone in this space should be keeping a close eye on Vechain I am not going to hate on someone just because they don't want to invest in a closed source project. And if someone decides to not invest in Vechain because its closed source why should it matter? Vechain will succeed with or without them as long as they follow through on their promises. Hating on someone just because they don't have the same coin as you is asinine.
4	1526833596	2	Weary means tired. You should use either wary or leery. Sorry, pet peeve. 
5	1526837336	2	Hahah no worries man I appreciate the correction. Grammar is important!
4	1526826102	1	Ok, I’m sorry. I was just having a bit of fun. I will stop now. Full disclosure, I also own WTC. 
1	1526825190	-15	Asking a multi-billion dollar market cap project to have a whitepaper explaining what it even is isn’t “harping.”
2	1526827045	18	If you had to guess, what percentage of people do you think were genuinely asking for a white paper, and which were trolling idiots?
3	1526831626	3	You don't need to guess, one look at this guy's history and he's 1000% a salty troll

4	1526847099	1	Not gonna name other coins but with my level of investment doesn't make sense to hold more than 5 diff coins imo.. I am banking on a couple chains i think have potential. But yea.. Reconsidered and bought back at virtually the same price i sold at

2	1526838216	3	ice cold :)
0	1526824560	6	Awesome! Should give us a lot of real use cases and their vision 
0	1526828772	4	So page 38 where it’s talking about Thor generated per 10,000VET is this considering the x100 supply change revealed last week? So say I currently have 100VEN aka I’ll have 10,000VET therefore generating 4 VTHO a day?
1	1526829919	6	Everything in the whitepaper has been written with the 100x in mind so the numbers should be converted to the new diluted format
1	1526831183	3	You are reading it correctly. It isn't a typo. You will get 4 VTHO a day.
2	1526831309	-1	x100
3	1526831371	3	No
4	1526831606	1	10,000x100x0.00432 = 432?
5	1526831645	1	He had 100. 100 * 100 * .000432
6	1526831998	2	Ahhhhh, ok ok yeah 4 makes more sense for 100
5	1526831726	1	4.32 VTHOR per 10,000 VET per day. /u/ItsEvan23 will have 10,000 VET after x100 change.
1	1526828945	1	Good question. Was thinking the same. 
1	1526829223	1	I think that's a typo, I would think they meant 1 million
2	1526831108	1	As mentioned in the comment below, every other reference in the paper has the x100 rate taken into account. I'm not so sure if it's a typo, it seems like a really important piece of information for them to just gloss over.Previously they've stated that the rate will be 0.00042 VTHOR / 1 VET / day. This is still the case, but we just didn't know about the VET you hold being x100 what it was prior.
1	1526833017	1	Any idea if one has to do anything for this supply change? I have my VET sitting in MEW at the moment...
1	1526847215	1	Im pretty sure that is still in current VEN tokens (10,000 VEN tokens today generates 4.32 THOR), unless they are also increasing THOR generation by x100
0	1526827930	10	From a quick skim through, the goals and design seem very similar to NEO (two-token model, dividends, a more limited number of nodes and focus on being compliant with regulation). The only major difference is the use of Proof of Authority for consensus, so it'll be interesting to see how well that scales and compares to dBFT. I expect it will perform very similarly given the minimal requirements to reach a fast consensus. The biggest issue with this approach is that it is still weak to a 51% attack, and can still fork/result in orphan blocks. That lack of finality isn't ideal, but it could theoretically be changed and solved.Very interested to follow the progress of this one, and very glad I invested when I did. 
1	1526828387	10	That 51% attack was addressed here:https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/defining-the-vechainthor-blockchain-consensus-proof-of-authority-8cf3f51a5fa0
1	1526837139	1	NEO’s 2 token design does not work. GAS is useless for mass adoption, it is fundamentally flawed due to its finite number and no cost adjustment mechanism. 
2	1526841144	3	I've been thinking about selling my NEO, and this is a big reason.
2	1526844984	1	GAS won't have a fixed supply for 21 more years?On top of that, the entire argument against fixed supply is that it gives incentives to hold rather than spend (prices drop, your coins become worth more so you want to hold on to it to get a better deal). This is a non-issue for NEO because GAS is redistributed to NEO holders whenever it is used. This gives an incentive to hold NEO, not GAS, which is absolutely ideal considering you want holders anyway so that they can help govern the network.
3	1526845088	1	How much does it does to deploy a NEO Smart Contract now? $15000ish given the GAS price? Does that make any sense? 
4	1526845515	2	As of current price, $11,662 (or less if you use MCT). Absolute peanuts to a legitimate project, or are you wanting more projects that want to raise millions of dollars in funding through ICO with zero initial investment or incentive to follow up on it? Name another industry where you can start a business and gain millions of dollars in capital in a span of *weeks* with zero investment from the founders. Hell, most companies are lucky to start generating profit by their 3rd year. This is such a ridiculous point to make.If you'd like a discussion about NEO contract deployment costs I'm happy to have one, but I'm curious as to why you had no more input on your issues with the supposed uselessness of GAS?
5	1526846608	1	Really? Go ask any enterprise id they want to spend that for smart contracts, 1 for 10k how about 100?  You are serious thinking 10k usd is cheap for a sc? Lol good luck mass adopting. On a second note, there are no hfh level business men in NEO foundation or CoZ, how would they know what “legit project” is? 
6	1526847197	1	A smart contract that raises millions of dollars from a $11,000 investment is a pretty exciting prospect for any enterprise, though on that scale they are more likely to go through the Ontology route and have their own custom chain.You seem to have some strange issues with NEO, but they aren't stemming from a logic at all. Checking your post history, you seem to be a hardcore hater of any platform that isn't VET. I don't blame you for supporting VET, they have the potential to be massive. But you don't need to spread retarded FUD about other projects to make VET look good. When you fail to acknowledge the positives of other projects, you just come off as an ignorant shill.Don't be that guy. Have an intelligent discussion. VET and NEO even share a partner in PwC. These are not stupid people, they are enterprise level businessmen that understand what the future of blockchain is going to look like. Support your fellow cryptos, especially when they are similar enough to compete. Adoption for NEO means interest in VET, and vice versa. NEO and VET are both new generation cryptos with a focus on compliance, scalability and efficient consensus. A win for one is a win for the other.
7	1526847402	1	VET and NEO share a partner in PwC? Where did you get that from?  I know Da before he founded On Chain, while he was a rep of Ripple in China, like Justin Sun. I know more about NEO than 99% of the people on this reddit.  VeChain is what NEO wanted to be but failed. 
8	1526847796	1	DYOR. Again you ignore reason to shill your bags. Is this what people meant when they talk about paid VET shills? You're the kind of guy that gives this project a bad rep. Sort yourself out.
9	1526848176	1	Show me a link like the below link from PWC official channels that stated NEO and PWC any entity has a Joint Business Relationship, otherwise, NEO foundation is lying.  Joint Business Relationship is the PwC internal phrase for partnership.  https://www.pwchk.com/en/press-room/press-releases/pr-040518.html#utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=20180504 
1	1526834083	-1	51% attack it's near impossible
2	1526835287	6	You would have to have multi-billion dollar corporations agree to collude. Not gonna happen. 
3	1526837032	6	I mean...all the multi-billion dollar banks colluded to prop up the housing market and give undeserving people loans for years. Don't act like a high level collusion couldn't happen, just might not be the same thing as a take-over 51% attack that everyone is afraid of. I'm not against VeChain but with centralization comes risk of people holding the power behaving badly, the whole reason why crypto exists in the first place.
4	1526842137	3	The 51% would have to pull it off without any of the other authority nodes being aware of it. Vechain itself owns an authority node.
4	1526837159	2	Sorry, man, didn't mean to be a dick. I don't think your comparison is analogous. No point in arguing. 
3	1526836017	0	Why not? Don’t be so naive.
4	1526836498	0	You clearly have no understanding of enterprise-level business.I'm not naive - you're clueless. 
5	1526843944	2	Yeah what a fool. There's never been a case of mega business enterprises  colluding or engaging in price fixing. Especially not Chinese companies. 
6	1526844858	2	You clearly don't understand math. You need half of the nodes to collude without even 1 knowing. The chance of one of the nodes going for collusion is already incredible small.Then that node needs to go to another, assuming that node will be a bad actor also. More then likely it will report the bad actor. A bad actor would need to do this 50 times in a row without one reporting the activity.Its an infinitesimally small chance that 50 will collude. Like literally many fractions of a percent.
7	1526846821	1	Who are the 101 active validators who are purportedly putting their identities and reputations on the line? Can we assume they are strangers? Can we assume no one person or entity controls more than one? Also such collusion would never happen in piecemeal fashion where one validator goes to one node after the other effectively telling them he is a bad actor. First the nodes agree to form some kind of consortium and collusion proceeds organically from there — much like how it ordinarily occurs in business sectors today.

0	1526840492	2	If anything, governments need to implement the blockchain infrastructure. Most people know that the government is corrupt, so this new technology will ensure that they are doing their job correctly. Hence, the US treasury cannot account for trillions of dollars! 
0	1526842846	2	Wow, just wow.

0	1526828058	-35	I usually review whitepapers of shitcoins because I want to tear their project before they reach front page. No way in hell am I reading this on a Sunday morning before work edit: I didn't mean to come off as obnoxious as I did. I accept the downvotes because tbh if I saw this comment I would downvote it too. If it gives me any credit, I called out /r/FlickerNetwork before people caught on it was a scam.
1	1526828280	18	Cool story bro, I wish I was cool like you.
2	1526829413	-11	Don't worry you're a crypto vegan, you got that covered.
1	1526829720	6	"before work".... You mean before you start your daily life wasting grind on Old School Runescape. 
2	1526829758	-4	Haha what a game. Unfortunately I quit after a while, just didn't like the direction the game was going.That game will always have a special place in my heart though <3 I hope to try it again when I'm 60.
3	1526833285	4	WoW was the real deal amigo
1	1526828228	1	Cool man. 
1	1526832081	-10	keep me updated pls :DI cant even load it :(I assume it's full of promises, and not verifiable statements.
2	1526832681	3	There's multiple mirrors in the vechain sub's megathread (and one mirror above in this thread). I'm sure the guys there will answer any questions you have too ;)
3	1526832868	-2	yeah I managed to find my way to it already, thanks though :)
