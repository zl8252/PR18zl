1	1526810090	14	its a 4chan mayme.
1	1526843285	2	Blessed is money skelly
0	1526783110	111	I get why other projects do compromise, however, everyone needs to know that all these high tx blockchains are generally sacrificing in one direction or another.Edit: That shirt lmao
1	1526831649	10	I haven't seen a good argument yet on this "sacrifice".  I am told over and over that centralization and lack of network security is the problem with dag coins, and I just stare and them and say, "Bitmain".  How can a Bitcoin holder, keep a straight face, and let these words leave their mouth, when Bitmain owns 34% of their network?  All your energy wasted, your slow transaction speed, your high transaction cost, ALL to stop centralization and securing the network, and a single company counters this argument.
2	1526834504	4	At least with a blockchain, there is competition to increase your hash power because you are rewarded for it. In DAGs, the validator nodes are crutches without reward incentives, and the networks depend on them to survive. Does that sound sustainable?
3	1526838312	4	Depends how many nodes there are vs how many needed...  100,000 nodes but only 2,900 needed? I’d say it’s fine. 10,000 nodes and 7,000 needed and you have a problem 
3	1526844723	1	Block lattice doesnt need to increase the hash power, because everyone has their own blockchain.  You secure your own blockchain.  Bitcoin has the issue of competition, which causes wealthy investors to work towards a controlling stake in the network.  You end up with Bitmain controlling 34% in 8 years, so 51% control is inevitable.  In the case of Bitcoin, I dont have to ask, "is that sustainable?", I ask, How could you possibly believe that is a secure network?  There is zero incentive for me to use my computer to secure the Bitcoin network because I will never be able to compete with Bitmain.  The incentive is not there, Bitcoin is at the mercy of the rich and powerful.Now let's look at Dag, a dag is only at the mercy of its developers, which every single coin is.  In the case of dag though, we do not have to worry about bad actors like Bitmain, working towards network control for their greed.  Fact is, dag works, it currently works, this isnt a theory, it's a mainnet, live, working every day.
2	1526832981	3	It's a good point. Mining pools are an issue for sure. It is also not completely the same as a single person or company owning the computers that are mining. I don't know who is saying centralization is a problem with DAG. Maybe security. DAG fixes a lot of things, the problem is it is still really really new technology. Our biggest examples probably being NANO and IOTA. I have huge faith in them, but IOTA just recently is getting away from their transaction problems, and NANO keeps having wallet issues. If they PAN out it could be a big threat, but it's still not there yet. 
1	1526830765	3	Blockchains live and die by the CAP theorem.
2	1526833101	2	It's actually not directly the CAP theorem, that applies to distributed data stores. Granted, you could say a blockchain is a distributed data store, but it's also much more than that. It suffers from a different but similar trilema: decentralization, scalability, and security.
3	1526842212	1	Well said, I was reducing it a bit to CAP.  Yeah, the trilemma is real tho, good point.
4	1526842279	1	Yeah for sure. Certainly a lot of cross over!
1	1526845835	1	except nano...
2	1526846072	1	Don't pretend nano doesn't have issues right now still. If it pans out it will be great, and I have  a lot of faith in them. However, like all dag projects, they're still early. 
1	1526801876	-32	I would say that Zilliqa is currently the only project that is close to implementation of high TX blockchain with good enough security. You could argue that shard with 600 nodes is less secure than the whole network but since the shards are rearranged every two hours it makes it quite secure. I agree it is still a trade off though...
2	1526823984	2	Every post you've made is just about shilling this zilliqa shitcoin, that's why you get down voted.
2	1526811152	-4	This is true. It shouldn't be downvoted. A lot of projects sacrificing decentralisation atm
2	1526811419	-4	Could you please explain why do you downvote my post? You don't agree about Zil or about sharding security or anything else?I don't care about karma, just pure curiosity
3	1526815989	1	My guess is people have PTSD (Post Traumatic Shill Disorder), so they downvote any comment where a different crypto than the topic is mentioned.
4	1526823348	1	~~What has that to do with PTSD?~~People are just afraid, and justifiably right so, of people wanting to shill their coin.
5	1526823837	2	It was a joke. Read what's in the parentheses...
1	1526824370	-4	Look into HPB. They are combining hardware and software and it’s beautiful.
2	1526829081	3	I get what they're doing but wouldn't they run into a similar problem? How many people would buy the hardware? 
1	1526787603	-19	[deleted]
2	1526790858	14	>The difficult thing for mainstream players to wrap their heads around in regards to transaction volume is that it's not provided by transactions per second in the crypto-space like it would be for Visa/Mastercard/Interac, instead it comes from transactions per second per crypto-currency.It's not really that difficult to "wrap your head around"
2	1526800458	13	A company can’t just switch blockchain on the fly, crypto currencies aren’t inter-changeable.
3	1526829704	0	But what if they were?
2	1526789217	5	My opinion is people get stuck in the Moore's Law sort of mindset. We see Intel and Nvidia release a new video card that doubles the number of teraflops it can do every couple years, and most of the time without sacrificing much in power requirements. So it's easy to see Plumbuschain come out of nowhere having 10X tx/s that Ethereum has and assume that they just "improved" the tech or coding, and made the system better. Now plumbus chain is like a gtx 1080, and Ethereum looks like a gtx 580.
3	1526808660	1	Do we? It took 10 years of intel taking baby steps to release a mainstream 6 core. AMD has only recently managed to kick up their game a notch to make that happen. Nvidia has similarly slowed down the past few years due to lack of competition from AMD. AMD is doing well in low and mid tier GPUs but can only compete up to a 1070 TI with current Vega, and they can't currently push the volume to be a threatening amount of competition there. So we get stagnation until AMD can can pull a zen in the GPU space, or intel pulls out some insane wildcard.
4	1526830166	3	Lets look at the release year of bitcoin vs now. The GTX 280 was the flagship in 2009, GTX 1080TI currently in 2018.Memory:280: 1gb1080TI: 11GBMemory Speed:280:141 GB/S1080TI: 484 GB/SPixel Rate:280:19 GPixels1080TI:139 gpixelsTexture Rate:280:48 GTexels1080TI: 354 GTexelsFloating point:280:622 GFlops1080TI:11,340 GFlopsTDP:280: 236W1080TI: 250WSo looking here certain spots have gone up quite a bit. Memory 11x, Floating point 18X, Texture rate 7x etc. while the TDP is like 6% higher.
5	1526832485	3	There were easy gains to be had from node shrinking, now costs are going up with each shrink and we are reaching limits in size/profitability. We were on 32nm and 14nm for quite some time and no consumer gpus have releases yet for 7nm. We really need to hope the fabs can nail euv down to a tee
0	1526782687	59	It's like the secret police ethics commissioner saying that ethics should not be compromised in order to favor high-efficiency prosecution of crime cases.Finally, a cryptocurrency with a moral backbone. Edit: Sorry, for those of you who cannot take metaphorical compliments.Edit 2: If you disagree, or hates ETH, and have something solid to back you up, I can be convinced. But please link to sources or BTFO with the hate.
1	1526785607	6	Asking out of curiousity because I'm ignorant, but doesn't Ethereum have mining pool issue like Bitcoin, and if 2 of the pools collude they could control the transaction verification no? 
2	1526787979	28	but those pools consists of many individual miners who can just leave pools if that happens.
3	1526838416	3	Yea I hate this argument I’m in one of those pools because it makes my life easier but I can back out any second I think they do something I don’t like. They don’t control the GPU power the just let us smaller guys work together and make it easier for us.
2	1526786349	8	yes but feel free to compete with this and make their share amount to less. You can't compete when you have system's like EOS or  VeChain (not bashing VEN, it's amazing), where there are a select amount of people that are chosen to run the network at a time.
3	1526805922	3	From my understanding, you can easily vote those 'selected people' out in EOS... they are also all chosen by the community. Isn't it almost the same as Ethereum then? If a mining pool is being malicious, the miners can leave. If a delegate is being malicious, they can be voted out.
4	1526825013	2	In practice, yes, with DPoS usually being a bit more decentralized since it forces a certain number of actors while pools usually end up with like 2.    Its more the theoretical side that bothers people. Kinda like how America was setup to not support political parties and ended up with more centralized parties than those who did.     BUT remember ETH is moving to proof of stake. It will be interesting to see how that ends up in practice. 
5	1526838532	1	Your leaving out the important fact that those pools are full of little guys like me who are just working together, we don’t communicate or have any way to collude so the second the pool owner does anything we don’t like we can back out and mine on our own.. the pool argument is literally bogus because of that one fact.
4	1526836217	1	In theory yes. dPoS works on paper... the way communism works on paper. It's just never worked out yet (save ARK and Nano's take on it). Even if it does work, it's not as decentralized as ETH could be, and never will be. I don't think EOS claims to be decentralized though, they should fully well know they aren't.
5	1526840781	1	EOS will be decentralized though. There will be 21 block producers with the top 20 being voted in and the 21st randomly round robin chosen on each block.Consensus requires 2/3 + 1 or 15 of the 21 BP's. So 15 out of 20 BP's (last spot is always rotating) or 75% of the BP's need to collude and act malicious. Also while I know a lot of people hate Bitfinex here, I was reading their Block Producer AMA and they are developing a voting tool on their Exchange to allow EOS holders to vote for BP's while holding their tokens on the exchange. This will help guarantee that Bitfinex isn't using their customers tokens to vote for themselves and the BP's they want. If more exchanges could develop and adopt these same voting tools it would help with the voting and decentralization of BP's for users that don't want to hold their EOS in their own wallet.Decentralization on EOS will mainly come done to the community actively participating and voting for the BP's that have their best interest in mind and voting out any malicious actors if there are any.I'd rather have to worry about 15 BP's somehow colluding together and staying in control than 2 or 3 mining pools colluding. Imagine if Bitmain and the chinese mining pools decide to abandon BTC and shift all hashing power to BCH. All BTC transactions would be stuck as block times take much longer than 10 minutes to mine and you have to wait 2 weeks before the difficulty readjusts.
6	1526841346	1	If you truly think that what you just described is decentralization, I won't take that from you.
7	1526841767	2	As an EOS holder, I have a vote in the community/decentralization.How does your average ETH holder have a say in the community/decentralization unless you are a developer or miner?
8	1526843187	1	they can buy as many GPU's as they fucking want/can and become a major part of the network. just because ETH right now has issues, doesn't mean that EOS is more decentralized
1	1526808055	2	This has been bitcoins argument for years. 
1	1526798260	-14	>Finally, a cryptocurrency with a moral backbone.you're calling one of the least ethical (non) cryptocurrency projects known mostly as 'chain of liars and thieves" with best examples of fraud and censorship EVER in crypto history as moral? lmao. I guess all that paid shilling, subreddit censorship on eth, and incorrect misinformed marketing worked on you. After all, people who are new to computers are their target audience while virtuall all altcoin developers spoke out against onecoin and ehtereum for virtually same reason.
2	1526802598	3	Source?
3	1526806601	7	senzheng is a troll that is on a crusade against Ethereum. 
3	1526806642	3	his ass. this user is one of a kind really.  i don't know what exactly it is that evil ethereum did to him, but it must have been traumatizing.
1	1526821520	-4	Ethereum is the crypto with a moral backbone?  Lol.
0	1526796620	8	Agreed. Otherwise the banks will simply create their own digital currency with all the same issues inherant in fiat currencies.High efficiency will come later.  But decentralizing becomes harder if you compromise on it early.
1	1526836352	1	Isnt that exactly ripple iota neo and EOS ?
2	1526837060	1	Ripple definitely.  Iota is supposed to turn off the coordinator once they reach a certain level of volume. Not sure about EOS. 
0	1526791075	34	This is from 2017. Old news. Anyway as he goes on to say there will be 2nd layer options for high efficiency on the ethereum network such as Plasma.
1	1526802649	6	That the problem for eth right now all the scaling solutions arent quite there yet, Raidens and Plasma are close.
2	1526840108	2	Plasma Cash is essentially here. Exciting!
1	1526809761	-4	I agree with Vitalik, we should not compromise on decentralization. The only problem is, Ethereum is not decentralized, himself and the foundation being in significant control of it as an authority figure, which will only solidify with POS, since they got a massive amount of coins via initial premine and poor distribution, while good distribution is paramount to good POS. This guy is a hypocrite talking about decentralization.edit: lol, classic reddit, downvoted because people like ETH and want to hear good things about it, not because anything i'm saying is wrong.
2	1526810513	16	Ethereum is decentralized from a theoretical protocol level and will remain that way.It's not restricted by protocol. Only in practice.Unlike others like eos vechain neo etc 
3	1526813277	-3	In EOS people vote for BPs with their tokens, in Ethereum people vote for mining pools with their hashpower. You can masturbate to your theoretical protocol all you want if it ends up being the same anyway.
3	1526810620	-10	Look up the definition of decentralization> Decentralization is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group.and tell me how Ethereum fits into that with its Ethereum Foundation. There is no other process of governance in Ethereum except them making the calls and the community either agreeing or not agreeing (e.g. ETC after them making the DAO fork, in which case they fight it).Btw i don't care about your theoretical blockchains, what happens in practice is what matters. Theory needs to include game theory too.
4	1526814863	3	>  There is no other process of governance in Ethereum except them making the calls and the community either agreeing or not agreeing.   "There is no process of governance except [process of governance]"
5	1526815394	-2	What?
6	1526815965	2	You said it yourself. Every time the main ETH chain did anything that was remotely controversial there's been an on-chain election preceding it.
7	1526816482	-2	But you realize the influence that the Ethereum Foundation has over those "elections", right? Read this, they explained it better than me: https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/6bgvqv/faq_what_exactly_is_the_fraud_in_ethereum/tl;dr: they control the codebase, most miners/nodes were auto updated to support the fork, all within 12 hours. This was not even a real election. Also think of the influence the foundation has on centralized exchanges, which gives them massive financial influence over what's going on. Whether it's good or bad is one question, whether is decentralized... it's obviously not lol.
4	1526813894	-8	It’s crazy you are getting downvoted for VERY relevant facts about the topic. Eth maximalists lol. 
2	1526817571	-2	I'd trust Vitalik with my life, let alone my coins. Long live the king! Praise be.
0	1526800219	11	 The only good guy in the whole crypto industry. Vitalik I love you bro
1	1526830351	1	I would add NEO founder Hongfei. 
0	1526783125	33	Is centralization essential in order to have higher efficiency? Is this the trade-off that platforms are facing? If so, then from an ideological side, good on ethereum for maintaining the central pillar of decentralization. From an investor side, this signals that maybe ethereum won't be the go-to for those projects that see wide-spread adoption, as it won't do everything to facilitate high transaction volume, which is above all (in my opinion) essential for wide-spread usage. Therefore, I'm thinking perhaps other platforms that facilitate higher transactions will be more valuable in the long run. Thoughts?
1	1526785954	12	Running an internet scale distributed database does not really work very well right now.  There are a lot of problems with all current implementations.  Centralization removes the whole "internet scale" part.  Then you just have a database cluster, and of course those can be very high performance.  The problem with centralization is that we already have that.  Visa scales quite well... but they take 1\-5&#37; of transactions.  They can change their rate if they want, and the system is created to make them money.  Same thing goes for paypal, or any other money transferring service.  I think eventually we'll figure out how to do a lot better on decentralized networks.  How long it takes before it can globally scale with high performance is anyone's guess though. 
2	1526798082	-6	imagine if we had a chain where the rules are changed arbitrarily that's controlled by a single party like visa, that even has a history of confiscating money or printing themselves money out of thin air w/o care of what others think. oh right,  that's scammer vitalik's centralized ethereum.it's not about internet scale distributed database, it's about consensus and consensus fault tolerances short term via consensus protocols and longer term via control and incentives. distributed databases exist and also trivial when you don't require handling disagreements. when you have a single party premining most of supply that literally provides the incentives, they have no right to claim decentralization of control, but they do because they are scammers with vitalik & his premine buddies being among the worst people in history of this field.
3	1526805731	5	> scammer vitalik's centralized ethereum*looks immediately at user name* "ahhh there he is!"DUDE YOU DID IT YOU'RE A MEME!
3	1526800246	1	>it's not about internet scale distributed database, it's about consensus and consensus fault tolerances short term via consensus protocols and longer term via control and incentives. distributed databases exist and also trivial when you don't require handling disagreements. Well, there are two distinct issues at play. 1) Speed (usually due to authoritative data centralization)2) Freedom of singular control.If you have a handful of databases, and don't need to make sure everyone on a world wide network is on the same page, then speed isn't normally an issue for something like a ledger.  You don't need to worry about confirmations, size of the ledger, network connectivity and peering between everyone, etc.   So, in terms of speed, I do think centralization plays a huge part.In terms of control, decentralization of the data doesn't necessarily change who is in control... A coin can be centrally controlled (or at  the very least, heavily influenced) through multiple means. How the control should work lacks clarity too.  Who should have the control.  Should it be the people who own the most coins? Should it be the people who mine the most blocks?  How much control should the coders of the protocol have over the future?  I think the industry is still feeling their way around this one.Centralization may not be the ideal solution for the community, but it certainly is the easiest solution for developers.    That is why we are seeing a lot of tradeoffs IMO.  
3	1526806494	1	You have some valid points, but isn't the decision to change a network consensus? There is, afterall, ethereum classic. Miners can choose to mine blocks on whatever chain they want, and users can interact with whatever chain they want. 
1	1526784380	35	If you want to view it from an investor point of view, a decentralized platform that compromises on decentralization to improve transaction efficiency is trading its long-term competitive advantage(trust) against the incumbent ie (fully centralized systems) when the most they will ever be able to do is match the speed of a centralized system.
2	1526792248	7	I see it more as today you have a little centralization to get things moving in a better direction. It can also help speed up progress anddevelopment. Just because it is somewhat centralizedtoday doesnt mean it can not be fully decentralized later.... I think a bit of technical flexibility is needed in this space. We are trying to bend technologies to our will that are just not there yet. As long as the end product is decentralized it shouldn't matter how it began. 
1	1526784297	25	Decentralization is expensive.  If your project does not need it, you should not use it.  If your project cannot afford it, you cannot use it.          There is good news though.  Amazon Web Services is affordable and works.
1	1526796192	13	I would argue any kind of blockchain based project is only worth anything, if it's decentralized. Otherwise why bother with this (most of the time) inefficient data structure, the whole point of it is being immutable and trustless. That is not guaranteed, if it's centralized, so you have to trust the governing body. Just like any other webservice nowadays, with google, facebook, amazon, etc. Can EOS compete with them?Of course it does not have to be black and white, certain levels of centralization can make sense. Just making a point.
2	1526801177	1	If I'm not mistaken EOS will have 16 nodes that are all independently operated, and those 16 nodes will vote on changes to the blockchain or something like that. Not totally centralized, but compared to most normal companies still pretty decentralized. I think projects that take a relatively centralized approach like this will have the edge, just because of how dysfunctional bitcoin development has been recently. Vechain will also only have 101 nodes at launch I think, and the foundation has hinted that that number could go up or down depending on a number of things. They *will* sacrifice decentralization for efficiency, unlike Eth. I personally like that. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out and which ones the right approach.
3	1526801812	0	So it works like ark already does? But they have a working project already.
4	1526821877	1	In this particular aspect yes, it is similar to ark. 
1	1526799557	3	He explains in the first few minutes in that link that second-layer and/or sidechain projects are to provide higher efficiency/higher centralization solutions.
1	1526807487	5	Is centralization essential in order to have higher efficiency? No. The Ethereum devs are working on scaling solutions that stay decentralized, this is why it has taken them this long to find something that works well.Is this the trade-off that platforms are facing? Yes. This is why some projects just run on a handfull on servers, sometimes geo-redundant, sometimes not. 
1	1526784560	5	I suppose that depends on where you personally stand on centralization vs decentralization... Im pro eth and see value in decentralization... but most people are sheep and will prob adopt a currency that belongs to a bank and is well marketed...
1	1526836596	1	We already have high volume transaction with low decentralisation. Its called visa and paypal. The only thing the coins have for themselves is the dentralisation.
1	1526795853	-8	Long run Ethereum is going to turn into a highly secure smart contract platform for big business. I don't see it as a platform for other things to run on-top off. Looks like Cardano is going to be what ETH is trying to be, and Vitalik is visibly butt hurt about it if you've been paying attention too. 
0	1526805739	5	The good thing about Ethereum is its turing-complete system. That's more than I can say for most projects in this space.
1	1526833407	1	Mhmmm, two edged sword my friend. You could easily argue Ethereum should not have used a turing complete language *initially*.
2	1526842480	1	Isn’t the narrative “rich state” now?
0	1526784490	21	Bingo.  That's why EOS and NEO are complete garbage.On testnets they have already demonstrated that Ethereum could scale to HIGHER than NEO's transactions/second, but it is entirely useless.  Ethereum's blocks aren't full anyways.
1	1526788283	10	> On testnets they have already demonstrated that Ethereum could scale to HIGHER than NEO's transactions/second,for your referenceVitalik setup his private Parity node on his laptop which could run 1000 tps with ease.https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/942960177036140544
1	1526784994	12	And yet Eth is controlled by three mining pools. That's way more centralozed than the 21 block producers Eos will have.
2	1526792857	20	This is temporary (Casper). EOS architecture is permanent. 
3	1526813511	0	So Ethereum can change and EOS is permanent? Your logic makes zero sense.
4	1526828861	3	ETH is changing. Research Casper
5	1526840160	2	Thus EOS can't. Got it.
6	1526842719	1	I don’t think they realize the equivalent of Casper and Plasma can also be implemented on EOS. They aren’t unique solutions to just the Ethereum blockchain. When implemented on EOS they could decentralize EOS even further while still maintaining far superior scalability.
3	1526798640	-10	casper is the [most centralized PoS ever](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/7djclm/casper_masternode_pos_variant_to_use_70_premined/) possibly, but it's designed by the worst dev team ever in this space so not surprise.casper weights by wealth rewarding those who premined even further than was enough for past censorship and state edits, punishes honest dissent, makes attacks on dissenting chains trivial, and thanks to pareto will lead to a couple of nodes you can never vote out in control only getting richer.millions of voters on eos control the network and delegate far more efficiently to more evenly weighted nodes, firing any that misbehave.there's not a single decentralized aspect to ethereum, and other than using an ico (possibly the most secure ico distribution model ever) has far more decentralized design than is ever possible on centralized eth. dpos is known for inventing dao's, for approval voting, for nearly infinite money at stake for producers, something at stake for voters, for fastest confirms, and for lowest fees.ethereum is known for history of only security failures, more than any other crypto ever, without a single positive aspect to their design or tech ever, other than famously taking credit for others tech https://medium.com/@nextlevelcrypto/whats-the-story-with-smart-contracts-and-ethereum-c0d771fd9eb9
4	1526828781	2	The worst Dev team in the space.. lol
3	1526808413	-1	Casper centralizes ETH even further, right into the hands of biggest current stakeholders (Ethereum Foundation, which got there via premine). You guys have no idea what you're talking about. Oh EOS is centralized with 21 voted in nodes each with 4% control? Distribution is via a year long ICO that you all talked shit about which was made so someone except whales can buy, instead of a massive premine? Yeah that sucks, why not make a POW blockchain with premine first, then convert to POS, so Vitalik and co control it even more than they already did by doing arbitrary forks, and then claim it's way more decentralized. Stop with this bullshit.
4	1526833428	0	Lmao you couldn't be anymore wrong
5	1526834386	2	Very detailed argument.
2	1526822299	2	The amount of EOS block producers are configurable, can be voted on by community consensus, and doesn't require a hardfork to implement.
2	1526786474	4	yes but which is more likely to change? 
3	1526787924	-4	The solution they will come up with who knows when wont be perfect either, because such a system does not exist. On the other hand, 21 different entities distributed around the world that can be voted out at any time is good enough for most of the people and applications.
4	1526798768	-2	& infinite standby producers with highest community approved ones getting paid for standing by & infinite voters & possibly the only pareto breaking design in bft tech. I'm always amused how little eth scam community knows about their own or other decentralized tech, but even vitalik constantly gets everything wrong - not that he cares, he learned long ago he can just lie and mislead and it leads to profits. got caught not understanding bft & not even knowing about merkle proofs in dpos while saying they didn't exist definitevely in public. no wonder devs in virtually every other altcoin despise the guy.
2	1526800096	1	No, it isn't.  Like at all.  Can you really not see the difference?!
3	1526808989	2	what is the difference dude? it's not like BPs in EOS can make transactions arbitrarily out of nowhere. both BPs and miners just produce blocks from valid signed transactions.
4	1526833725	1	They can also deny tx's, blacklist addresses, whitelist addresses, etc...
5	1526834407	1	Which is the same shit mining pools can do in eth.
6	1526834581	1	No it’s not. I decide of my volition to join the mining pool. Mining pools are a collection of clients pooling their resources together. We could decide to leave those pools and run our own clients in silo or in groups to reduce the hash rate of malicious clients (pools).Now if we bring ASICS into the picture, things certainly change.
7	1526836039	1	You realize you can also vote out BPs right?
8	1526839864	1	Yes, I’m well aware of the parameters of dPoS
1	1526839572	1	how much were you paid to post that or how much did your upvotes cost you? since obviously somebody supporting centralized ethereum cannot be honest or intelligent.
1	1526790958	-3	How many mining pools control ethereum? 4? 5?Eos has 21 delegated BPs (miners) that can be voted out at any time. I would say 21 with an equal % of power is more decentralised than a few gangs who control things.
2	1526799996	8	Only a complete moron would think only TWENTY ONE "delegated" miners can be decentralized.  Like seriously people, do you hear yourselves?
3	1526805998	-3	How many gangs of miners control bitcoin and ethereum? Only a complete moron would think this was decentralised.
4	1526810961	1	But miners cant undo transaction, but bps can, right?
5	1526814221	0	Good point, but 3/4 of BPs have to produce any block so for 15 to go malicious is highly unlikely. 
6	1526821971	2	its a design decision - reversability is a feature, which opens up the door for discussions and politics.guess the market will tell whether this feature and the implications of it are to be desired....i see two options - either it will be used all the time or never.
2	1526793104	14	Where do I begin..mining pools = gangs but BPs are benevolent? ok...Look at the organizations vying to run BPs. They could easily collude as their interests are shared and are NOT aligned with yours. This is what people consistently fail to understand.
3	1526809052	1	> They could easily collude as their interests are shared and are NOT aligned with yours. This is what people consistently fail to understand.as if this does not apply to mining pools.
4	1526828663	1	Mining will be replaced by pos
5	1526834353	1	So the stakeholders in POS> could easily collude as their interests are shared and are NOT aligned with yours.
3	1526793896	1	Only time will tell. Good luck to both cryptos, actually most cryptos.
3	1526799630	-3	mining pools are not punished for attacks other than losing block reward, BPs get kicked out forever if they misbehaveanyone can collude especially miners, but if even 1 honest producer exists, it would become obvious and be able to sign votes until voters switch over fully.they have a ton of future income at stake, they are literally voted in by you and your interests and can be voted out by you and your intersets and thus they are aligned unless they want to lose income for rest of time which is basically infinity. gpu miners have no interest, can care less what they mine, can even return the gpu's after an attack, and they can't be voted out which means they can try attacking as much as they want.majority of the minority can always restart the chain void of malicious bp's, on chain funding makes it irrelevant who did ico.they are not benelovent, nobody said that except you. dpos is designed with complex incentives, pareto breaking weighting, something at stake for every participant to align interests, no barrier to entry to become standby block producer other than approval of the network.casper weights by wealth which is also barrier to entry with literal masternodes, punishes honest mistakes, punishes dissent which is nice for preminers, makes it easy to use their premine to cause slashing conditions on others on any forked off chain, used the worst possible distribution method in ico for decentralized distribution, have arbitrary stake amounts that can be easily gamed by leverageit's like night and day by design quality, but no honest developer respects vitalik for a good reason. like private/trusted blockchains, eth community doesn't understand difference between blockchain and decentralization of control.this has been written up countless times, even damn bitfury report in 2015 covered most of it, although I realize how eth is years behind others tech wise (if not a decade since it's centralized) and is only capable of copying others instead of inventing something new.
0	1526818176	2	This is what EOS is trying to achieve, losing a bit of decentralization for the sake of scalability. Let's see how that goes.
0	1526784831	3	He looks like Vigo the Carpathian's hippie bastard.
0	1526793018	3	IOST seems to have a pretty good solution for the whole scalability problem.
0	1526784029	2	Thanks for this, old but I hadn't seen it so watched the whole video which was excellent.
0	1526791344	2	Spooky Action at a Distance... How many centuries are we from utilizing quantum  entanglement, and mooting the efficiency of centralization?
0	1526802244	2	Ethereum holders war crying at EOS (again).One word ETHEREUM tribe:Diversify.✌
0	1526798261	1	Cause a few big miners isn't centralized. Lol
1	1526800965	-2	Right, if he cared about decentralisation, he world fork Eth to address ASICs
2	1526806740	3	I don't know if there is even a point to fight ASICs. Let's say you hard fork to make current ASICs useless? Good, casual miners can now use their GPU again to mine and everything is decentralized again. Then 3 month later, new ASICs come out, pro miners buy them and you are back to initial situation. I don't know if there is a solution to this problem already...

0	1526800636	1	Respect!!
0	1526818088	1	Does anyone know where I can I find live stats on the amount of archival nodes ?
0	1526825414	1	Take a look at Zilliqa. It provides a simple solution that does solve allsharding-related issues. 
0	1526826626	1	*cough* EOS *cough*
0	1526833700	1	So he'd rather it be unusable?
0	1526783034	2	Makes sense but that limits it if its one or the other. Thats why other platforms like EOS or Cardano could take the #2 spot. 
0	1526785112	-12	Vitalik says everything opposite of what he does. He compromised on decentralization when he premined most of supply for profit. You can't reverse the damage from that. And it proved to be damaged when they trivially went in and changed state after a bad investment without asking basically most of participants just by abusing default settings catching people off-guard.higher bandwidth usage of eth from high block cap and uncle design IS a decentralization compromise making it harder to validate.casper makes premine effects only more centralized through their masternode bonds and minimums and makes it even easier to attack dissenting chains, even easier than last time they did it.he doesn't understand decentralization and every design decision I'm aware of done by him made ethereum the worst possible version of what it could be. but then again, this is same guy who raised money for a fake quantum computer he claimed could break sha256 before raising money for a fake blockchain on par security wise with onecoin & mysql.it's amazing how much misinformation ethereum scam has put out since everyone agreed it is not relevant to decentralized tech. seems like it worked on new people who don't know any better - their target audience. why focus on security when you can just market with all that premine centralized funding the exact opposite - easy with no ethics.
1	1526800593	0	On this sub you are downvoted if you dont worship Vitalik
1	1526811718	0	You're mentally ill.Seek help.
0	1526793798	1	Has anyone seen somebody who has a head like that that isn't super smart?See also [Jack Ma](https://www.google.com/search?q=jack+ma&oq=jack+ma&aqs=chrome.0.0l2j5.2650j0j4&client=ms-android-motorola&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#imgrc=MFmPH4HKhIu7BM:) 
0	1526805386	1	but its fine to compromise on decentralization to save your own money? See the DAOlol.
0	1526786816	1	Vitalik seems like he would be a warlock. Not disappointed.
0	1526792764	1	The definition of decentralized is becoming more and more broad seemingly however. If I run a google sheet that also duplicates(and updates) onto an excel sheet(locally) that also duplicates onto an aws servicebased spread sheet and that posts to a Mac OS X numbers sheet for some fuck reason but any change made changes all of them based on the most recent change then tell me capernicous, how would you claim that decentralized? I can say it’s god damn inefficient, but the data doesn’t sit in any one place; there is a certain level of importance to the idea and practice of decentralization but it still comes at a cost. Everything comes at a cost but there is indeed a balance as there is with everything. A quick example is the amount of good/intelligent information that comes out of vitalik’s mouth compared to the loudness of his shirt from the 3rd grade, completely out of balance; turn down the shirt and maybe we’ll even see an increase of reputation.
0	1526800643	1	Can anyone here run an ethereum full node? How is ethereum not sacrificing decentralization for efficiency when it's become extremely hard for anyone to run a full node?
1	1526807276	1	Running a full node requires [~145Gb of diskspace](https://etherscan.io/chart2/chaindatasizefast) and some know how. And anyone can run it.
2	1526839084	1	That isn't a full node. A full ethereum node is currently 500-600gb in storage. 
3	1526841570	1	It is a full node for all intents and purposes. You can run a full archive node if you'd like, and it will be the same.
1	1526805666	0	I actually considered it back in 2015 after the network went live. To this day I still regret not going forward with it. I was also thinking about purchasing 10,000 ETH as well.Life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards.
0	1526816628	1	He has the worst forward neck syndrome I have ever seen
0	1526825252	1	It doesn't want to compromise, but it does compromise. Also, the DAO. Also, ETC is ethereum but lovely alt you got there.
0	1526827448	1	Vitalik needs to leave ETH in order for it to succeed. 
0	1526796912	0	Haha, good luck developing Dapps that all compute on the chain. lol Turing complete indeed.
0	1526802767	0	He looks like he’s on meth
1	1526808527	4	mETH even
0	1526814164	-2	If only he wasn't infected by the Core "full nodes for users" nonsense. SPV seems to be the least understood concept in crypto. Read up in the Bitcoin whitepaper (if you read carefully, fraud alerts are not needed for trustless use), or watch this [SPV explainer video](https://youtu.be/-h4iYaqXv94).Ethereum could scale if they did it right. Otherwise, BCH is coming for you.
0	1526815632	0	Ethereum rolled back it's entire blockchain because some idiots fucked up, so to argue that Ethereum isn't centralized, is just fucking dumb.
1	1526842406	1	People hate it when you say that. But.. yes.
0	1526805679	-1	Irony of a community hanging off the words of a single central figure, re: DEcentralisation
0	1526809073	-1	So why did he lie about asic resist and sell eth to bitmain?
0	1526809089	-1	What's wrong with a little more decentralization than we currently have while maintaining enough centralization for scalability? It's a design decision and security best practice to use more redudancy for your data, so having a cheap and efficient blockchain to get these desireable traits is still a good outcome. Extreme decentralization leads to high cost, and economic exclusion, which is the thing that we are trying to avoid to begin with. We don't need to be extreme either way. A good balance can make everyone satisfied imo. 
0	1526818694	0	This sounds like a direct rebuttal to what VeChain has been saying about Ethereum. 
1	1526842360	1	Or what EOS is claiming 
0	1526785308	-2	[deleted]
1	1526798251	1	Albert Einstein's hair wasn't anything to write home about either but who fucking cares. That's hardly something worth criticizing someone over.
0	1526794341	-5	Trying to justify the gap between EOS and ETH tech?
0	1526814171	-2	The problem is he doesn't know how the world works yet, he still needs to learn.. EOS is solving most of his problems and also giving a better public image as a cryptocurrency.
