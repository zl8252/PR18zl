1	1526799461	22	It’s not the institutional money that pumps the prices since they usually by OTC, it’s the investors that take the big institutions buying in as a buy signal which pushes prices on the normal customer market. 
2	1526823021	4	But even with OTC trading, that crypto has to come from somewhere, right? Someone at some point has to buy it from an exchange to have the supply to meet the demands of the OTC buyers. The more demand by institutional investors = the more crypto supply needed by the ones selling to these investors. 
3	1526830057	0	Nope. Where do you think most miners sell at? The open market in order to knock the price down and make their own mining less profitable? No, they sell them on the OTC as anyone buying or selling a large amount at once would prefer to do 
4	1526831836	0	But that’s assuming miners are immediately cashing out and selling their crypto for fiat which I don’t believe is true. Then, doesn’t there come a point where the miners can’t provide enough capital to meet the demands of these huge institutional investors? And even more so when the difficulty increases.
5	1526833688	1	To be a miner, you don't necessarily have to even be pro-Bitcoin. It could all just be about profitability which would mean selling your coins Speaking on liquidity, same applies to any sell order. Both the seller and the buyer of a large amount of BTC benefit from doing so on the OTC, so as to not have their own sell/buy block cost them money due to a market reaction 
6	1526834215	1	That’s a fair point, but if you’re doing it as an investment and purely for profitability, then history says selling immediately isn’t the most profitable. It would be tough to sell crypto that is consistently increasing in price. I agree that liquidity is a big problem on exchanges and that there are many incentives for OTC. I do believe that nearly all big players are going through OTC, but I just don’t think miners can support the heavy demand for these investors. I’m thinking this money has to be bought at some point by someone on an exchange.
2	1526812281	2	This guy gets it.
2	1526847272	1	Couldn’t the OTC market effect prices as well though? If there was a ton of OTC demand then the sellers would raise their prices and if it got too high the buyers would just buy on exchanges. If there was very little OTC demand then the sellers would lower their prices and if it got too low they would just sell on exchanges.Source: Took an intro to microeconomics class once in college.
1	1526785984	23	Ppl saying institution money will pump the price when it's dumb money that caused that. Banks  will swing trade our asses till we're broke. So long are the holders. They'll corner the price range. 
2	1526818944	15	Pack it up boys. This guys obviously knows what he’s talking about. Price will never pump again; big money won’t ever pump the price. Lmfao. Goddamn I can’t wait to see you eat your words. You have no idea what’s coming or how this is going to work. 
2	1526792287	26	Those are the same people who thought futures would be good for crypto.  Crypto was good the way it was, not sure why we want to go through the same cycle what most wanted to get away from.
1	1526812382	5	That's nonsense and creating FUD as well.
1	1526829927	6	Yeah it's called accumulate and then when ready,  switch from OTC to regular platforms to set a volume spark. Have their news sources pamp it. Then let the people run the price up. Pretty straightforward
2	1526830973	1	Well summarized.
1	1526796997	3	We lost the ability to assess how much money is really going into the market when the first private order book exchanges came out 
1	1526804722	3	But ultimately they want it to go up, right?
2	1526812455	1	Of course, don't listen to the fudders and trolls, more money coming in and regulation is very good news.
1	1526825798	0	The market is likely to become more "efficient",  i.e. trading will become more difficult.
0	1526801329	4	Ohh dem fees...it's like how they front run their clients...banks just can't resist
0	1526805850	12	On a bit of a side note Amber Baldet is one of most promising and intelligent people in the Blockchain space. Listening to her speak is a bit like listening to Vitalik speak, it makes you realise just how inferior your own intellect is. Now she's ditched the banks and gone out on her own, she's going to be a true credit to the crypto space.
1	1526825947	6	She bombed at Consensus. Terrible, superficial presentation and she got called out for it on stage.
2	1526835176	2	What was the presentation about?
1	1526829520	3	I found Amber Baldet! 
1	1526847706	1	She actually dodges questions and repeats a lot of superficial talking points—but okay. 
0	1526824111	9	Who else clicked this because she looks hot?
1	1526845088	1	Amber Baldaaang!
0	1526799571	2	Purps
0	1526801411	2	Hopefully.
0	1526831306	2	Crypto  market will be a 20 trillion market in 4 years.   I know I'm going to retire a millionaire by then.  Won't ever have to work again.  Get me some bikini bitches to peel my grape skin before feeding it to me.  
1	1526833980	2	Don't bank on it. No pun intended. 
0	1526790087	6	They'll short. 
1	1526820556	17	Banks cannot have proprietary positions.
2	1526821288	8	And yet 24 people upvoted his retarded comment. 
3	1526827916	6	Makes sense considering this sub is mainly composed of retards.
3	1526824752	1	24? that's nothing. but hey, at least it is a metric for SOMETHING, lol
1	1526799846	4	You realize opening shorts means nothing without having the ability to control the underlying market ? Bitcoins are quite finite and Id be pretty surprised if there is enough of them offered on OTC markets to sustain multiple institutions short dumping. Maybe we will never see insane runups again like in december but that doesnt mean we will not see growth
2	1526816352	0	You could probably offer the Gox trustee a decent price OTC for the 160k BTC he's holding.
0	1526805295	1	By "banks", she probably means "the people our banks will goad into fulfilling our goals".
0	1526807409	1	I doubt it that bank will let that happen so easily.
0	1526827305	1	In Europe I know some banks are looking into Limitlex solution for trading platform.
0	1526831259	1	I agree
0	1526844794	1	Well..: according to some banks are slow as fuck.. I had expected them sneaking exchanges through last year
0	1526816478	1	I feel like someone saying "I got into crypto because of the banks" would have a completely different meaning in 2012 than in 2018. Fuck JPMorgan. Fuck institutional money. And fuck all the plebs who think this is good news.
0	1526806284	1	They will OTC though
0	1526824631	1	does anybody else think she's kinda hot?
1	1526838813	1	She’s smoking for a hacker. 
0	1526812218	0	There's no Google for Dapps.... ahhhh how about NAS sweetie.  Not to mention devs have worked there and NEO plus first mover advantage and a top 100 Crypto project currently with first mover advantage.  Aside from that I find it extremely bullish that has an insider knowledge and couldn't leave her cushy Wallstreet fast enough to jump onto the Crypto train.  She obviously has an idea of the flood thats coming.  
0	1526819039	0	Her neck, zero makeup there....
0	1526794804	-8	She looks like Jodi arias idk if I should trust her
1	1526798691	1	Not even close. She actually reminds me of Vanessa Bayer from SNL

1	1526795149	33	Why is this even a thing you feel the need to post on the internet?
2	1526800430	3	Whoa-man
2	1526802957	4	Because free speech
3	1526820665	1	Pretty much.  If guys see a still shot of a semi hot woman with their mouth open , they will think of one thing.  Especially if they are eating a banana or lollipop. 
4	1526821199	1	That's just life
5	1526822139	-4	I know, people downvote like its a horrible thing to say.  The whole reason a woman dresses sexy, and puts on makeup is to attract the opposite sex.   Even my wife who is liberal thinks the whole thing about sexual harassment is blown way out of proportion by women who are just bitter.  In her own words. Lol that came from a liberal anti trump woman too.  
1	1526807555	4	I remember being 15.

1	1526818899	0	Obviously way out of your league.
0	1526821289	0	If you think that when banks start trading then bitcoin will moon you’re wrong. Banks are here to give you money they’re here to take it. The only money you can take is from noobs like the ones in December.
