There are plenty of interesting things going on in the crypto world, but they take time to build and no one is really ready to on board the masses yet so it is inevitable that any "realist" is disappointed by the situation. The hype from 2017 got ahead of the tech, and now we have to deal with a bit of a hangover. In the long run, it doesn't really matter. The tech continues to evolve and improve. Eventually we'll see it deliver. The short term road just may be a little bumpy as the hype runs out of rocket fuel. I guess I'm jaded, but I feel like we pretty much deserved this after 2017 :) Technology continues unabated, relentless in its march - blockchain is a key part of the next steps.
1	1526838374	1	2017 was awesome as it raised so much awareness about crypto. Now people have at least heard of bitcoin, which is a major step in the right direction.
0	1526769800	23	and from inside the crypto world, all I get is how much it sucked because it was nothing more than people sucking up to big banks and corporations...
1	1526782449	7	and charging you a few thousand bucks to listen to their crap:)
0	1526769201	21	Bunch of old people, talking heads, and bankers uttering buzzwords like "blockchain" and "smart contracts", not knowing what the fuck they're talking about, in an attempt to show that they're educated and slander crypto because they feel threatened.
1	1526775158	23	And then within the cryptosphere you have supporters of one coin doing the exact same thing about news of other coins without seeing the irony.
2	1526775944	3	Those are just cultists that have been brainwashed. At the heart of all of them exists a regular crypto supporter, if they keep an open mind.
1	1526769827	7	I remember the days when the newspapers and journalists  claimed there was no good journalism online. People are rusty and scared of change. It’s not if, but when crypto takes its place in everyday society.
0	1526775290	12	We need some killer blockchain applications to go mainstream. That can be either through OMG providing banking, WYS showing off shopping powered ai or Walton with blockchain + rfid. Something, ANYTHING has to provide an actual valuable use case to the real world ~ then it will be easy to shut haters up.At this moment I’m not shocked they think it’s filled with schemers, scammers and speculators. As it’s easy to attack from their perspective.
1	1526782742	9	why would you be shocked?this is very much true - crypto is full with schemers, scammers, speculators, plagiarists, thieves and people who chase easy money and don't give a flying fuck about anything else. projects are even hiring marketing teams to do the lying for them, and others to write their white papers, somebody on upwork to make a bitcoin code base clone or write their token... it's all actually a lot worse than what mainstream media shows.
2	1526823845	5	said not shocked
3	1526824486	2	oh yeah, right, sorry.i was more like trying to subtly emphasize on the fact that almost everything is still massively overvalued the way it is, with no justification whatsoever. and that bitcoin is cancer and people suck. and that by downvoting anything, that doesn't make facts and laws of physics magically disappear... would do everybody good to stop and question his motives every now and then.
4	1526836641	1	Sadly it feels like some tokens are literally sub religions filled with zealots.
1	1526815807	2	XRP has a killer application that is being used right now.
1	1526819016	1	I like WTC an OMG but had not heard of WYS before, its not listed on CMC, could you provide a little more info or shill me briefly on the benefits? cheers.
1	1526834133	1	When Wysker 2.0 goes live next month we will get mass adoption of the Wysker app. It will go viral :) 
0	1526781928	8	If you don't want stories making fun of you about rented Lamborghinis, then don't rent Lamborghinis and park them in front of the conference like a an absolute tool.  NYC isn't LA...People there actually have class and flaunt their wealth by buying apartments that look out over the park.  
0	1526763416	6	Haters gonna hate
0	1526811479	3	Wow, this was actually a decent article with a real, well thought-out and well formulated opinion. Something that’s increasingly rare  with smaller crypto publications. Actually increasingly rare with larger ones too on second thought... What a breeze of fresh air 
0	1526827285	3	Lol Consensus is a garbage event for token kids and banks. They didn't sell tix for cryptocurrency. There was no crypto usage during event either. Consensus does nothing to advance cryptoCURRENCY adoption. It serves as a networking event for banks, regulators, govt officials, and bag holders. The mainstream media got this one correct. The absense of ETH and Bitcoin figures speaks volumes. 
0	1526792399	2	Is anyone surprised? It's their job to do so.
0	1526798748	2	Only good thing out of consensus was iexec and it's partnerships!! $RLC BaBy!!
