1	1526810355	9	How can you take it seriously when it's a joke :P
0	1526827217	10	Lol... Bitcoin and Verge tied for 13th place... What a joke
1	1526840445	-1	lol indeed.  If Bitcoin wasn't the key innovator, they would be much further down the list.  Amazing they're even in the top 20.
2	1526847787	1	Well, duh. Kind of hard for the very first of a revolutionary technology to be the most advanced. Why would anyone make something that is explicitly worse than the original? Also in case it went over your head a scam coin like Verge even making the list is pretty laughable

0	1526812517	9	Ah ol' government of China, run by the most trusted people on earth. 
1	1526813815	5	I find it interesting that the PRC listed XMR so highly.  You'd think they'd be terrified of the tech.
2	1526820956	1	to hide their own stashes
3	1526839823	2	And that right there is why privacy coins aren't going anywhere. 
0	1526836313	2	Interested they didn't go with Neo, usually they like supporting there own products
1	1526837058	2	Rumour is they donâ€™t like neo (Inb4 downvotes) 
0	1526836863	2	lmao look at OP post history just another shiller
0	1526813824	2	- 2 & 3 is Steem and Lisk- v. low 'application' Steem is 2 while winner in innovation BTC is 13- actually very usable Monero has low 'application'- all things considered, Ripple should be much higher, not that I like it but    they should have v high technology and applicationIn general, they pulled this out of their corrupted chinese asshole.
0	1526809721	1	Opinions.
0	1526823477	1	CHINA SAYS ETH WHAT? BUY BUY BUY ETH

0	1526840511	1	expected
0	1526840686	1	NEO btfo by their own government.
0	1526822074	3	bitcoin.com promotes fake bitcoin.
0	1526814782	1	Why is steem 2nd? I though it could be used only for their platform? Maybe I'm wrong.. 
0	1526824693	1	They're probably just shilling
0	1526827567	1	The list is quite off, but I do agree with ethereum though :)
0	1526831294	0	The Chinese, a great bunch of lads.
1	1526839839	1	Careful now!Edit: Whatever idiot downvoted that comment doesn't get the joke. Down with that sort of thing!
0	1526815396	-9	Under what terms, it will change this June when EOS releases mainnet tho.
