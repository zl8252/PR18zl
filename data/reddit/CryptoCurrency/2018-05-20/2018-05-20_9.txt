They will institute a traceable digital currency for "our protection" as in this case. The claims of it eliminating criminal activity and terrorism are the selling points for giving away your freedom. Five years from now I'm betting that personal rfid chips will be implemented and link directly with your government approved digital currency wallet. That will be implemented under the guise of keeping the terrorists out of our country. Sorry for the rant, it's just this subject is a very slippery slope for personal freedoms.
1	1526810141	5	100% correct...just like the survelience bs, all for your safety. BS! How many have they stopped?
1	1526824469	1	They also want traceable crypto transactions to stop tax evasion. If they can eliminate cash and all transactions are traceable, no more tax cheats.
0	1526783461	27	I've said this many times before but people always downvote me, don't know why. The governments want to ban cash. It's in their interests to ban all possibility of anonymity in payments and cash is a way to pay anonymously. They always say is to fight corruption, sometimes what they call corruption is just a way of protecting your money from the government, they just want to have total control of their citizens. If there's no cash, you simply can't escape the government, because everything will go through controlled bank accounts.Cryptocurrencies are here to save us from that socialist dystopia. Bitcoin is a way to fight the government and their control over us, and governments didn't count on the invention of Bitcoin, so we have the ultimate weapon on our side :)IMHO if a government dares to ban cash, that would be a death sentence for them. Bitcoin will rule the streets of the country the next day. 
1	1526785104	9	Most people aren't ideological enough to care... You think the average person who doesn't already have crypto would go through the hassle instead of just using credit cards a tiny bit more?
2	1526785825	3	Most people aren't ideological but still care for other very legitimate reasons, most people really struggle to make ends meet, you know? Those people sometimes **need** to work under the table. All these people may not be ideological to care, but they will care about banning cash, that's for sure.
3	1526823601	1	Ok, I was assuming the average person doesn't work for money under the table. That would be a market for cryptos... I still think entry is too difficult if going cashless were to happen right now.
2	1526825971	1	Every single person on the face of the earth has secrets. Everyone. Every single person wants to buy or has to buy something that they want to keep to themselves. It probably isn't illegal for most people, but they'd like to keep it their own business. If a government banned cash, every person in that country would have some amount of cryptocurrency.
3	1526841272	1	Maybe I'm just being cynical, but observing how facebook, google, apple etc etc track and encroach on privacy more and more - and how people just go along with it - I feel like most people would just be like "well that's annoying..." and then still not move towards crypto :P
1	1526790416	1	Of course bad actors will start to use Monero and so forth, after time I'm not sure if it would be worse or not. It would be easier to transport a cold wallet with 1 mil on it than cash. To hide illegal transactions etc. It all depends how easy it is to monitor the use of the 'alternative' cryptocurrencies that bad actors will try to exploit but it seems impossible.
1	1526798184	1	completely agree, except for the point about the rulers' not counting on bitcoin, it's an nsa invention, and not by some made-up character no one has ever seen.without total anonymity and privacy, digital cash is a total control mechanism as you correctly state very well. why aren't those coins which offer that making huge advances?
0	1526804620	10	A politician investigated for corruption, said that he will combat corruption. Man this is Mexico in elections, they will say a lot of things to win votes and after, all empty promises
0	1526779916	3	Yes
0	1526780031	3	Wtf your username. I bet 90% of the karma came just from the username. Maybe Iâ€™ll change my reddit.
1	1526780319	5	Happy cake day!
2	1526783167	1	Maybe it's just the inner manbaby in me but the name made me chuckle. 
0	1526780654	5	I want to point out that he is only proposing that for the three government branches. Not for the whole country.
1	1526781979	4	yes that is something op forgot to mention in the title, this way i do agree it seems to be a positive move, but again neoloberalism will not acept it.
2	1526796338	1	I'm somewhat confused.  Why do you think proponents of neoliberalism wouldn't accept it?
0	1526782736	2	Letâ€™s hope he wins !!!
0	1526784945	2	Yes but also no: the 'war on cash' thing is integral to an historically unprecedented state drive for authority. 
0	1526787979	2	Mark my word, this is to introduce negative interest rates.
0	1526792211	1	So a politician that doesn't like corruption we'll that is impossible my friend. 
0	1526812976	1	Problem is that the hardcore far-left Obrador is a shoe-in to win.
0	1526835406	1	You know when someone running for the Mexican drug cartel when... ðŸ˜‚
0	1526836783	1	I don't think, he probably by saying digital money is meaning credit or debit card, I hope this involves also crypto!
0	1526842044	1	A politician saying crap on the campaign trail. Ignore 
0	1526847149	0	**NO**  First of all he's only proposing eliminating use of cash in government procurement and this doesn't mean that they are going to use cryptocurrencies as a replacement, but rather that they are only going to use electronic money transfers using existing financial systems and only Mexican Pesos (MXN).
0	1526791860	-2	Okay...... Now I'm actually concerned, if not scared.If governments can(will?) have access to this kind of power then to hell with blockchain.
