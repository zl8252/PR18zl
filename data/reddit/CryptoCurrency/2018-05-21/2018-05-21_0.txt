0	1526879413	317	>The £37 million ($50 million) plans will see the sea-bound city state, with 300 homes as well as a handful of hotels, restaurants, offices and more.that's what $50M can get you ladies and gentlemen. Now take a look at some of the amounts these ICOs are asking for, and ask yourself if that is credible.
1	1526885937	93	Is $50 what th ey spent on plans because there is no way that will cover the construction costs on a project of this scope.
2	1526898308	9	You're right. It was also mentioned in the video and in the, very long(!), article. These costs ensure planning in all areas, for the next 3 years. I mean, it still makes financial sense. You need engineers, top in the field, across various different areas and you need to hire them for this project, for at least 36 months. Still it shows, what can be done with "little" money like that. It makes you wonder why EOS is valued at 15 billion.
3	1526918795	1	$50 mil doesn’t seem like enough. I would think this pays for engineering and some of the basic materials costs. 
4	1526934534	1	I don't think this would even pay for the engineers. They are some of the smartest people in the world - not schmucks. They know what they are worth which is probably in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. Considering that you would probably need a medium sized team of them (maybe 30?), 50 mil seems like a really small sum of money for this project. Maybe they would be given equity options or something on the completed project but they would require more than 50 million in value collectively. 
1	1526882871	81	Essentially the amount will be definitely increased at some point. Though, I totally agree that the ICO's are asking for an unhealthy amount of funding. That needs to stop
2	1526885416	12	How will they increase that amount without screwing their initial investors?
3	1526885524	1	Not sure what exactly do you mean by screwing but tell me the percentage of projects that really build in 'their limit'. Most of the times, there is a need for additional funding or other support. 
1	1526890492	66	There is absolutely no way this project will cost $50million. Unless they intend to build it out of plyboard and watch it come apart within a year.
2	1526905628	8	The $50M is literally just the cost of the planning haha
3	1526912358	2	The ICO hard cap is around $15 million, the softcap is around $3 million (4000 ETH).
2	1526915277	2	Hilarious, and reading some comments that think this is doable even more hilarious. Obviously not one ounce of experience in RE dev. 50mm.... more like multiples and multiples and multiples of that amount. Even if it were a completely greased hand off the books no law/rules build out... 50mm ain't getting you this lol. Laughable... 
1	1526890871	28	Or, you know, ask yourself: is DailyMail credible? (nope)
2	1526935741	1	the ICO is going to be open any day now for those in the know
1	1526888833	28	I have no idea how this sum can be that low. Putting down a few roundabouts already costs millions where I live. 50 million USD for an island with all of that sounds crazy ambitious. I'd think more around 500 million USD.
2	1526903903	8	I wouldn't be surprised if 5 Billion USD was more accurate.
1	1526899917	9	$50M will NOT get you this. You're delusional if you think this won't cost A LOT more.
2	1526907021	4	50M might get you a broken down cargo-ship and some shipping-containers to build homes out of... 
1	1526903478	7	Lol. I'm planning a building right now at the architecture office I work at that will cost about $25M. I can garantee you, with 100% certainty, that there is no way a project this magnitude would only cost $50M. That amount of money is literally peanuts in the construction industry. I would believe it if the planning alone would cost that amount, and even that I'm not sure about.
1	1526897741	3	so in other words... i could issue an ICO and build one of these for myself!!
1	1526920716	3	The dailymail article is full of disinfo, go here to read the actual white paper with actual facts:http://www.varyon.io
1	1526897752	5	There have been several new (non-crypto) currencies in the recent past. No one "invests" in them because they aren't assets that accrue in value (like gold, stocks)They are currencies. They aren't supposed to "go up" in value, they are supposed to be spentFor a cryptocurrency to be actually used as a cryptocurrency - it needs to be stable, certainly not something we invest inIt seems more than a few in crypto don't grasp this basic concept
1	1526901874	4	$50 mil is enough for a handful of luxury yachts. Not a floating city. This is nothing but a ploy for another shitcoin ICO.
1	1526884516	2	Filecoin or Bancor could have their own floating city-state!
1	1526891134	2	Filecoin can build 5 of these cities! 
1	1526906629	2	Cheap labor. It doesn't look that big. 300 homes.I live in Thailand. I see what people build for $30,000 USD. (A western standard 3 bedroom bulgalow).
1	1526892285	3	This may be slightly off topic but Monero's Riccardo Spagni wears a watch that costs nearly one million dollars. I believe it still pertains to the argument that this industry is getting ridiculous.
1	1526916844	1	I just read yesterday about the latest LA Rams football stadium.  It is expected to cost 5 BILLION dollars.  I would take this all day over that.
1	1526932824	1	Our cost estimates come from our Economic Impact Analysis: [https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/blue\-frontiers.appspot.com/o/docs&#37;2FEconomic\_Impact\_Analysis.pdf?alt=media&token=eff96c09\-9179\-4cd5\-854b\-c6afb70f8cac](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/blue-frontiers.appspot.com/o/docs%2FEconomic_Impact_Analysis.pdf?alt=media&token=eff96c09-9179-4cd5-854b-c6afb70f8cac)The pilot program will build 14 floating platforms and each platform is estimated to cost $5 million.
1	1526912699	0	The ICO hard cap is 22,000 ETH, the soft cap is 4000 ETH. The funds raised in the ICO will be used to go toward engineering and prototyping. If the hard cap is reached they should be able to produce the first couple of 25x25 meter platforms.They will be keeping a large portion of the tokens in reserve for when they are able to start building further structures in 2021. The pilot project of 10 platforms should cost close to the amount of the tokens in reserve.Hotels, restaurants, etc. will likely be funded by investors who want businesses in a Special Economic Zone with ocean front property. If funding is needed pre-sales of the platforms can be done. Or if enough is raised for the 10 platforms, they now have assets that can be leveraged for further financing.
0	1526881101	61	Ok, I dont want a lambo anymore. This one is better. ... When floating nation?
1	1526884715	8	HODL that dream!https://www.designboom.com/technology/lamborghini-aventador-super-veloce-speed-boat-06-27-2017/
0	1526867852	464	A tiny floating resort nation, presumably without a navy to protect it, and filled with crypto libertarians. I think I'll pass thanks.
1	1526870229	139	What could possibly go wrong? 
2	1526874468	199	Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?'No!' says the man in Washington, 'It belongs to the poor.''No!' says the man in the Vatican, 'It belongs to God.''No!' says the man in Moscow, 'It belongs to everyone.'I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different.I chose the impossible. I chose... Vayron.A city where the artist would not fear the censor.Where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality.Where the great would not be constrained by the small!And with the sweat of your brow, Vayron can become your city as well.
3	1526880980	26	Great bioshock reference. Wondered when I would find it. 
3	1526883010	17	A man chooses, a slave obeys
3	1526877692	54	So...yet another retreat for rich people who don't want to pay tax?
4	1526881374	37	I see you haven't played BioShock yet. Give it a try. It's Randian af. Hell, the character giving that speech is a genderbent Rand.
5	1526889313	17	Would you kindly give it a try op?
4	1526881314	9	You would leave too if you could.
5	1526888497	1	Yeah everybody leaves, if they get the chance
4	1526891332	-4	People who actively engage in tax evasion are heros. They make it harder for the mafia to acquire resources and control our lives. Thank them. Encourage them.
5	1526904361	7	2edgy. Do you used ETH or LTC to wire money to the fire department or the school teacher when you need their services? Transaction time is a lot faster than BTC..
6	1526916305	0	I care less about transaction time and more about the (in)voluntary nature of any given transaction.
5	1526904616	1	You mean the people who enjoy protection by the army, use schools, roads, etc., but don't want to pay for any of that?
6	1526916069	1	Not wanting to be extorted and trying to protect one's property from organized crime is not the same as not being willing to pay for services one uses.I can see how you could confuse these two things if you only consider the services provided by the mafia which almost everyone uses. Consider also things like mass mureder of innocent people (aka collateral damage), kidnapping people and letting them rot in cages for decades because they did what they wanted with their bodies (aka the drug war) and many others.But let me be clear, regardless of all the horrible, immoral and even just useless things the mafia does with your money, I maintain that there's a difference between not wanting to pay for protection and roads and not wanting to be extorted, even if the extorted money is then used to fund protection and roads.These things ought to be funded voluntarily. If someone actually doesn't want to pay, you can refuse to serve him, it's that easy.
5	1526903124	-2	People who engage in tax evasion here in the US are considered “criminals” and “subject to fines and/or imprisonment.” People who break the law willingly are not my heroes but to each their own. 
6	1526916616	0	They are considered criminals by a band of organized criminals who are trying to extort them. I'm not sure why you would listen to a criminal who's telling you that he himself is actually a law abiding person and it's the people who don't want to be extorted by him who are the actual criminals.To say tax evaders are criminals because the state says so is absurd beyond verbal description.
7	1526921041	2	I prefer to be a responsible parent and not put my freedom at risk by breaking the law. If you want to break the law and face the possibly consequences, go right ahead. But don’t complain if and when the IRS comes knocking. 
3	1526917669	5	What people on this thread seem to not realize is that this eutopia already exists to a large degree with the sailing community.   That is why a lot of them choose it.Granted, when they port, they are subject to the laws of the country to which they sailed.  But this idea is not far from that lifestyle.The important things missing are medical care, policing, reliable supplies and groceries and many others.  You might find it pretty hard to educate a child on a floating island of 300 homes.That being said, I would be an expat in a minute if I could remove myself from an oppressive government run by absolute idiots who employ police who think it's ok to murder anyone with a cell phone in their hand because "it looked like a gun to me".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cesSRfXqS1Q&feature=youtu.be
3	1526881522	3	Oh shit I had goosebumps remembering that scene
3	1526902212	3	11 years later and bioshock 1 reference still gave me the chillstruly a masterpiece of a game

3	1526884415	1	Prepare for pirates!

2	1526888650	9	"Republic of Minerva"In 1972, Lithuanian-born real-estate millionaire Michael Oliver, of the Phoenix Foundation, sought to establish a libertarian country on the reefs. Oliver formed a syndicate, the Ocean Life Research Foundation, which allegedly had some $100,000,000 for the project and had offices in New York City and London.[citation needed] In 1971, barges loaded with sand arrived from Australia, bringing the reef level—normally a metre below sea level at high tide[citation needed]—above water. In 1972, the Phoenix Foundation began constructing a platform on the Minerva Reefs. The Republic of Minerva issued a "declaration of independence" on 19 January 1972 in letters to neighboring countries and began minting their own currency. In February 1972, Morris C. Davis was elected as "Provisional President" of the Republic of Minerva.[citation needed]Tonga’s claim to the reef was recognized by the South Pacific Forum in September 1972. A Tongan expedition was sent to enforce the claim, arriving on 18 June 1972. The Flag of the Tonga was raised on 19 June 1972 on North Minerva and on South Minerva on 21 June 1972.[4][5]
2	1526872606	19	Too many things to list.  I especially like the bit about getting rid of politicians. If only it were so easy. (In reality they'll be up to their eyeballs with politicians, whether they use that name or not. It will dominate their society.)There have been many attemps to build utopias. Judging from the article my guess is this, if it comes to fruition, will be below the mean in how it ultimately pans out. I just hope it's not an outright tragedy.
3	1526879029	28	If this ever gets built, which I doubt it will, it will just be 300 rich people that buy a house there and spend maybe 2-3 weeks a year there. It will be a ghost town. 
4	1526885454	8	What about their servants?
4	1526889524	9	Most of the year it'll just be Notch and Julian Assange trying to teach Ted Nugent how to use Facebook
5	1526890542	6	You just pointed out the biggest problem with this project. Julian Assange would get snatched up immediately. This free floating island would have zero say in the matter.
6	1526898755	1	Wouldn't such a city require at least some sort of military protection? Any jet could just drop a bomb, powerful enough to destroy anything, and it would just be gone and nobody would know what happened and who did the attack? 
4	1526898639	1	I'd argue that merely depends on the infrastructure and scale of the city. But I definitely see your point. If I, as a tourist, wanted to see cool and smart shit, I' travel to Singapore for much cheaper most of the time. Still a cool theoretical project. We'll see what happens. Peter Thiel is no bullshit, I'd like to believe. I think for him, it's mostly about Crypto exposure he gets from it, since he's invested in Crypto too, and it's to show what "could" be possible, rather than really becoming like your own Government.
3	1526879582	3	I'm being facetious. I would have thought that was self evident.

2	1526912750	1	Pirates.
2	1526872312	1	Dam Crypto-pirates in these here waters!!
1	1526882639	5	I’d be worried the island would sink from the amount of guns and ammo on it.
1	1526878356	14	Now I'm just imagining the pirates from Captain Philips just plundering the place and overtaking it."Look at me...I am the President now."Knowing some of the ancaps that hang around in crypto, they'd probably welcome their new leaders.
2	1526903426	4	I’m sure you’ve seen the videos of oil tankers and merchant ships that have a crew of security that protect them against pirates in dangerous territories, right? I’d imagine people with enough money would hire a private security force. Plus, there’s probably some sort of governing body, like a board, that has risk assessment analysts that safeguard against threats to protect assets as large as this 
1	1526880415	8	Yup, don't forget the failure of the Google Barges which were (possibly) meant to be anchored in international water off San Francisco to avoid taxes etchttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_barges#Intended_useand then there is this monstrosity that cruises the world full of rich, old, lost peoplehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_The_World
2	1526896388	3	that cruise ship is my actual hell.edit: tbf, all cruise ships are my actual hell.

2	1526903925	1	Wow, the idea of cooling your servers in the ocean is a fascinating idea. And using waves to harness power to power your data centers is equally as fascinating. It makes me wonder, what would be the side effects of massive power centers occupying parts of the ocean. The ocean is, incredibly enormous, but still, what would be the ecological side effects of occupying parts of the ocean? I’d imagine you would need to power the servers if you couldn’t harness enough energy from waves to generate enough power. And if you’re introducing power to supplement, would that extra power dissipate into the ocean making its surrounding environment warmer than what it already is? I have lots of questions about this! 
1	1526911351	2	I'd invest in it to sell my part last minute at an overpriced cost to one of those crazy libertarian fucks
1	1526870714	7	Just set up near a frequent us navy route. Still international waters without having to worry about pirates. In regards to crime, I'd just have all the citizens buy shares of the country and if they commit a crime they lose some/all of their shares. The designs should be much more efficient though, that snowflake design would have too much traffic since to get from one branch to another you'd need to go into the center and back out again. Very inefficient. 
2	1526877835	29	> Just set up near a frequent us navy route. Still international waters without having to worry about pirates. So leech off the taxpayers of another nation for their security?
3	1526878471	-2	I meant it's there so why not use it? Most of the citizens would also be US citizens anyway.
4	1526878709	23	Because it goes against the very ethos of libertarianism, doesn't it?But then I suspect that most "libertarians" are in reality just selfish people who are happy to use services that others have paid for just as long as they themselves don't have to contribute.
5	1526879620	18	"We don't need laws!""What about copyright laws?""Oh yeah, well, gotta protect *my* stuff."
6	1526891736	3	I have never met a libertarian who didn't want any laws. Citation needed, please.
6	1526896814	4	Copyright laws are deeply anti\-libertarian. Way to show your ignorance.
5	1526885500	2	That level assumption has made an ass out of you, sir.
5	1526879086	-8	>are in reality just selfish people who are happy to use services that others have paid for just as long as they themselves don't have to contribute.Are you talking about the poorest 50% of this country that doesn't pay any net taxes after transfers because they vote to pay less tax than everyone else?
6	1526885439	11	Yeah all that desperation and crippling terror about homelessness and feeding their children is just a ploy to avoid paying taxesOr maybe it's terrifying that half your country can't even afford to pay taxes and you should help them.
7	1526893458	-2	California, Oregon, Washington, and NY have the most progressive tax laws in America. They must be free of homelessness by your argument. 
8	1526894217	3	What a bizarre strawman. I'm saying you're targeting the poorest 50% who can barely feed their children and so of course can't afford to pay taxes. It's incredibly unempathetic, illogical and mean-spirited to attack the poorest and blame them for voting to not be taxed even though their voting power is historically minimal and far less influential than the richest who can directly influence policy and the votes of legislators with their huge capital. Meanwhile the top 1% in the US owns more than the bottom 90% altogether, yet they pay far fewer taxes than the middle-class thanks to their lobbying power, loopholes and access to havens. If you yourself are not a millionaire, you have been duped to fight against your own interests, which is really sad. If you are, you are selfishly protecting your own shit at the expense of others, which while logical, is still a dick move.
9	1526896281	-9	>What a bizarre strawman.Did you not argue that a progressive tax helps fight homelessness?>I'm saying you're targeting the poorest 50% who can barely feed their children and so of course can't afford to pay taxes.If they can't afford to pay taxes, what use are they to our nation? What use are the people who don't provide for the human race? Those poor people are just pets who want to be fed, bathed, housed, trained, groomed, fixed, and eventually put down by their providers. The only welfare I approve of is paying the poor people to be sterilized and aborted and euthanized. >If you yourself are not a millionaire, you have been duped to fight against your own interests, which is really sad.

If you are, you are selfishly protecting your own shit at the expense of others, which while logical, is still a dick move.I also think it's funny how you give me two perfectly acceptable options. Either I am a virtuous ethicist who is capable of placing my own selfish desires aside and support what is best regardless of my station in life. OR, I am just doing what you're doing and supporting my own station in life. By the minimum you've dictated, I am at the very least as Good as you.>Meanwhile the top 1% in the US owns more than the bottom 90% altogether, yet they pay far fewer taxes than the middle-class thanks to their lobbying power, loopholes and access to havens. And this is what it all comes down to doesn't it? You're the jealous child on the play ground who's sad because Tommy has more toys than you and your poor brain thinks it's unfair so you start to cry about it. You want to take Tommy's toys for yourself, don't you?
6	1526885624	-7	The downvotes lmao! Statists and collectivists won't ever get it man. You can't come to their echo chamber and convince them of anything. If you don't want to pay taxes you want babies to die in the streets and there to be no roads and no parks and NO JUSTICE FOR ANYONE, RAWR... Let sleeping dogs lie, man.
7	1526893360	0	I am a statist though. I just hate hypocrisy more than anything.Check my posting history in /r/georgism and /r/geolibertarianism. Both do require a state.
5	1526887202	-3	I think you nailed it.
2	1526880596	5	Protection tax: 30&#37; of crypto assets. Why do you think that the US Navy wants to protect people who don't want to pay for protection?
3	1526880850	1	They don't have to do anything. Just their presence is enough to deter pirates.
4	1526888601	4	what'll stop the private security you hired for the island from turning on you and doing some sort of coup? the sort of people who would serve as a psuedo-military for an island nation specifically set up to be lawless might not be the most trustworthy of folks when billions of dollars are up for grabs.
5	1526892411	4	What's to stop any country's military from taking over that respective country?
6	1526893059	3	Wow, I was just about to say the same thing. You beat me to it. The answer, of course, is the same as the answer to the question of why don't the mafia boss's men just take his spot first chance they get.The military, and violence in general, is fundamentally not an expression of wealth creation. When someone steals wealth, the amount of wealth in the world stays the same. When someone is offered wealth in exchange for something, the wealth in the world increases. The military, security, violence, etc *needs* a host to feed it. It cannot survive alone so there isn't ''anything'' keeping physical force in check other than basic fundamental economic reality. Buuut it also helps to structure your military such that it checks itself. I'd personally go with the explosive self-destructing collars for the military to wear. The collars need to be reset every day by at least 51% of the shareholders (by weight) else they explode.
7	1526894105	3	i dont know if you knew this but the life of a warlord or crime boss is not exactly a relaxing or secure one. how much "wealth" is in the world is a completely irrelevant calculation. if you had 2 billion dollars, and you were paying your head war guy 1 million dollars a year, he'll still be a lot better off if he kills you and takes it. even if your whole empire or whatever is in shambles and he only ends up with 1 billion or 100 million it's still worth it for him.in stable democracies people don't just serve in the military because that's the highest bidder who will pay for their services (most people arent willing to risk their lives for just money), they tend to have some sense that they're serving their country - whatever that means to them. and in parts of the world where the people with the guns don't like what the people in charge are doing, you have military coups.
8	1526894774	-1	Patriotism is downstream of the economic reality I told you about. Why do you think people evolved to feel patriotic? Because the people who *didn't* steal the 2 billion survived, and the people who did, died.Look at mafias where the boss will get 90% of the drug money. Or the pirate ships where the captain will get first pick of the booty. Or the corporations where the CEO will get 9 digit paychecks. Why doesn't the board just fire the CEO and pocket the 9 digits? Why doesn't the pirate crew kill the captain? Why don't the mafia drug runners steal all the cash?
9	1526895162	3	all of those things have and do happen. i half assume you're trolling but you never really know in this sub.

2	1526871133	4	what happens if the potential proceeds of the crime are greater than the shares held? the whole island would be a massive honey pot for anyone lookin to do a crypto heist. robbing some of its citizens at gunpoint could net you hundreds of millions in crypto.
3	1526871302	0	People who don't have the asset collateral wouldn't be allowed in the country. People who do have the asset collateral aren't likely to throw away their life for some more money. Again, there'd be security to enforce and defend property rights.

5	1526878384	1	Good point. But even the poor people have collateral. Collateral doesn't just have to be money.
6	1526878814	7	I think if you need to use family members of service workers as hostages in order to prevent them from committing crimes you're probably not living in a Utopia.
7	1526884348	1	Oh they aren't hostages! They're free to leave. But they won't. Because of the *implication*.
8	1526888464	3	they're out in the middle of the ocean, in your crypto distopian city. there's nowhere to run. if they wanted to leave they could. but they won't. because of the *implication*.
7	1526878931	-1	There is no such thing as utopia. It's just better safe than sorry. Service workers don't have to come here if they don't like the terms. If the rich are putting up collateral, why should the poor peoples get a pass?
8	1526879363	5	Personally I think the world could do without another oligarchy built on what sounds almost like debt slavery, but I guess everyone has their own priorities. Although I thought the whole idea of libertarianism was that less regulation makes life better for people not worse. 
9	1526880610	1	Libertarianism is really just microfascism. Instead of a government having the monopoly on violence, libertarians believe in landlords having the monopoly on violence. Funny how they don't understand that the government is basically a landlord of a really large chunk of land. For example, the Queen of England legally is the land owner of all the land belonging to England. Bring that up to a libertarian and they pop a gasket. I like libertarian ideology but my system would emerge into libertarianism rather than be scripted to be so. The goal is to use public choice theory to figure out how to get people to vote and support more libertarian policies because we know small scale groups coalesce into larger and larger groups over time. If we assume that the entire universe is owned by a group of shareholders with millions of shares each, the act of buying and selling these shares would quickly give everyone shareholder rights to all natural resources. So when someone wants to own a natural resource, the shareholders are paid a severance based on how much they decide on the asking price for that contract. So in this world, a fascist libertarian island is totally possible and would be commonplace. The citizens who want the rights to that island just pay the severance fee to the shareholders and get to have control over that area until they can't or won't pay the severance any more. In this world, you would be able to use willing citizen lives as collateral since H2H activity would only be regulated in established districts.
4	1526904950	1	Who gets to be in charge of the security if there’s no government? Who decides what they enforce?
5	1526907897	1	The shareholders would be the government. The ideal system wouldn't have a police class. All shareholders would have the right to make arrests but every arrest would require evidence to support it so wrongful arrests would be financially devastating to the arrestor. Because of these legal requirements, you'd only try to make an arrest if you knew you would have the legal right to do so. So while you wouldn't need a badge to police the streets, you'd want to avoid doing so unless you knew exactly what you were doing. If you were wrongfully arrested you'd get compensation, unlike today. The people who choose to police the streets and make arrests would have no extra rights than the rest. You could still pay people to police your streets so there would be a career out of it, but you wouldn't be protected. You'd still be a regular shareholder.In regards to sentencing, that'd be up juries whose power would come from the shareholders. If a jury makes a bad decision, the shareholders can overturn it.
6	1526910169	1	This would only work on extremely small scale where everyone is wealthy/ there is no poverty. Are you saying the more money you have that directly gives you more control over the government operation 
7	1526911310	1	Why shouldn't you get more of a say if you have more at stake? Just because you have more money doesn't necessarily mean you'll have more shares. You could buy just one share and spend your money on something else. Having something at stake is necessary for people to vote rationally. Shareholders will vote to protect their assets; their goal is to make their shares rise in value. If you're worried about a dictatorship, look at the world bank where even the US, the richest country on Earth, only has 16% voting power. It'd take 8 or 9 of the top shareholding countries to get 51% approval. 
2	1526877737	3	Implying the US wouldn't be the biggest threat to a concept like this...

1	1526898792	6	It's the Daily Mail so it all should be considered bull shit until proven elsewhere
2	1526933366	2	Yes this article got some facts wrong.1. Peter Thiel is no longer involved with the seasteading project. He hasn't supported The Seasteading Institute for years. He certainly isn't bankrolling Blue Frontiers.2. The first line says our first seastead will operate outside government regulations. That's not feasible. Our pilot project will be in a special economic zone \(we call it "SeaZone"\) of a host nation. A special economic zone is negotiated with the host country to remove regulations with the goal of spurring innovation, but it's not completely free from govt. A completely free\-floating nation is many steps down the road.

0	1526882973	18	Some questions off the top of my head that could be problematic:1. Will the 300 residents provide the labor force that would do the maintenance of the houses, cleaning of public spaces, mechanics, plumbing, restaurants, etc?2. If "YES" to 1, then they will need more than 300 residents, and will the first residents then will be comprised of millionaires who happen to be plumbers and carpenters?3. If "NO" to 1, then will they source for low-skilled labour from the neighbouring Pacific Islands, thereby promoting a wealth gap in this community's genesis?4. This community is no different from a floating cruise liner, with 5000 passengers. Why not just build off of a small cruise liner to trial such a community, to save on cost, and attempt to determine the best community leadership mechanism and smooth a lot of intangibles out before actually building out an actual Proof-of-Concept in the Ocean?
1	1526898032	6	Some more questions that could be problematic:1. Where do they dump their poop and other garbage?  I'm sure whatever country they choose to anchor nearby may want to know.2. What happens when one of them inevitably gets murdered. Where is the law enforcement? What law applies? Anyone who has been a member of a residents association can tell you how smooth everything goes /s3. When the Somali pirates turn up to entertain the obviously rich hostages what are the defence arrangements?
2	1526900614	5	4. Internet, will it go by sea or is it satellite, neither sounds good.5. Will the government be self\-sustainable? since fresh water is harder to obtain.
1	1526923690	2	I was actually just reading about a cruiseship called "The World" that is privately owned. People own apartments on board, and apparently some live on it full time.

0	1526868525	55	Now we just need a decentralized military. Loyal only to the Ethereum Autonomous Government. Defend nodes, enforce contracts. A new type of insurgency, no government will be able to deal with it because it’s outside their jurisdiction.  the Ethereum government will blanket the world because of the global nature of the internet. All governments will fall under the umbrella of the DAO, an invisible government that exist only as 1s and 0s. Finally we will have one global government. One nation under DAO.
1	1526881494	20	We're getting somewhat science fiction, but imagine a decenralized defense system. Defenders buy stake in a "node", which pays dividends as long as the node is not damaged. It's now in the economic interest of holders to defend it.

1	1526892311	4	Well this one isn't floating, is it? It's a platform on pillars.
1	1526884458	3	**Principality of Sealand**The Principality of Sealand, more commonly known as Sealand, is a micronation that claims Roughs Tower, an offshore platform located in the North Sea approximately 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) off the coast of Suffolk, England, as its territory. Roughs Tower is a disused Maunsell Sea Fort, originally called HM Fort Roughs, built as an anti-aircraft defensive gun platform by the British during World War II.Since 1967, the decommissioned HM Fort Roughs has been occupied by family and associates of Paddy Roy Bates, who claim that it is an independent sovereign state. Bates seized it from a group of pirate radio broadcasters in 1967 with the intention of setting up his own station at the site. He attempted to establish Sealand as a nation-state in 1975 with the writing of a national constitution and establishment of other national symbols.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
1	1526928877	1	Sealand can't get recognized as a nation by any current sovereign nation or the UN because "Artificial islands, installations and structures do not possess the status of islands. They have no territorial sea of their own, and their presence does not affect the delimitation of the territorial sea, the exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf"Even if they build this, I expect they'll run into the same problem.

3	1526888047	1	Yeah, Utopia's are really dangerous, imagine if people would figure out that they can actually be happy!
4	1526892000	3	An utopia would require tremendous government crackdown and opression, turning it into a dystopia.
5	1526892932	0	Right, cause in your mind a utopia would be to suppress all people...? I'm sorry to say this, but you're probably thinking of something that is NOT a utopia, in fact, you seem to be thinking of the exact opposite. If you would of said that a utopia would be impossible because the idea of a utopia is different for everybody (for you apparently it means to oppress all people). However, saying in a very linear, unambiguous way that for a utopia to exist the government needs to crackdown and oppress all people leads me to believe that in your mind, there is only one way to get to utopia, which is of course absurd.
6	1526895534	2	No, because not everyone will conform to your ideals, and since they won't conform the only other way is to force them by hand. This devolves into crackdown and opression. That ofcourse is a bad thing. This is why, for example communism will never work, since it will involve opressing the population so it will act according to what you want.
7	1526897357	1	But  communism had never been vieuwed as a Utopia? Also, as I hinted in my previous comment, what a Utopia is, is really a philosophical question, as it's different for everyone...
8	1526900950	2	Ergo, it is impossible to have one.

It's just human nature to want to control others at their expense - *especially* when you get an ounce of power.
0	1526906793	2	A project so big and ambitious is bound to cost a lot of money. And definitely more than 50 million
0	1526909128	2	No way in hell something like this costs 50 million. 50 Billion at a minimum, if you're judging from that snowflake picture.

1	1526888952	1	Since 1987, Sealand lies within the territorial waters of the United Kingdom.[10]Bates moved to the mainland when he became elderly, naming his son, Michael, as regent. Bates died in October 2012 at the age of 91.[11] Michael lives in Suffolk, England.

0	1526888342	1	This is great, a good opportunity for projects like Lamden and EOS.
0	1526888887	1	See another project recycling Rolls Royce or Bugatti names 🙄. See its bank rolled by Peter Thiel 😲
1	1526934101	1	Daily Mail got that wrong. Peter Thiel is not involved with Blue Frontiers.
0	1526907693	1	Frankly this idea is ludicris.Let me point out the largest pile of steaming BULLSHIT of all:"It could see the creation of an independent nation that floats in international waters and operates within its own laws to 'liberate humanity from politicians', according to the Seasteading Institute"yea RIGHT.Until said entity / island can defend itself from aircraft carriers, orbital weapons, nukes, etc - It will never be free of politicians who want something from them. Its a goddamn pipe dream until they have the might to insist upon sovereignty. International waters will not protect them.  And the 2nd place winner is:"A number of the island's dozen non-residential buildings are designed to function as business centres, allowing companies to work outside of government regulations."Until the UN or some other nation state deems whatever the hell they are doing to be a threat or potential disruptor of a beloved business model and decides to take them out or just go and TAKE whatever it is they are working on. Honestly, do they really believe that a little water is going to stop regulators?I've had ideas like this too, at least I know they are crazy in this context and know what I'd have to do to solve these issues and frankly, its technologically impossible without a few trillion to solve some thorny tech problems...not impossible, but very difficult. I'd love to work with some people who could potentially solve such problems of which I am not willing to even speak of here.
0	1526912371	1	I definitely don't like the sound of that.A place where rich people and companies can operate without gouvernment jurisdiction? That sounds like yet another tax haven and breeding place for corruption. Nothing to celebrate here, the _Paypal_ founder probably got a good personal reason for funding this project and it's most likely not philanthropy.
1	1526918625	2	Except the article is full of disinformation and Peter Thiel is definitely not funding this project.
1	1526933858	1	It's the same principle that let Hong Kong flourish under a different set of regulations. Chinese officials saw the benefit of less regulation and have created many other special economic zones. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special\_economic\_zones\_of\_China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_economic_zones_of_China)
0	1526912694	1	That looks rad, but when it comes to man made island nations, my heart will always belong to Sealand. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand
1	1526912703	1	**Principality of Sealand**The Principality of Sealand, more commonly known as Sealand, is a micronation that claims Roughs Tower, an offshore platform located in the North Sea approximately 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) off the coast of Suffolk, England, as its territory. Roughs Tower is a disused Maunsell Sea Fort, originally called HM Fort Roughs, built as an anti-aircraft defensive gun platform by the British during World War II.Since 1967, the decommissioned HM Fort Roughs has been occupied by family and associates of Paddy Roy Bates, who claim that it is an independent sovereign state. Bates seized it from a group of pirate radio broadcasters in 1967 with the intention of setting up his own station at the site. He attempted to establish Sealand as a nation-state in 1975 with the writing of a national constitution and establishment of other national symbols.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

1	1526895481	2	I recall back before the Millennium the  [Freedom Ship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Ship) was supposed to be huge.  I sent them my resume!
2	1526909154	3	I'd rather put in money for that. I could probably afford to live there, not so much the Tahitian super-resort version. I mean that looks like a kickstarter for the 1% more than anything else. 
2	1526895486	1	**Freedom Ship**Freedom Ship is a floating city project initially proposed in the late 1990s. It was so named because of the "free" international lifestyle facilitated by a mobile ocean colony, though the project would not be a conventional ship, but rather a series of linked barges.The Freedom Ship project envisions a 1317 m (0.818 mi)-long integrated city with condominium housing for 50,000 people, an airstrip to accommodate turboprop aircraft, duty-free shopping and other facilities, large enough to require rapid transit. The complex would circumnavigate the globe continuously, stopping regularly at ports of call.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
