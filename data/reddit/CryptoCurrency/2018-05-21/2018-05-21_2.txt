1	1526874847	33	DAMN!!  Hundreds and hundreds of the exact same or slightly different quote posted over and over and over.
2	1526874991	41	I don't get how Reddit can't catch this and ban these accounts with an automated process...
3	1526885555	10	They would have to make an exception for legitimate bots, which would not be as easy to automate!
4	1526888410	10	Good bot Edit: explanation: I was summoning the bot that responded to me. Maybe something like this could be implemented on Reddit's end so each account can have a bot score. If the score is too high then the account is flared "suspect bot". This way users can use their own discretion, and no innocent bots have to be banned. 
5	1526888436	13	Are you sure about that? Because I am 100.0% sure that 435627793 is not a bot.---^(I am a Neural Network being trained to detect spammers | Summon me with `!isbot <username>` |) [^Optout](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=-spamfighter-&subject=!optout&message=!optout) ^| [^Original ^GitHub](https://github.com/SM-Wistful/BotDetection-Algorithm)
3	1526884391	0	What exactly would you like them to do?
4	1526916555	2	Ban spammers for breaking the spamming rule... this isn't rocket science.
3	1526893709	-1	and what exactly this account has done that is not in accordance with reddit's rules?
4	1526916465	3	Reddit rules section 3 - Spam.  Did you even look at the rules before asking this? :)
5	1526917992	-2	why would you qualify it as spam? that way every shill topic would be spam which is majority of this sub, and it's likely not even automated, that guy answers in his topics
2	1526906968	7	>[Innovative Project, The team is massively doing well. It is necessary to learn closer this project it can be very promising, this will a good hold for tokens.](https://np.reddit.com/r/treon/comments/8kzzu8/innovative_project_the_team_is_massively_doing/)............... my poor brains.
2	1526918111	1	In different subs for a handful of different coin projects. Could not be a more obvious paid account. 
1	1526875283	10	Holy shit, that‚Äôs a treasure trove.
1	1526895726	7	Taking his first page of postings only, and filtering on unique subs, this gives us (as if we didn't recognise them as such already) **these shitcoin subs**:- Alt_Estate  - BlueFrontiers  - dwbtoken  - ForeverHasFallen  - hazeian  - Homelend  - iShook  - koronacoin  - onlineio  - peur  - Productivist  - retailglobal  - Sleekplay  - thugcoin  - TraXion  - treon  - Utrumdotio  - VelixID  - WealthMigrate  - xchangerate  - ZeCashOfficial  Stay away from them like the plague. I won't be making these into links:
2	1526905185	11	> thugcoinI admit I found this intriguing.  Does this beat up the other coins and take their value?
3	1526907262	7	Nah it just cruises thru the cryptohood looking for dealcoins to deal and bitchcoins to pimp.
1	1526876099	4	Wow is it that easy to be hired by some of these projects to shill them or do you think they are just buying these coins then jumping on the shill train to try and pump their investment? I‚Äôm thinking this may be super lucrative. 
2	1526876229	10	They‚Äôre most likely shillbots and all of these projects are run by the same people.
3	1526876604	8	Yeah I think you‚Äôre right. I was searching around for companies that provide this service and there are a ton of ICO marketing firms now. Here is one that offers ‚Äúsocial media advertising‚Äù which I think would be the buzzword for this kind of activity. https://cryptoprofits.agency/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwuYTYBRDsARIsAJnrUXBrBOZF6CVnUWbT68yDETExmtChBbomsHZuUZDCywzp0Ns8nd8uploaAv3vEALw_wcB
2	1526894882	2	they receive the tokens for shilling, why do you think most ICOs go way below ICO price early on? it's not that geniuses buy in the ICO to then sell at a loss immediately, it's all those shillers, influencers, advertisers dumping to secure income, I mean even translating jobs or graphic jobs are often paid with tokens
0	1526869204	34	This is just one of dozens of subreddits for ico's that I subscribed to with 1000's of bullshit nonsense posts.  A lot of it comes from lame airdrop/bounty  seekers.  I went down the airdrop rabbit hole a few months ago, and its amazing that some of these "companies" think its a good business decision to have people spam their social media accounts with bullshit like "Faith in amazing project opportunity moon lambo!" .  Even the 1 or 2 seemingly legit projects look scammy as fuck with these barrage of posts.
1	1526882340	8	Competing projects probably spamming each other with obvious scam bait.
1	1526894705	3	most of those companies don't have any business experience so what do you except? you can learn how to create an erc20 token in an houranyway, it probably has a decent degree of success if those scams on twitter do
0	1526867676	30	Oh my god this is cancer.I really hope the mods don't delete your post because this is truly eye-opening.And by the way, I totally expect this thread to suffer from massive gaslighting because you exposed this - Especially since you exposed Reddit manipulation, on Reddit
1	1526880581	11	Dating With Benefits Will Be The Most Popular ICO This Year.
2	1526884516	10	Much date. Wow benefits.
3	1526907338	4	So sexual wow
2	1526888711	5	I invested only $100 and already dated 2 sexy girls and had a $5000 return.  
0	1526873485	12	holy shit, I clicked on some of the posts in there since they all have 20+ comments, its all just a circle-jerk of robots! I know that paid shillers are a real thing, but god damn. Makes this sub look a hell of a lot better by comparison at least.
0	1526869698	10	So painful to read.
0	1526874075	6	The facebook page is just as crazy.[**https://www.facebook.com/DatingWithBenefitsOfficial**](https://www.facebook.com/DatingWithBenefitsOfficial)Hundreds of random people just leaving bs comments.  "This project is the future" "Such a great team" "Amazing project" Click on any of the users that leave these posts and you see they bombard every ICO with the same comments.  They are just in it for bounty / airdrop rewards.  Or they are just paid spamming accounts and or bots.One of the posts says they are featured and the number one ICO on "ICOTokenNews"   2 of the people on their team run that website...
0	1526867801	9	I don't know why we need a token for our sex lives hahaha.Like how do we quantify or measure it?Are they trying to incentivize promiscuity or something?
1	1526872696	7	Yeah I don‚Äôt understand the purpose of this project. It seems like a poster child for the major issue of companies attempting to apply blockchain to solve a non-issue due to the technologies popularity. Reminds me of this guy: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/12/18/small-cap-longfin-soars-2000-percent-after-acquiring-blockchain-company.htmlThe video made me sick and I love watching his price fall as he speaks. 
2	1526873007	3	lol. Venkat Meenavalli is a fucking classic, I‚Äôm so glad that he got to be publicly humiliated on CNBC about his scam... twice. 
3	1526873164	2	I know. It warms my heart to watch him squirm on national television. I haven‚Äôt seen any other videos though. Care to share?  This one comes up when I search ‚Äúblockchain company horrible CNBC interview‚Äù.Edit: found it from last month actually. https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/04/04/longfin-ceo-speaks-out-on-sec-investigation.html
3	1526917378	1	Saw the videos, doesnt sound too bad. Many crypto companies are worse.
2	1526895218	2	> Yeah I don‚Äôt understand the purpose of this project.making the creators money is a pretty clear purpose
3	1526925703	1	This. So much this.
1	1526881681	2	Gallons/yr
0	1526878217	4	haha one thread has someone named bear_crypto replying to bull_crypto. This feels like reading role players.
0	1526901001	4	> Hi I'm 13 and my mom gave me a credit card to use for emergencies, but I think I should max it out on this awesome ICO and pay for my future tuition with my Moon Lambozmmmm, seems legit.
0	1526877268	3	Gob: "...But check your lease, man. Because you‚Äôre living in fuck City."
1	1526894173	1	"But how do we filter out all the teases?"
0	1526888289	3	nCash sub in a nutshell
1	1526922968	1	or bcash, or zcash...
0	1526904418	3	"DatingWithBenefits Is The Most Successful Project As Ever" "Hey, Do You All Want Your Life Is Fully With Sugars? DatingWithBenefits Is The Right Coice""This Is One of The Key How BENEFIT Price Will Grow, Perhaps Rising To The Sky?"I'm pretty sure I got herpes just visiting that sub.
0	1526900771	2	I can't believe what I'm reading: "Hi I'm 13 and my mom gave me a credit card to use for emergencies, but I think I should max it out on this awesome ICO and pay for my future tuition with my Moon Lamboz" 
0	1526902010	2	this makes bunnytoken look harmless
0	1526868625	1	That shit is amazing. Thank you.
0	1526870787	1	Even if that project is legit I'd never touch it with a barge pole now that I've seen that cesspool of a subreddit. Do they not realise doing that makes it look more shady? Or do people really fall for that shit? While it's clear the posts are total nonsense in a few years when AI bots gets better they'll look convincing. To the point where this won't be obviously bullshit. That is a worrying realization for a number of reasons. 
0	1526882288	1	Downvote all those fake accounts to oblivion 
0	1526882450	1	The best part is how the translator broke and they just straight up refer to it as a token for the "sex industry".
0	1526883654	1	They added boobs there, I'm a simple man, I see boobs, I buy that token.
0	1526883819	1	It‚Äôs like the subreddit simulator of ico
0	1526884925	1	I can name a dozen "legit" coins which can't stand up to basic reasoning, but I won't even bother. Crypto is festered with bullshit. 
0	1526890495	1	 You guys can play it safe -- I'm going in **balls-deep**. Later virgins.
0	1526892463	1	The consistency in language and ‚Äûlogic‚Äú makes this look like a one man (moron) effort. Someone has been very busy.
0	1526906339	1	"It is a powerful technological and information resource which encompasses all aspects of blockchain technology"This shit is gold. I just imagine every comment made in a computer voice.
0	1526906583	1	Lol @ at guy identifying as a wolf :)
0	1526911126	1	This was my favorite comment I found:> I don't know about you, but I'm going to listen to whatever he says.. I'm sold! >Just imagine the BENEFITS, the crypto, it's all cryptic and just how I like it to be.
0	1526912708	1	DOH!!! Definitely should of listed the link as NSFW XD
0	1526926885	1	So basically the VeChain subreddit. 
0	1526884027	0	Sounds like VeChain community..
1	1526927017	1	Exactly like it. 
1	1526890689	1	Wait till Vechain shiller army finds this post. Or hold - unless you mention Vechain in title they won't bother.
1	1526896038	0	They are all true believers over there. No need for paid shills when everyone drank the kool aid
0	1526917366	1	was hoping for a link to Bcash
0	1526904306	-1	This really isn‚Äôt that much different than what I see every day here.  Surely people see the similarities to VEN posts etc.
1	1526924524	1	I think you mean Tron.
0	1526924776	0	Reminds me of VEN sub
0	1526878252	-3	Hi I bought some and I noticed many girls messaging me on Tinder. Is this next ethereum for dating? 
1	1526888512	1	I invested just $50 and already had 2 dates with 2 sexy blondes. Will definitely invest more.
1	1526888648	0	No, you have been scammed. 
0	1526886743	-5	WTF is "blatant" ?
1	1526896775	2	You are asking what the word "blatant" means?
