0	1526902339	124	Probably try learning a programming language.  Try CS50 at edx. It's free course intro to computer science.
1	1526914158	25	Wow, this is awesome, a free introduction course from Harvard? didn't even knew this existed, thanks!
2	1526917704	14	A lot of top 10 schools have free online courses. I know Stanford and MIT have some good ones too
2	1526921142	7	It is so well done too. you get included in most of the assignments, projects, and even hack-athons that the actual Harvard-enrolled students do. The class itself is an absolute grind (in a good way). Coming from someone (me) with 0 programming experience prior to CS50, I would struggle through it again 10/10.
3	1526921437	2	100% doing this in july after my exams. Do people actually pay for these certificates? And any opnions to enroll in MIT’s intro to cs or Harvard’s intro to cs? Pro’s and cons? Seems like MIT Only covers python and databases and Harvard a set of different languages?
4	1526923285	12	They make their money by selling the certificate but if you just want the knowledge then simply do the course.LITERALLY showing you that the only thing your money goes to is a piece of paper in college, lol
5	1526928382	4	As an executive at a Fortune 1000 software company, I will tell you that this is largely true. I'd much rather have interns or fresh grads from a technical college that have real application under their belts. A degree shows that you have the ability to start and complete a task.
6	1526928762	4	Thanks for reaffirming that im wasting another 4 years of my life
7	1526928971	4	I would never call it "wasting" as you learn quite a bit outside of your actual degree if you spend the time wisely. If you have any opportunity to travel, volunteer, or learn another language, this will help you in your interviewing and resume. You need things to make yourself standout from the others when you don't have experience. 
5	1526933113	3	Don't forget the lifelong connections to people of your generation. If you're doing college right, they will be part of your professional contacts list for the rest of your life. 
5	1526935874	1	> mrhindoglicker..wow, you must think the earth is flat and man never walked on the moon as well?!?!
6	1526935927	1	I don’t understand what you just said so I’ll just say yes
7	1526936004	1	that explains your lack of education. you should try educating yourself sometime. I'm not referring to youtube videos either
8	1526936030	1	Ok
5	1526924567	1	Accurate lol
6	1526925117	3	Yet I still fall for it :(It’s ok I’m going to be changing my major to Computer Programming, just started the cs50 course online and I like it so far :)I’d love to get a job in the cryptosphere or even do something on my own. Would be neat
7	1526927211	1	Is it possible to bingewatch the course whenever you want or can you Only like acces the programs courses once a week as stated on the website (eg 2-6 hours per week for 6 weeks)?
8	1526927339	2	It's self paced, you can churn it out in one week if you want.
9	1526929912	2	Lets gooooo
2	1526924646	2	They're actually really great too.
2	1526934516	2	if all you're interested in is the knowledge (not the connections or experience) you can get a free education from the best schools in the world today. see: coursera and similar sites.
3	1526934731	1	Correct, I’ve been doing Some courses in webdevelopment on udemy which I think are pretty good. I’m Just curious how a course like cs from harvard would be given!
1	1526931586	1	Thats awesome! Didn’t know that existed at all...
0	1526903331	68	I have made this switch and I can say that you are still very early in a developing field, which lacks developers with experience and knowledge. So it is very doable! Learn to program in a few different languages. Meanwhile, read up on the technology behind blockchain's, not the use cases, marketing and prices. Once you can comfortably explain how they work in great detail, you are getting close. A little self-study in cryptography will help. Next up, learn solidity and experiment with creating a few smart contracts, you can show these at job interviews. Everything I just mentioned can be learned online, so a degree is not a requirement, but will help a lot! Given the fact that I already knew programming. It took me about half a year of reading up on blockchains and solidity to get started as a blockchain developer. Since it is such a young field, you will not only be programming. I write blogs, do presentations and generally have to inform a lot of parties about blockchain. Therefore good presentation and writing skills would help a lot. Lastly, I personally recommend trying to get involved in the communities of the big applicable blockchains. Ask questions, learn from them and get your name out there. Good luck and don't be scared to apply early for jobs. Most companies need knowledge in blockchain they don't have, which you can provide after good preparation! 
1	1526917174	4	What language would you say someone should learn first, as in the most useful?
2	1526929323	9	As mentioned before, Python is a great starting language because it is powerful in the sense that you can do a lot with very little code. C++ on the otherhand does little with much code, but you are fully in control. It is a great mindset for a blockchain developer to know how to work with limited resources that you must control yourself, so I find it a great recommendation.The only other langauge I would recommend is javascript, purely because I encounter it surprisingly much (for example with iota).
2	1526920195	3	Depends on what you want to do really. If you want to work on blockchain projects like Bitcoin, C++ is the way to go (I have recently seen a project using Rust, but I don't remember its name).If you want to create Dapps on Ethereum, learn Solidity (obvisously).If you want to start programming just for fun, Python is probably good, but you should also check out some strongly typed languages. If you like maths, functional programming is for you (Haskell!)Also, it depends on your knowledge of computers in general. Don't start with C++ if you don't have a deep understanding of computer architecture! C++ is really hard for beginners (even for some advanced programmers :D). But since C++11, it is actually a really good language if you know what you're doing. And really fast (again, if you know what you're doing).
2	1526918813	0	doesn't just work that way, but Python is regarded as the "easiest" to learn, although many start with C++, you can really do whatever you want. 
3	1526919144	2	Plus Python is freaking awesome. So much fun combining different APIs.
4	1526919193	1	i taught myself a little bit... I can make calculators... yayi should really finish learning it
1	1526921132	5	Did u see a big pay bump?
2	1526929065	1	I personally did not because I am helping my IT company explore the possibilities of blockchain, which means I am a risk. But once we have more projects, it will start to change. That might be the case for other companies, but fully committed companies probably offer a more competitive salary.
1	1526905857	-1	This
0	1526902489	30	sounds like you're trying to get in as a developereasy answer would be to just become a web developer, then you can work in any field, including blockchainif you want to specifically be a blockchain developer then you'll want to study cryptography and distributed systems, make some cryptocurrencies from scratch for practice and resume and then apply for jobs at blockchain companies.
1	1526903061	15	Some hard work but this looks appropriate.
1	1526905894	6	Why web development? Shouldn't be a software developer more appropriate? 
2	1526906780	2	can you find me a crypto startup that doesn't have their own website or app?
3	1526917729	2	Isn't he talking about the blockchain technology though. Understanding and applying the fundamental basics of it requires knowledge in distributed systems, computer networks and programming skills (C++, Java, ..). Studying cryptography is useful but definetely not the main pillar. I personally don't think studying web development is the best fit but it goes in the right direction as long as there are personal side projects.
3	1526928215	1	I've already created a crypto. Currently working with other business students on how to market the use case. Would love to have you on board if you know how to create iOS/android apps.
2	1526909510	3	If you're good at building websites, you're, usually, good at whatever language you use to do it with. The same core principles apply to several projects, so learning to build websites gives you the tools to do other things as well. 
2	1526913753	1	are web developers not software developers? 
3	1526914211	-1	Totally different
4	1526915667	3	I wouldn't say totally different. Web developers are more like a subset of software developers. They both build software but one specializes in building web applications while the other builds software that could be applied in other situations
4	1526915772	2	Eh kinda, they’re all sort of merging now. With Node.js traditional web developers that used JavaScript client-side can now develop for desktop and back-end, and traditional desktop/back-end languages like the .NET stack can be used for web development. Software development is in this weird spot where they’re trying to make every cross-platform and cross-use. A lot of blockchain projects are written in JavaScript so starting as a web dev probably isn’t a bad start.
5	1526932041	1	Node and its polar opposite WASM, if it ever lands. 
4	1526916167	2	I totally disagree with that statement .  There are different type of software developers: web application development, mobile application development, data science, QA/TEST, embedded systems, system security etc.  They are ALL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS/ENGINEERS because they obviously create software.....There are a plethora of software developers that work specifically on developing web applications that have a title 'Software Engineer'
5	1526916271	-2	In different languages though, So it Still is different, is it not?
6	1526916399	3	yes, you will be using different languages, but in the end it's still programming.
4	1526919669	2	Totally agree. Comparing front end to back end development, though there can be overlap, is why it's so hard to sort through garbage titles these days.Web developers often don't go engineering unless they're working in a more advanced environment. Traditionally, they're working with purely front end technologies, but these days, front end has begun to blur as we've started automating a lot of scaffolding and styling with modularization and frameworks.Back end stuff is a lot more engineering focused, working serverside with stuff behind the scenes. IDK people are downvoting you. This is industry 101 knowledge.
5	1526921536	1	Exactly. Thanks to you sir.
6	1526921671	2	ma'am ;]
1	1526909670	5	Specializing in UX development would probably help OP market themselves better. Lots of projects out there with terrible UX.Save us, OP! Help make crypto more usable for regular users!
1	1526918896	1	Dis. Even if you aim to get into software or something more advanced down the road, web development, or more ideally, front end development, will have a lower barrier of entry in a lot of ways and teach you the basic skills that will propel you into more advanced places later. It also will give you a stronger foundation by knowing how front end is affected by back end development.Speaking from experience as someone that went from design to front end to engineering with only a degree in design, taking it piece by piece is much easier. You can also look into bootcamps if you have the time to dedicate to it. We hire a lot of our developers that way now. Formerly, a 4\-year education was standard, but because tech shifts so quickly these days, what you learned that the beginning of your 4\-year term would more likely be outdated at that point. If you're serious about things, a bootcamp can be completed in about 3 months or so, attending classes 9\-5, five days a week, and you'll leave having a real project or two that you can showcase with an understanding of current tech expectations. You'll probably land a junior position a lot more quickly that way.
0	1526901920	26	Upvoted for visibility, definitely interested in a career in blockchain/crypto 
1	1526903012	12	Same!
1	1526914236	1	Same Same!
0	1526902904	53	I really appreciate the actual help and not the old "so we have this thing called a search function" response. Much love and many moons to you all.
1	1526910491	5	There are several free CS101 courses available online, pretty sure Stanford and MIT both make theirs available. I recommend doing them both to see which clicks best for you.After learning some basics, you will also find several free online courses that are crypto related - coursera is very good so try there.Once you've done a little coding, try visiting the Reddits and Discord servers of lots of different coin projects. Chat to the project teams and the communities. Ask lots of questions and keep going until you find a good crowd of people that you get along with.You might find you enjoy several different projects so hang with whoever and ask how you can help. People are generally pretty decent and will give you that chance. Read a LOT. Read more, and ask lots of questions just like you did with this one. You will succeed, all you need to do is keep going. All the very best!!! 😀Cheers,Robots.

0	1526918296	8	Let me hit you with some harsh realities.\- The people who are creating new Crypto startups are 29\-40 year olds that lived through the .dot com bubble\- Most of those people have been in their field for at least 10\+ years\- A lot of those people have also built their networks of people across all industries that are lynch pin dependent on goods/services from the other\- A lot of them\-\- have little to no programming knowledge what so ever.You have a couple of choices from my perspective:\- You dig in and learning coding C\+, Java and/or Python\-\- json, CSS and HTML5.  Get to know how code structure works, commits, Git Hub, etc.  Join an open source project and figure out how teams work.\- Do the above but take a more business minded approach to understanding communication \(internal/external\), DevOps/BizOps models, operations and day to day operations.  Learn the technologies that these teams use, learn about the integrations, ask a lot of "well how does that work?" type questions and use that as your platform to build off ofHere's the trick\-\-\- you do the two things above while in parallel you're working your "day job" by learning industry practices \(ITIL and such\), build your social network at work and outside\-\-\- go to lunches with recruiters simply to learn what companies are looking for.  Eventually, you'll run into someone who will shoulder tap you to join a project and that will be the day that you can pinch yourself.Good luck.
1	1526929194	2	Good solid advice here.
1	1526934869	2	> The people who are creating new Crypto startups are 29-40 year olds that lived through the .dot com bubbleSome of them. Some of them are older or younger than this. This gatekeeping elitest attitude that some kid isn't qualified because he doesn't have the background you say he needs to have doesn't serve anybody, least of all him. Because it just doesn't match reality.You can be 14 or 90 and if you have good ideas and execute them well and you learn and adapt quick enough, you can succeed just as well as a 35 year old who 'lived through' the dot com bust while he was in high school.I'd list lots of examples but people would just nitpick them rather than see my point. But I'm sure you can think of many examples of young people doing well without prior experience, connections or domain expertise. This is the internet, not some old boys club.

1	1526929598	2	Ouch
1	1526918948	1	that is hilarious
1	1526929915	1	You made the mistake of not doing an ICO at the end of all this blockchain, could easily have recouped all the costs, and then some
0	1526903231	7	Look at companies that are hiring for blockchain development. As in like, look at the actual job description. Then over to the requirements section of the job description.Learn whatever it is they're asking as a requirement.
0	1526902432	4	To jump on this data analyst, 25 yo. Fluent in python. How can I make a leap into blockchain 
1	1526905970	4	Start learning a lot about 1 blockchain. Im in same situation coming from R with medium python skills. Learned how to set up a VM on digital ocean, set up r shiny server to host sites. Now i installed node.js on the vm and reading into iota.. how to query nodes etc
2	1526908023	3	if you dont mind me asking what do you hope to achieve through blockchain analysis? feel free not to answer if its prying. Also thoughts on solidity? thinking of starting there. 
3	1526909212	3	Really difficult question. Thats why i try to pick up general programming skills as well. Im trying to think up usecases for analysis on blockchains but have a hard time thinking them up. Probably analysis is a little bit further away from core blockchain technology, more for apps on top of blockchain.  
4	1526911367	1	Thats exactly where I fall. Having hard time of thinking of apps on top of blockchain. I can pick the coding as I go along. 
5	1526920036	1	A blockchain needs input the data to store . Apps will look after that. Output for humans is probably some web client in many cases. Internet of things has some nice use cases for more unusual stuff.
4	1526931642	1	Forensics and corporate intelligence.
3	1526917573	1	I work for a notable start\-up and I can tell you that most of these projects will need marketing and sales data. I haven't seen anything associated with either of these business ops yet. Learn to pull data that is actionable for those who are making decisions. It could be error rates, or portions of code that run more efficiently, or user demos, or usage patterns. Tons and tons of options out there that would justify having you on the team. Good luck!

1	1526911332	3	This. Sounds like a shill, but Ivan has a decent channel, I learned a ton from this videos.
0	1526905607	3	https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7zlvge/the_path_to_become_a_blockchain_developer/This should help.
1	1526906379	2	Try to find the information here [https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Main\_Page](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page), maybe it will help you with a choice.
0	1526909693	3	Learn the basics of computer science including data structures, algorithms, cryptography.Pick up a common programming language like Python, C#, Javascript or Java.Learn a database language like SQL or NoSQL.After that you do all that you should realize that blockchain is really just a slow database in most cases like what Jimmy Song said and fairly useless.
1	1526923716	1	blockchain is only usable if a decentralized nature outweighs the speed. BTC may be "slow" compared to instant settlement systems like PayPal but what you get is a trustless system.Nokia doesn't need a blockchain, lol.
0	1526912124	3	If you just want to work in a blockchain firm in the future, web development or software engineering (mobile apps for eg.) can't go wrong. Every blockchain company will need to maintain mobile app + web services. Plus its broad enough that if crypto is a massive bubble and dies (*gasp*), you'll still find plenty of jobs in traditional companies like banks/fintech/e-commerce/other startups.If you specifically want to get into cryptography/building blockchains/blockchain development, then definitely take plenty of courses in mathematics, cryptography and distributed systems. In the meantime, pick up some smart contract programming like Solidity. College probably won't be teaching Solidity, but plenty of resources are online.
0	1526919344	3	If you want to get a shit ton of money really fast just learn Solidty (ETH) smart contract and ICO developers are getting rich because every startup/company wants someone help them launch a coin and they are throwing a crap ton of money at them to help. Buddy of mine is a developer went to school for computing science. For the last 2-3 years he’s been learning solidty and all that stuff, and he’s being doing contract work. Within a single year he’s earned over 300k for a single project. I envy him...
0	1526903436	2	Something you could start doing today, set up local crypto meet ups to discuss ongoings, and start inviting more and more people. Eventually, the network will attract large players with connections.These people could fund projects, introduce you to others, or hire you themselves. I know of many people hired by the biggest companies that all started by simply setting up their own events. 
0	1526908622	2	Learn to program. You don't need college, start with free online courses then move on to creating your own projects. 
0	1526912300	2	Step 1: Get some steel balls.
0	1526932489	2	If you live in the USA, move to Atlanta: Bitpay has a major dev team here making a payment app, and Atlanta is one of 11 cities nationwide hosting the DAPP Hackathon DAPPHACK.Learn the React JS web dev language (a form of javascript) and get proficient with it.Or, on the flipside, take some classes in day trading and start margin trading on the exchanges.  Get good enough and you can literally retire while an automated script does the rest.There's also customer service for any of the exchanges; great way not only to learn how exchanges work, but give you a peak at the kinds of issues the Crypto users are facing.  Working support for an industry is the #1 way to learn about that industry in a meaningful way....more so than college or books, by far.
1	1526934991	1	What language are these scripts written in?React JS/JavaScript as Well?
2	1526935832	1	Mostly Python and Ruby, some Java.  JS is really for the interface.
0	1526902852	1	I saw [this article](https://howtotoken.com/career/blockchain-developer-salaries-2018-report/) recently which might be helpful.You may want to upskill in a blockchain-specific language like [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/).

0	1526907376	1	I know a bit ether, so here is what I would propose, but feel free to replace the ETH parts with the equivalent.So, i am not sure what it is that you want to do exactly. But If you want to be a "blockchain developper", you have to become a dev first. By all means, its not impossible, in fact several great engineers I know are self taught dev. Even if you dont reach the end, you will have learned something usefull, so here is my list :step 1 : learn to code. do some C, a bit of python, then a bit of GOstep 2 : compile geth from scratchstep 3 : write a smart contract, no need for a fancy idea, anything dump, for example one that sends back any token it receives, compile it and "publish it" on the blockchainstep 4 : well at this point youll be more knowledgable on blockchain than most dev. But you still need to understand more about the theory of computer science, so learn about graphs, "distributed systems", anything from consensus algo, bizantine fault, graph issues and overal any algorithmic part of computer scienceOptionnal step : get into linux, most blockchains application work on linux first and get to windows later. Also linux is an open book, understanding how it work will help you understand how a computer works.
0	1526908084	1	Thanks yall good info , I wanted to ask too but yall know everyone is busy and mean nowadays thank yall again
0	1526908765	1	Good question, well in blockchain you really have so many opportunity to be a developer, cause you sounded like you wanted to
0	1526908916	1	Work on a crypto project. Either contribute to one that speaks to you, Invent a personalized “hello world” for your simple ICO launch, build some sample smart contacts to do something novel. Just some thoughts. 
0	1526909011	1	The best thing you can do is try to understand how the technology works, not trying to rely on anyone but your own knowdlege and intelligence.This also means not only reading the whitepapers but also understanding the technology behind it. And not just that but also the economical weaknesses and strengths beside that.This is a really really exhausting task in itself. On one hand this ecosystem is indeed plagued by a lot of malicious actors (I'll not just call them ICOs because that would be wrong, e.g. Dash)  on the other hand this space is still in its babyshoes and faces many issues that are hardly desribed by a few words alone (or better said simplified).The thing is that there are many that do not even want to understand a jackshit about the technology, yet are only here to get rich. The worst kind you'll face are highly skilled, well educated persons and traditional companies that either do not take this all serious or even willingly put this space down with their opinions just as much as these guys only set out for getting rich.That also includes many security researchers and highly "respected" universities. Since many of those are against the idea of "free knowledge".An good example of that would be Hashgraph, if you want to research it yourself.Let me summarize it for my example here - (which you should basically ignore as well after digging in yourself).Hashgraph is not Open-Source. It has to be licensed and is being used by big conglomerates to strengthen their positions instead of trying to improve the ecosystem that start this all (well they do, but just for themselves - $$$).Their intentions are the same - to protect their money and their knowdlege. Their positions they do not want to give away. This ecosystem is challenging these hiveminds of restriction greatly, its like fossil fuel vs. electric cars / alternative energy.All that said move with open eyes. The more someone tries to make you judge pre-emptive without backing their points making you judge by their opinion alone (not matter their background) the more careful you should be.TLDR: Let me give you two resources to get started (be aware all of this can be visited by the malicious actors as well so keep that in mind if you fall back to juging by opinion based posts that will often pop-up)./r/cryptotechnologyand Nebulas, if you want an easy platform to dive in to start developing. An DApp since I believe the overall package is just right (how they take on things, just as much as chosing an beginner-friendly language like JS/TS for their approach).Keep in mind, always do your own research.(and start hacking around).Thats the way to start. It will keep you busy for the rest of your life (or not).Cheers!
0	1526909387	1	Learn Python, Java or some other programming language, and learn how to work with a Blockchain. Getting to know Hyperledger is not bad, either. 
0	1526909432	1	Hi man, as someone who just decided to become full-time blockchain developer I can vouch for the free courses on Blockgeeks as a good starting point. Other than that I'd fool around with solidity and smart contracts. Here is a post by someone else giving advice on exactly this: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7zlvge/the_path_to_become_a_blockchain_developer/ It's a great post 100% read it.

0	1526910907	1	There are a lot of free ressources online. Check out Solidity and start playing around with smart contracts on ethereum testnet - that's what I do.
0	1526911990	1	If you are good at coding try holo. It's already in alpha and free to download. You dont need special coding skills for blockchain its java based
0	1526912294	1	Learn JavaScript for sure. 
0	1526912833	1	Pick up coding skills.Depends on what you want to focus on, If you're interested in actual blockchain, then you will need to understand a bit more on the logic in terms of smart contracts and how those functions work, or if youa re building different channels or processing modules, then backend related coding skills, API building etc, will be needed.If you are looking at building website frontend, then, you don;t really need to know blockchain. That's web development skills. Again, it's different if you're building the front end, vs the back end \(engines\).
0	1526912947	1	I've been watching these free crypto lectures as I have time.  Knowledge is power, soak as much up as you can until you have the coding skills to start doing some freelance to build up your work experience. https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7il6rx/sixty_free_lectures_from_princeton_on_bitcoin_on/
0	1526915456	1	Find a project with a real world use. Think of something blockchain could significantly improve. That's step zero. Too many cryptocurrencies which are "fast, anonymous and safe". This was recycled a million times and is still being over abused.

0	1526917485	1	Now this is the kind of threads that should be all over the crypto space. Conversations about how to get involved. I am in the air national guard here in Alaska and have been interested in cyber surety but since discovering crypto I’ve been leaning towards getting into IT. These are definitely exciting times with so many opportunities. I wish everyone good luck! 
0	1526917762	1	As a graduate from a certain Manitoban college tech program: ***Skip it.*** They're going to teach you only what the local businesses want them to teach you. While it'll all be vaguely relevant, you're much better off putting a laser focus on the specific skills you want, going to Hackathons, publishing open source code.Get on Coursera or EdX or Udemy and learn some basic programming skills. I'd highly recommend learning Javascript \(the language first, then Angular or React\) and Python as your first languages. The two of them will let you accomplish pretty much anything in the modern dev space. Once you feel comfortable reading and writing basic apps, head over to /r/ethdev and check out some of the learning resources they've dug up. If you need money as a motivator, check out Gitcoin. They do bounties paid in Ether. It's all Ethereum\-based stuff, but it's a great place to start. **TL;DR**: Skip college unless you've got the money and want to try out a multitude of roles before settling on one. Focus on your interest and start building ***ASAP***.

0	1526920386	1	While this isn't blockchain specific, I think this [github link](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#prerequisites) is really valuable. Its a collection of open source educational material that comprises a fairly robust computer science curriculum. All free material, most of which is from accredited universities. Also, learning how to code in Solidity is in very high demand in the blockchain space. I've been learning from some people on youtube. Here's a good [start](https://youtu.be/v_hU0jPtLto). 
0	1526920709	1	Here is a decent curriculum by a youtuber: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVVGv2bmxow
0	1526922117	1	Focus on how to create a 100% decentralized crypto exchange.
0	1526922143	1	Python is always useful. It's certainly not all encompassing but it's great for starters and there's an enormous demand for it.  
0	1526925387	1	The only thing I would say is at 21, realize you'll be competing with people who have been coding since they were 5 yrs old. Not saying you shouldn't do it, and there are plenty who start later in life like yourself. Just letting you know what type of people you will be competing with for jobs. 
0	1526926501	1	If you're not already a geek and into programming/computers then find something else.  Tech is not hold your hand friendly and simply getting  a degree wont be enough if you never self started on your own.
0	1526926832	1	dapps are the new apps, come build them with us at [decent](https://decentcrypto.com) 
0	1526927803	1	What do YOU think blockchain is?  Why do you want to get involved with blockchain technology specifically?  
0	1526928532	1	Pick a project, look for one with a friendly developer community that will help you get off the ground, and start building. Easy to say, hard to do, but you _can_ do it.Where I would get started, if I was getting getting started (this is based entirely only my own limited exploration of the scene): - Blockstack is making a platform for distributed apps and providing a lot of developer support. Looks like an interesting way to be a dapp pioneer. They run a "community rewards program" with bounties for both technical and non-technical work that you should look up.- Stellar runs quarterly Stellar Build Challenges ("SBCs") and just today announced the summer challenge, SBC7. The deadline is in August, so you've got time to come up with an idea and work on it. Full disclosure, I participated in and was awarded some lumens to support my project in SBC6. Great community.- Similarly, there's a handful of ethereum challenges/hackathons/bounties out there - google 'em, they might give you an idea of the sorts of projects people are looking for and rewards that are out there as incentives for doing so.Personally, I find it a lot easier to motivate myself if I'm working towards something concrete like a deadline or specific goal - that's why I'm suggesting challenges/hackathons. Do some work, win or lose, and then you may be able to parley your experience ("real experience" - really) working on your project into a full-time job with a team working with similar tech. Teams are hungry for devs that know their platforms.
0	1526929301	1	I don't know specifically about blockchain (I am thinking of getting into it myself, though I am older than you), but programming generally needs lots of patience and practice. It is one of those professions where you can compete with the best and get paid well and do interesting work, if you put in the effort (mostly, there are still companies that look for degrees from ivy league schools, but those are in the minority). Also, look around and make sure programming is what you want to do - this is such a new field, that there is demand for all kinds of people (though programmers will always be in demand). You could become a teacher, evangelist, marketer, product designer, business guy etc.If you can get some degree, do it. For day-to-day job  purposes, degrees are useless in programming, but they are very useful while applying for visas etc if you ever decide to work in some other part of the world.
0	1526929903	1	Provincial? Where are you based? 
0	1526930574	1	Well, learn the basics of computer science, data structures, and algorithms.At a high level, blockchain is a simple data structure known as a singly linked list. There's more to it than that, but it's good to be able to reduce problems down to their elementary data structures. You'll soon find out that a lot of the newest and buzziest stuff is just an implementation or derivation of concepts that have existed for a long time. 
0	1526931129	1	Go to meetups and network.
0	1526934060	1	Make "when moon" balloons and tshirts. 
0	1526934376	1	If my market was not saturated with people in my area doing it I would but simply be a "tech liaison" for business that want to get into crypto.All you do is help people understand and set up their coinbase commerce for a small fee like 0.05% or a maintenance fee to do check ups on people. I think of it like being a "google translate"  for this technology and help people out of the loop with questions and concerns about this technology.The biggest thing I hear is misunderstanding of how wallets works, sending coins , and storing them. Having a physical representative to talk to about this will ease people into holding large sums of money.Essentially like a teller at a bank to help people understand how and why certain things are done within the bank.
0	1526934558	1	If you go the programming route look into functional programming. It's a more secure way to program that should be useful for high value blockchains and smart contracts.

0	1526907415	0	I would suggest /r/cryptotechnology Start with any programming languages to get a handle. Python is probably by far the most common one you see or hear about in the broad scheme. Also I know Ethereum has some things written in it, as well as NEO and others. For specific Blockchain I believe C+ and Java are the most common. Solidity is probably a big one but I doubt it would be good to start on.
