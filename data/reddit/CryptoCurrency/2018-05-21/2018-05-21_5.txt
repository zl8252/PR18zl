2	1526928279	3	Employee-less store but seems easy to steal from. This thread is suggesting everything be set up in such a way that you're automatically charged money for things you take. 
2	1526911016	3	You do realise Waltonchain is building on top of this? Look at those RFID chips. And no blockchain component.
0	1526900965	13	Nice!!! 
0	1526892282	25	Magnificent! 
0	1526898168	32	>Xiamen Municipal Development and Reform Commission is an administrative department under the **Xiamen City Government**. Its operation is guided by the **National Development and Reform Commission of China**. The main responsibilities are the implementation and co-ordination of economic policies, the study of local economic and social development policies, the **implementation of macroeconomic control at the provincial level**, and comprehensive coordination of economic and social development. These specifically include the **implementation of national and provincial laws and regulations, strategic guidelines and policies on national economic and social development**, economic system reformation and openness to the foreign market. The Commission supervises the overall economic and social development of the city, **implementing national and provincial industrial policies and coordinating major issues of industrial development.**#National government. 
1	1526913626	2	Just to clarify, I believe it is saying that Xiamen Municipal Development and Reform Commission, a department of the Xiamen City Government, works to implement national and provincial laws, regulations, and policies within its province.  This is guided by the National Development and Reform Commission of China.  I would say this is equivalent to a state or city government entity, like an economic council or development center, that works to implement initiatives and programs mandated by the federal government. Pretty cool connection and just another piece of evidence that this crypto project is very connected to the local, provincial, and even national government of China.  
2	1526923866	1	Gonna have to agree with your interpretation here. I'm a big fan of the Walton project but I've noticed a little stretching of the facts from some community members lately
0	1526905100	18	National goverment interested about Waltonchain tech. NICE! 
0	1526895677	14	Its going to be a big month ahead! 
0	1526897294	17	The leader of IoT blockchain doing his thing
0	1526904707	11	I'm bullish AF with this project. It's just flying under the radar. Big things ahead for Waltonchain.
0	1526900729	18	Sounds like W a l t o n c h a i n is starting to unleash the marketing beast!
0	1526909475	10	Unashamedly copy/pastaing old comments!When people realize...Physical working product - RFIDMany legit use casesCorporate/Government partnershipsOn schedule road mapMain.net launch successful10 confirmed child chainsGMN holders just got the biggest reward (current $$$ value wise) in crypto history Mother fucking ALIBABA!
1	1526916791	4	TFW the coin you laughed at all winter explodes to the top 10...
0	1526898155	5	Whats gonna happen to all the jobs when IoT and new technologies get adopted? Mass unemployment into revolution into government reform? Nothing related to waltonchain 
1	1526900307	13	“Destroyer of jobs, creator of better ones”- vitalik buterin 
1	1526899004	10	Minimum wage jobs adjust to the new economy. Always do. Entry-level coding will be the new "do you want fries with that?" type of job.
1	1526898293	10	Don't mention Waltonchain bro, you will get this post downvoted... 
1	1526898327	6	the same what happened in the past with the industry revolution. Some jobs disappear but new jobs get created.
2	1526900385	5	no, that's not really what's happening. the industrial revolution you talk of opened up a whole new field that is the service sector, catering to billions of workers, plus we have gigantic labour-intensive sectors like logistics, supply chains and stuff like that. now tell me what a similarly new avenue is in times of accelerating automation of these huge sectors? well there are NONE. nada. the only thing that springs to mind is, uhm, being an influencer on social-media or sumshit like that. hence why we're talking about unconditional basic income.
1	1526915085	1	If history is any guide, this will open up many more jobs.
0	1526911422	2	Do you feel the marketing. 😁
0	1526906260	1	Sounds like this could use some insurance....AIX
0	1526920353	1	>smart
0	1526903748	0	Unfortunately retail customers are wild animals who treat stores like training grounds for a mass looting. There is no "solution" for their insanity. 
1	1526903849	8	I guess one solution could be a security guard and alarms triggered by RFID tags. Actually seems v solveable
1	1526923833	1	Chinas Social Credit System May be a cure for it. 
0	1526903146	-9	Amazon already has unmanned stores. Doesn’t need Blockchain either.... 
1	1526903920	9	...but it's better to have blockchain and other companies are allowed to do things better than Amazon.. or do we just stop there. Also - this is china
2	1526904458	-6	You write like a non-American, Chinese person. How WTC better in any way, shape, or form? Amazon stores can detect when items leave the shelf, items are sent to your “shopping cart” in-app when picked up, and then you’re charged automatically when you walk out. You sound incredibly uniformed, just saying it’s better because “Blockchain”..
3	1526905806	7	Right fine. It doesn't rely on cameras so there's a lot you can do with it. I.e. the smart mirrors. (I assume you didn't read the article).Blockchain is a more authenticated and unchangeable method of data storage. It's why we are here and interested in blockchain. Having receipts of clothes purchases on the blockchain is very useful. It could remove the requirement for receipts (again this couldn't be done by Amazon). Also with a link to the supply chain, you can confirm the authenticity of the product and information about it that you may not have been privvy to before. I'm not a fan of people in crypto that continually question why things should be on blockchain without thinking about the  practical benefits of blockchain. You're the type of people that didn't get a smart phone for ages because texting was just fine. Why are you even here at the beginning of another technological revolution? It makes no sense to me.Lastly stop being such a rude dick. You'll be happier.
4	1526906575	-6	> Having receipts of clothes purchases on the blockchain is very useful. It could remove the requirement for receipts (again this couldn't be done by Amazon). Um... you think Amazon is handing out paper receipts? Emails are linked to an application.. you get a receipt via email upon checkout. > Also with a link to the supply chain, you can confirm the authenticity of the product and information about it that you may not have been privvy to before. I’m not sure how necessary this is for every product. > I'm not a fan of people in crypto that continually question why things should be on blockchain without thinking about the  practical benefits of blockchain. You're the type of people that didn't get a smart phone for ages because texting was just fine - so why are you even here at the beginning of another technological revolution. It makes no sense to me.I’m sick of noobies being so goddamn sensitive and overly enthusiastic. I got into eth because of smart contracts. I stayed in crypto because Blockchain check. I think supply chain use cases have potential.. I’m just merely pointing out Amazon already has this tech for **cashier-less stores**. Sorry to have broken the echo chamber. 
5	1526907441	2	Are you Acrimony?
6	1526907742	2	Is that a person, place, or thing? 
7	1526908072	1	Person - you just write in the same style and i haven't seen him about. Sorry if I offended you with my "noobish" comments about Blockchain and my Chinese writing style. I do also think that smart contracts are great. Waltonchain are implementing them also didn't you know? Which will be work particularly well with RFID chips.
8	1526909648	3	Ah gotchya. Yeah, not me. I do have an alt account which I used for DNM vendor/product reviews lol, but haven’t used it in years. Pretty much mobile only now.. so I don’t got time to log in/out of accounts. Sorry if I offended you as well. I didn’t initially comment here with those intentions. I quickly became overwhelmed by the WTC crowd brushing off Amazon’s progress and trying to sell me on WTC tech. Hence my attitude turned sour there..Amazon is pretty far ahead in this, but who knows, maybe they are doing it inefficiently. Maybe Blockchain tech like that in WTC ecosystem will prove more efficient than Amazon’s tech. I wasn’t trying to say Amazon is doing it right or wrong - was just pointing out they’re already doing this in live stores, and they aren’t using Blockchain. I’m well aware of what WTC is developing, and look forward to seeing if they can develop a better system than Amazon. I’m just remaining an objective observer. 
9	1526911935	2	Don't think you're well aware enough on what WTC is developing. 😂 
5	1526918663	1	I get your point with Amazon. However even if it is better, the fact is, it's only for *Amazon*. Their system is not tailored for other stores, unlike Walton's which is made specifically to be drag and dropped into existing stores. You can argue which is better or worse, but the point is, there is no commercial solution out right now, and Walton is looking to be the one to solve it (in the eastern world atleast).
5	1526906842	1	downvoted because you didn't even try to understand the points made... e.g. it's not about having receipts in paper form, it's about being able to return an item without having to proof that you bought it at that particular store!
3	1526905265	3	Amazon uses cameras, which seems incredibly sub-optimal compared to next-gen RFID chips. The blockchain adds huge value for the data that is gathered, since it is trustworthy and therefore can be shared and decimated autonomously accross the entire retail industry for AI, data analytics, etc..
4	1526910018	2	This 100&#37; plus it costs so much to implement all those cameras and such where as WTC's solution only costs a fraction of the price of Amazons to implement. Its clear you haven't done your research schizocat
3	1526923786	1	Are only Americans allowed to comment here?  Get off your fucking high horse.
1	1526904756	4	And Amazon sell counterfeit goods without knowing it. They also spend millions on stocktake, they lose millions on lost goods, staff costs are high and the list goes on. Bring in blockchain!
1	1526913694	1	WTC's solution for the unmaned store costs way less than amazon's and is overall better for analytics. Do some research next time. 
1	1526924075	1	yeah, and their solution is ridiculously primitive.you think installing thousands of cameras in a single store is cost effective?
2	1526926169	1	Amazon uses cameras and machine learning.. I’d hardly call that primitive. The whole system within the store is far from primitive... You think implementing Blockchain and rfid sensors / chips will be any more cost efficient? Do we even know the relative costs a system like this would run a company, or are you just spewing random “facts” based off nothing? 
3	1526926780	1	i do think implementing RFID chips into products coming out of warehouses will be more cost effective than installing THOUSANDS of cameras into one physical location for one physical store - yes. what business is going to outlay that cost into someone else's  property?
1	1526904732	0	There's a whole supply chain that gets the product to the retail store.  One of the leading use case for blockchain.  You probably shouldn't tout yourself as a blockchain enthusiast if you don't get this.
2	1526906008	-1	No need to be a bitter shill. The supply chain use case isn’t necessary for a cashier-less stores. 
3	1526916292	1	Uh..ok
3	1526925417	1	nah, hes right.its not necessary...businesses can go down the path amazon did and install thousands of cameras.they just better hope that after spending all that money on infrastructure for the store they dont get evicted, or, the rent goes up to an un-affordable price, or, their sales dont match the outlay costs ,or, well you get the point.i mean RFID chips embedded in packaging combined with RFID scanners at the door certainly are not necessary and there is alternatives to this particular solution... i guess time will tell which solution business will adopt. an intricate network of thousands of cameras that will only work in one physical location, or , RFID chips embedded into packaging that will work anywhere you install some RFID scanners.one of these solutions solve only a very specific problem (cashier-less stores) and the other solves this exact problem as well as others (supply chain solutions)  
1	1526910041	0	"We already have USD. We don't need Bitcoin..."
2	1526911043	2	I did phrase it poorly, but I didn’t say Blockchain wasn’t a solution. Just wasn’t necessary for Amazon to develop their system. 
3	1526913064	2	Not necessary, true. They are using weight sensors, cameras, rfid sensors and facial recognition to determine if something was taken, what was taken, where it was taken from and who took it. It's a very fancy and complicated system to find out what item should be billed to which person, but not safe from double-entries or theft.Blockchain with it's unique hash-codes for every item ensures that each item can be billed only once, provides merchants with instant tamperproof live-inventory and connects each individual item to the corresponding wallet with higher security at much lower cost.Yeah, you don't need it.. but it sure makes your life as a merchant easier.. .and you pay less in the process.
0	1526900631	-11	I hate going to stores with not enough people to help. I definitely would not shop there.
1	1526900780	12	nobody cares 
2	1526900787	6	Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care.
3	1526927281	1	lol, i love this bot
1	1526902966	6	Whenever you can't find an employee to help you in a clothing store, it may be because that employee is  * searching for picked-through items needing to be refolded  * hunting in the back for a particular size/color that was mistakenly not restocked earlier  * working the cash registers due to a sudden flood of customersPlatforms like WTC can improve or even eliminate these scenarios for many businesses, and actually increase the availability of employees to assist customers.
1	1526912192	1	Employees hate people going to stores expecting there's people to help. They definitely would not want you there. 
0	1526917997	-1	This would never work in the United States, stealing would run rampant.
1	1526924616	1	amazon already has a working pilot of unmanned stores in seattle... their solution, however, is ridiculously primitive and certainly not cost effective beyond their prototype store. good luck implementing this with thousands of cameras if your business doesnt own the property - if you ask the landlord really nicely perhaps they will pay for the installation? lolhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbumR6Bhd8the future is coming whether you agree or not
0	1526906804	-5	Im more into other blockchains like CS  have distributed, decentralized storage and open source code. Support for public and private networks.
