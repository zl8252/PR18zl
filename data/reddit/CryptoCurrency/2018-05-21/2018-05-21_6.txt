0	1526912552	31	Pretty bullish i think:  >"Hong Kong is the third largest financial center in the world. The summit was held here and brought together a number of heavyweight quantitative asset trading experts, hedge fund and investment industry giants and a number of financial community celebrities from Hong Kong."  
0	1526913056	39	>*" Waltonchain CSO Welson Wong said: “The market capital of Waltonchain is  not yet ranked first in the global blockchain \+ IoT market rankings,  because our team unanimously focuses on the development, innovation and  application of the underlying blockchain technology. There are many  users who still do not really understand our value. We firmly believe  that in the future when more and more people realize that Waltonchain  will combine the RFID chip and blockchain technologies with its own  strong combination of hardware and software, and will provide the world  with the only and most complete solution in the blockchain \+ IoT field  together with its global trusted digital ecosystem, Waltoncoin will  become the world’s top four cryptocurrency!”*
1	1526914036	24	Reading that gave me a gigantic shit-eating grin from ear to ear. I love when they confidently state they will be top 4 :)
1	1526913328	13	He really said that? Shots fired... hopefully not in waltons knee.
2	1526918578	-24	>The market capital of Waltonchain is not yet ranked first in the global blockchain + IoT market rankings, because our team unanimously focuses on the development, innovation and application of the underlying blockchain technology.almost looks like a shot at VEN, not smart on Walton's part at all. Let your tech speak for itself, don't come up with excuses for why you're in second place...edit: given the hostility between children on both sides, this was probably the dumbest comment I could have made, ever.
3	1526919952	26	How is that at all a shot at VEN? Tired of people needlessly  pushing crypto-drama...
4	1526920202	-11	>The market capital of Waltonchain is not yet ranked first in the global blockchain + IoT market rankings, because our team unanimously focuses on the development= "we are not #1 because we focus on our technology" implying that the current #1 does not. I'm not trying to push any drama...ninja edit: for those who don't understand, this is how shade is thrown professionally. You can't openly bash another project, but you *can* passive-aggressively make it sound like you do something better. Like when Vitalik the other day "helped" the EOS team, but in reality he was telling them their methods won't work.
5	1526920470	12	Certainly does not imply that at all.
6	1526928044	2	He most definitely worded this in a way that can be taken as a bash to VEN. Whether he intended to, only he knows. Mr. burglar is right to have his own take on this. 
6	1526920598	-5	Okay, well if that's your take on it, that's that, nothing wrong with it. Not everyone is going to see something the exact same way.
5	1526923250	2	You are pushing drama, by describing VEN as number 1 as if its a foregone conclusion. I dont think VEN is number 1, I think WTC is number 1, and I even hold VEN :)
6	1526923725	3	>by describing VEN as number 1 as if its a foregone conclusion. Larger market cap, more adoption. I wasn't saying it as an attempt to piss off WTC holders, it's just what I took his words as. Curious as to why you would think one is "number 1" over the other though..
7	1526924219	2	Because I sincerely think they have an edge with the technology. Current mcaps are not a factor for me, because Tron and Litecoin are ahead of VeChain, should they be? absolutely not. VeChain is destined for great things and I have a good VEN position, but today I think Walton's tech is a little better, primarily as they manufacturing their own hardware. The jury is still out on which one has greater adoption today, its too early to tell.
8	1526925725	3	i have something better for you: honesty. I have read the code of neither VEN nor WTC. because "drumrolls" i cannot read code. So here i am, hoping my ball is in the end more colourful the the next kid's. I dont want to imply anything here. Maybe you read the codebase of both, maybe you didn't as they are close source, but who knows. You may have access to information i do not. In case i am wrong and you are in fact just as clueless as i am, chill out and stick to the colourful ball analogy. Just know, that all you do is polish your ankerbias of whatever it is that stroked your sexies.EDIT: this is purely about the "WTC has better tech" sentence. nothing else
9	1526927534	1	>I have read the code of neither VEN nor WTC. because "drumrolls" i cannot read code.there's actually no code for either project that we as the public can view, VeChain's will be available to the public next month, Walton's will be available one day they claim.
8	1526924502	1	>but today I think Walton's tech is a little betterTheir hardware IS better. If comparing VeChain and Walton's hardware means anything, then Walton would win of course, I mean a chip that doubles as a node is innovative as fuck. Comparing their hardware means nothing though, both have exactly what they need to do what they plan. primarily as they manufacturing their own hardware.>but today I think Walton's tech is a little better, primarily as they manufacturing their own hardware.To be fair, VeChain could buy out a manufacturer too and "manufacture their own hardware". People put too much weight on that part. It's not like Walton build their process from scratch
3	1526920002	18	I hold both VEN/WTC but you're always in Walton threads bringing up VEN. VEN wasn't mentioned anywhere in these comments or article.Take your speculation elsewhere. 
4	1526920116	0	> but you're always in Walton threads bringing up VEN.Not that I bother to keep track but this is probably the first time i've done so for May.>VEN wasn't mentioned anywhere in these comments or article.I never said it was, re-read the thread...
5	1526927674	5	I'm not here to argue bud. I was just stating my opinion that I see you in a good bit of the Walton threads and daily discussion as well on the subreddit.The reason I said something to you is because I knew it would turn out in a big back and forth between Ven/Wtc in here because of your comment. I wasn't trying to be an ass. I apologize if I came off that way.
6	1526928922	1	I also apologize if I came off as an ass, I never intended for a VEN/WTC thing, I just legitimately took the statement as some sort of jab at VeChain. I realize now that I shouldn't have commented about it, since the resulting hate should have been obvious.
7	1526931274	4	Yah man. you may not have said anything about Walton in the last two weeks, but you are definitely known and recognized "poster of VEN in WTC threads" kinda guy. I don't mean that disparagingly per se, just saying that your reputation precedes you.
8	1526936871	1	>but you are definitely known and recognized "poster of VEN in WTC threads" kinda guy. cool, don't really care if a couple people think I do that, considering I don't.
5	1526923111	3	That's cause May has been a slow month.  You're literally in every WTC thread in this sub.
6	1526923663	0	Considering I hold WTC I think that it's acceptable for me to be in some WTC threads, but "You're literally in every WTC thread in this sub" is just plain wrong. 
7	1526923915	0	Nope, you're like the only reddit name I have recognized cause of how often you come to FUD WTC.  Idgaf if you hold WTC cause you obviously hold more VEN and praise it every chance possible while fudding WTC as much as you can.
8	1526924352	2	Notice how he didn't say anything about Sunny throwing shade at their latest meet up in NYC. Only Walton. even though it wasn't even aimed at them. Bias is showing
9	1526927455	2	What shade was thrown in the meetup? Actually asking.
8	1526924549	1	>Idgaf if you hold WTC cause you obviously hold more VEN and praise it every chance possible while fudding WTC as much as you can.Show me where I praise VeChain and "fud" Walton here please>Nope, you're like the only reddit name I have recognized cause of how often you come to FUD WTC. Yes i'm aware that Walton holders have started this thing where they think i'm some "Walton fudster". I really don't care, I just ignore them at this point, if they want to think I have some personal vendetta against WTC, it doesn't affect me. I'll continue to say what I want. 
9	1526924885	-2	I'm not going to look through your whole giant comment history to find every bit of evidence but the recent one of "printing this fucker out, making it a book" of the Vechain white paper makes it pretty fucking clear.
4	1526929694	0	When the CSO compares WTC's position to other IoT+Blockchain coins and says it is not yet ranked first but will be, then he is obviously comparing WTC to the IoT+Blockchain coins currently ranked above WTC.  To say VEN wasn't mentioned is disingenuous.  VEN wasn't mentioned *by name* but VEN, along with any other higher ranked IoT+Blockchain coins (IOTA?), *was* brought up.And that's ignoring the fact that the supposed comparison between WTC's tech focus and VEN's marketing has often been a talking point for WTC maximalists.  The CSO's comments were not content free.  There was meaning and direction to what he said.
3	1526920163	9	This is crypto. White papers and empty promises get billions. Tech != price. Walton is first in many areas and metrics. Don't try to stir up things between VEN and WTC. VEN wasn't even mentioned. 
4	1526920240	-3	I'm not trying to stir anything up, I wouldn't have made that comment if I knew people would get so angry at seeing VEN mentioned...
3	1526930240	3	The Waltonchain team does not give a fuck about the petty internet war between VEN and WTC that shouldn't even exist...
3	1526920737	3	More like him admitting that people have not understood the real value of WTC which he belives should be a top IoT crypto because of not having marketed it enough. It in no way implies that the #1 has marketed more or does not have the tech.
4	1526920896	0	>More like him admitting that people have not understood the real value of WTC which he belives should be a top IoT crypto because of not having marketed it enough.yes, he says this too, my comment was really only directed at the first part. If some people don't feel i'm right that's fine, I was just pointing out that *to me*, the way he worded the start was specifically his way of saying multiple things with one sentence.
3	1526933951	1	Maybe the "who's Walton?"comment by Sunny has triggered them into showing them who's boss.
1	1526915628	-21	You know anyone's RFID tags can be attached to a dozen or so chains... With it being a top 4 crypto, it will have a market value of more than every RFID manufacturer currently in the world.
2	1526917282	25	Hey, actually this isn't true at all.The existing RFID chip industry cannot meet the development of IoT applications for the following reasons:* There are few options available while the prices are high* The transmission power and stability need to be improved* The reception sensitivity is low* The anti-interference ability is poor and the transmission power is low* The existing RFID ICs have many problems such as high power consumption, poor matching with antennae, and difficult system integration, etc. **Waltonchain's IC design has the following advantages:*** **High security:** The chip integrates asymmetric random password pair generation logic, uses a core asymmetric encryption algorithm with independent intellectual property rights, and an optimized design without increasing the cost and power consumption of the chip, enabling higher communication security* **Tamper-resistant:** A dedicated storage space is integrated into the tag chip for the storage of hash value of tag status and key information* **Optimized anti-collision design:** The chip uses a binary tree anti-collision algorithm with independent intellectual property rights and a time division multiple access design, significantly improving the tag recognition success rate and the number of identifiable labels at the same time* **High sensitivity:** The chip uses an optimized noise suppression technology to improve the noise figure at the receiving end and the overall receiver sensitivity, which plays an important role in increasing the recognition success rate* **Good compatibility:** The chip can achieve high-frequency and ultra-high frequency functions at the same time, so the end customer can read the information through their smart phone and inquire about reliable product information* **Long lasting:** The chip adopts a low voltage and low power-consumption design, allowing the chip to last more than 20 years  
3	1526917548	7	TLM, you’re knowledge with regards to what WaltonChain is doing, never ceases to amaze me! 👍
4	1526919905	-6	to be fair anyone can copy stuff from a whitepaper, doesn't mean they have extensive knowledge on the topic (idk this guy though, he could for all I know)
5	1526931513	5	Lol. You clearly don't give a rats ass about Walton yet you claim to hold Walton. I'm calling you out. If you knew anything about Walton or the community you would know that /u/thelatemercutio is one of THE most educated investors in the community and has done great work to publish information for the broader investment community. If you don't know TLM, you don't know WTC.
6	1526936791	1	>Lol. You clearly don't give a rats ass about Walton yet you claim to hold Walton. I'm calling you out. If you knew anything about Walton or the community you would know that /u/thelatemercutio is one of THE most educated investors in the communityso you're calling me out because I don't follow the walton community? I hold IOTA, I can't name anyone that knows their shit here on reddit about it, does that mean i'm against it?.>If you don't know TLM, you don't know WTC.I'd love to poll every single WTC holder and ask if they know who he is. Apparently you have to know who he is to invest in walton
5	1526930431	6	TLM knows more about Waltonchain than any other investor. I'm pretty confident about that. He wrote the All-In-One Thread.
3	1526919019	-17	You can take that copy and paste job back to their marketing team.
4	1526922995	10	It explains clearly why you're wrong and that's the best reply you can come up with? Guess he just destroyed your claims.
5	1526931752	-4	If you really think those things are only available for Walton, then you are only fooling yourself.
6	1526932653	4	> *anyone's* RFID tags can be attached to...evolves into>If you really think those things are *only* available for Walton...You've now moved the goalposts considerably.
6	1526933828	1	You got thoroughly dummied, best to move on silently.
4	1526919218	16	I never claimed it wasn't copy and paste?It's directly from their whitepaper. I figured that much was obvious. Also, who cares about their marketing team? Lol. They're nailing govt partnerships left and right. They're going to be a top coin whether you like it or not. So keep laughing at their marketing and miss out. Idc. 
2	1526918715	8	Walton’s advances RFIDs are patented.
3	1526931766	1	And there are hundreds of other RFID patents.
0	1526912979	22	people are starting to realize...
1	1526923403	5	How did they not realise before? The info is plainly available with minimal digging.
0	1526912436	18	🚀
1	1526912472	22	Waltonchain is the SpaceX of Cryptocurrency 
2	1526915540	13	Bleeding money from every pore?
3	1526916616	17	SpaceX is not bleeding money, Tesla is ;) 
4	1526916846	17	You're right. I stand corrected. Swung and missed.  
5	1526920458	5	Relevant username? Appreciate the levelheadedness, the cryptosphere needs more people that can stand being corrected occasionally
6	1526921179	1	Purely in my own interest. The market doesn't care if you feel you're correct about something.   
7	1526928883	0	[deleted]
8	1526928943	1	I'm not sure. Ask r/raimimemes
2	1526930872	-2	HAHAHAHAHA what a fucking stupid comment, holy shit.
0	1526923366	14	Congrats! Go Waltonchain!\-VEN guy
0	1526915037	13	Much of the Institutional money coming will invest in projects with real life usage. You can bet Waltonchain will be near the top of that list.  Bargain bargain price for WTC right now. Wouldn't be surprised to see it go on a bull run very soon.
0	1526913292	16	but was the relationship confirmed by Huobi?
1	1526914134	42	Well, it was at Huobis summit on Huobis stage that Huobi gave them a Huobi Business School consultant - diploma.
2	1526914650	16	I was kidding - that was the joke.  
0	1526913855	3	Can one buy WTC on Huobi?
1	1526916031	13	Likely waiting for token swap
0	1526915353	2	Love this!!! 
0	1526917923	4	Walton wont announce anything before token swap imo. This is not another coin with huge promises and not working product 
0	1526916557	3	+rep to my comment historyREAL WORLD WORKING PRODUCT BOUT TO BTFO THE TOP 25
1	1526918847	0	Gotta crack the top 50 first...
0	1526936880	1	Can someone please explain this to me? Wtc is the advisor for huobis team/“business school” that looks at blockchain tech? I’ll freely admit I’m a ven boy but I don’t want to just shit on wtc if this is legit good news
0	1526926342	1	Btw, any news on the token swap? I can never find good info on it.
1	1526928840	3	Not that I am aware, I hope token swap occuers this month, but it's not 100% certain
0	1526916065	-3	Did Huobi confirm it yet though?
0	1526936344	0	StoreofValue gotta be mad salty about this.
0	1526912947	-21	Huobi Business School, so close to Hobo business school...
1	1526923199	5	What even is this lame attempt to FUD?
