0	1526871209	11	Co CEO Mike also just announced today that one of their "3 largest financial partnerships" is going to be a TOP 20 BANK! And that's top 20 in the world, not just the country. This is going to be the next Ripple. Insane potential. So glad they didn't have an ICO :)
1	1526871249	6	Awesome glad to be a part of history!
2	1526902971	3	I do not understand what you're talking about, why is there [https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Main\_Page](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page) no information about the Hydro?
3	1526934746	1	That's the history of bitcoin.That's why.
1	1526878313	0	"I'd love to see Hydro DUMP, fair price is 60 sat"  .. said a user from mercatox Because it's been unfairly pumping for the last few days and now the pump has lost fuel
2	1526885659	6	Not sure anything from the Mercatox trollbox is worth quoting. Moreover, the real ‚Äòearly‚Äô people that got into Hydro were in around 5-10 sats (and from what I can tell there weren‚Äôt that many). that‚Äôs roughly a 10-20x from here and can be explained easily because they didn‚Äôt have an ICO. Comparing a justified pump like that to the pumps pretty much every coin saw late last year, doesn‚Äôt even pale in comparison.  The valuation for Hydro is still mega low considering the way the team are moving, the partners they‚Äôre on boarding, and the scope of their project.
3	1526887320	5	all this shilling made me get hold of someIt's still low mcap and so I thought why not .. I am holding it for 1 year anyway
4	1526934777	2	You won't regret it man. This token will surprise you.
4	1526887430	4	Cool, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Hop into the Telegram chat if you have any questions - happy to discuss ideas, concerns, anything. I‚Äôm pretty excited about Hydro as you can probably tell 
3	1526918934	1	Well, the *real* early people got into Hydro before the airdrop. 
3	1526933481	1	> the real ‚Äòearly‚Äô people that got into Hydro were in around 5-10 satsHas been my best decision in crypto thus far actually..glad to see some others who are looking at hydro for what it really is. I'm surprised at the lack of attention it's been getting, but I guess that also has to do with the minimal marketing the team has been doing..
2	1526881581	2	We already had our correction. The hydro journey has really barely just started. There's going to be a lot of movement coming up in the next few weeks.
1	1526884412	-4	Except their total supply is literally a meme 
2	1526885695	3	In what sense?
3	1526889460	1	11,111,111,111But I'm mostly joking, I'd just have preferred a nice rounded number 
4	1526889865	3	Ha, fair enough! 
0	1526879215	3	Where it is easiest to buy, IDEX ?
1	1526881681	1	Nah, easiest place to buy would be either coinex or mercatox imo. But all three work
0	1526871510	6	This token has so much potential in its app, its program, and its only in stage 1 of 4.  A bunch of large brand names like insurance companies and banks are already signing up for it. 
0	1526872979	6	That's called having a plan!
0	1526873347	6	Proud to be a part of a well planned project. Amazing potential and such low visibility. Keep going Team Hydro!!!
0	1526871580	7	This is huge, I can‚Äôt believe how cheap this coin is right now. It‚Äôs been confirmed that they‚Äôve signed a deal with a major (top 20) bank as well. 
0	1526877962	4	I signed up to Coinex (fuck Mercatox) a week ago to purchase Hydro. The fact that it's a real company with a working product and such a low market cap currently is what drew me in. I'm expecting pretty good things from Hydro. But obviously don't listen to the shills on this post, do your research and invest accordingly.
0	1526920983	2	One of the most solid projects and teams in Crypto at the moment. They are doing all the right things... I am expecting big things from Hydro. üöÄ
1	1526933525	1	As am I. Super hyped to have gotten in this early in its growth. Last week has been rocky but the coming months will be crazy
0	1526878636	6	nice shill.
1	1526881721	4	What else do you expect, how is anyone ever supposed to promote any sort of coin then? This sub would be dead without, what you call, "shilling"
1	1526892792	-2	You know what‚Äôs funny... there is a post about a ton of shilled coins and this happens to be up there at the same time. Do these pump and dump idiots never learn? There is another one for some shitcoin called ecc... I swear they picked the best day to coordinate their pumps. Roflcopter!
0	1526878059	2	So you are saying Hydro is not part of a 4chan pump and dump scheme ?
1	1526885271	5	This is the sad thing about biz. Every so often they pick up on a really good coin with potential and people then see it as a pump and dump. Yes, there are a lot of biz shitcoins. IMHO Hydro is far from one of those, even though they picked up on it before Reddit. The good news is that they‚Äôve laid off of it for now (and as such the 4chan hype cycle continues). I see it more as a HOLO type situation, where it gets its own legs when it‚Äôs put out there and grows despite biz‚Äôs sentiment towards it. And that‚Äôs when you know it‚Äôs not just another pump and dump.
2	1526933584	1	Totally agree, much more akin to what they did to HOLO, though I don't expect to see us on the downtrend as long as they have been.
1	1526878622	3	Check out the official telegram and ask about the bank as a client you'll see for your self. 
1	1526881643	2	lmao, Hydro has a significantly stronger project and team than Holo did. This coin is actually going to go places (Holo may as well, not putting it down). biz just got hyped on it because it started at 1 sat.
2	1526881974	2	judging by your comment you are looking for long term pump .. not short term goals. 
3	1526933626	1	Looking for both, actually, and so far I've succeeded. 
2	1526884436	-4	But their total supply is literally a meme, its all I see when I try research the project. 
3	1526885422	1	What are you talking about?
0	1526892900	-4	nice paid shills posting here. 
1	1526910215	3	I‚Äôm not ‚Äúpaid‚Äù but still posted positive comments. All I ask from you is to click the medium page above and try and give it an actual read. While you‚Äôre at it, look up the team members/ their experiences. I think you‚Äôll be in for a surprise:)
0	1526885277	-2	I studied this one and it‚Äôs quite interesting. I‚Äôm also bullish about Lamden TAU, the mainnet comes out in Q4. The best part of this project are the features like, atomic swaps, free transactions and a speed of 10k tx.
1	1526885641	1	Hydro has a smaller market cap, partnering with a top 20 bank, and has a much larger vision. I'd stick with Hydro...
0	1526888027	-3	Lamden‚Äôs offering some pretty hood features like Atomic swaps, free transactions and a speed of 10k tps.
1	1526933691	1	and Hydro has a smaller market cap, partnered with massive financial firms and a project that goes much deeper.
