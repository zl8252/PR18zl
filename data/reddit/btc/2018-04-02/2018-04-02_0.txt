1	1522618240	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSJS6mgqV64  ;-)
2	1522634220	5	Glad to see people are catching up, guess who has at least 30x more devs than any other crypto and is where the most value creation (product development) is happening? ... it was the first to abstract/generalize blockchain technology ... created by a genius 19 year old at the time ...
3	1522646457	9	Ethereum is an interesting project, but they are making a bet on Proof of Stake. No one knows if that will pan out. And they don't have a cap on total issuance.
4	1522681556	1	that's about to change 
4	1522682738	1	> This is interesting. Can you tell me your thoughts on why PoS won't pan out? 
3	1522653808	3	Etheteum is not ideal money.
4	1522662243	3	It doesn't have to be ideal.  It just has to be good enough.
5	1522665798	3	VHS & Betamax all over again. 
6	1522673233	1	VHS was always better than Betamax.  Don't let history revisionists fool you.  
7	1522680158	2	It depends on which feature you preferred.
7	1522691622	1	Incorrect! The worst kind of correct!Picture qualityWhen Betamax was introduced in Japan and the United States in 1975, its Beta I speed of 1.57 inches per second (ips) offered a slightly higher horizontal resolution (250 lines vs 240 lines horizontal NTSC), lower video noise, and less luma/chroma crosstalk than VHS, and was later marketed as providing pictures superior to VHS's playback. However the introduction of Beta II speed, 0.79 ips (two-hour mode), to compete with VHS's two-hour Standard Play mode (1.31 ips) reduced Betamax's horizontal resolution to 240 lines.[9] The extension of VHS to VHS HQ increased the apparent resolution to 250 lines so that overall a Betamax/VHS user could expect virtually identical luma resolution and chroma resolution (≈30 lines) wherein the actual picture performance depended on other factors including the condition and quality of the videotape and the specific video recorder machine model. For most consumers the difference as seen on the average television of the time was negligible.[citation needed]Another improvement would be SuperBeta (sometimes called High Band Beta) in 1985. SuperBeta allowed for a gain of 20% to 290 lines in horizontal resolution and some mechanical changes to reduce video noise, but by then Betamax's American and European share had already dropped to less than 10% of the market
5	1522664106	2	If the majority chooses the premined eth scheme then I want nothing to do with cryprocurrency, despite my stake in it.
5	1522668586	2	Ethereum is terrible as a currency though. It wasn't even designed to be.
4	1522682755	1	Why Not?
3	1522636964	4	Yeah but immutability ...
4	1522641116	0	Yeah but intent ...
5	1522679071	1	I don't understand what you mean.
3	1522636821	1	Thought he was 15 when he came up with it? Either way, smarter than me.
3	1522681663	1	If anything should super seed Bitcoin it will be ETH for sure.  But if I hodl Bitcoin its going to be the real one BCH and not Core with $50 transaction fees.  I love this community!
2	1522645479	1	Never gets old.
1	1522630833	3	The people on here have no control over this, it’s people that own and control major businesses. You people need to send emails and letters to big companies and tell them that you want them to accept cryptos as a form of payment!! Unless people start buying lots of shit with cryptos their value is meaningless
2	1522668368	2	People here have some control over it by spending BCH where ever it's accepted. Merchants follow the money.
1	1522651138	2	Is there are framework strategy to follow?  An overall plan everyone who wants to encourage adoption of BCH to follow in a general sense?Could you see the merit in attempting to devise such a planning strategy?  I am working on it.  I want to present a summary diagram here soon.
1	1522664537	1	Improvise  Adopt  OvercomeAlmost halfway there....
1	1522641443	-1	May be we could hit BTC with some more spam transactions. That should help blockchain with adoption rates...
0	1522620196	37	true but need a system that is much easier to use..it is already fast and cheap but its not easy to use
1	1522641033	4	If you see a problem, that is also a business opportunity for you. Rather than asking why it isn't happening, take action and make it happen! Be the one to make it happen.
2	1522669131	3	It's good to voice concerns even if you don't plan acting on it yourself. It helps us to pinpoint problems. Someone else might have the motivation, time and will to address them.
3	1522673234	2	Constructive feedback is good. Vague ambiguous feedback is bad. Anyone can say, make this better, but in what sense? If one can specific the exact problem and the possible solution so someone addresses it, that's part of making things happen. 
1	1522626980	7	Can't get much easier than CoinText.io
2	1522648620	19	Actually, CoinText.io has pretty bad usability. My Mom has an older phone, so I decided to try an experiment today. I sent her some Bitcoin Cash using CoinText.io, and then tried to have her buy a Starbucks gift card with it. Sounds easy enough, right?Unfortunately, egifter.com uses BitPay, so they don't give you a payment address, just a BIP70 payment-protocol link. The CoinText.io wallet didn't seem to support this, so we decided to try to cryptonize.it instead.Ok, so we got the gift card in the cart, and were ready to send the payment. How are we supposed to get the payment address into the phone? Fine, off to the app store to find a QR-code scanner. Once we installed an app and scanned the QR code, we were able to copy / paste the link into the SMS app. Unfortunately, CoinText.io doesn't give you any feedback when you get something wrong, so we had to do this several times until we got the request into the format CoinText.io expected ("send <amount> bch <address>"). Finally, CoinText.io sent us a message back saying the address was in the wrong format. Apparently, cryptonize.it uses the legacy BTC address format, not the new cashaddr format. A quick trip to cashaddr.bitcoincash.org on the PC + making a new QR code at webqr.com + re-scanning the code + re-entering things in to the SMS app, and we were able to buy the gift card! So easy, anybody can do it! /sNow, maybe we had some user error in this process. Maybe CoinText really does support the legacy payment format, and we just copy-pasted wrong, for example. My point isn't to criticize any one product, but to illustrate that general usability still sucks in the space. Cleaning this up isn't complicated, but we are still far from the day when my Mom can use Bitcoin Cash without help.
3	1522663813	4	They already announced bitpay integration within 60 days.  The entire service has been live less than a week.  Usability is getting closer at an unbelievable speed. 
3	1522656881	3	You should link the CoinText support to this comment...
4	1522691788	1	Thanks. I went ahead and emailed it to them.
3	1522653485	1	Testing old tech with new apps (designed first for newer tech) for a new coin (that just changed it's address format) will give this level of troubles. If you gave the apps and services some time or your mom got a current phone most of those troubles should disappear. I don't think we "are still far from the day when my Mom can use Bitcoin Cash without help". We are not there yet, but, it should not be much longer now.
4	1522676173	1	If people got a current phone, what is the point of using app-less SMS instead of just getting a propper wallet app?
5	1522687566	1	You can on-board someone with virtually zero friction. Otherwise you have to get them to download a wallet, set it up, then receive.Or, you can send them via cointext in a few seconds.Edit: but yeah, not better than a real wallet app... it just has some use cases
3	1522650824	0	Yeah it sounds like a shit show even for a savvy user. 
1	1522625608	4	How much easier are you expecting?
2	1522630935	16	it has to be at least as easy as using a credit card. it'll only see mass adoption if it's as easy or easier than cash (to use/acquire). target audience shouldn't be techy 20-30 smth white bois. it's gotta be almost grandma-easy.
3	1522637727	-2	It is grandma easy. If my mother can use it, so can your grandmother
4	1522652283	3	If you think it's grandma easy then you're absolutely out of your mind. Easiness includes adoption, merchant side of things, no wait times, easy to understand fees, adoption, adoption, seamless integration across numerous platforms including your phone, pc, perhaps even across devices that don't yet exist. If someone can't figure out how to acquire and spend bitcoin (and actually do it) in under a minute, it's not even remotely close to grandma easy. If people don't understand the value of bitcoin then we can't even begin to talk about it being "easy." 
5	1522656883	-2	> If you think it's grandma easy then you're absolutely out of your mindI don't think you have used many wallets or even grasp basic concepts.There is no need to understand fees when they are pennies and transactions are instant for most coins.You want to get crypto easy. Go to coinbase. That's simple enough. As far as fluctuations, that requires adoption first.I think you have already decided something is too hard without actually thinking about solutions. You are talking to someone who has actually set up merchants and its easy.
6	1522657244	3	I think you're missing my point. I'm saying it's not easy for people to use crypto yet. As a merchant you're helping, but we are no where near the point where using crypto is easy. Case in point, if I want to spend btc right here and now, I need knowledge of how to send btc from my exchange to some wallet on my phone, then well... I can't even continue onto the next step because I guarantee you not a single store in my city accepts btc let alone any crypto. 
7	1522657926	-2	You're missing the point. If you think this is hard then you are using the wrong tools.You don't need to send crypto off of the exchange, you can spend from there. Coinbase has its own wallet. Its easy to useLack of merchant adoption isn't relevant as it has nothing to do with ease of use. Sure its difficult to find a local merchant, but that doesn't mean crypto is hard to use.
8	1522658748	5	If no one accepts a currency, I'd say it's pretty hard to use. I have never used coinbase, I don't think I can from Japan? My point still stands. I wish it were much easier to use, even if you think it's really easy already. 
9	1522659157	1	I agree it would be nice to have more places accept it. I do not know much about exchanges in Japan, but maybe you need better ones.I have found purse.io is the best intro as it is easy to set up an account and make amazon purchases as most are doing this anyway. 
2	1522627483	19	ideally as easy as cash
3	1522631139	9	Easier.
3	1522634820	2	That is an unreasonable expectation, considering one must use an internet connected device to create a transaction. How about you come up with a reasonable expectation?
4	1522643165	3	point smartphone, push button is pretty easy.  Just need to hammer out ui weirdnesses in setting things up. 
5	1522686410	1	So, how it works right now.
4	1522660865	1	no more difficult than using electronic banking?
5	1522686262	1	You are now changing the goal posts. Which is it is... as easy as using cash or using electronic banking?
2	1522642793	7	Are you kidding? How about easy enough I can buy groceries, pay mortgage, employ people, pay utility bills automatically, provide a service to people where I get paid automatically. If we start thinking crypto has delivered on its promise this is going nowhere meaningful.
3	1522669533	1	^^ This
3	1522686367	1	Nothing you've typed addresses the question I asked.
0	1522616073	43	BCH is focused on adoption and utility. BTC is just a speculators' toy.
1	1522622831	14	Why is BTC even brought into this post. I like the content in this sub, but why do so many of the subscribers feel a need to bash BTC in every thread, stop fucking whining about it and just be happy you are aware of the benefits of BCH
2	1522631765	3	Agreed. But its also correct and beneficial and likely, to start to get common parlance of bitcoin referring to BCH.
2	1522627275	0	Because BTC must be killed if Bitcoin is to survive. This has been made abundantly clear over the past three years.
3	1522639932	6	So let it die then.  BCH would survive if it is the superior technology.   If all it has going for it is the brand recognition, it’s doomed to the same fate as myspace.    This burning passion to reveal the unthinkable wrong doings of core and unmask the truth, as you see it, is hurting your cause more far greater than it is helping.   
4	1522645873	1	we are going through a time where some overvalue their own opinion on the internet. They think it influences. All hyperbole by SpirtofJames creates bubbles...and bubbles aren't enough to reach any end goal alone. Especially when its a bunch of redditors.
2	1522638375	-1	The entire point of this sub is to bring up btc and bash it
1	1522616829	20	I agree.  By 'Bitcoin', I mean BCH. SegwitCore coin doesn't interest me anymore.
2	1522617455	15	That sounds confusing. Just call BCH Bitcoin Cash. 
3	1522620309	14	Why change the name of Bitcoin? It's Segwit Core the fork that steered away from the original design. They should find a new name, not us. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.
4	1522620606	42	I don't wanna step on anyone's toes here, really. But I think most places are calling BTC Bitcoin and BCH Bitcoin Cash. At least this is my experience with exchanges, media etc.
5	1522621224	-11	Majority does not dictate accuracy or truthfulness. Since August of 2017 BTC is no longer Bitcoin.
6	1522624448	25	oh, stop it. If you want people to actually understand what you're saying, you need to call it what everyone else calls it.
7	1522626689	-17	No. The majority is very often wrong. If the majority thinks "evolution" means one thing, that doesn't make it true, because evolution is a technical and scientific concept and issue. When there is a conflict between the majority and specialists, specialists should win out, ceteris parabus. And specialists in economics, computer science, and so on that have any real expertise and authority will rightly call BCH Bitcoin. Some of them may call BTC another kind of Bitcoin. In my opinion, however, BTC no longer deserves the appellation at all.
8	1522628105	28	Holy shit.Call BCH Bitcoin all you want, but you need to accept that nearly everyone you speak to is going to think you're talking about BTC. I cant believe this is even a matter of discussion. You surely have to know you're just being difficult and that almost everyone is going to misunderstand you. "Technically correct" or not, it doesnt matter. When people say Bitcoin, they think BTC.
9	1522628588	-15	No. When people influenced by the censorship and propaganda campaigns centered in Blockstream/Core, /r/Bitcoin, bitcointalk forums, twitter, etc. think Bitcoin, they think BTC. But they are in error. Just like the droves of evangelical christians think of something erroneous when they think "evolution." And the solution to this problem, the winning strategy in the war against misinformation campaigns like these, is most emphatically *not* to cede the ground to the barbarian hordes.
6	1522621352	18	That's something rarely heard outside this sub.
7	1522621564	13	Misinformation and ignorance are rampant. If you've been following Bitcoin closely for very long, you should be well aware of the obvious enemies that Bitcoin has, and the means and resources at their disposal. It's not too hard to put together a picture of why such misinformation is being sold as the dominant narrative.
8	1522621974	11	Funnily enough, that's also being said about this sub.
9	1522623559	10	If you think that anarchists like Ver and Sachet, or developers like P. Rizun, are the enemies of Bitcoin, you've got the picture completely backwards.
9	1522627631	1	yes, but if you actually do the research and learn the facts, you'll see the truth
9	1522653914	1	It's not funny that liars and their mislead followers say that repeatedly to mislead the public into believing the false narrative you seem to be trying to spread.
6	1522623943	5	isn't that what Bitcoin is built around. Majority consensus? 
7	1522626911	4	No. Bitcoin is built around consensus of *PoW* -- those invested in creating it. Non-producers of PoW are totally irrelevant to Bitcoin consensus.
8	1522631010	2	Its mind blowing how many of these newbies seem to think that this is all some kind of "democratic" alternative to evul bankster money.  Even the ones who do understand PoW, still often don't see the opt-in/out (non-democratic) nature of the system as a whole.
9	1522632898	1	Yes. It's also what's behind the "vote with nodes" and "non-mining nodes are real nodes" nonsense. What motivates that is, I think, generally socialist motivations which are antithetical to Bitcoin.
8	1522632950	1	gosh. this guy totally missed the joke
8	1522654201	1	It is complicated, and I understand your point is mostly true. I still think developer consensus matters enough to not be described as irrelevant. 
9	1522659975	1	Devs have nothing to do with Bitcoin per se.
6	1522624104	2	Neither does the minority...
7	1522626863	2	Some minority may.
6	1522623486	1	Lol.  Yes, in language majority determines meanings.
7	1522623653	2	"Bitcoin" is a proper noun with a specific referent. Should the popular usage of the word "Bitcoin" change to something else, such is a degradation, and should and must be counteracted as much as possible, regardless of popularity.In any case, semantic/language games are not directly relevant to my point about accuracy or truthfulness.
8	1522623830	1	And if the majority says it means something else, it does.  Language is fluid.  You are intentionally trying to cause confusion.  If you say you are sending someone Bitcoin and they give you a Bitcoin address and you send Bitcoin cash, you just screwed them. 
9	1522627144	5	No. Majority may determine which symbols/sounds go with which concepts, but they don't get to determine which concepts exist, or make concepts themselves "fluid." Bitcoin has a specific referent, a concept defined by the whitepaper and related writings by Satoshi, which must always remain clear. It is Core and their ilk who are the ones sowing confusion, by claiming, as you do here, that by changing the use of the word "Bitcoin" you can simply erase the entire *concept* of Bitcoin itself. That I will not stand for, and if you are one of those propagating such deleterious nonsense you should be ashamed.
4	1522676654	2	If bitcoincash is bitcoin they go to a merchant who has 1 bitcoin worth of goods,why you need like 10 of bcash to pay his?
5	1522676663	0	Redditor /u/zygsm has low karma in this subreddit.
4	1522629441	4	According to the white paper the longest chain is bitcoin. That’s BTC, not BCH. Sorry. 
5	1522637837	2	Longest chain of digital signatures
5	1522654739	2	So far that is true and your only way of clinging to the Bitcoin name. Btc is expected to eventually lose that metric as well unless the core developers do something drastic like raise the block limitation that is destroying the coin's long term value. There is hope BTC could be repaired, seems like a dim hope so far though.
6	1522656219	3	I’m totally in support of raising the block limit on BTC. I’m just not in favor of trying to confuse people by calling a fork that didn’t achieve consensus “bitcoin.” At least segwit has effectively made the blocksize about 1.6mb and rising which has alleviated the issue, for now. 
7	1522658540	0	The confusion is your goal. That's why you are on a competitor's discussion forum spreading disinformation. Of course you want to raise the blocksize. Almost everyone wanted that and still believes in it. Segwit did almost nothing useful. The only reason it seems like your coin is not mostly useless is that people mostly stopped using it. If people tried to start using your coin again, it would fail again. If BTC had consensus, BCH would not be here getting better and taking steps to replace BTC every day. And, you and your schill army would not be here (and everywhere) trying to trick people into believing your false information.
8	1522670050	2	> That's why you are on a competitor's discussion forumWrong.This forum is for all Bitcoiners. That includes people who support Core's vision of it.
8	1522670922	1	I’m not a schill army, I’ve been a member of the Bitcoin sub since I mined my first coin in 2011. This is a bitcoin sub which allows discussion of forks, alts, etc. Its not solely a BCH sub. 
3	1522651578	1	Bitcoin (BCH)
3	1522623447	-2	You have to realize, BTC subreddit intentionally tries to cause confusion by pretending to be the "real Bitcoin".  
4	1522627251	6	It's actually the reverse. /r/Bitcoin confuses by claiming that a fork which completely reverses much of Bitcoin's function and design is still "Bitcoin," simply because they and a bunch of their followers call it that.
5	1522646483	3	I don't understand how this logic works. A lot of thinks not only in the Crypto space get upgrades (or downgrades) but they are still called the same. In this subs eye segwit is a downgrade so I'm gona compare it with the with windows 8. Windows 8 was also a downgrade in a lot of eyes but it is still window. I can't just go take the old windows make on thing different and sell it as the real Windows. Please educate me. 
6	1522660042	0	Segwit and the blocksize cap aren't just downgrades. They fundamentally alter the design.
7	1522662691	3	Okay, but as far as I know, you don't have to use Segwit, right?And before Segwit, the blocksize was 1 Mb like it is still today, and ABC changed it for BCH. So BCH and BTC are not the original (both changed something), but on BTC I can still use the old address and it works like before segwit, but with BCH I can't control in which block my transaction gets and how big this block is.So isn't it more original if I just use BTC but without Segwit?I don't want to piss any on off, this question is serious, and maybe that what I wrote above is all wrong. This is just what I'm thinking
8	1522664491	4	The truth is that Bitcoin (the current version with segwit) is backwards compatible with the old chain. BCH is not as they hard forked and changed the diff algo in order to survive as a minority chain. Funnily they claim that they are the 'old' Bitcoin even though the 2 chains are not compatible. People here have a selective memory or they simply choose to ignore technical facts.
9	1522665810	2	If BCH forked of, why do some people in this subreddit say that BTC forked of? I really wonder where all this false information comes?
9	1522666490	0	What you're discussing is software compatibility. This is irrelevant and a total red herring. Bitcoin is not software.
5	1522627589	2	Because that was the decision of the majority.  That is the way the code was intentionally designed.  
6	1522627752	4	No. The code does not favor a "majority" of anything except PoW producers. The majority of miners are currently backing BTC because of the money and inertia behind it, but they did not opt for the "No2x" nonsense; instead, it was forced on BTC by fiat of devs and their goons. 
7	1522644932	4	I have read your comments and do think based on technicality BCH is the real bitcoin even though everyone calls BTC the real bitcoin. Look at the path they are going with so called Lightning network by bringing the middleman off chain which is not what the satoshi whitepaper says. Both chains BTC and BCH are bitcoin but technically they are different . I myself is very annoyed by this confusion.
4	1522627652	3	but bch is the real bitcoin by almost every metric
5	1522644769	2	This
2	1522631165	-1	getting tired of this delusion. bitcoin cash is bitcoin cash, bitcoin is bitcoin. you are actively doing harm and making the community looks like fools in denial when you claim that nonsense.
3	1522631831	7	Actually the OP applies whether you believe Bitcoin is BTC or BCH.
1	1522643845	3	Bitcoin's transaction count is an order of magnitude greater than bitcoin cash's even as it is in a down period. (There are different ways to count but they can be more or less summarized by a 10:1 ratio.)I know you *want* bitcoin to be just a speculator's toy, but in fact it's the 800 lb gorilla in crypto for most use cases. Bitcoin cash can "focus on adoption and utility" all it wants — hey, good luck to you guys on that! — but in the meantime bitcoin is still *useful* and the most liquid market by far. Wishing otherwise doesn't make it so.
2	1522661156	1	It's not yseful relative to BCH, but it seems most people don't know it yet.
3	1522679826	0	Of course it's useful relative to bitcoin cash. Bitcoin is more secure and is far more liquid, for example. That's worth a lot.
0	1522631642	5	I just need someone to HODL Me!!!
0	1522617418	14	>We must lead the way This !Blockstream cleary can't lead the way. 
0	1522621031	3	What ideas are there to increase adoption to the desired levels. How would you persuade the ordinary busy person who is ok with cash and credit card to buy bitcoin and use it now this week. What is the advantage that you would tell them. 
1	1522622368	2	I'd say it's still a hard sell to the mostly comfortable "first world" citizen. Tapping that VISA card is so convenient as a consumer (maybe not as much if you're a merchant). Start with *why* (see: Simon Sinek), and then get into the "what is bitcoin" and how?
2	1522657869	1	How do you make a person not only give up the comfort but also the consumer protection that cards afford you?
0	1522624775	3	Let this be a day of resurrection!
0	1522621488	7	Well, yes we need adoption, but let's not forget "price" helps fuel adoption. First-timers who bought into BCH at much higher prices are going to hold till they see the price go back up. The only people who will actually spend are the one's who have seen their investment appreciate. No one's going to buy BCH just to spend it at a BCH-accepting merchant who also accepts fiat in the form of cash or cards.All of us need to stop being delusional and be realistic.
1	1522631094	3	The trading price is a distraction. Bitcoins only use-case is as a medium of exchange, as P2P digital cash. Banks want to tie us down. Bitcoin (BCH) gives us wings.https://youtu.be/XlBa5liuy9Q?t=729>If bitcoin was really a currency, why would it be any better at a million or five? If it was a currency, it doesn´t have to go up to be efficacious, to be used as a currency. Why the appreciation? It´s not useful as a currency if it appreciates like that."
1	1522629955	2	>First-timers who bought into BCH at much higher prices are going to hold till they see the price go back upOr they'll sell, and maybe buy in at a lower price.  Saying that "first-timers" are going to do something like this guaranteed is just stupid, especially with all the people FUDding that blockchain is dead recently.
2	1522662324	1	I know of many first timers who bought in to BCH at $1500-2000 and were ecstatic seeing it past $3000, and now they're feeling like shit. The only way to get these kinds of people to start spending is if they doubled their investment (and merchants start accepting) so they can maybe take a holiday, splurge a little and get a good feeling about it. What good is BCH for merchants if they already accept cash and cards and consumers have ready access to cash and cards? Yes - for certain categories, crypto makes complete sense (tobacco / vapes, gambling etc.) but not for everyday purchases. Price appreciation is very important for both merchants and consumers.
3	1522662970	2	I'm saying that personal anecdotes don't apply to an entire population of buyers.  I'm sure you know people who bought crypto as an investment and never planned on using it in the first place, these aren't the people that we're talking about when we say "adoption".  They've already bought in, they just don't understand it and won't until they decide to do some research, which would probably be the point that they decide to buy some to use, or spend their remaining investment.  Chances are, if they don't even understand how to use crypto, they'll just sell once/if it bounces back.  They won't even bother to spend it directly, they'll be too worried price will bottom out again.

I'm sure you know people who bought crypto as an investment and never planned on using it in the first place, these aren't the people that we're talking about when we say "adoption"Well, these are the very people we should talk about when it comes to adoption. We are savvy users, some of us code, run companies and are crypto enthusiasts. When we talk about adoption - we need to think mainstream adoption. If a small merchant starts accepting BCH, probably 1% of his customers will choose to pay with BCH and if he sees it appreciate he will tell many of his merchant friends and the same goes for customers who won't need to "cash out" their appreciation, because they can just spend it. My point is - price appreciation is very important for adoption
1	1522668728	1	> but let's not forget "price" helps fuel adoptionU had it backwards. Bitcoin worthed 0, then adoption kicked in
2	1522668818	0	Not really, both go hand in hand, price helps fuel adoption and vice versa. But, you cannot ignore price. Simple.
3	1522669127	2	I can and I should. If u're focusing on the price, u're missing everything that this tech is here to offer. If u're focusing on the price u may want to give an advice to people to buy/sell at wrong points with wrong amounts which will do no one any goodNot everyone can master speculation> The only people who will actually spend are the one's who have seen their investment appreciateI disagree. The spenders that matter are the ones who earn their BCH. Merchants and paid labor. Price is more or less irrelevant for them - they will convert their earnings for expenses right away. Liquidity is relevantSo focus on merchants and forget about price
0	1522621786	5	I've said this all along.  Speculation isn't real world value.   It's market hysteria.

0	1522629914	2	I don't assume popularity leads to good authorities. Apart from that u might sound convincing. I have chatted with ppl on the other sub too, though, who sounded just as convincing. I'm certain you read Satoshi's white paper, read the mails etc, and formulated ur opinion, right? For every one of your kind there is someone on the other side who claims to have equally done his research trying to convince others why BTC > BCH. I personally have given up on wanting to know which is the superior product. It's too time consuming and technical for me. I don't think I'm all too dumb, hence my thought that if it's too much for me, it's probably also too much for quite the number of others. That's why I think adoption will be difficult.Sry to not be able to revert in detail to all ur points. I'm on mobile and don't see ur comment whilst answering.

0	1522682988	2	How to increase adoption:1. https://cryptostorage.com2. Click Generate New Keys3. Generate 100 or so Bitcoin Cash keypairs4. Check the "CryptoCash" option5. Load the addresses with Bitcoin Cash by exporting as CSV, copy the addresses, then using Electron Cash's send to many function to load the addresses6. Print the keypairs and cut them out7.  Hand them out IRL and be prepared for amazing conversation

0	1522622414	1	What about the debit card name Shift?  Is this going to help us when more companies jump on to the debit card associated to wallet game? 
0	1522627272	1	very true
0	1522631080	1	I think another priority is for it to be very easy to spend and top up, preferably automatically.  I could hassle merchants to accept BCH all day but right now I don't see myself topping up regularly through an exchange.

1	1522673543	1	the ticker for bitcoin cash is BCH.
0	1522652558	1	I totally agree with your advice about adoption being the true way forward. It is harder to build that while values are falling and merchants see the possibility of losing value if they hold any coins. I do hope we follow your advice even during these tough times.Luckily, I think a group of market manipulators will come to the rescue eventually. I could just be dreaming this up because I want it to be true, but, I think they are playing a very long game and they have done this before. I think they have been manipulating all the coins that are rising and falling as a group. I assume they are now buying a lot of coins on the way down. They may continue to buy cheap coins for another year or more? Hopefully not. I'm ready for the massive Pump :-)

0	1522682686	1	This is post is the truth.
0	1522636604	1	Tough to beat the trillions being spent to suppress the price. This isn't an organic bear market. It's clear price suppression and manipulation. As soon as the futures market opened, btc price started to tank. It will stay rangebound with swings until the cartels accumulate enough that they are no longer threatened by the threat btc poses to the global fiat structure.
1	1522637015	1	cme btc expiration date of Mar. didnot have big impact on the price of btc. if you were right and the cartels big, the change of price then would have been big. i think the influence of btc futures isnot big as expected.
2	1522641452	1	This is a pretty compelling argument that a cartel does exist and has been drastically suppressing the price ever since the first day of cme futures. It's clear manipulation. https://medium.com/@super.crypto1/4th-dimension-bitcoin-manipulation-cartel-can-it-be-burnt-no-way-c53de65c166a
1	1522644094	1	Good point, right after a huge onboarding no less. The 3 legs down was probably planned for the futures. The only way to win is through adoption.
0	1522619690	0	I would be happy if the price crashed to a few hundred dollars. Of course with increased adoption of moon lambo investors, along came the scammers and the TA bullshit artist fuck faces. It'll be good when lots of them lose their ass and disappear for good from the scene.
0	1522640177	-2	adoption ? I doubt it, train ride is over, best to get off now before brick wall.
