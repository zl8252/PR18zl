0	1522667267	35	Competition is what Bitcoin is all about to me, I can fully agree with these statements.gild u/tippr
1	1522668589	12	Thanks, and I hope https://cryptonize.it rewards your efforts in the Bitcoin Cash market.Good to see tippr being able to gild again. I thought maybe Reddit had cut off its gold supply.
2	1522669311	6	Thanks! Yeah he had some issues but in the end it got resolved I guess. I’m so used to tippr, I haven’t even used chaintip yet, was missing it while it was down, it’s the first thing you notice when visiting this sub; people getting magic internet money!
3	1522675777	7	Try chaintip. It's the best option for tipping noobs. 
4	1522677566	7	Yeah I really should get myself to chaintip, nothing better then on-chain stuff!
3	1522675115	4	How’s the Cryptonize.it going? I know it’s a private information, but the community would love to hear if a BCH business is successful or not. We’re pushing for adoption, but is it actually happening?
4	1522677460	4	Save it for the AMA tomorrow! But it’s doing good, expansion is coming:-)
5	1522682780	3	Oh, there's an AMA? I'll definitely tune in for that one.

0	1522674005	9	Great post. This is precisely how Satoshi approached the problem. He released working code first, then lobbied. Risky, but it worked. Almost everyone nowadays lobbies first to see if there's any traction, then takes the risk if they perceive traction. 
1	1522689989	3	Great point. Satoshi didn't propose, he did. He didn't take umbrage, he said, "Watch me!"
0	1522677898	8	Fully agreed. And thank you for all you've done for Bitcoin, without asking for recognition. u/chaintip
1	1522686265	3	Thanks for the tip, and your insightful posts on https://bitco.in/forum which have always inspired me.

0	1522674954	5	Correct. Bad system works thanks to. Good system works **despite** 
0	1522670934	10	Agreed. I would also add that I think we have to give some people in our community the benefit of the doubt and really think about what they may mean, rather than trying to find fault with what you think they are saying.  
0	1522679633	8	> I'm not saying Bitcoin Cash has a problem. Just that we should see disagreement as part of the creative process, and don't mistake every instance of it for some kind of "attack".I agree 100% that disagreement is extremely important and should be encouraged.  However maybe its the way disagreements are being made, and the toxicity that is developing that is not good.  Then disagreements become not about ideas, but of people. The community needs to learn how to disagree while maintaining respect, which is not easy to do, but its something we all need to work on.
0	1522674043	5	Great post. Absolutely true. There will always be someone who disagrees with you, no matter how correct your idea might be. That’s the nature of people and communities.I’d like to point out that for the freedom of ideas to fully work, *freedom of communication* and unstifled, uncensored discussion is mandatory. Reddit is not a good place for this as it allows manipulation. (It’s not just limited to Reddit. It has even spread to Twitter and Youtubesybill accounts, voting, impersonation and more).Just look at the effects caused by r/bitcoin moderation on the entire Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash community. It led to the ability to divide the community and require a fork of the entire blockchain. Censorship is a powerful opponent of free ideas.Perhaps some day we can break the shackles of this censorable platform and truly allow a free market of **ideas**. At that point OP’s post will be able to be most fully realized.
0	1522677786	4	We are a bunch of passionate geeks, Our main mission is to help clear the air around cryptocurrency and make it a larger community than it already is A lot of scattered, excess and some times incorrect Cryptocurrency information on websites/ blogs can give any newbie cold feet, hence we have created a simple, user friendly platform called http://cryptonoob.io/ which illustrates a step by step guide to create their own digital wallets, example : btc , ethereum , ripple wallets , we update the coin help guides every week and guess what You can also buy most of the coins on our platform itself with just one swipe of your credit card.
0	1522672533	5	Couldn’t agree more. 
0	1522682898	5	Literally every coin/project out there should be taking this advice. The tribalism doesn’t help anyone and disagreements should really be used for growth and sourcing new and different ideas. Too much of crypto is about “consistent thought” which prevents critical thinking from situation to situation in the name of philosophical orthodoxy.
1	1522690452	1	Thank you for this comment, I agree with you 100%. A constructive attitude should extend beyond to other cryptocurrencies.

0	1522673979	3	> We need people to BUILD what they think will help Bitcoin CashThis is a moot point when the protocol direction is controlled by a very few individuals/companies. You can't build on a foundation that is not solid.> Either the market is able to look at the fundamentals of these different proposals, and sort out what works from what doesn't (and I believe that to be the case). Or it doesn't, in which case I would say Bitcoin Cash would fail, and so would every other human endeavor. Letting the "market decide" is grossly inefficient when it comes to ledgers  because forking is expensive.Either Bitcoin Cash will be able to develop more efficient self-governance mechanisms or it will be replaced by some system that will.

1	1522684655	1	Awesome quote. Thanks :-D
0	1522685103	1	> even if we have to call it 'Bitcoin Cash'.that seems like giving up, i think people will call it by whatever name that people like to that stays truest to the original name, for me it is Bitcoin*. (BCH)
1	1522686733	2	People are free to call it whatever they like, but the reality is that we had to fork with minority hashpower and therefore had to get a different name and ticker to get listed, and that had to be something people could distinguish from BTC.There was recently a poll in Korea where they checked among young people, how many were conscious of cryptocurrency. The poll got a surprisingly low number - around 20% only. That means many more people are unfamiliar with the Bitcoin / Bitcoin Cash debate, and if they get a positive experience with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) or a horrible one with Bitcoin (BTC), this will stick in their mind, and they will gravitate towards _what works_.
0	1522689201	1	There’s a problem when the lead devs of ABC and Unlimited go around accusing people of being scammers and frauds with 0 evidence to back any of it up. Luckily those people will end up irrelevant and forgotten.
1	1522689596	2	> the lead devs of ABC and Unlimited go around accusing people of being scammers and frauds with 0 evidenceLinks?
2	1522689805	1	Amaury and Peter have both accused CSW of being a scammer while having no proof. Peter has done it recently on Twitter. Amaury said it once here on reddit...couldn’t find it. That type of behavior helps *no one*.
3	1522690082	1	If it's public you should be able to produce a link. You know, evidence.I know Peter disagrees with Craig on a lot of things, but Peter is NOT the Lead Developer of BU. He's Chief Scientist. Accuracy matters here, since by 'lead dev' you are implicating Andrew Stone, who IS actually the lead developer of BU.And if you refer to Peter's claim that he did not sign an NDA for reading CSW's retracted paper, then it should be simple for CSW to provide the signed NDA to expose Peter's claim as false. If he doesn't, I must ask why not.If CSW parades around casting shade on Peter's integrity, then he should expect a robust defense, and expect to be challenged to provide evidence for his claims.

0	1522691783	1	Yeah okay but call it what it is. Bitcoin Cash. Not Bitcoin (cash). 
1	1522691929	1	I call it Bitcoin (Cash) when what I say applies to both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.When I'm saying something that I think applies only to Bitcoin Cash, I call it Bitcoin Cash.
2	1522691963	2	Fair enough
0	1522682173	1	If some minority in bitcoin cash disagrees they don't need to work together. They should pursue their own vision by forking bitcoincash, registering bitcoincash.com, and getting the @bitcoincash twitter account and then have conferences and try to convince everyone that their fork is the real bitcoincash. 
1	1522691027	1	I upvoted you since that is exactly what is meant by 'permissionless'.However, let's remember that Roger Ver cultivated bitcoin.com long before the Bitcoin Cash split, and still supports both BTC and BCH both on that site and in bitcoin.com's wallet. I'm not sure who controls the @bitcoin Twitter handle, but I've seen no evidence of it changing ownership.If the Bitcoin Cash community becomes so toxic in future that they run smear campaigns against industry leaders, boycott businesses and censor public opinion on forums such as this one, then I think it will definitely be time to do what you described.I see no sign of that so far.
0	1522689047	1	You've seen it all happen and play out with Bitcoin before... the disagreements, the community split and, eventually, a new coin.&nbsp;Question: When BCH splits, which will be the **true** "Satoshi's Vision Bitcoin"?
1	1522689474	1	BCH has already split before - Bitcoin Clashic - isn't even listed on Coinmarketcap.If there is another split over a controversial aspect, then just like with Bitcoin, holders of the coin will be holders of both forks, and will be free to support one or both of the forks.The community split due to censorship and demonization of the principle of hard forking (which is used successfully by other coins to upgrade their protocols, but for some reason Core insisted it was not viable on Bitcoin).
2	1522690880	1	Did not answer my question.
3	1522691161	1	The answer is quite simple - it is up to everyone individually to decide which Bitcoin adheres the closest to "Satoshi's vision".I thought I made that clear in this> free to support one or both of the forksIn case it comes to a future fork and someone has doubt which one is closer to the original concept, they could consult https://bitcoincash.org/bitcoin.pdf .

0	1522678553	-6	This is part of the narrative to make it seem as if CSW's recent attacks are somewhat ok.Toxicity is never ok. Stupidity is not ok. Greg's tactics are not ok. Look where it got him: he lost his job, his ex-coworkers hate him, and it's a matter of time before his own turns on him. 
1	1522687353	2	looks like he got sent over to fuck with Monero for now. 
0	1522681787	-6	Bitcoin crash just doing its thing.

1	1522682955	1	Thanks for giving us your childish input
2	1522687446	-2	But whatever it was, it can’t be more childish than saying "BCH is Bitcoin".
