1	1522689895	3	Does anyone know of any good forums/sites that have a more...adoptive view of Bitcoin cash or crypto currency in general? Basically, a place where the speculative aspect is kept to a minimum, and there's a focus on the actual original goal and birth of crypto?This community (and reddit in general) has become pretty terrible for these types of dicussions. The shilling, censorship, dumbfuck memes, crypto 'factions' etc. has totally destroyed any serious discussion on the tech and its way forward.Surely there's a better place? (pm if you want)I want to create a proper ecosystem for this crypto. Try and figure out ways on stabilising the price and enabling its use as a **currency** or facilitate the trading of goods and services.
2	1522690714	3	If you get a suggestion  as a PM and not a reply here could you send it to me as well? 
2	1522691472	1	Bitco.in

1	1522685266	3	yeah, sure i will spend now the bch i bought two months ago and let half of my money worth vanish
2	1522686211	5	You replenish and worth no longer vanishes. 
2	1522685440	2	That's fine, be shortsighted and work against your own success :)
3	1522685607	5	oh you're right, i'm a cryptorich now with my 200$ i paid 400$
4	1522686180	3	Everyone said crypto was a bubble which is why I didn’t put too much in. But yeah I agree the whole “store of value” thing is retarded. My 300$ is worth like $150. It’s all too volatile to be a currency. Maybe it’s just in it’s early stages but overall don’t really get the point.

6	1522686935	1	When will that be
7	1522689171	2	In a hundred years
8	1522691458	2	hodl
2	1522688618	1	I doesn't really matter if you'd buy and replace the same amount you spent. Buying BCH is cheaper now too remember.Cryptos go up and down in value. That's nothing new.
