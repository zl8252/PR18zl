0	1522672499	6	Awesome!
0	1522683472	5	Waves is the most undervalued platform right now.
0	1522687567	1	Sadly volume is very low. 
0	1522678188	1	Waves sounds awesome until you realize their blockchain is a Proof Of Stake system. :(
1	1522680615	5	Is that bad? 
1	1522681102	2	Nothing wrong with seeing competing paradigms in action. Even though PoS doesn't have me convinced either
2	1522682307	2	I'm upvoting you, even though I develop ethereum smart contracts and hope to promote and use proof of stake (in the case of Casper) -- it is a hybrid system, not pure PoS.  I believe it has massive potential if successful but I'm not 100% convinced yet, just hopeful as a developer.
