1	1522665242	3	Thx god I'm an October kid! 
2	1522667299	3	Anything is better than a poor December kid!
3	1522676910	1	Yeah, RIP these kids!
3	1522690382	1	RIP
1	1522656248	5	" I should of bought more when " and" Oh i yea i got some in 2008/09/10/11 "it is amazing how many people were buying early by the way people talk today.
2	1522658390	7	2008... -___-
2	1522666800	6	What did you buy in 2008?
3	1522668071	10	nothing. but i hear this line every week by joe cool as he blows off bitcoin acting like they too smart and already got in and out (before exchanges even existed)
3	1522671088	4	He is satoshi. He was writing the Bitcoin code. 
2	1522668723	2	Lol I now stay quiet. Can't go and make  myself a target now just to out some crypto bro
3	1522668982	2	i just act like i have no idea what is going in most situations.. keeps you from having to explain things to people who do not care and won't remember
0	1522662927	11	Bitcoin was invented as an answer to the financial crises in 2008 - many seem to misuse it
1	1522685530	0	Bitcoin is about freedom though, how can you misuse bitcoin?  What if someone says you misuse bitcoin?  Is it not just a matter of perspective?  
0	1522661256	3	Short answer is yes. 
0	1522671568	2	I've been here for years. Not going anywhere.
0	1522646231	-50	This particular sub is in Eternal Craig Wright.At least until 2020, when coins will not move and instead there will be lawsuits from people that Craig will fight using money he made from those very people.
1	1522647868	30	Continue to attack people and not ideas, see how far that gets you.
2	1522648120	-27	There are no ideas to attack, just a middle aged con man with no accomplishments repeating technobabble, with the help of social media manipulators.
3	1522652891	22	There are plenty of people who like or dislike Craig on this board. Instead of finding someone who is actually talking about him and trying to argue it out, you just come in and state like everyone is supporting and behind him. Not a very constructive approach, makes you look like a troll more than anything.
4	1522672932	2	> makes you look like a trollIf it talks like one and logics like one... It probably *is* one
3	1522656390	5	There is enough material for attacks on his (empty) ideas.But you stick to personal attacks.
2	1522652929	-11	is "remembering past events" attacking?
3	1522656267	4	>is "remembering past events" attacking?By doing so are you talking ideas?Then you have your answer.
1	1522646616	31	Nobody here cares for the person craig wright except for you morons mentioning him every 10 seconds
1	1522656158	3	I see lots of critics on CSW in this sub.
2	1522690604	1	fool me once..
1	1522691869	1	> At least until 2020, when coins will not moveNo, you're confusing is with the 1MB 4EVER coin. Bitcoin Cash can scale on-chain without resorting to Lightning.
