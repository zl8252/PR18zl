0	1522761243	101	I didn't join BCH because of Craig Wright...I joined because it follows the Satoshi White Paper!
1	1522773233	18	Agreed. One thing I really dislike on this subreddit is the amount of CSW posts that get upvoted.By now it is obvious CSW is professional con artist. That whole "I am Satoshi" drama... that switched into "OK, now give me Bitcoin patents" is crazy.I have nothing personal against the guy; given everything it is possible he played _SOME_ role in Bitcoin history. But it would be best for everyone if he just went away... as he promised he will, when he failed to produce signature: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Steven_Wright#Bitcoin
2	1522779322	1	>By now it is obvious CSW is professional con artist. That whole "I am Satoshi" drama... that switched into "OK, now give me Bitcoin patents" is crazy.You obviously are disinformed. He had already secured bitcoin/blockchain patent long before the drama started. it was more like.."We want your bitcoin/blockchain patents as part of the deal...oh we also want your satoshi life rights". Everything was done by mutual agreement but was part of a deal.And no, CSW is not a con artist. Anyone who does a bit of research on him can easily see this. 
1	1522762281	17	This!
2	1522778740	1	That 
1	1522764568	11	I [advocated BCH before it even existed](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68jja0/dont_forget_money_and_bitcoin_are_just_a_ledger/dgyysp0/), Craig Wright didn't even support BCH publicly until things had already advanced to a stage where the market was accepting the fork.
1	1522777905	2	What does that have to do with the topic at hand? You seem to be deliberately conflating criticism of Craig Wright with criticism of BCH.
1	1522766592	9	>I didn't join BCH because of Craig WrightHave you considered that Craig Wright may have joined BCH to court those he's decided are gullible?
2	1522772374	12	There are gullible people everywhere. I’m sorry but the narrative that BCH supporters are naive “noobs” who don’t understand bitcoin is a false one. 
3	1522777445	1	What about the narrative that BCH is governed by the 21 un-elected members of the Bitcoin Unlimited group who voted to create it? How decentralized is that, and what would you call folks who delegate "consensus" to them?
4	1522777922	1	Are we going to keep coming up with narratives to be debunked? If we are being fallacious I could come back at you asking how decentralized is having anyone who has a different of opinions with core developers being ostracized. Are you not delegating consensus to core?But since I’m not into fallacious discourse, I would ask you who are the 21 members of the BU group. As far as I know Amaury from ABC took the lead on the fork and managed to spin up enough support to have he fork survive. It has since attracted a great many dissenters from the big block community, especially after 2x failed. If you follow BCH development it should be clear that there is no unified vision. ABC rejects OP_GROUP while BU supports it. Peter Rizun and CSW are constantly at each other’s throats. Here doesn’t seem to be a clear, unified strategy consistent with masterminds with ulterior motives. Incidentally, BTC core development seems to have exactly that, as dissenting voices are cast out. So no, there is no delegation of consensus as far as development goes. If you meant something else that message was lost in your text. 
4	1522778406	1	This question shows you miss the whole point of cryptos.  It's all trustless.  We no longer have to trust anyone.  We can see the consensus rules of a block chain protocol for ourselves, we can evaluate it for ourselves and decide if we like it or not.  We do not have to take anyone's word for it or trust any individual or group.  Personally, right now, I believe BCH is the best available.  Next month there will be a scheduled hard fork to update BCH.  I will re-evaluate it then.  In November there will be another scheduled hard fork to update BCH again.  Again, I will re-evaluate it.  At no point do I give a rats ass what Craig Wright, Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, or anyone in /r/bitcoin have to say about the block chain I use.  I can decide for myself and so can you!
2	1522773251	2	Is that what someone told you? 
3	1522776845	1	No, but it's a reasonable theory, if CW is the fraud many think he is. Scammers prey on the gullible. He's been widely rejected by the BTC community and should sense that's not fertile ground.
4	1522779084	1	> He's been widely rejected by the BTC community I can see that you are new to crypto...so think of it this way... the greatest impact an individual can have on a block chain is to contribute code to it...so just imagine...He's welcome to submit code to the BCH repository.  If it gets included in an update of BCH, we can all evaluate whether we like his changes or not.  If we do, cool.  If we don't, we can sell our BCH and move on.  Either way, there's zero reason to fear fraudsters like you are implying.  It's not like tomorrow he's cable of running off with anyone's BCH.  .
2	1522779431	1	BCH people are the least gullible.
2	1522772144	0	considering those that are for bitcoin are by and large the early adopters, technically literate, and long time users; I think he would have better luck with the btc-core newbies who don't undertstand almost any of bitcoin. 
3	1522778047	1	I don't pretend to know the mind of CW, which group he thinks is gullible, or why.
1	1522773696	1	I can certainly understand that! I'm curious though - do you personally condemn Craig Wright for lying about being Satoshi and providing forged proof?
0	1522753060	207	Great respect to Buterin for speaking this out loud.CSW is just a fraud, nothing more.
1	1522779499	1	Your comment received 207 upvotes, the fact that core trolls are brigading your comment should tell you something about the veracity of your convictions.
1	1522775247	8	yes! And no amount of astroturfing/mental gymnastics can convince me otherwise
2	1522779956	1	The most ridiculous thing is that the guy still gets invited to crypto events...I mean for fucks sake it is like inviting freaking Madoff to an investment conference.
1	1522778672	2	Everyone should encourage /u/memorydealers to step up and do the same.>Great respect to Buterin for speaking this out loud.
2	1522779367	1	> Everyone should encourage /u/memorydealers to step up and do the same.This indeed is trolling, but valid trolling to some point, so I give you 4/10 for that.I heard lately that Ver is a supporter of Wright (he really wants him to be Satoshi, or something ?), so he has his flaws.But this is not a problem, because we - early Bitcoin adopters - are here for original Satoshi's vision and real Bitcoin(Cash), not any particular person.
1	1522762488	-19	Who did he defraud? Who is the victim of fraud?  Don't call someone a fraud unless there is a victim.
2	1522774447	5	How can someone not be considered a fraud for lying about being someone he's not? If I claimed to be Amelia Earhart then I feel you should justifiably call me a fraud and a liar. What would you call this instead?
3	1522775151	1	An imposter is a better word I think if that is what people want to imply.
4	1522776111	1	Now ask yourself the question - what are some possible reasons to impersonate Satoshi?
3	1522776559	0	If you were getting press attention and getting paid for giving speeches as Amelia Earhart, you’d be a fraud and a liar.See where this is going?
4	1522777701	2	Um, not really to be honest. Care to explain it to my feeble mind?  Craig has certainly gotten media attention for claiming to be Satoshi.
2	1522763083	43	He's definitely getting paid because he's pretending to be Satoshi. He's stealing all our time. He's making a fool out of the entire Bitcoin Cash effort. Don't pretend there are no victims here. 
3	1522763732	5	He is definitely getting paid because he is pretending to be Satoshi? Do you have any evidence to back up this wild claim?
4	1522764833	5	Well he certainly **got** paid by nTrust. 
5	1522766888	3	Maybe because he proved to them he was Satoshi and he decided he didn't want to prove it to random redditors?
6	1522768388	5	> ‘The deal had the following components: clear the outstanding debts that were preventing Wright’s business from getting back on its feet, and work with the new lawyers on getting the agreements in place for the transfer of any non-corporate intellectual property, and work with the lawyers to get Craig’s story rights.’ **From that point on, the ‘Satoshi revelation’ would be part of the deal. ‘It was the cornerstone of the commercialisation plan,’** Matthews said, ‘with about ten million sunk into the Australian debts and setting up in London.’They literally [call](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-729.989-732.0) it the **CORNERSTONE** of the commercialization plan. 
7	1522770771	5	Is there any lawsuit from ntrust against Craig for defrauding them? Its the cornerstone of the "commercialization" plan, not the entire deal, so your bolded part is misleading.  Are you privy to all the details of their plan?  Maybe plans change? Maybe the plan is in progress?  But you want to go ahead and spam the internet about how someone is a fraud about a situation and partnership of which you have no involvement.  Pretty strange you are so dedicated to anti-csw trolling [as this post explains](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7s20u0/ucontrarian_is_the_guy_that_spams_every_csw/).
8	1522771147	-3	That post was [debunked](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7s20u0/ucontrarian_is_the_guy_that_spams_every_csw/dt1o8ce/) here. > But you want to go ahead and spam the internet about how someone is a fraud about a situation and partnership of which you have no involvementI wasn't even using this as an example of how he's a fraud, but instead just as evidence that he got paid (in part) for his claim to be Satoshi. That is, he had good *motive* to pretend to be Satoshi. 
9	1522771322	4	Do you have proof he is not Satoshi? What do you think about prominent people like [Ian Grigg](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6lfz1o/ian_grigg_says_craig_wright_and_dave_kleiman_was/), [Gavin Andresen](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi), and [Jon Matonis](https://medium.com/@jonmatonis/how-i-met-satoshi-96e85727dc5a), all vouching for him being Satoshi, based on cryptographic **as well as other evidence**. 
9	1522771520	4	Why would nTrust pay someone for fake proof? nTrust is a company which is competing against other companies. I highly doubt they would pay someone for life rights without doing their due dilligence.
5	1522767508	1	So...because he received a payment, at some point in time, from N trust. He's being paid by N chain to be Satoshi?That sounds about as legitimate as your bullshit time zone accusation.
6	1522767636	2	> ‘The deal had the following components: clear the outstanding debts that were preventing Wright’s business from getting back on its feet, and work with the new lawyers on getting the agreements in place for the transfer of any non-corporate intellectual property, and work with the lawyers to get Craig’s story rights.’ **From that point on, the ‘Satoshi revelation’ would be part of the deal. ‘It was the cornerstone of the commercialisation plan,’** Matthews said, ‘with about ten million sunk into the Australian debts and setting up in London.’They literally [call](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-729.989-732.0) it the **CORNERSTONE** of the commercialization plan.

3	1522769506	-1	Your comment was a waste of time. Does that make you LITERALLY GUILTY OF FRAUD?
3	1522769548	-4	Fuck off faggot.
2	1522763108	25	> fraud: wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain.  If *fakeproving* to be Satoshi doesn't fit that definition, I don't know what does...
3	1522765845	11	That's a different meaning of the word.  He said CSW **is a fraud**, *not* **CSW is guilty of fraud**.In this context the word means someone who is not what they claim; a charlatan.
3	1522763688	8	He never fakeproved anything.  Stop continuing this lie about fake proof.  There was never fake proof, and it really is annoying me.  I made a thread about how there was never a "fake proof" like people are claiming: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6na1ks/craig_wright_never_provided_a_fake_satoshi/
4	1522765024	12	[Bullshit](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-2501.0-2505.153). > (Interviewer:) ‘So what happened on Monday,’ I asked, ‘when it came to writing that blog?’> (Craig:) ‘I gave them the wrong thing,’ he said. ‘Then they changed it. Then I didn’t correct it because I was so angry. Which was stupid. I put up the wrong one.
5	1522765120	8	That proves nothing Contrarian.  You are a known anti-csw shill: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7s20u0/ucontrarian_is_the_guy_that_spams_every_csw/
6	1522765235	12	That thread was nicely debunked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7s20u0/ucontrarian_is_the_guy_that_spams_every_csw/dt1o8ce/).Give **one** example of how my evidence is bad. By the way, the OP of that post seems to be a [shill](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7s20u0/ucontrarian_is_the_guy_that_spams_every_csw/dt1t5m6/) himself. Ironic.
7	1522767608	-5	Was not debunked at all and if someone clicks on your link they won't see a debunk...
8	1522767723	5	They are free to judge for themselves. Go ahead, give me **one** example of where my evidence is bad, then.
7	1522771801	-5	I'm the OP of that post and I'm not a shill. Everything I have said there stands. You basically discard CSW as fraud because he refused to come out as Satoshi. Wired wrote a piece on him without even asking for his permission. Since you are confident in your thesis I challenge you to a live interview in Youtube, face to face. Show us your face and I will show mine so you know I'm not a shill.Either way none of this which happened back in 2015 is relevant to the discussion on the panel, so it's completely off topic and a distraction. Everything CSW said on the panel is spot on.
8	1522773645	2	People don't need permission to report facts about someone.  
9	1522774095	1	> People don't need permission to report facts about someone.Which part in my comment does that refer to?
6	1522768347	0	The laughing stock that is the BCH community fighting amongst themselves...*sips champagne*
7	1522775849	1	*champaign
4	1522764661	7	Even if it wasn't *fakeprove*, it was still deceptive...
5	1522764790	1	I agree it was deceptive and weird, but maybe he has his reasons.  I have thought of and seen others suggest (some who were present at private signing sessions) there could actually be an easter egg hidden in the cryptic blog post that may indeed prove that he holds the Satoshi keys. That would be interesting.
6	1522766754	13	stop making up shit.
7	1522777778	1	Isn't that what Reddit is for? 
7	1522768651	-1	What did I make up?
8	1522769609	4	> there could actually be an easter egg hidden in the cryptic blog post that may indeed prove that he holds the Satoshi keys. That would be interesting.The more he fails to prove his claims, the more bullshit you come up with. CSW either proves it, or shuts the fuck up.
9	1522769756	1	LOL, what bro
6	1522773035	2	I, too, have talked to multiple people who have seen private "proof," and what they describe seeing is never convincing.
6	1522776158	0	The Russian judges give you a 9.5 on your mental gymnastics.  
4	1522773501	1	He claims he was satoshi in that archives post.   He should probably not do that.  Especially if he can't sign it. 
5	1522778314	1	He also embarrassingly explained how he came up with the name Satoshi Nakamoto in one of the other conferences last year. Apparently he had a Japanese carer or something when he was young, he chose a Japanese name as he though his childhood carer would think it was cool. 
2	1522763050	13	He's using it in the colloquial sense of 'fake'.>Fraud - noun: a person or thing intended to deceive others, typically by unjustifiably claiming or being credited with accomplishments or qualities.
2	1522770933	5	Oh you seem to be confused and think that fraud requires a victim. It doesn’t.
3	1522771022	1	Ohh so you just drink Core Koolaid and can invent your own reality?  Here is [the definition of fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud):> In law, fraud is deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a **victim** of a legal right. 
4	1522777213	1	You’re confusing the criminal act of fraud (prosecutable) with a person that is acting fraudulently.  Big difference.  Maybe it would just be easier to call him a liar and be done with it.  
2	1522764074	10	apart from the thread being heavily brigaded, if you had say a shit load of bitcoin, im sure you wouldnt give a shit if people thought you were a fraud. in fact, im sure you would put forward evidence to discredit yourself to being that person that people were outing you asCSW is at least part of Satoshi. We know that much.
3	1522766232	14	We actually don't know that CSW was a part of Satoshi, unless there is some evidence that hasn't been fabricated that I'm unaware of.
3	1522764313	4	Good point
2	1522763332	8	"Fraud" is probably wrong word. English is not my first language. Sorry for that.The word I was looking for is probably "crook".
3	1522765964	17	Fraud is absolutely the correct word.
3	1522763633	-3	LOL, no crook is even worse.  If you want to be upset because he never publicly proved to be Satoshi then ok, but he really doesn't owe anyone anything.  The only thing he did that people can complain is he made it seem like he was going to prove publicly then he backed out.
4	1522767554	1	Can you help me out here? wtf are people talking about? Is the "fraud" that he said he was Satoshi and then failed to prove it? 
5	1522774654	2	> Is the "fraud" that he said he was Satoshi and then failed to prove it?It depends on your definition of “failed”. If Craig had made the claim and then not provided any evidence people would have dismissed it telling him to prove it or fuck off.But what Craig *actually* did was try to present evidence in the form of pgp keys, a message signed with an early Bitcoin private key, and old blog posts where he’d written about Bitcoin in its earliest days. All of that evidence was shown to be fake.Basically he was caught red handed trying to fool people into believing he was Satoshi, and some people here are trying to fool the rest of us into believing they are stupid enough to still believe him.
5	1522768529	0	Yes apparently, although that doesn't seem like fraud to me.  So people are just parroting a narrative.  His blog never provided fake proof as everyone is claiming either: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6na1ks/craig_wright_never_provided_a_fake_satoshi/
5	1522773016	0	Failed to prove to the world, but did prove to a few.
5	1522770163	-1	Additionally he apparently showed some private proof to Gavin Andersen, an early bitcoiner that many people trust: https://www.ccn.com/gavin-andersen-craig-wright-blog-mistake/This one still has me scratching my head, honestly. Craig is also [being sued](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/26/17055102/craig-wright-satoshi-lawsuit-dave-kleiman-stolen-bitcoin) for allegedly stealing btc from his former partner's estate after his death. My best totally will and unsubstantiated guess is that Craig Wright actually was involved in the early creation of bitcoin and that "Satoshi" was never actually a single person. It doesn't mean that Craig invented bitcoin himself, just that he may have been around and he or his former partner maybe did some of the early mining or somehow got access to a key for the proof to Gavin. One of many possibilities
6	1522771698	3	> Additionally he apparently showed some private proof to Gavin Andersen, an early bitcoiner that many people trust: https://www.ccn.com/gavin-andersen-craig-wright-blog-mistake/> Yeah, that's it. This is why I am calling him a crook.He tried to cheat all of us into believing he is Satoshi and then gain from it. Lucky he failed. We (mostly) did not buy it. Probably dodged a bullet there. Who knows what would happen if the world started to believe this crook actually is Satoshi.
2	1522767540	2	Gavin is a victim of CSW
3	1522768608	3	Do you speak for Gavin? Has he publicly said he is a victim?  Craig Wright said on slack that he likes Gavin and they are friends and still talk, so why should we judge? Maybe Gavin thinks he is Satoshi?  Gavin said there was [other evidence not just cryptographic evidence that he was Satoshi](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi)
2	1522764145	-11	Look at all the bcash victims they are bag holders because some think that faketoshi represents Satoshi 
3	1522764159	12	Redditor /u/bitking74 has low karma in this subreddit.
3	1522764392	4	LOL, yes so victim that is why I [even predicted and advocated Bitcoin Cash before it existed](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68jja0/dont_forget_money_and_bitcoin_are_just_a_ledger/dgyysp0/), and basically was an influential person helping launch the currency.  Because I am so clueless and just blindly follow fraudsters huh? Nice straw man.
2	1522767306	-1	Satoshi.
3	1522768638	1	how?
4	1522770199	1	By saying he (CSW) invented something Satoshi invented. This is not very complicated.
5	1522770416	1	He reluctantly admitted he invented Bitcoin after hackers outed him.  You cannot really prove that he is not Satoshi and that he did not invent it, and actually there is a decent amount of evidence he is.  Prominent people like [Ian Grigg](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6lfz1o/ian_grigg_says_craig_wright_and_dave_kleiman_was/), [Gavin Andresen](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi), and [Jon Matonis](https://medium.com/@jonmatonis/how-i-met-satoshi-96e85727dc5a), all vouched for him being Satoshi, based on cryptographic and other evidence. 
6	1522770707	0	I'm glad you agree that he is defrauding Satoshi.
7	1522770836	1	Ohh yes drink Core Koolaid, and then you can just imagine your own reality. 
8	1522771106	1	You stopped trying to convince us that he isn't defrauding anyone and jumped to your second bullet point on your job description in "*Defend CSW engineer*" so I can only assume you gave up that point.
9	1522771234	1	I don't have to convince anyone he isn't defrauding anyone, because no person has offered any proof he has defrauded someone.  Its not up to me to prove a negative.  You should prove your claims.
1	1522767765	-5	Sounds like you are the type to play "leadership politics". Some people think for themselves, but most prefer to follow leaders - just look at people every four years arguing over it.You just happen to cheer for Vitalik, who is probably wrong about more things than CSW. Most people here don't cheer for either, and evaluate statements from each on a case by case basis.
2	1522771614	1	> Sounds like you are the type to play "leadership politics". I am sorry, but I don't even know what that means.
2	1522772246	0	Oh BTW, I am not a leader type if that is what you mean. I am more of a "I'm-gonna-point-out-what's-wrong-here-and-get-angry" type.
0	1522750070	40	Did shit just get real? Need updates.
1	1522753265	47	He's just saying what everyone has been thinking. Kudos to him for doing so. There are limits to how polite and tolerant you can be to a professional bullshitter's bullshit without addressing it, before it threatens your own credibility.
2	1522757428	12	I think Samson Mow is a lot more dubious...
3	1522763929	9	He is, but that's still no excuse.
2	1522753590	-3	Not everyone, maybe you and a bunch of other people like you but not people like me. Vitalik also says that non mining nodes matter which is absolute nonsense, that clients want to verify their transcations themselves, nonsense. And that he finds a security model that considers 100% of miners honest troubling, nonsense. Miners have an incentive to stay honest. On top of that he said CSW is a fraud, I don't get how that is relevant to any of the points CSW makes. But fine apparently some of you are stuck in 2015 and still don't understand what is going on.

But fine apparently some of you are stuck in 2015 and still don't understand what is going on.Quoting the full post, for everyone to see just how little you understand about Bitcoin.Given that there are so many cutting edge experts making the same claims as Vitalik, did it ever occur to you that perhaps you don't fully understand what's going on? Don't bother answering, rhetorical question.&nbsp;Oh, and CSW is a fraud. OK, if you really don't like *fraud*, how about clown? Or muppet? Do you like these better?
4	1522778933	0	Ok so your post boils down to this:>"do you really think you know more than vitalik?"Well, about those specific statements yes. If vitalik says miners can be dishonest then he doesn't understand the bitcoin economy. >Oh, and CSW is a fraud. yeah sure. Wanna repeat it one more time? Maybe it sticks.
3	1522754530	2	> On top of that he said CSW is a fraud, I don't get how that is relevant to any of the points CSW makes.Regardless of how we feel about it, it's relevant to why he is a big name, why he is at the conference, and why people listen to him. The question is insulting, but valid.As for the two things you've called nonsense. Meh, I consider them to be self-evident facts and it's been discussed to death here before so I don't feel like getting into it and won't be able to cover any new ground.
4	1522754834	3	not valid, since we are talking about bitcoin. Everyone is laying their arguments and in the middle of the debate you bring up something from your adversary's personal life, to me that sounds more like you are losing the debate. Everything Buterin said about CSW's claims (except of LN which isn't clear what he was talking about) is false, in other words CSW's claims about mining nodes, user validation, network topology, and honest miners are true. Vitalik called them out for being ABSOLUTELY FALSE and then launched a personal attack. Why? If you want to attack him, after the conference, once the debate is over post a vlog saying why was this fraud even allowed here.
4	1522767436	0	There are two types of people: those that think for themselves, and those that look to leaders. Most people, including yourself, fall into the second category. You are currently looking up to Vitalik, so you are going after people who seem to listen to Craig. Problem is, a lot of people here are in the first group that thinks for themselves, and don't care about your "leadership politics"
0	1522751773	227	CSW is fraud from the day he claimed to be the satoshi, cheated Gavin Andresen, and then posted article with fake signature. Fraud and lies all the way. It's really pathetic that he got so many followers on /r/btc just by saying what they want to hear
1	1522756612	60	>CSW is fraud from the day he claimed to be the satoshi,I couldn’t care less about his claim to be Satoshi.. His behavior raise many red flags even without that.
2	1522761737	28	Okay, I have to chip in and I think I mentioned this before. I don't care if he has a PhD in computer science or is Satoshi whatsoever. In the end what counts is what does he bring to the table. He can give presentations, tweet, or publish papers. But, of course, he should be also questioned as well -  in a constructive manner. I don't think we put him on the pedestal. Time will tell if he going to contribute to the BCH community. I have a more pragmatic approach to this matter.
3	1522762169	22	Given how much deception there is in the community, especially people pretending to be pro-Bitcoin while secretly trying to cripple it, it's pragmatic to be wary. People are being way too generous with CSW given that he has already engaged in deception (pretending to be Satoshi). There's just no need to keep giving some random sketchy person so many chances.
4	1522762814	7	> It's pragmatic to be wary.I agree
4	1522768706	-3	> People are being way too generous with CSWWe don't need your advice. You are way too slanderous with CSW. Stupid infight. He does research, organizes funding of development and the demand to get him as a speaker on conferences is very high. 
3	1522763329	12	His PhD is in Theology just fyi.EDIT: After more research I can't actually say that he even has a PhD at all, let alone in Theology. That is just a claim he himself made and no further evidence is available. There is only evidence of 3 Masters degrees from CSU. Even those are questionable because it was the university that he worked for.
4	1522763755	3	No, he just recently got one in information security or something. 
5	1522767793	2	So that means he doesn't have one in Theology? 
6	1522767923	7	I think that was not a PhD supposedly. It was a 'doctorate-level' degree, though. He's released no evidence of it either way. Edit: (No evidence that I'm aware of.)
7	1522770416	3	Wright says his PhD is in theology, comparative religious and classical studies, achieved in 2003 with a dissertation titled "Gnarled roots of a creation theory". Wright claimed to have a PhD in computer science from Charles Sturt University on his LinkedIn profile. But the university told Forbes that it only awarded him two master's degrees and not a doctorate.
8	1522770632	5	> Wright claimed to have a PhD in computer science from Charles Sturt University on his LinkedIn profile. But the university told Forbes that it only awarded him two master's degrees and not a doctorate.This **was** true. He lied about having his PhD *then*. However, in 2017, he appears to have actually received a PhD.
9	1522771290	2	Are you [sure](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/659wk9/craig_s_wrights_ph_d_thesis_submitted_to_charles/)?
5	1522768419	1	> or somethingYou even don't know what he got. 
6	1522768670	2	Point to evidence showing what subject the PhD was awarded for. I've seen the thesis myself, and it looks like information security to me. 
3	1522776761	1	As Craig himself is so fond of saying.. All that really matters is the work.  So, in keeping with Bitcoin.. I'll wait for *proof of work* before i judge the guy.  Lets see what happens in the next year or so. 
1	1522759147	23	The person who will regret his poor choices the most regarding Wright will be Roger Ver. He keeps vainly trying to defend Wright because he desperately wants him to be Satoshi. This is a sad to watch when it was obvious to any rational person that Wright is a scammer. He’s not even a very good scammer. Having Wright extolled here by many members as some kind of ‘leader’ has driven away a small but significant portion of very smart people away from actively working on Bitcoin Cash.  Charlatans like Wright exist in many areas of society and it’s always sad to watch how they invariably manage to fool those who don’t have technical knowledge. As you can imagine the fields of politics, religion, and ‘social’ sciences are filled with them.  
2	1522762366	14	No one think CSW as leader here. In fact there is no leader. You must be confused with Corea sub.
2	1522765510	8	It is because of Roger Ver endorsing him that he has managed to get a stage and legitimacy.I think Roger Ver knows he isn’t Satoshi. I’m not sure if he thought so from the start or if he got conned. But the pendulum seems to be swinging back now and people like me that have supported Bitcoin Cash since years back and been saying he is a scammer since he started are finally not downvoted to oblivion.I think the reason he doesn’t say it is because he is afraid it will ruin his reputation or that he has some sort of deal with him. If he really cared about Bitcoin he should tell everyone he is a fraud and is not to be trusted. That way maybe we could expel both this scammer and his company nChain from the community and give Bitcoin Cash more legitimacy.Right now is the perfect time.
3	1522771648	1	all that needs to be done is to simply stop inviting him to events like this
2	1522764938	6	Wright as a leader? Nobody here sees Wright as a leader. >has driven away a small but significant portion of smart peopleHuh? All I am seeing is increasing adoption and interest in Bitcoin Cash. Most smart people and true bitcoiners from the early days are endorsing Bitcoin Cash now and working on it.Do you like making up facts?You can’t just throw shit to the wall and see what sticks.Again: We do not give a single fuck about CSW or anybody else. All most of us value is the effort people put into BCH to make it the best money there is.
2	1522760398	6	Don’t forget Calvin Ayre.  The whole public face of Bitcoin Cash is a scammy mess.
3	1522765904	6	They are not leaders, they are just rich/popular supporters of BCH. And BCH is permissionless, anyone can be part of it, its kind of the point of Bitcoin...
4	1522768413	8	I didn’t say they were leaders.  You can’t argue that Ver/Wright/Ayre are the most prominent public personalities representing BCH.  Ver/Wu are the driving force for BCH, no?  Not leaders, but certainly figure-heads.
5	1522770648	2	I have no problems with Ver or Wu. Only craig is controversial for me. Regardless, I support the BCH code and thus the blockchain it runs. If the code gets changed to something I disagree with, I will move to another blockchain.
2	1522778975	1	Its actually quite good for Roger that he's pro-CSW. From watching all his interviews, he gets a lot of crap from people, and most of it doesn't seem to bother him, but the thing that seems to get under his skin the most is the accusation that he pays people to agree with him. Its very obvious that nearly 100% of both halvs of the Bitcoin community and most of the altcoin communities are anti-CSW. If Roger really was paying people to spread his message, then the pro-CSW people make up the population of people he pays. Since pro-CSW is such a minority opinion, it kind of proves that Ver doesn't pay (many) people to agree with him. The more minority opinions he takes, the more it proves that he doesn't pay people to retweet his opinions.

You can't make it as simple as saying "just give me the cryptographic proof".
2	1522758117	25	> might not want to come out as Satoshi    Are you for real? Craig has been trying to convince everyone that he is Satoshi, only the fools buy it.
3	1522760087	4	Perhaps after he was outed as Satoshi, he really wanted to come out. He certainly didn't before that. Anyway, that's when he showed it undeniably to a bunch of guys that matter. Then something happened, and he suddenly had to make it seem like he's not Satoshi. Perhaps we get the full story someday.Meanwhile, please explain how he signed a message of Gavin's choosing with a vanilla laptop without having Satoshi's private keys. Also, please explain the emails between Craig and Kleiman and Kleiman's estate. Explain the 2007 Wright, Kleiman & Sundhar [paper](https://www.vidarholen.net/~vidar/overwriting_hard_drive_data.pdf). There's plenty of interesting material right [here](https://www.scribd.com/document/372485868/Bitcoin-Wright-Kleiman-Lawsuit).Not really related, but right after Gavin endorsed CSW, his admin rights to the Bitcoin github were taken away. That's kind of interesting too, no?

5	1522772747	2	*Wright, Andresen says, offered to perform the second test, signing a message of Andresen's choosing with a key from the first "block" of 50 coins ever claimed by a Bitcoin miner, in this case Nakamoto himself. (He also performed a similar test for Jon Matonis, a former board member of the Bitcoin Foundation, and a reporter for the Economist, the magazine says, using both the first and ninth Bitcoin blocks.) Andresen says he demanded that the signature be checked on a completely new, clean computer. "I didn’t trust them not to monkey with the hardware," says Andresen.Andresen says an administrative assistant working with Wright left to buy a computer from a nearby store, and returned with what Andresen describes as a Windows laptop in a "factory-sealed" box. They installed the Bitcoin software Electrum on that machine. For their test, Andresen chose the message "Gavin's favorite number is eleven." Wright added his initials, "CSW," and signed the message on his own computer. Then he put the signed message on a USB stick belonging to Andresen and they transferred it to the new laptop, where Andresen checked the signature.At first, the Electrum software's verification of the signature mysteriously failed. But then Andresen noticed that they'd accidentally left off Wright's initials from the message they were testing, and checked again: The signature was valid."It’s certainly possible I was bamboozled," Andresen says. "I could spin stories of how they hacked the hotel Wi-fi so that the insecure connection gave us a bad version of the software. But that just seems incredibly unlikely. It seems the simpler explanation is that this person is Satoshi."*https://www.wired.com/2016/05/craig-wright-privately-proved-hes-bitcoins-creator/
6	1522774704	2	I believe that article supports my description of the conditions.>please explain how he signed a message of Gavin's choosing>>Wright modified the message before signing. At best, the message was only partially chosen by Gavin.>>>  For their test, Andresen chose the message "Gavin's favorite number is eleven." **Wright added his initials, "CSW,"** and signed the message on his own computer.>with a vanilla laptop>>An ostensibly new-in-box laptop furinished by one of Wrights associates.>>>Andresen says **an administrative assistant working with Wright** left to buy a computer from a nearby store, and returned with what Andresen describes as a Windows laptop in a "factory-sealed" box.Gavin presumably cannot validate the signature generated during the demonstration outside of that context and environment. That appears to be the intent of the conditions. Even assuming absolutely honesty on Gavin's part, under the conditions of the demonstration, it is unreasonable to assume he was capable of thoroughly validating the signature or that it had been generated using a specific keypair associated with the genesis block.Without corroborating evidence, there is no reason to believe Gavin's attestation of the signature. To do so is antithetical to the concept of cryptographic  proof.
3	1522760889	3	That is the core troll mantra, so it must be true!
3	1522758758	0	So true...
4	1522759150	3	monero troll...
2	1522775364	0	> You only need to read a bit into Craig's history to grasp why he might not want to come out as Satoshi^ This 
2	1522774684	1	I don't understand why he would only sign messages in private for people.   Jon also doesn't seem to understand just how important the cryptographic verification was, given that he comes away with only a feeling that he met SN.   Signing messages would be inevitable proof, not a piece of evidence to consider.  
3	1522776877	0	He wants plausible deniability. For tax reasons or whatever. It seems someone blackmailed CSW, trying to out him as Satoshi. He certainly made such a threat useless.This is all conjecture, but CSW refusing a public proof is compatible with him being Satoshi. There are more possibilities than blackmail. Maybe he wanted to protect (the family of) the rest of team Satoshi and decided to be the scape goat. Or he didn't want to die and take his secret to his grave (like other early bitcoin people), but needed deniability nonetheless.
4	1522777096	4	The tax man doesn't care if you're dancing around the bush.  I don't buy that reasoning either.  Until he signs a current headline with a verifiable key, I'm going to go ahead and consider anyone defending him as SN to be entirely misinformed about the point of private key encryption.   
1	1522752325	4	he didn't cheat Gavin..
2	1522759846	10	Why involve Gavin at all in that process? 
3	1522761288	-3	I didn't involve gavin, the guy said CSW cheated even Gavin and I pointed out that he didn't lie to Gavin
4	1522761661	6	I was questioning why CSW would involve Gavin.
5	1522761722	-7	He didn't involve Gavin..not sure where you got that. The comment here said CSW is a fraud and even cheated gavin that's where it started
6	1522761850	9	> He didn't involve Gavin..not sure where you got that.He did involve Gavin and Jon Matonis as witnesses of proof in being Satoshi.
7	1522762058	-3	Oh ok. Well this discussion belongs back to 2015 so I don't really know the details. But my guess because he was connected to Gavin, and Gavin is expert enough to not be fooled. So he probably thought proving it to Gavin, Jon and other experts would suffice instead of providing public proof which could get him in trouble. His adversaries exploited every bit of that to attack his rep.Edit:  He also offered to do the same with gregory maxwell, but gregory maxwell never accepted the invite.
8	1522762451	8	If he wasn't ready to come forth with absolute proof to the public then he shouldn't have gotten other people to vouch for him. 
9	1522762618	1	He was pushed to come out publicly, he didn't push for it.He didn't ask anyone to vouch for him, he said come I will prove it to you in person. Those people, like Gavin, reported what happened in their presence. That's it.
2	1522752959	12	> he didn't cheat Gavin..Maybe he did ? How do you know ?FYI: They did **not** actually test Satoshi GPG signatures on Gavin's laptop.Do you know that Gavin agreed that CSW is going to "buy" a "fresh", "clean" laptop to check the signatures on ?Gavin basically got played like child.CSW is a fraud, nothing more. And you are his sockpuppet (or him in person).
3	1522753269	16	Because at least Gavin would have figured it out by now. ANYWAY..when CSW says :1) non mining nodes do not matter (true)2) miners have an incentive to stay honest (true)3) I as a client don't to validate transactions (true, I want them to be reliable I don't have time to validate)4) *I'm still trying to figure out what CSW said about LN that Vitalik found as absolutely false*How is "this guy is a fraud" because he didn't provide public proof that he is Satoshi back in 2015, relevant as a counter argument? If you're okay with what Vitalik did so be it. I'm disgusted by it. 
4	1522761935	6	He might say some stuff you agree with. However, when he goes beyond those points he delves into complete nonsense. Almost **all** of the people who knows about these networks at a high level, across communities (even within BCH) agree he is a fraud making wild technical claims in east and west without logical coherent arguments. Then gullible people buy it because he talks with confidence and uses some technobabble that sounds impressive.You are free to keep warping your own reality to suspend the disbelief that he isn't a complete fraud and could plausibly be Satoshi, but I don't think aligning with *obvious* pretenders will serve anyone good in the long run. If you go down this road you will only drive away the people that actually have some legitimate pedigree, like Peter Rizun. Good luck waiting for his 800 patents that break the laws of physics and will only be allowed on BCH or recovering when every developer worth his salt has moved on from the technical dumpster fire.
5	1522762310	0	All people like who? nChain? SBI group? Gavin? Gavin said if anyone attacks csw for being a fraud that says a lot more about them than csw. Peter was proven wrong by CSE on Selfish mining already. Also, Peter has been accusing Csw of not knowing what memorylessness when the debate showed that peter was the one speaking of head starts in mining.
6	1522763584	4	Just in that video Vitalik and Joseph Poon pointed out he was spouting nonsensical technobabble.Paul Sztorc did a breakdown of one of his papers a while ago if you are interested in more something more substantive but it seems you have already made up your mind that all these guys are just out to get him.
7	1522766490	2	The one spouting nonsense is vitalik saying that non mining nodes are relevant for security and that assuming miners are honest is a security threat. I've nothing against Vitalik, but he was wrong plain and simple. LN is nonsense because it take a complete network and turns into a mesh network creating a routing problem which bitcoin never had and will never have on chain. Everyone has agreed with these points all along now Vitalik shows up says the opposite and everyone agrees with him because he calls CSW a fraud.
8	1522767316	4	Lol, alright man. It must be a giant conspiracy to discredit the real Satoshi!
4	1522758225	4	1) They do matter when you are accepting 0-conf txs and need to verify them3) The ones that you are receiving, one has an interest in verifying
5	1522760869	3	can't you just query a number of spv nodes and get virtually the same level of verification with almost 0 resource use? 
6	1522762619	2	Yes...but if you are a large retailer, you may be rate limited and you would just be depending on others' nodes. You could just run your own.So this would likely be fine for small businesses, but mid to large businesses would likely run their own.
7	1522762775	2	well yes. at large scale absolutely run your own node...but it's not a necessity by any means
5	1522759044	3	1) No they don't matter mining nodes do that better and faster, non miners just slow down the network. And if miners who make long term investments could be "dishonest" according to Vitalik, non mining nodes are 1000x times easier to corrupt. This is really nonsense to even be discussing after all this time.2) Yeah, I'm receiving a payment and if I have to verify every payment I would rather use credit cards. I'm not a nerd who like to verify tx one by one, I'm a merchant I want a reliable solution not a DIY solution.
6	1522759491	7	Businesses would have an interest in verifying incoming 0-conf transactions since they will be the ones that will have attempted double spends directed toward them.I never suggested that a normal user should run a node.BTW - miners have nothing to do with 0-conf txs. They have no power over them. It's not fucking hard to run a node. Have you ever done so?
7	1522759930	2	> Businesses would have an interest in verifying incoming 0-conf transactions since they will be the ones that will have attempted double spends directed toward them.Do you verify incoming cc transactions?>BTW - miners have nothing to do with 0-conf txs. They have no power over them. It's not fucking hard to run a node. Have you ever done so?Yes miners have power because can scan for double spends in the utxo pool. Non mining nodes make this process slower. I don't care if it's easy, it slows the network down and it is useless.
8	1522762782	2	1. That's a dumb ass question because you do, by verifying with the fucking credit card company at the point of purchase. Ever heard of a cc being rejected?2. Miners are on their own network which quickly disseminates to the remaining miners. Miners aren't slowed down.
9	1522767046	1	It's dumb of you to think the merchant is verifying, the merchant accepts the payment and the network tells him if it's good to go.Same with 0-conf, the merchant accepts and the network tells him if confirmed or rejected. Exactly because miners are on their own network nodes are irrelevant.

5	1522753795	8	You must have a really sad life to think this way. ANYWAY the topic switch came from Vitalik and you, the guy (CSW) is talking about mining, network topology, scaling. And you bring up this guy is a fraud to discredit him, it shows your true colors not his.
5	1522754376	7	You realize you sound like a retard when every sentence you say says: “fraud says fraud and who cares about fraud because fraud“?You’re literally failing to convince anyone of your viewpoint.

Who is the victim of the fraud?  Pretty sure Gavin and csw are still friends. [Jon Matonis has also vouched for him](https://medium.com/@jonmatonis/how-i-met-satoshi-96e85727dc5a).

He faked [blog posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80ryvc/craig_wright_2008_august_26_blog_post_i_have_a/duxwsyk/)2. He faked [PGP keys](https://medium.com/@tbrice/wrights-appeal-to-authority-paper-disproved-its-own-thesis-8f2d45e5df24)3. He faked [contracts and emails](http://blog.wizsec.jp/2018/02/kleiman-v-craig-wright-bitcoins.html)4. He faked [threats](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80o2xf/its_time_for_another_reminder_craig_wright_is_not/duxbjuw/) 5. He faked [a public key signing](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/05/craig-wright-s-proof-he-invented-bitcoin-is-basically-a-canadian-girlfriend.html)6. He has a [well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related](https://www.scribd.com/document/372445546/Bitcoin-Lawsuit) (see numbers 88 through 102)7. His own mother [admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-1655.0-1655.94)And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:1. He has provided no independently verifiable evidence2. He is not [technically competent](http://archive.is/6C3C9) in the subject matter3. His [writing style](http://seclists.org/basics/2008/Mar/42) is nothing like [Satoshi's](http://satoshinakamoto.me/)4. He [called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011](https://theconversation.com/lulzsec-anonymous-freedom-fighters-or-the-new-face-of-evil-2605#comment_6162) when Satoshi never used a space5. He [actively bought and traded coins](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hx3q9/according_to_the_mtgox_leaks_from_early_2014_our/) from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 20146. He was [paid millions](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-729.989-732.0) for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive

2	1522773073	-1	What does this proof? Maybe he edit a post but that´s no fraud or did he harm someone with this?
3	1522773455	4	It proves fraud, deceit, trickery, to gain dishonest advantage, fame, power within the crypto community.**fraud**noun1. deceit, trickery, sharp practice, or breach of confidence, perpetrated for profit or to gain some unfair or dishonest advantage.2. a particular instance of such deceit or trickery: mail fraud; election frauds.3. any deception, trickery, or humbug: That diet book is a fraud and a waste of time.4. a person who makes deceitful pretenses; sham; poseur.http://www.dictionary.com/browse/fraud?s=t http://www.dictionary.com/browse/pretense?s=t > did he harm someone with thisAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.CSW is an unrepentant fraudster, and his 2016 Satoshi fraud hits at the core of cryptocurrency.He can't be trusted, and he shouldn't be the public face of BCH, and he shouldn't be given power & influence in the BCH community.If CSW really cares about BCH, then he should recognize that his name & image is toxic, he should step out of the public eye, and just do his BCH work in private, and publish his work under the nTrust / nChain name.  The public can still read his whitepapers.
1	1522765011	4	[Contrarian__ is the guy that spams every CSW comment with 6-7 FALSE arguments. Here is FULL proof that his arguments are FALLACIES.

3	1522765541	3	You link to some blog claiming [this paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6932u2/appeal_to_authority_a_failure_of_trust_still/) was debunked: https://medium.com/@tbrice/wrights-appeal-to-authority-paper-disproved-its-own-thesis-8f2d45e5df24When all it says is the time stamps were removed.  There are many logical reasons for this.  Its much safer to not include timestamps when creating keys because entropy could be associated with your clock on computer while creating keys.  Then one possible attack vector could be to analyze time stamps and try to reverse engineer the entropy and key.  So you just link to some frivolous long winded blogs that say basically nothing and then claim you debunked the failure of trust paper.  Its bullshit, stop with your propaganda bullshit.
4	1522765810	2	> When all it says is the time stamps were removed. It does not say this. Read it again. 
5	1522768965	4	Yeah what does it prove? I see a bunch of more lies like claiming that Craig needed knowledge of the future which was not true.  Here it is in 2009 debian admin weblog suggesting to use the same configuration the keys used: https://debian-administration.org/users/dkg/weblog/48Your evidence is bad, that is just one example.  All your so called evidence is propaganda bullshit.
6	1522769393	3	> Yeah what does it prove?It proves that he didn't change the key configuration after he created them, **which is what HIS OWN paper claimed he did!** So, since that config was not the default in 2008, **the PGP keys couldn't have been made then, since the timestamps would have been different**. It's pretty simple, and I'm not sure why you're not following it.So this evidence is good. Any other examples of 'bad' evidence?

4	1522768052	6	> You claimed to be able to predict someone's time zone based on the timing of their postsNo, I didn't.

0	1522775176	4	BCH community has everything to gain if less people treat him as if he were Satoshi and more people treat him with healthy skepticismThe only positive side is that he made some well delivered speeches and effective tweets about Bitcoin as an economic system and the importance of scaling on-chain. I admit he's been refreshing and enjoyable to listen, but is that anything new or special? Many other prominent BCH supporters have made the same arguments and can debate them effectively.This must be weighted against all other negatives:-The Satoshi fake signatures story-Wild claims of alternative Bitcoin client, new BCH mining farms and new technology that have yet to materialize. They were promised last summer as very close. How long until "put up or shut up" ?-His few technical papers are unanimously dismissed by other experts, including BCH supporters, as technobabble full of nonsense-Bitchy and full of himself like a narcissistThe similarities with the toxic personality explained by Falkvinge are self-evident: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOLZNtbLUTYSo guys, let's take anything positive that Faketoshi will deliver (if ever) but don't put him on a pedestal 
1	1522777894	-1	> more people treat him with healthy skepticismFor the most part, this describes the BCH community. Its the trolls like vitalicuck buterin who make accusations with no proof.

3	1522763650	7	If you think rick's video was about csw, you are not paying close attention.
4	1522766378	2	I agree it wasn't CSW, but who do you think it was about?
5	1522767133	2	It was about teaching people to recognize toxic, whoever that is.
6	1522769389	2	Rick was teaching people to think for themselves and be skeptical.
7	1522769680	4	Yes, you can't do this by giving the answers right away.
7	1522771482	-1	And also to speak out! Everybody has a voice, use it. It's an absolute disgrace that CSW spoke on Satoshi's Vision conference and nobody has yet to explain to me what the benefits are for Roger Ver to allie himself with CSW, knowing the guy is a fraud. Or has Roger  been bamboozled by CSW? In this case he needs to become un-bamboozled. 
6	1522770531	1	There is so much toxicity lately that I think it's breeding immunity into the community.
6	1522771292	0	Yeah and it was recorded and uploaded just a bit before CSW came running in like the rock star he wants to be proving how spot on Pirate Rick was with his analysis of toxic people.  CSW is a big sad joke and I don't understand why some of our leaders like Roger Ver do business with him and allow him to speak at conferences making the BCH community look like a joke.  He is by the far the person that fits Pirate Rick his classification of toxic people the best. Also Rick asked people to speak out and stand up for what is right, so we are doing that. In the hope of maybe finally being able to convince Roger Ver of parting ways with CSW.

4	1522769748	1	It sure sounds like it is about csw. 
4	1522771973	1	The PhD / Dr part of Rick's video basically described CSW's PhD situation in 2016, including using a PhD in theology to use the title "Dr" in the tech industry.
3	1522754266	2	Rick would never ever do that
3	1522771670	1	That video was NOT intended to call out CSW. After CSW is gone there might come more like him.   The timing of it was a bit unfortunate, a week after that video was made ... there goes CSW running on to the stage like a rockstar. You can't make this shit up. It's like CSW watched the video and got totally mesmerized by the rockstar word and then forgot about everything else, convinced him that he is a rockstar and then was like: and rockstars do come on running on the stage and then he ran on the stage.CSW speaking on all these events is an embarrassment to all of crypto. A slap in the face of people that are doing hard work.

1	1522766754	-1	Where on Earth are the sources and links in this thread? This thread devolves into every thread that /r/bitcoin has about CSW. Very few have actually read the material he has published (which I can guarantee Vitalik hasn't considering he is advocating for 15 second block times) and instead resort to ad-hominem attacks on the man's character because he didn't want to prove his identity to random people on the internet.CSW was undeniably responsible for the growth of Bitcoin at it's earliest stages and I think that it deserves some type of respect/understanding of why he's taken the actions he has.
2	1522771862	0	It is absolutely your right to think he deserves some respect, but I disagree. As long as his jump to fame is based on a lie that he refuses to come clean about I don't think he deserves even a pixel of respect.
3	1522772544	1	I respect the hell out of CSW for refusing to identify himself with the pseudonym and try to spread his information/ideas on merit alone. Everyone wants proof of who Satoshi is to make him a Messiah, and Craig made it clear from the beginning he had no intention of bringing the spotlight upon himself.The holder of the Satoshi keys could change the future of Bitcoin overnight, and I respect them for forcing us as a community to grow and develop new ideas ourselves.
4	1522774364	1	> Craig made it clear from the beginning he had no intention of bringing the spotlight upon himself.No, he did not. He went on TV and said "*I am the person behind the moniker Satoshi Nakamoto*". Then he tried to prove it. And he failed. That is so far from having no intention of bringing a spotlight on himself that you couldn't get further.
0	1522761907	29	About time someone called out that cancer IRL.*-edit-*Just realised these threads are fucking great for tagging CSW sockpuppets. Unholster your RES gentlemen.
1	1522766607	2	Im usually on my phone and cant tag anyone, is there a public list of various core trolls, and all the rest?  We shouldnt all have to reinvent the wheel.
2	1522778453	1	Core trolls?  This thread is exposing Craig Wright sockpuppets.  Craig Wright supports Bitcoin Cash, not Bitcoin.
3	1522778932	1	i'm in favor of weeding out anybody who's a liar.. there's a lot i don't like about roger ver either.. he's a fremeny in my book.. the point is that i can't tag anyone on my phone
1	1522766063	4	holy shit seriously;  I call out when there is a bunch of bs about CSW because it distracts from Bitcoin only, but I really dont care about him in any way shape or form, but he **still** has interesting ideas about Bitcoin through all of the shitbut holy shit this circus is being made entirely about CSW and completely avoiding talking about Bitcoin in any way, shape or formits just downright disappointing so many people are so gullible they eat up the distractions, even Buterin which disappointed me the most through this that he would resort to enabling a character assination distraction like this
2	1522771330	2	Calling BS is not character assesination
3	1522773789	2	than what's the point?  its not like your researching and refuting the things he says, screaming fraudster to distract everyone, nothing morewhich is bullshit
4	1522778900	1	Im not screaming fraud, but to be wary of snake oil salesman
5	1522778968	1	can not agree more, but does not warrant the fraudster execution/distraction by others
2	1522772284	1	> he still has interesting ideas about BitcoinSuch as? And what has he done with these ideas? 
3	1522773684	0	he gets people to think and refute the crap he spewsseriously.  if he really is a fraudster this is absolutely awesome, out in the open for everyone too see how fraudsters in the shadows will manipulate peoplebottom line it does nothing to scream fraudster in his face like a child
4	1522774205	0	No one screamed fraudster in his face like a child, and getting people to think is not the same as having interesting ideas. A puppy can get people to think, but it most likely has no interesting ideas.I've yet to see what he does with the supposedly good ideas he has.
5	1522775720	2	do you even know what this post is about?  watch the video
0	1522759017	13	Stop the presses!...Seriously?Also, the brigading in this thread is something to behold. Known troll accounts hyper voted as if there were no tomorrow...
1	1522762502	13	Almost like CSW is such an obvious fraud that even the common BCH and BTC supporters are in agreement about it. Weird huh.
2	1522764306	5	For a long time now, there's going on a lot of propaganda and emotional judgements and fallacies that doesn't equal to "irrefutable facts".I haven't seen yet any compelling reason to believe CSW is eminently toxic. I'm not talking about personal preferences or how attractive you think he is or the tone of his voice. The main and obvious toxicity I keep seeing is the one directed at himself by multiple actors.Even more, the attacks against his character are so similar and so well synchronized to the campaigns against BCH that I can't help to be even more prudent to reach to hasty conclusions.What we may loose witch hunting him may be more than what we gain. For one he is usually spot on regarding the economics part of Bitcoin.I'm still waiting for technically sound evidence to show he is the "fraud" many noisy actors claim him to be. What I'm tired of seeing is a lot small things blown out of proportion searching for some kind of outrage. And that's not proof of anything, that's just sad.
3	1522777565	2	> I haven't seen yet any compelling reason to believe CSW is eminently toxic.Ok. Put aside the fraud issue for a moment. CSW and nChain are attempting to file literally thousands of patents for every half-baked idea they can come up with for something people might try to do with cryptocurrency. They aren’t actually trying to *do* any of these things, just file patents for them. That is 100% glaringly obvious patent troll behaviour. They plan to make money while stifling development in the crypto-space.Craig’s small but determined army of defenders will tell you this is all fine because he is going to make the patents free to use in relation to BCH specifically. Even if you believe that non legally binding pinky-swear, they are *still* patent trolls planning to cripple development in crypto. Now with that in mind, the fact that he *does* have a history of telling huge lies and trying to take credit for the work of others seems *really* fucking relevant. His promises not to enforce the patents on BCH are completely worthless, and he will definitely try to sue any non-BCH company that does anything that can be remotely linked to one of their endless piles of brain-fart patents.That’s why he is toxic. 
3	1522765143	3	If his vague/empty discourse isn't enough to make you question his intentions, you can always find users posting detailed lists of CSW's shortcomings in these threads, though those usually get ignored. (the craig apologizers can be very dilligent, but only when defending him from insults or unsourced attacks.)https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89bui6/buterin_about_csw_why_is_this_fraud_allowed_to/dwq8egl/Regarding the fact that there's no evidence of CSW's self-proclaimed expertise and connection towards bitcoin (let's ignore the evidence of his attempts at fraud for a minute), why do you find the idea that many personalities from disparate projects in the crypto space are in cohort aiming to descredit him more plausible than the simple explanation that he is a conman?
4	1522771244	2	I'm not sure what that con would consist of to be honest. Do you fear he is trying to destroy bitcoin cash from the inside? Or do you think the project could be harmed by him wanting to help because of the bad press it could bring? Maybe I'm not worried because I believe in Bitcoin as system to allow consensus between parties that doesn't trust each other. No devs, no miners, no public speakers.And the system should be open to all actors, including CSW, including Adam Back, or anyone really.We just need to remain vigilant as a community. To ensure we are not being manipulated by any side.If many voices say "attack him" I question those voices. Because for me Bitcoin has nothing to do about attacking things but creating things together.
5	1522777634	1	The play is to accrue power and influence in the community, and maybe lure even more people into buying in, by making himself appear way more knowledgeable and relevant than he actually is. Not unlike what Dick "Falkvynge" does, but with the fraudy twist of implying to be the actual genius that created bitcoin. It's borderline plagiarism.Many voices attack him because he is universally disliked. If there's something bitcoin and bitcoin cash folks agree on is in their admiration for Satoshi, the simpleton craig trying to take credit for his work is a big offense.
2	1522771761	0	Either CSW has bamboozled Roger Ver or Roger Ver is allied with him for strategic reasons and knows very well the guy is a fraud. Both possibilities are bad. 
0	1522766476	6	I'm not going to weigh in on whether CSW is satoshi or not, but I will say pointing to the selfish mining debate as an example of CSW not having a good technical understanding of bitcoin is very biased and misleading.Please read my thread here if you want a different perspective on the debate:https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88irk1/the_selfish_mining_debate_toxic_and_unnecessary/

0	1522756455	13	Holy shit coming from vitalik.. it mean something..
1	1522762574	-1	Appeal to authority huh?I never like CSW but Vitalik really disgust everyone by attacking him but not his ideas. You can see he couldn't make valid argument and tried to discredit CSW by calling him fraud. 
2	1522763358	8	>Appeal to authority huh?No, it is because vitalik is usually very polite and non-confrontational.>I never like CSW but Vitalik really disgust everyone by attacking him but not his ideas. None of his idea are debable, he is basically pilling up pre-announcement tweet without any detailed explaination.
2	1522777128	1	Hey, there is little else left to do when CSW has been debunked *ad nauseam* and there are still cultists left following him.We can categorize them in 2 complementary kinds: one kind replies to people debunking CSW ideas, they respond by attacking the speaker. The other kind replies to people attacking CSW, those accuse the speaker of *ad hominem* instead of arguing the ideas.
2	1522769115	0	CSW’s entire relevance is an appeal to Satoshi’s authority. 
0	1522757111	8	The fact that in his latest tweet Wright can't tell Beavis from Butthead does kind of concern me more than anything else I've seen so far.https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/981132424875728896
1	1522762344	10	Neither does he know how to spell Beavis nor Vitalik's name. Also having a PhD and being a fraud are not mutually exclusive. Lame.
1	1522761075	0	He just posted himself as Butthead doing the talking.  Or, at least, that's how I'm choosing to interpret that tweet.

2	1522762753	5	Yea, it's all a giant conspiracy to **censor** CSW. It's not because he is spouting absolute technobabble at an otherwise somewhat respectable conference.

2	1522763398	-2	Thought leaders = people prominent in the BCH community

Charles, Gavin Andresen, Emin Sirer, just to name a few.And they disagree all the time, so, idk who is the leader.

1	1522771890	2	I think only Roger Ver really gives him a platform. And then then money that nChain is trowing around. They sponsor and event and then of course demand that CSW get's to speak. This is just bribery and won't make the world a better place. 
0	1522760961	3	the sock puppets brigading this thread is outstanding.whether CSW is or isn't, who gives a fuck, he was at least there from the *very* begining and like almost every single initial user is demonised by the Core group because .. I guess they are upset about not being there before them.When you have people in charge of Bitcoin that are on record stating it doesn't work, they don't understand it, it's stupid and not at all interesting... and they are 100% in complete fucking control over the entire thing..... why would you give a shit what they sayCSW convinced people who matter. that convinced me. who gives a fuck what anyone else thinks.dont let the brigading in this thread cloud your judgement either way.
1	1522776614	5	> whether CSW is or isn't, who gives a fuck, he was at least there from the very begining You’ve repeated this multiple times in this thread. There is absolutely no proof that CSW was an early bitcoiner. There is proof that he faked back dated blog posts and pgp keys to make it look like he was Satoshi. But there is no proof he was involved in any way with the creation of Bitcoin, or was even an early user.
1	1522766556	3	This thread is an amazing example of vote manipulation.  We are being fought hard.Fraud or not, the ideas are what we are seeking, and they can stand on their own.
1	1522761485	-1	Damn straight.
0	1522763193	4	All this people complaining that Vitalik asked why he was allowed in the conference. Well, my 2 sats:1 - on one hand, if you have people actively developing and investing in crypto, seems that it is enough and so Vitalik looks like he is being a dick, if they have sansung mow, why not CSW? No difference;2 - but, on the other hand, I don't think Vitalik is being a dick, because this is a special case: if the person gathers attention, fame, etc, based on something that is NOT public proof, then it feels pretty illegitimate and it is not healthy for crypto as a whole; we (and I'm including every single "crypto" listed in CMC+the whole ecosystem) are plagued with scams, this whole party is going to be over soon like that and CSW not signing the freaking genesis block, or any of the known satoshi addresses, and at the same time gathering publicity with a bogus proof behind him, is just fucking bad for everybody, it looks like a scam.Now, I do think CSW has some interesting things said/wirtten, I think he is a guy committed to help, investing and funding development for BCH (and not a scammer because he didn't scam anyone), and I do think there is a chance he is satoshi, but good god, sign the fucking keys or stop being so butt hurt with people pointing the incoherence, because, "as is", looks bad AF. Sorry, Vitalik just said what 99% of people feel, "gosh, sign the freaking keys and/or quit the publicity".You are not going to jail, charlie lee also launched a crypto currency and is out there even dumping it on everybody else, actively manipulating prices and scamming, and nothing will happen. Just having launched a crypto won't make you a criminal.Oh, before the devotees come to say this is FUD, hate, and that a man has a right to privacy, first, I have no negative feelings about CSW, but tell me, what privacy is it going to talk after talk, conference after conference, with the whole baggage of the bogus proof behind? Isn't it at least bad that this is allowed to happen and, as it is, it has the status of fraud? Just think about it.
1	1522773116	1	I think Craig doesn't ever want to publicly prove he is Satoshi. He just wants to contribute to Bitcoin Cash and its ecosystem. To state the obvious, at these conferences he is presenting as Craig Wright not "Satoshi" so therefore people should evaluate his ideas on their merits alone and not some god complex that he is Satoshi. If Satoshi ever wanted to be publicly known he/they would have used their real names on the original whitepaper. Of course they would probably never do that as it's not cypherpunk culture and you would have a target painted on your back by various governments and spy agencies. That is why I think whoever is Satoshi will never publicly prove themselves.
2	1522773539	1	> people should evaluate his ideas on their merits aloneNever going to happen after the bogus proof he gave, I'm just being realistic. If he comes out clean, people will pay more attention to what he is saying, there is a big barrier as of now that I don't see ever clearing up.
3	1522778259	1	Lol it will all get cleared up after everyone is proved wrong.
4	1522780108	1	Prove it then.
3	1522780134	1	He doesn't want there to be a "king" on Bitcoin Cash. He wants it to evolve and self govern, not in control of any one party. So there's no benefit for him to out himself.
0	1522753044	2	Popcorn time
0	1522769175	4	Ugh, Vitalik shouldn't talk. He's the one with the cult following that believes what he says without any understanding.Vitalik has been just soo wrong about so many things, this actually gives CSW cred in my book.
0	1522759596	0	This comment from the leader of the biggest ICO shitcoin in history which got hacked for millions then just hard forked to restore the funds. What an embarrassment. If he knew anything about blockchains he would know the ledger is supposed to be immutable.The only "good" thing to come out of Ethereum is insecure smart contracts and about 1000 ICO shitcoins which do nothing but clutter up the space and allow scams to breed like wild rabbits.I am not surprised he is going after CSW with personal attacks. It's because he is scared of what CSW and nChain are bringing to BCH, namely *secure* smart contracts, private transactions and other interesting things which eat up Ethereum's use case. He would do better to debate the actual points CSW makes rather than ad-hominums which make him look immature.
1	1522760610	3	Exactly my thought, too.
1	1522773211	1	Ethereum is not a shitcoin at all. It was the DAO that got a bug exploited not Ethereum itself.  What you are saying is not true. Ethereum could have been build on top of Bitcoin if it did not get hijacked by core. The people that want the success of Ethereum want the success of Bitcoin Cash and the other way around because both go hand in hand. In an ideal world we would still have one system with massive support but we don't have an ideal world. Ethereum will never go global without a crypto first turning in to money, which is not even a guarantee no matter the circle jerk around the technology. 
1	1522762560	3	Look another CSW.
0	1522769069	3	It's clear that this thread is being infiltrated by core thugs. If you can't contribute anything intellectual and have to fall to base level insults, there is nothing to discuss.
0	1522773630	2	Is Vitalik advocating censorship?"...allowed to speak..."Maybe Vitalik can go ahead and put on his own conference and choose to invite who he wants to?Isn't that an insult to the organizers and financiers of the conference to make a judgement on their guest list?
1	1522777596	0	I can think of tens of people more qualified to speak on the limited time and space of the conference. Heck, even I am more qualified than CSW.
2	1522777699	1	It's an invite list.And no, you did not qualify for that list.
3	1522777745	0	Thus, much less CSW.
0	1522762945	2	Known troll accounts getting mass upvoted in this thread. Kudos to Vitalik for not having the balls to respond to Craig and for making the entire panel all about himself during a panel that had nothing to do with Craig.

0	1522767452	2	Alright. Someone fucking explain who he defrauded please. 
0	1522758300	0	He's a fraud because he's a fraud because he's a fraud because he's a fraud. That seems to be the argument.
1	1522759954	1	Same thought. A bad video with low quality were I don´t understand a single word and Bcore shills are here in full strenght. Saying CSW is fraud without an arguments? Maybe I´m to old for the Internet but I want some proof or explanation why he is fraud. Because without that it is just a personal insult.
2	1522763972	10	> but I want some proof or explanation why he is fraudHere you go:1. He faked [blog posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80ryvc/craig_wright_2008_august_26_blog_post_i_have_a/duxwsyk/)2. He faked [PGP keys](https://medium.com/@tbrice/wrights-appeal-to-authority-paper-disproved-its-own-thesis-8f2d45e5df24)3.

He faked [threats](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80o2xf/its_time_for_another_reminder_craig_wright_is_not/duxbjuw/) 5. He faked [a public key signing](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/05/craig-wright-s-proof-he-invented-bitcoin-is-basically-a-canadian-girlfriend.html)6. He has a [well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related](https://www.scribd.com/document/372445546/Bitcoin-Lawsuit) (see numbers 88 through 102)7. His own mother [admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-1655.0-1655.94)And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:1. He has provided no independently verifiable evidence2. He is not [technically competent](http://archive.is/6C3C9) in the subject matter3. His [writing style](http://seclists.org/basics/2008/Mar/42) is nothing like [Satoshi's](http://satoshinakamoto.me/)4. He [called bitcoin "Bit Coin" in 2011](https://theconversation.com/lulzsec-anonymous-freedom-fighters-or-the-new-face-of-evil-2605#comment_6162) when Satoshi never used a space5. He [actively bought and traded coins](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hx3q9/according_to_the_mtgox_leaks_from_early_2014_our/) from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 20146. He was [paid millions](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-729.989-732.0) for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive
3	1522768355	-2	Ok but do we know who you are?  If not the big problem with your post is this part: Contrarian__.  When you are calling someone out, put your name on it.  Otherwise you are sockpuppeting.
4	1522772264	3	You don't need to know - nor does it matter - who he is to verify what he is claiming.
5	1522772909	0	Yes, we do.  Look at the post history of Contrarian__.  Consider his purpose here.  Look at the repeated posts of this content.  Does that not spell sockpuppet?  Absolutely, I think it's necessary that he identify himself, if he wants to be taken seriously at this point.
6	1522774373	2	But if his points are valid and his facts are true, why does it matter who says them?
7	1522774491	0	It starts to matter when the assessment is levied against an individual. 
8	1522775153	2	By that logic, a whistleblower would have to publicly identify themselves before evidence of wrongdoing is worth verifying. You are wrong, facts stand on their own.All you essentially have is a very weak ad hominem, you're fishing for a personality to attack and ignoring the facts.
9	1522775314	0	>  a whistleblower would have to publicly identify themselvesCorrect.  The whistleblower must emerge.  An anonymous 'whistleblower' has no credibility.
1	1522761766	0	No, because he claimed to be Satoshi and provided proof (signature of Satoshi) which turned out to be FAKE. He's a 100% fraud. Also most of his stuff is just nonsensical technobabble, but that's not the main point.
2	1522769348	1	I would say the nonsensical technobabble is all the proof that’s needed. Where you out a conman isn’t by degrees and other forms of social proof, because they are masters at faking that and taking advantage of others’ trust, it’s by looking at the actual quality of their work. 
2	1522768896	0	>No, because he claimed to be Satoshi and provided proof (signature of Satoshi) which turned out to be FAKE. He's a 100% fraud. i don't see what this has to do with his, as you put it:>Also most of his stuff is just nonsensical technobabble
0	1522758937	1	When I first heard about someone named Craig Wright to claim that he is Satoshi, I didn't know that guy so I looked up some video on youtube to hear him speak.Took around 10 seconds to know there is no way in hell this guy could be Satoshi Nakamoto, as he came off immediately as a complete idiot. 10 seconds video footage is all it took to know. I'm still completely baffled how there are intelligent people who believed him for a second that he could be Satoshi, just wtfffff.
1	1522767107	5	He may be an asshole, but he's no idiot.Satoshi wasn't super pleasant either though.
2	1522773411	2	If you would start reading all Satoshi wrote you would now that what you said is not true. http://nakamotoinstitute.org/
3	1522774383	1	Please elaborate.
4	1522775200	2	No, you are the one that said Satoshi was not super pleasant either. So you elaborate first. Why do I need to do the work for you when you claimed that Satoshi was not pleasant first. 
5	1522776450	1	If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry
6	1522776566	1	Ah yes, that's something Satoshi said. Is this your evidence that Satosh is not very pleasant?  
2	1522772427	1	He is an idiot. No technical background at all, his doctorate is in theology... lol
3	1522774552	1	His papers / presentations are very technical.  You should look at them sometime.The doctorate is irrelevant.   I don't care if he is a high school drop-out if he has good ideas.
0	1522773307	0	Vitalik supports censorship then.
0	1522778219	1	Bottom line is CSW talks alot of technical jargon, so its up to the people who are in this field to prove to the community hes a fraud with your knowledge not with your emotions. For us who are not programmers and scientists or mathematicians we simply cannot verify if what hes saying is bs or not.On gut instinct I still dont feel hes a fraud. For example the question he asked Samson Mow about the 10cent is exactly what I thought before he asked that question. And even if he is a fraud making statement like a person has no right to speak or be at a conference is extremely dangerous state position to start taking.
0	1522778982	1	I've said it before guys... I disagree with the BCH idea of scaling, and don't want to discuss it here, but one problem BCH *most definitely* has is that of PR.* Roger is very charming and can do terrific marketing, his criminal background can easily be forgotten. He's not a liability.* CSW/fakesatoshi... Perfect liability. Come on, do you really want to be associated with this clown? The more he goes on to talk and promote BCH, the bigger the loss in credibility for this community. Toss him out of the window, now, and replace him. There's another academic, a **real academic** that seems to like BCH... perfect alternative. * Calvin Ayre... another liability, though admittedly better than fakesatoshi. You should really get more people involved that have a certain credibility **in the eyes of the general public**. Else don't be surprised if everyone ridicules BCH, regardless of any technical merits, you have a freaking PR problem!
0	1522779982	1	Vitalik wants to censor his closest competitor? Nooo.
0	1522754155	-3	Maybe he is a scammer... Still doesn't mean he wasnt part of team satoshi :) I don't think you can call him a fraud at this point anyway as afaik he *has* done good things for bitcoin through nChain and pretty much perfect redpills even if you don't believe he was part of the team(which i see as highly unlikely)...
1	1522754947	2	This.Satoshi was brilliant, but like somebody's Facebook feed we only got to see the curated highlights. The ugly human nature concealed so that bitcoin could succeed in the public eye.Team Satoshi could well be awful humans, but they created something amazing.No human can ever live up to the hype of being Satoshi. Any who try will be ostracized for falling short of being the God of bitcoin.

1	1522778100	1	> tv station or media Big difference pal.
0	1522772499	1	He is allowed to speak because his subject matter is quantifiable by investigation and fact checking. He gets a huge amount of flak, largely because so many trolls like to project for the sake of projecting. He absolutely understands more about the underpinnings of Bitcoin than many other "authorities". Try for once listening to his talks, reading is papers, asking questions and come to your own conclusions. Don't join parroting the projectionists.Please, point out specifically about his "non-sensical" claims about tech, crypto, and math. This should be good. We can start with the selfish-miner. What a pile of horse shit that (non-issue) has become.
0	1522765005	1	There are no leaders in bitcoin. The moment you declare there is a leader, the whole network becomes centralized. 
1	1522767126	2	You can talk about theory all you want, but in reality there's like a dozen people who are controling how it gets developed. Its just how humans work.
