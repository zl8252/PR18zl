0	1522713859	21	There'll be a discussion about: "Bitcoin, Controversy over Principle".Soon after Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper on Bitcoin was published, Bitcoin has recorded tremendous growth with an equal amount of global interest. The Bitcoin market expanded further as major financial institutions started entering and investing in Bitcoin, leading to the creation of a futures market for Bitcoin, which implies the official integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. However, the issue on scalability has been consistently controversial and eventually led to a diverge of the Bitcoin community and discrepancy in defining Bitcoin. On the one hand, Bitcoin is viewed as digital gold by emphasizing its role as store of value. Conversely, the other party believes Bitcoin is a digital currency and should be valued upon its actual usage. Deconomy will elaborate on this issue and will open the floor for intense discussion.
1	1522721564	21	the fact that they're even willing to talk about the issue pretty much makes them pro-BCH. This is very bullish. 
2	1522722153	14	Good point. SV was good but exposure was limited to pro-BCH. This seems much bigger and more mixed. A great opportunity to make BCH's case to a much wider audience. 
0	1522741369	8	Good to see that Samson finally maned up for a debate.u/memorydealers should ask Samson especially about his statement that BTC isn't for poor people living under 2$ a day, because they are not computer literate enough.https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/783994642463326208?s=20Also it would be good if you could mention some specific weaknesses about lightning - like having to be online to receive payments, the unsolved routing problem, the centralisation force where more funds have to be locked in as a payments go over more hops, which leads to a strong incentive for large, centralised payment hubs.Then the risk of losing funds when going offline, hence the need to trust third party watchtowers. Denial of service risk..The fact that Yours and Openbazaar held off on lightning.That even Peter Todd is critical of lightninghttps://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/968190530294337538?s=20
0	1522713731	18	Anyone knows any live streams?
1	1522730752	4	Ya would love to see this live. What time and a link would be rad. 
0	1522717036	15	looks really cool full of interesting speakers, except of samson mow..
1	1522723740	15	He's gonna get his ass handed to him in discussion, that's gonna be interesting.
2	1522726286	-22	Who do we think is less credible, samson mow or craig wright?  I know samson has a bad history in this sub cause blockstream, but /u/Craig_S_Wright got owned by Vitalik and others when he masqueraded as satoshi.  I personally think /u/Craig_S_Wright may have bipolar disorder and really believe the delusion he is satoshi.  Even Roger Ver wont vouch for his satoshi claim, and roger even vouched for mt gox so you know it must be really extra untrue about nakamato dundee.  
3	1522727784	32	Samson Mow is definitely less credible.
4	1522728673	-9	IDK, does samson have any fake degrees?  I don't think samsons mom has called him out for being a lifelong liar either.  Samson is lacking in faked cyprotragraphic signatures too. Samson should up his scumbag game and get on craigs level.From the article, http://archive.is/kjuLi"Wright’s mother had told me about her son’s long-standing habit of adding bits on to the truth, just to make it bigger. ‘When he was a teenager,’ she said, ‘he went into the back of a car on his bike. It threw him through the window of a parked car. That’s where his scar comes from. His sister accompanied him to the hospital and he’s telling the doctor that he’s had his nose broken twenty or so times, and the doctor is saying “You couldn’t possibly have had it broken.” And Craig says: “I sew myself up when I get injured.”’ What his mother said connected with something I’d noticed. In what he said, he often went further than he needed to; further than he ought to have done. He appeared to start with the truth, and then, slowly, he would inflate his part until the whole story suddenly looked weak. "/u/99r4wc0n3s http://archive.is/kjuLi you should read the article and do some research boy
5	1522733495	13	you seem like the kind of person who would use People Magazine and National Enquirer as source material for a debate.  come back with a detailed critique of this paper and prove yourself otherwise:  https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3153477
6	1522733751	-5	> you seem like the kind of person who would use People Magazine and National Enquirer as source material for a debateDid you just make a comparison of Andrew O'Hagan and National Enquirer?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_O%27HaganYou really don't think that's a false comparison?  Andrew seems like a pretty grade A journalist.  Probably why Craig tried to hire him to write his story. Infact, The article I cited is cited in craig wrights own wiki page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Steven_Wright 
7	1522733758	5	**Andrew O'Hagan**Andrew O'Hagan, FRSL (born 1968) is a Scottish novelist and non-fiction author. He is also an Editor at Large of Esquire, London Review of Books and critic at large for T: The New York Times Style Magazine. O'Hagan is currently a creative writing fellow at King's College London.O'Hagan was selected by the literary magazine Granta for inclusion in their 2003 list of the top 20 young British novelists.*****Craig Steven Wright**Craig Steven Wright (born October 1970) is an Australian computer scientist and businessman. He has publicly identified himself as the main part of the team that created bitcoin, and has claimed he is the identity behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The BBC, The Economist, Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen say that he has signed messages with private keys known to have been controlled by Satoshi Nakamoto in a demonstration. The Economist, GQ Magazine and others in the bitcoin world have said that this demonstration could have been stage-managed or that the people present at these demonstrations could have been bamboozled.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
5	1522729493	16	This is what you brought to the table, really? 🤦🏻‍♂️I did not bother to read the article, as your excerpt contains zero supporting evidence and only some story his mother supposedly told.CSW is one of the most sought after speakers on cryptocurrency technology. There aren’t many people (if any) that understand the Bitcoin protocol on his level. I believe Hal Finney and Dave Kleiman were a part of one of CSWs companies at one point prior to the protocol being released. To top it off, it was CSW who’s home was raided on the suspicion of tax evasion by government authorities.It is far too dangerous to reveal SN’s true identity, in addition, it is much more beneficial to the community to leave it anonymous. Don’t be foolish, put some respek on CSW name... boy.
6	1522729948	0	> I did not bother to read the articleLOL, the denial runs deep.  You know the author is respected right?   You know craig paid that guy to write his story right?  You know the author was there the whole time right?  Maybe you should read it if you want to speak on the issue boy.>CSW one of the most sought after speakers on cryptocurrency technology.So lots of people want to hear him talk?  So that makes him legitamite?  I thought that was the logical fallacy argumentum ad populum but what do I know.>It is far too dangerous to reveal SN’s true identity, in addition, it is much more beneficial to the community to leave it anonymous.Then why did Craig hire a PR firm and author to cover him coming out as satoshi?  Don’t be foolish like craig wright and shit on your own reputation.
7	1522730012	4	You’re right about one thing, the denial does run deep. Boy.
8	1522730547	9	I know I am right about you being in denial, Thanks for confirming my suspicions.  Its ok you cant read that big article, world needs ditch diggers too boy.I noticed you didn't reply to the meat of what I had to say there.  You were really shut down that hard?  I thought you had more left in you, poor showing on your part overall boy.  Anyways, good luck not reading the main article about Craig wright and defending him, lol.  
9	1522730848	1	C’mon little girl, I’m not going to argue with you just for the sake.You didn’t say shit - there’s no need to reply.“If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry” - SN
7	1522762079	1	I read the whole thing. In it, it explains exactly why there was a PR firm. People had money in the game, and got fucked when Craig backed out. It also makes it pretty clear that Craig never wanted to come out at all. Did you read it?
8	1522770245	1	> It also makes it pretty clear that Craig never wanted to come out at all. Why did Craig accept the money then to come out as satoshi?  Why did craig go along with the plan if he didnt want to be outed?  Did you comprehend this part when you read it.  Go slower this time and take time to think about it.  ‘The deal had the following components: clear the outstanding debts that were preventing Wright’s business from getting back on its feet, and work with the new lawyers on getting the agreements in place for the transfer of any non-corporate intellectual property, and work with the lawyers to get Craig’s story rights.’ From that point on, the ‘Satoshi revelation’ would be part of the deal. ‘It was the cornerstone of the commercialisation plan,’ Matthews said, ‘with about ten million sunk into the Australian debts and setting up in London.’He took 10 million to pay off his debts, lmao.  If he was really satoshi he clearly wouldnt need the money
5	1522739895	3	I've read it a few times it's very interesting. Have you read it in its entirety? Are you aware the author believes CSW is satoshi? 
6	1522768775	1	> Are you aware the author believes CSW is satoshi? He does not.  He chose not to write craigs book after craig failed to provide cryptographic proof of his claims.
3	1522727876	9	If CSW is not satoshi himself, he is the closest living being to the SN identity.Let that sink in.I suggest you DYOR on CSW.

4	1522745404	3	His fuckery with supposedly satoshi’s keys alone is enough to completely discredit his story. Can’t believe there are reasonable people who still believe it. P(shill) has just skyrocketed for you account.
5	1522769322	1	YES! Let’s completely ignore his work, his involvement with Hal and Dave, the raid on his house, the lawsuit for 1M BTC, and the various people who’ve actually had contact with SN who seem to believe it’s very likely that CSW is indeed SN and discredit all that he has done over the ‘fuckery’ with the keys. - EASY.Another shit argument.

4	1522740060	3	Where's the tweet sheet he says bitcoin is not for the poor? He should never be able to live that one down. What a disgrace.

3	1522727722	2	I am a big blocker, they are big blockers. Murders can like the things i like; won’t change what i like. 
1	1522738417	3	A good forum should have all parties involved that play a significant role, no matter if someone agrees with them or not. That tells an interesting event from an echo chamber.  
0	1522729084	2	Do we think this meetup will remove some of the fud and help prices recover?
1	1522742763	3	Let the speculators and weak hands sell, the rise to the top will be swifter and smoother.
2	1522750141	2	I think the market is like a bow being pulled back... sooner or later all that pent up energy needs to be expelled. The lower the price the more violent the upsurge 
0	1522743849	6	Looks like Vitalik ripped Roger's and Fauxtoshi's rear-ends apart. One clap for Roger. 
1	1522748302	10	Not really, roger ver pwned sansung, vitalik ripped csw tho.
1	1522747881	3	Samson mow must have received a tomato to his face, right?
2	1522769564	3	Better than getting teabagged by Vitalik. 
0	1522730507	1	Jon Choi from Ethereum is speaking! He's a solid guy.
0	1522737012	1	Jihan is mentioned as one of the speakers here. That is not true.
1	1522741925	1	I saw a deconomy forum advert with Jihan in it.
2	1522742163	1	Link?
3	1522742576	1	It was on vin armani show.
0	1522739747	1	very cool!
