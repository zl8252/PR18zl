It was so insane that the only way I could describe it was with this Pizza story allegory:https://hackernoon.com/chapter-one-alice-and-bob-9fa315aeef62
1	1522730619	8	Hah, great read.
2	1522741573	5	Home-made bread pizza is highly underrated. 
1	1522750444	3	Can´t wait for Chapter 2 on August 1st. 2018 :D
0	1522705705	40	RBF was definitely contentious, large volume consumer-facing businesses were frustrated and wondering wtf.  however, it didn't require a hardfork.
1	1522712276	39	It was deployed, literally, on Black Friday, the biggest holiday shopping day of the year in retail.A signal.This was when we knew Bitcoin was through and the rest of us enacted other plans.
2	1522767922	2	>It was deployed, literally, on Black FridayCan you explain what you mean when you say that RBF was "deployed" on one day, since it's a per-node relay policy and not a consensus change? And how did you determine that it was that day in particular?[Bitcoin Core 0.12](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.12.0) was the first version to forward RBF transactions. It was released on February 23rd, 2016. [0.14](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.14.0) was the first version that allowed *creating* RBF transactions and was released on March 8th, 2017.
1	1522733283	7	"hardfork" is just a distraction. There reason is that Core was in favor of RBF and not in favor of a block size increase.
2	1522768528	1	No, it's not a distraction. A hard fork requires that *every* participant upgrade their node to stay on the same blockchain. RBF is only a rule about when to relay transactions, it's entirely optional to use, if your node rejects RBF transactions you will still be on the same blockchain as everyone else using Bitcoin.
3	1522772405	1	I know that. But "hardfork" was not the answer to the question. "Core" was the answer to the question.
0	1522719903	13	And changing the default timeout for mempool transactions from 3 days to two weeks so that people are further encouraged to use RBF was also done with little fanfare.
1	1522721303	6	https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9312
2	1522723087	6	I don't really understand their arguments.  It seems like they say timeout doesn't matter because someone will rebroadcast... Then why make it longer?  Or they say you can change your own node... But that doesn't change everyone else's node that is still holding *your* transaction in memory (you can't force them to drop your transaction).On top of that, you can see history where mempool statistics show drastic changes in low fee transaction count on two week increments - which would indicate some users could have benefit from shorter timeouts.Maybe I'm missing something but it seems wrong.
3	1522723186	5	Indeed.
0	1522721574	16	Simple: This was accomplished by censorship which molded the narrative and ousted dissenters.
0	1522713384	5	It was added as non-default in the BCore client. Everyone was told not to worry about it because by default RBF wouldn't be activated.This was a big criticism of the famous Mike Hearn message where he ridiculed RBF for what it was. "Mike is talking about a opt-in feature" was the narrative. Here's an example of the narrative at the time:- https://medium.com/@mbevand/mike-correction-replace-by-fee-rbf-was-never-merged-into-bitcoin-core-621bf26be84Only with latest BCore release did they make RBF turned on by default, and announced it with little fanfare in the release notes.
0	1522713417	6	We tried to fight against it. Consensus is apparently not needed when BlockstreamCore want something merged:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7388
1	1522769133	0	What are you talking about? From the very first release (v0.12) to this day (v0.16), bitcoind has a `-mempoolreplacement` option.    -mempoolreplacement       Enable transaction replacement in the memory pool (default: 1)From day one you have been able to disable RBF policy on your node.If you think your personal wallet not accepting RBF transactions somehow does anything other than makes you less safe, then you don't understand this at all.
2	1522780108	1	Miners and node operators are lazy and run with the defaults. Defaults matter and this new policy was pushed on the network by BlockstreamCore.
0	1522707145	30	RBF could be added without a hardfork, thus didn’t require widespread agreement. It also doesn’t really kill instant transactions as RBF enabled transactions are tagged as such. So merchants can choose to wait for confirmation on a RBF transaction while not waiting for a non-RBF transaction.
1	1522710610	12	I see from your post history you've got a pro-LN, anti miner centralization, anti CSW point of view and I respect that since you appear to have logical reasons, even if I don't agree with them.Counter views are important so we don't become an echo chamber like some forums.Thanks for sticking around this sub./u/chaintip
2	1522720662	13	>anti miner centralizationWho in the Sam Hell is pro-miner centralization? 
3	1522772600	1	Bcash folks.
3	1522725065	-12	Tons of people. Especially in this community. All the people who say non-mining nodes should not even exist becuase they're "pointless" since they dont have hasing power. Those people are pro-miner centralization.
4	1522727759	21	Miner centralization means hashpower centralization. Recognizing that non-mining clients do nothing to decentralize or secure the network isn't supporting miner centralization, it's facing reality. Proof of work, not proof of warm body running a piece of software. Competition, skin in the game, **incentives** - not everyone gets a free vote just for showing up.>The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. **If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs.**Was Satoshi pro-miner centralization? Proof-of-IP or UASF - now there's a way to guarantee centralization. Bitcoin works precisely because it harnesses competition and greed, not charity and "full node" feels. That was an idea invented by Core after Satoshi left. It arises from a simple misreading of Section 8 of the whitepaper. The brilliance of Bitcoin's design incentivizes miners to compete and cooperate to best satisfy stakeholders and thereby increase the value of their mined coins, and to interconnect in a configuration so tightly and directly that it approaches the theoretical maximum possible robustness for a network, enabling secure 0-conf and stability at very high capacity. The bigger the blocks, the stronger these incentives get and the harder the network gets to attack.Meanwhile a limp & loose mesh of non-miners leach off the network by pretending to be mining, thinking they're helping "relay" blocks between miners without realizing that every significant miner already has a blazing fast direct connection with every other significant miner. At large blocks this will be even more true. Your sockpuppet "node" could try to keep up, but this "guardian of the network" roleplaying charade will come with an  industrial-sized internet bill. Bitcoin mining was always destined to professionalize. That doesn't mean centralization; the opposite in fact, because there are thousands of businesses that will be getting into mining as BCH goes mainstream. 
5	1522733762	5	Very well put.
4	1522725986	12	non-mining nodes are..........not miners.   they have nothing to do with mining centralization. you can spin up 1 million rasberry pi's and it will still have no effect on mining centralization.    
4	1522726655	6	The argument is not that non-mining nodes should not exist. It is that non-mining nodes do nothing to benefit the network for the community as they have no function. Only miners secure the network. Nodes have to relay messages on to miners who confirm things. This argument was a response to the core argument that block sizes can't increase as people with Raspberry PI's won't be able to host a full node anymore.
5	1522729431	-4	Depends on what features your trying to secure.  If chainwork is all you care about than yes, only miners secure the network. If supply staying under 21 Million and coins staying in owners wallets until the owner and only the owner spends them is  important to you, than people running full nodes is very important.
6	1522732129	6	First of all, raspberry pi nodes do not prevent the 'supply from staying under 21 million'. I have no idea what you are going on about there.And as far as 'coins staying in owners wallets until the owner spends them', once again you don't need a full node for that. You don't need any node to store coins. Your coins are bound to a particular public key and that public key can only be spent with a private key. You can write that down and go off the grid and your coins will stay in your wallet.Now if you are suggesting that you need a full node to spend those coins...against that's not true. A partial node will be fine to do that unless you honestly think that the partial node that you have is not legitimate and has at some point forked from the full chain. Which, I suppose could happen, but sounds like a pretty big impossibility that a lot of people wouldn't be raising the alarm bells about it.In any event, you can spend it just fine with a tiny fractional partial node. Because to spend it all you do is send a message across the network formed by your private key saying "These many coins corresponding to this public key are now going to belong to this other public key and here is the code to authenticate this transaction"None of which requires a full node. 
7	1522768510	1	Bottom line is: "You need a full node to verify for yourself"For me that is the main point if you do not want to trust anybody run a node yourself.
2	1522731128	4	We're not all the same here. I'm pro bitcoin cash, pro lightning network (not the bitcoin core rollout though), very anti-miner centralization, and super duper anti-csw.started in the big block camp and never left.
2	1522737164	4	Believe it or not, I wouldn’t describe myself as pro-LN. When it comes to Lightning I’m generally neutral. But I have spoken in defence of the concept of LN in recent weeks because I see a lot of people trying quite clearly to spread FUD about it. I’m anti-FUD.
2	1522721883	3	Depending  on the wallet software a merchant chooses, spotting RBF tx's may not be easy. Especially when you have to train your employees as to what to do with them if they crop up. 
1	1522725122	4	This means devs could change anything including coin supply without widespread agreement if they coin up a soft fork, and that is exactly what happened with segwit and LN, reducing coin demand by using payment channels, same effect as increasing coin supply, but poor average users just can't understand what has happened until it is too late
2	1522726964	1	Most people don't understand a lot of things and cryptography and computer science is sort of a niche field that the vast majority of people do not understand. They went along with the loudest voices because people are social creatures and we tend to take cues from others as to what is the correct response in an uncertain situation. There are lots of interesting psychological studies highlighting this very phenomenon. The problem is that blockstream/core took over a lot of the major channels of dissemination of information about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and spread a lot of misinformation that way. Once enough people were fed the misinformation there was a tipping point where these people created more content and made the arguments for the blockstream/core side organically. Anyone who understood the issues were silenced so a coherant argument against these notions could not be put forward.And the few people who had the platform / money to have that kind of voice were targeted with personal attacks and shut down that way. 
3	1522730478	2	Anyway, the past several years has proven that cryptocurrency is also vulnerable to centralized control of devs and politics, and we have seen this even on the OP_GROUP discussion. So either you fix the code and never allow any change of it, or you have to apply many social measures to make sure the community does not split in multiple forks. Decentralize into other coins seems to be a new trend
4	1522731754	0	People should learn programming and cryptography in school. Everyone should be able to write a program that is a bitcoin client. The bigger issue is that we're not sure how long these encryption are going to work before something cracks them or a vulnerability is found. When that happens things will get interesting. 
2	1522737136	1	How could they change the coin supply using a softfork? 
3	1522742427	2	Two coinbase transaction in the same block. One "real" one, one "segregated" one. All transaction spending the new segregated coinbase transactions would have to stay in the extended block region though.
2	1522730991	1	> This means devs could change anything including coin supply without widespread agreement if they coin up a soft fork, and that is exactly what happened with segwit and LNYeah, I don't think people understand that you can do practically anything with a soft fork.  Yes, that includes increasing the blocksize, or increasing the total coin supply, or changing the proof of work algo.  (Basically, the way it works is that you create an extension block chain that includes a higher coin cap in it).
1	1522709186	6	So why wouldn't BCH want RBF as an option then?  Users could choose in their wallet app while paying if they want an instant transaction or an RBF one.  The community here seems anti-RBF so I'd like to understand better.
2	1522709734	31	because RBF would only be needed on a chain that is expected to experience a clogged mempool and a blind auction for transaction fees. this was never part of the original design of bitcoin, therefore RBF is an un-needed hack that adds extra complexity and risk for merchants wanting to use bitcoin for fast retail transactions.
3	1522714242	14	Additionally, u/radmege, it's a user-experience thing. The mere existence of RBF requires additional steps of merchants and consumers. How do you conveniently convey to people that they need to make sure they don't accidentally have RBF turned on? And those times they do screw up you will need to tell your customer they now have to stand around and wait for 10 minutes when they expected their transaction to be instant. Core doesn't care at all about user-experience because they design their software for themselves and not other people, so this point continues to be lost on them.
4	1522752412	3	What about 2 buttons in their wallet app, one titled "Insta-pay!" and one "Secure-pay!" so the average guy knows to press insta-pay when he buys a coffee and Secure-Pay when he buys a car or whatever. instapay is a no-rbf 0-conf transaction while secure-pay is an rbf transaction and needs a few confirmations.
5	1522768032	1	What makes you consider rbf as more secure?
5	1522752611	1	No matter how you try to spin it it's just not ideal from a UX point of view to introduce this unnecessary complication. It's always going to be simpler to just not have RBF. Your own example is a great demonstration of this. A lot of customers are going to unthinkingly use "Secure-pay!" because, well security, everything should be more secure, right? Without realising that that is going to provide them a terrible user-experience when buying a coffee.  Also secure pay is a terrible term for RBF since it's arguably less secure than a non-RBF payment given how it helps facilitate 0-conf double-spending.
6	1522753094	2	I assume people will get the "slow & secure" vs "fast & secure enough for small purchases" concept pretty fast. at the latest after they had to wait 10 minutes for their very secure coffee :)
6	1522753396	1	Sorry for double post but I had the idea that an optional RBF can be used absolutely without any UX changes: shops which accept 0-conf no prob could simply encode no-rbf into the QR-code to scan while shops which don't accept 0-zero conf could encode this as well...
7	1522753826	2	They could do that yes, but you would still have the bad UX failure-vector from anyone who didn't do this; so it's Core-style putting a demand on the entire ecosystem for something that I still can't understand the benefit of on an uncongested blockchain. The minute a Bitcoin user goes to a shop that accepts 0-conf but doesn't use this and then accidentally uses RBF they have the bad UX I mentioned  earlier. Can you with  a lot of time and effort get it to be the case that most people can successfully use non-RBF transactions? Probably. But there's always going to be the possibility for people to have a bad UX with RBF so long as wallets support it at all, so there needs to be some reason to have RBF, and I'm not convinced there's any benefit at all on an uncongested blockchain, and certainly nothing that outweighs the downsides. I'm more concerned about Bitcoin users having a good user experience and wanting to use it than I am about Peter Todd getting to pad his resume by releasing an "optional feature" everybody hates.
8	1522754472	1	Ok, we clearly disagree at the UX topic. However, we can agree that RBF is really of not much use on an uncongested blockchain. Bitcoin cash is going the "blocks should never be full" route and thus has no RBF feature, while Bitcoin wants full blocks and fee market in the blockchain thus needs RBF for dynamic fee transactions, cancelling of transactions etc. And thats the end of discussion i guess.tldr: BCH needs no & has no RBF while BTC needs&has RBF 
3	1522710735	6	"Keep it simple" - makes sense to me.
3	1522724289	3	RBF works when there is a practically adjustable blocksize (not in cases where there are blocks that are at the blocksize limit for extended periods of time).  Adjustable blocksize allows miners to take increased risk of orphaned blocks for increased rewards of fees.  RBF would then allow users to give miners an increased incentive to produce the good the users desire (block capacity).As it stood a few months ago, increased fees put you ahead in the que but didn't produce incentive for larger blocks*.  This was essentially the same scenario as a monopoly/cartel where supply is intentionally limited and showed similar economics.*Perhaps it should be technically said that it didn't produce sufficient incentive to switch due to lack of competition accessible to many users due to low merchant acceptance for most alt coins.  Perhaps some order of magnitude increase in incentive Would cause miners to produce larger blocks on the BTC chain.
3	1522714877	6	> because RBF would *only* be neededSatoshi had other uses back then for tx replacement pretty close to the current RBF mechanism. Did you read mike hearn's e-mails? Just search for nSequence [here](https://pastebin.com/JF3USKFT)
2	1522713261	9	Because there's literally no benefit to RBF on BCH. It's useful on BTC when fees go bananas and your transaction would never get picked up otherwise without raising the fee. On BCH, however, the minimum fee (1sat/byte) gets picked up next block every time. And the BCH community is dedicated to keeping fees low even if tx volume substantially increases by means of allowing big enough blocks to keep said fees to a minimum.
2	1522714880	9	Very few people around here know about [this satoshi's post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2181.msg28729#msg28729) and that ["Transaction replaceability was enabled in the first version of Bitcoin[1] but was disabled in the 0.3.12 release with the comment, "Disable replacement feature **for now**".[2]"](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_replacement). You can read more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/82wskg/bitcoin_thinks_0conf_is_still_safe_on_core_can/dvdlstm/).
2	1522713619	2	It would undermine 0-conf
3	1522737546	2	It would actually be possible to have a form of RBF that allows 0-conf to still work. If you can only add new inputs to a transaction and not remove outputs, that would let you replace a transaction with one with a higher fee that was still guaranteed to pay the original recipients the same amount as before.For some *inexplicable* reason, though, Core wanted the version of RBF that killed 0-conf transactions. A mystery for the ages.
4	1522757424	0	Or another way, mark RBF accepting transactions as RBF and merchant software can simply choose to not accept these transactions, oh wait... This is actually how it works.
5	1522763853	1	Which means a user can submit a valid payment transaction that the merchant then rejects saying "Sorry, you had RBF enabled on that transaction, you'll have to either wait for it to get a confirmation or you can go through the expense and trouble of cancelling your RBF transaction and send me a non-RBF one." Great user experience there.
2	1522711287	1	Also, if all wallets and merchants don't already support rbf, then they have to stop accepting 0conf until updated.
2	1522709741	1	Because Bitcoin Cash is designed to operate without congestion and so RBF should not be needed. Adding RBF complicates an otherwise elegant design. 
1	1522739136	1	So everyone has to change their software not to get defrauded? Nonsense.
2	1522739955	1	No, not really. Historically, accepting zero-conf transactions has *always* been recommended against. When I started using BTC pretty much everyone waited for ~6 blocks before accepting a transaction as real.Peter Todd made some successful double spend attacks (before blocks were full) as proof of principle that zero-conf wasn’t safe. Then, instead of trying to fix zero-conf, he made something which turned the attack vector into a feature.
0	1522704765	13	Consensus by corporate sponsored propaganda. Very professional quality propaganda. Couldn't fail.Ask Cobra about it, he is a political theoritician, very well coached in the techniques.
0	1522743052	3	RBF wasn't a consensus level change anyone could have forced it on the network. It would be up to miners to accept those txns.
0	1522732384	4	Bitcoin-Core is under centralized control. A small group makes the decisions and as long as they don't tank the price too badly (think censorship and troll armies keeping the dream alive), the miners stay to make money.
0	1522746170	2	RBF was able to be introduced by a much less contentious soft fork. Unlike a block size increase, it is also opt in for the end user to send or accept such transactions.
0	1522753864	2	RBF was in Satoshi's original version of bitcoin, the code is still online as is the code comment he placed directly above it explaining it.
0	1522707690	3	RBF was not a consensus change.
1	1522721526	-1	Defaults in the client matters.
2	1522722272	3	Sorry, but what does that matter to the question asked?
0	1522711887	4	Simple answer: RBF was not a consensus change. Mempool management is not part of consensus, which makes it much easier to change.
0	1522712177	4	One word, Core.
0	1522728546	2	The codes were controlled and maintained by a single group of developers. After observing their bad unethical intentions, I no longer could feel safe putting my money in BTC. I do not like my money controlled by a single group of people with known history of harassments, propaganda, lies/misinformation, censorships, making death threats against others.I am all in Bitcoin Cash not so much about the money but because I cannot see myself supporting such evil group of people. It is an idea and knowing that bringing Bitcoin Cash as Cash to the entire world is really making a huge impact on future generations. I want to be part of that change for the better.

1	1522747807	1	This reply is stupid. RBF was a new feature that didn't have community consensus. It doesn't matter if it was actually a good idea or not. The point is a non-consensus major change to how bitcoin works made it into the codebase, proving that a minority of devs do have control of bitcoin.
