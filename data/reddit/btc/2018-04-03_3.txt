0	1522747575	36	Remarkably balanced opinions.
1	1522749174	5	I wish we could get a CSW vs. Vitalik debate to hash out their misunderstandings. Or at least have V do a peer review of CSW's papers. Hopefully he will.
2	1522751051	40	CSW is not worth debating. A review would be fine but his papers make no sense as you can see from Peter Rizun's review:https://bitco.in/forum/threads/wright-or-wrong-lets-read-craig-wrights-selfish-miner-fallacy-paper-together-and-find-out.2426/
3	1522761282	6	The fact we are all talking about him indicates that in fact he is worth debating. If Vitalik is right then what better way to prove it!
4	1522761901	11	The people who don't already understand that everything he says is nonsense, won't be convinced by another debate.
5	1522774304	4	Exactly. This is also why CSW keeps on going, he knows there are plenty of people that don't understand what he is saying, even if he would make sense.  But it's still weird when real life turns into a Star Trek episode.  
5	1522772517	2	I disagree, I'm still on the fence about CSW. Seen good arguments on both sides so... More discussion doesn't hurt as long as it's open.
6	1522777812	2	OK, if you're actually on the fence, I'm happy to answer any questions.
3	1522760338	3	This is not as black and white as you put it and neither Rizun nor CSW have the last word.[They both have their points, and the matter is still up for debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88irk1/the_selfish_mining_debate_toxic_and_unnecessary/).
4	1522761992	9	It's only up for debate like evolution is up for debate. The ignorant side will continue to be wrong but that doesn't mean it's up for debate.
5	1522762982	4	There are many fields where intelligence can be applied on. For example, there's intelligence applied to mathematics, applied to sports, applied to human relationships, and applied to self-awareness.And you keep stating emotionally charged opinions as irrefutable facts, which is the same babble you accuse CSW of, if only on a different field.
5	1522765881	1	I will quote you from that linked thread:"I don't think the fight is bad, as long as nobody gets censored. It encourages people to think for themselves."change your mind in the past two days?I'd also like to point out that both you and Rizun showed up to that thread but didn't even attempt to argue against CSW's points
6	1522778852	2	> change your mind in the past two days?Good question, because if I do think the fight is bad, I shouldn't be fighting it. But as I think about it, it's been quite positive, at least for me.Before recently, I had never really looked into selfish mining and I didn't know if the argument was sound or not. But now I've read the paper, I've seen CSW's nonsense rebuttal and Peter's review of it. I've [proved](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/dwjvm3a/) myself with simple math that withholding blocks can be beneficial even if you can never share your blocks faster than other miners. I've [argued with CSW](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/dwkl5vg/?context=1) himself and found out that he never addresses anything but just replies with nonsense. I've discovered (once again) that there are a lot of clueless people who are very sure of themselves. And I've even [changed one persons's mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88jkpc/i_have_40_of_hashpower_and_i_mine_block_n1_if/dwlfr01/) slightly.I now have more respect for Emin GÃ¼n Sirer and I definitely appreciate Peter Rizun for calling out Craig Wright's nonsense.I can only hope it's been as positive for some other people as it has been for me.But of course that doesn't mean that I think this fight should go on forever. Once the clueless people have been exposed to the people that matter, there's not much left to gain. At least until enough new people join the community who need to be made aware of who is who.> I'd also like to point out that both you and Rizun showed up to that thread but didn't even attempt to argue against CSW's pointsI have [proven](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/dwjvm3a/) that (a form of) selfish mining can work and I've already done an extensive [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6v5ee7/block_times_and_probabilities/) on the memorylessness of the exponential distribution. I'm not aware of other points that need addressing.
3	1522759864	-5	Pretty sure Rizun is a troll. It's very dishonest to review a paper that hasn't been released to the public as completed to try to discredit someone. Seems like a passive aggressive bully tactic. It gives CSW more credibility that he's attacked so consistently. Let Rizun review the most recent papers. Would love to see Buterin take a crack at them too. 
4	1522765343	1	Buterin seems to not have that much interest in debating Craig
5	1522775049	3	Legit astronomers and scientists refuse debates with flat-earthers as well.
5	1522770822	0	I'm not too familiar with him but he did seem dismissive of CSW enough to bely some fear perhaps. It was an interesting exchange, I think it spooked some whales. 
2	1522751236	11	I'd be much more interested in Vitalik writing some BIPS/BUIPS for solving actual problems, instead of more detabe with "the resident rockstar".
3	1522753688	5	>That said, I think BCH should just hard fork to cut block times down to ~15 seconds and adopt GHOST.https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/981092517096562689sounds like a proposal to me.
4	1522754063	6	It is not an actionable proposal, it doesn't contain enough information do anything productive with.I'd be happy if he took some time to formalize what such a proposal would look like, and lay out where we are, how to get there, and why it is a good place to get to.
4	1522758650	2	You have too many orphans with such a short block time...weak blocks provide the same PoW assurance but hash power isn't wasted
2	1522750152	2	I agree that he should review his papers.
2	1522760127	1	That would be good. Also because the debate arond Bitcoin is larger than tech.Maybe Vitalik can run circles around CSW just on the computer science part, but CSW can run circles around Vitalik regarding the economy and incentives part.We need both.
1	1522769333	0	More like just plain wrong about a lot of things. He's just a kid.
0	1522745460	10	Very entertaining. Wish there was video 
1	1522752562	10	Here's a video of Vitalik calling CSW a fraud https://twitter.com/taidi_ji/status/981101226480762880
2	1522752933	5	Name calling is so convincing.  I'm hooked.  Time to go buy some eth. /s
3	1522755179	5	yeah this was a bummer, I hope he reviews one of CSW's papers and makes up for the ad hominem. He really looked immature here. 
4	1522764279	7	You are disappointed that a man calls out another man's credibility when he is already operating on borrowed credibility?  Call it an ad hominem, but why does he have the stage, if it were not for his own ad homimen of calling himself Satoshi, lord of bitcoin?
4	1522758236	3	Looking for approval from the crowd
5	1522759745	2	Maybe, maybe not. I'd be pissed if I thought I were being taken for a ride, which seems to be the general opinion of a more than a few knowledgeable devs re. his latest paper.
5	1522759295	3	Very juvenile. He'll regret it some day. 
2	1522768146	-1	I guess this is why I dumped a lot of my ethereum last year. As smart as Vitalik is, he should stick to attacking ideas instead of people. He will discredit CSW more if he can prove his ideas wrong, but by personal attacking, he makes himself look like the wrong one.
1	1522749096	2	yeah I hope they post something.
0	1522749968	26	Awesome thread, Vitalik has more common sense than half of the crypto community together.
0	1522766119	6	Roger finishes, speech, one person claps. Roger says "you can clap".  25%? Of the room claps.Lmfao
0	1522751926	20	49.Roger brings up my post on why soft forks are coercive50.I agree with my post on soft fork coercionmade me laugh ^
0	1522754603	6	Thank you for this /u/vbuterin !
0	1522772778	2	Vitalik is my spirit animal. One of the few people I feel are fully trustworthy in the crypto space. 
1	1522773141	0	I feel that he's honest, but also has some growing up to do. Economics is tough for a youngster to grasp because you have to have been around the block a few times to really get a handle on the human nature aspect. He'll get there, but he's not there yet IMO
2	1522774973	3	Economics is not a hard science like mathematics. No human being ever gets economics 100% right, just look at history. You can't predict future human bevarious unless you live in one of Asimov's Foundation books! 
0	1522755382	4	 /u/vbuterin needs to do a formal review of some CSW papers before continuing to sling mud. Ad-hominem makes him look like he's afraid of something. If CSW is wrong, please explain to us WHY instead of name calling. BCH is not a cult of personality, if he can explain to us why Dr. Wright's IDEAS are incorrect we'll gladly jettison him from the community. 
1	1522758910	11	Here's why CSW is wrong:https://bitco.in/forum/threads/wright-or-wrong-lets-read-craig-wrights-selfish-miner-fallacy-paper-together-and-find-out.2426/#post-41736https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy
2	1522758919	2	**Gambler's fallacy**The gambler's fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, is the mistaken belief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future. It may also be stated as the belief that, if something happens less frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen more frequently in the future. In situations where the outcome being observed is truly random and consists of independent trials of a random process, this belief is false. The fallacy can arise in many situations, but is most strongly associated with gambling, where it is common among players.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
2	1522759207	3	Nah sorry, you can't cite an unfinished, unreleased paper. Find one that he posted as finished and refute that. 
3	1522774432	3	What do you mean with "unreleased paper"? The paper is available [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3004026).It's not peer reviewed, but why should one not be allowed to criticize a paper that's not published in a peer reviewed venue? If anything, that weakens the credibility of the paper, because reviewers likely saw it the same way as Peter Rizun.The paper will btw. never be published in a credible peer reviewed venue (unless he is extremely lucky with the reviewers), because it's wrong and doesn't have any valuable contribution.
3	1522774499	0	Hey, it's me I am God almighty himself speaking to you through this reddit post. CSW is not Satoshi, and I know .. trust me on this. You can't proof I am not God  but good luck trying! 
1	1522756211	4	This.  If CSW is wrong then so be it, he made an argument, presented his case, life goes on.  If CSW is indeed a fraud then he will consistently be wrong and, over time, this will become obvious to everyone in BCH....but...if this sub considers this name calling from a person of perceived authority, to be anything more than what it is, pure mud slinging, then BCH's future doesn't look so bright anymore. 
2	1522756580	10	I mean the magic of r/btc is that "this sub" is a chaotic sandbox of differing opinions. I haven't seen too many minion followers of CSW to be honest, mostly curious skepticism. We keep him at arms length. If he produces some magic. Great! If not, we'll sally forth without him.The idol worship of wonderkid Vitalik Buterin, IQ a million!!! Easily as bad or worse than CSW. 
3	1522768394	2	> The idol worship of wonderkid Vitalik Buterin, IQ a million!!! Easily as bad or worse than CSW.this. I think there is some projection going on, because its vitalik's fanboys that are the most vocal about calling other people fanboys of CSW.
3	1522774708	1	I agree with you on this one. As for worshipping Vitalik, I like his personna and attitude, he is a youngster after all. I don't know if he is a genius, cause I don't think I will ever even do an attempt in trying to understand Ethereum  ... so I have no idea how smart he really is. Smarter than me that's for sure. 
3	1522757636	1	Agree wholly
2	1522759935	2	Completely agree with you.Not only that. The toxic mud-slinging is also encouraged by trolls, in order to further divide the community.We all have a responsability here to act as adults, including CSW, Vitalik and everyone else.
1	1522775803	1	Absolutely not.  He has way more important shit.  For more information see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit#Bullshit_asymmetry_principle
0	1522759104	2	With the exception of replace by fee, Vitalik completely agrees with our views
1	1522759583	6	Also zero conf, he doesn't seem to understand the utility of sub one second payments. He needs to go ride the bus or buy a coffee at a busy shop. 
2	1522762783	3	He does understand the importance of quick transactions. Hence the "This I think is definitely a bad argument; I actually go to restaurants often and usually when I come to one and it's full, I go to a different restaurant." response.He is just afraid of miners colluding, but it's highly unlikely miners won't just mine the first block they see.
3	1522771064	3	I don't mean restaurant fast, I mean FAST. Like Shinjuku station at rush hour fast. 20 milliseconds tops fast. This shits gotta be better than the money we have now. They say a disruptive tech has to be 10 times better to gain adoption.
1	1522768470	1	He doesn't understand the importance of PoW over PoS.Honestly, if you don't get that, you never understood why Bitcoin works.
2	1522770674	1	I thought Casper was a hybrid system and not pure PoS. All of the work on dagger-hashimoto wasn't just to distribute stake

0	1522772888	1	Doing it for fun..... A.K.A. "Im going to troll but with relevant information and opinion". That's basically what he meant IMO lol. That aside Vitalik has some good thoughts and ideas. <3

0	1522768030	0	Wow, this just proved to me that Vitalik doesn't understand how/why Bitcoin works.I have to think that he was *assigned* to work on crypto - paid by someone higher up that understands.
1	1522772072	1	ETH has spawned a thousand shitcoins that's for sure. It's been great for the divide and conquer hit on bitcoin for sure. You never know! Interesting that he doesn't quite *get it*.
