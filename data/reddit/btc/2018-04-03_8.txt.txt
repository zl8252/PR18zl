0	1522724175	10	He probably won't get any more business. Crypto (and most) promotions are based on the illusion of hype and he just destroyed any chance of convincing anybody that hype illusion is real.
1	1522733887	26	You give too much credit to the average human brain.
2	1522740770	5	The moon kids in r/cryptocurrency already destroyed mcafee months ago because he pumped the wrong coins, and fought with Verge (being pumped at that time).Now he said he takes a "promotional fee", probably, not to go to jail prosecuted by the SEC.
0	1522721997	3	This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17189880/john-mcafee-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-twitter-ico) reduced by 76%.

1	1522743468	1	2nd of April? Doubt so.
0	1522744278	2	I'll do it for $100,000.
0	1522757883	2	Fuck all this cult of personality shit. There is no rightful place for it in crypto or anyone else. Opinions should stand on their own merits and the market shouldn't blindly value someones opinion, just because they are "influential" or famous or whatever else.
1	1522758260	2	Except they do. That is how coins get pumped.
0	1522722762	4	He is an person with influence, they get paid get paid for offering their influence without directly disclosing that they are paid.Somewhere there is likely a disclaimer that says that the views and endorsements expressed on his twitter is promotional and that it is the company using the account, not John McAfee the person.What he does is probably legal and standard practice, the reason famous people tweet about products and events is because the get paid to do it, and it is in their own financial interest to hide the fact that they are paid to the extent it is legal.
1	1522733870	0	Yes, while your statement is largely true, his endorsement still undermines some of the integral values of the crypto community.
2	1522737326	10	There is no values or integrity when it comes to trading, no matter what the underlying asset that is traded is.His comments was aimed towards aiding the pumping and dumping of coins.This is part of what crypto stands for, no rules, no regulations, no oversight, no barriers of entry into investing and no central control over what is illegal in regulated markets.
2	1522745656	3	The only true value in cryptocurrencies is the cryptographic verification.  Having integrity is just a thing humans need to trust you.  Cryptoeconomics is trustless.  
0	1522739015	1	Why doesn’t he make his own ico 
0	1522739390	1	so this is what crypto currency was made for - so sad
0	1522748284	1	Does this mean we won't be watching him eat his dick on live television?
0	1522750774	1	Has this been fact checked guys?

0	1522757110	1	Yeah, hookers and blow are expensive.  Gotta pay the bills somehow.
0	1522757763	1	This guy is very toxic
0	1522760797	1	And he said "I'm old! I don't need the money!" which got a lot of people to trust his tweets thinking it WASN'T for his best interest. 
0	1522721791	1	Wow! Like his credibility could be any more tarnished... this guy is such a liar! How can he not get in trouble? 
1	1522721904	6	funny enough you do not see this in /r/Bitcoin but if they do this will be "good for Bitcoin" too.
2	1522726737	1	They don't do it since Mc Afee is down with the BCH gang.TBH the headline reads worse than it actually is:HOW TWEETS ARE CREATEDWe turn down over 90% of all companies wanting to buy our services. The reason is that only products and services that Mr. McAfee truly believes in will be promoted. These are products or services that Mr. McAfee has personally purchased or used and is pleased enough with to engage in promotions, or ICOs whose white paper describes a vision in line with Mr. McAfee’s vision and the company producing it has passed our thorough audit. As such, he is comfortable using his own voice in tweets if our clients wish. In this arrangement, the client is allowed no input into the tweet so that Mr. McAfee’s tweet will remain authentically his. Alternatively, the client may write their own tweet, but the tweet must not imply that it was written by Mr. McAfee.
3	1522740883	0	> They don't do it since Mc Afee is down with the BCH gang.Is he? I think he mines whatever and sells, he met jihan only to buy cheap asic miners.
4	1522769615	1	Dig through the interviews with him.He never states it publically anymore since core trolls would terrorize him.
5	1522769781	1	So core trolls are cyber terrorists with the power to silence people?
6	1522771004	1	No, they are simply retarded and annoying.Why feed trolls unnecessarily.
2	1522778115	1	That's because they are auto removing any new posts with the words "John McAfee" in the title.  I tried 3 times 3 different ways to submit to the articles from the verge, CBS marketwatch, Cnet, and /bitcoin isn't having any of it.I found it odd that I saw a post in /news and not /bitcoin.  As recently as yesterday McAfee was the /bitcoin poster child as "proof" bitcoin will take over the world.  Today they are pretending he no longer exists.
1	1522721868	2	I'll do it for $50,000
2	1522722157	0	yeah man, I can tweet for like 1/10th of that. And I give you a bunch of tweets per month for free.
1	1522731335	1	Fake article dude. He didn't reveal anything 
2	1522757707	3	https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/979819934082584577
0	1522743266	0	So, was he being paid when he was talking about BCH last year?
0	1522731431	0	You're all sheep. John is true cryptocurrency hero. He fights for you. This article is totally false! 
1	1522757678	3	false how, he's now always. He admits it's his website https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/979819934082584577
