1	1522721658	16	The "Federal" Reserve is also a private entity in control of the money supply.Blockstream is operating in no different manner.Think about it people.
1	1522700003	10	Of course it will generate revenue. AXA want ROI
2	1522713758	7	That's literally the face of a scammer.
3	1522722049	19	I love it he totally missed how sinister the question was. The interviewer was literally asking him if they were going to benefit Bitcoin or benefit themselves, and he just spilled the beans. This should be stickied in this sub.In fact, can anyone just take the question, crop out all the in between commentary, and just leave Sampson saying that theyâ€™re trying to benefit themselves and not bitcoin? Because that shit going viral...

0	1522696516	21	So blatant. That guy gives me serious Heebie-jeebies. Bitcoin is a currency, not an enterprise corporation to abuse as they please. edit: can anyone else see /u/tralxz 's comment (many recent comments are not showing up for me (including my own) https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/893m8j/blockstreams_samson_mow_largely_our_stuff_is_free/dwotm3t/ edit2: nm. looks like there was some realllly weird delays going on.

1	1522699358	2	I can see it bro .
0	1522707563	15	The guy is a jester, willing to say or do anything for a buck and he has found his niche in the Blockstream PR shitshow.

0	1522732622	5	If he shows up, he'll be drilled on the Korean conference.
0	1522739402	3	Yet blockstream/core fanatics seem to act like they are never charge for their services..
0	1522729305	2	I think what's more interesting here than a company trying to be profitable (shock awe horror) is that they've made it clear federations and sidechains are a different thing. I wish someone besides Paul and I were working on Sidechains.
