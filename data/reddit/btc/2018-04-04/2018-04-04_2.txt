0	1522797115	33	The best part of this graphic is how you show that neither branch can definitively claim to be going in a straight line from the original history.  There's no angle data in the block chain.
1	1522801105	6	Although I would like to see the BCH split upward earlier on the timeline than the BTC's downward split, and a dashed or gray (ghost) line continue straight. It was important that BCH split off before BTC introduced SW and the promised-but-never-delivered 2x (2MB).
2	1522809482	6	This doesn't show the 2 splitting from an imaginary perfect/original bitcoin. It shows that the 2 utxo sets have diverged.
1	1522833830	2	You're right, the angle means nothing. Similarly, the thickness and lengths of the lines mean nothing.  It'd be cool to see what it'd look like if this was adjusted this so that angle to the horizontal was momentum - ie, transactions per minute, the length of the lines was number of transactions and thickness of the lines was value of transactions.
1	1522840024	1	Not true. If you take a client from 2013, spin it up and let it sync it will sync to to the Bitcoin network, not the BCH network.But ultimately it's not the software that counts. At the end of the day it's the community, which is predominantly behind Bitcoin. And so are businesses, even if they are philosophically aligned with BCH - No business will risk "accept payments in Bitcoin" and then request BCH. Or sell BCH when asked for Bitcoin. Because they would be defrauding the clients and end up in a court of law very fast.Bitcoin is Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash.
1	1522853950	-1	The fact that a bitcoin client from 4 years ago still works (on only one of the two branches) is not sufficient?
0	1522793454	18	> Bitcoin Cash is the continuation of the Bitcoin project as peer-to-peer electronic cash. It is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain ledger, with upgraded consensus rules that allow it to grow and scale. That means you own the same amount of Bitcoin Cash as you did Bitcoin at the time of the fork. Bitcoin Cash immediately raises the blocksize limit to 8MB as part of a massive on-chain scaling approach. There will be ample capacity for everyone's transactions. Low fees and fast confirmations resumed with Bitcoin Cash. The network is growing fast again. Users, merchants, businesses, and investors are returning.>Why didn't Bitcoin raise the blocksize if it was easy? > Some of the developers did not understand and agree with the original vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash that Satoshi Nakamoto had created. Instead, they preferred Bitcoin become a settlement layer. Many miners and users trusted these developers, while others recognized that they were leading the community down a different road than expected. These two very different visions for Bitcoin are largely incompatible, which led to the community divide. -from http://bitcoincash.org/#faq
1	1522815226	8	A quote dripping in bias language. 
2	1522815287	2	Where is it biased, show me.
3	1522815426	3	Sure! > Some of the developers did not understand and agree with the original vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash that Satoshi Nakamoto had created. Instead, they preferred Bitcoin become a settlement layer.

4	1522820976	4	I just don't see the bias there. Seems very factual and neutral to me.
5	1522831458	3	Not sure if /s but if you aren't. I'm not op, but there's the presupposition that those who are on core are incorrect in their understanding of satoshi plans. This is not put within enough context to be justified as a claim and also cannot be called neutral as it takes a position on the issue. The unbiased phrasing would be more like: Two parties arouse. One believed that the ideal scaling method was off chain. The other believing the ideal scaling is on chain. Both believe they are most in line with satoshi's vision and both have the best interests of bitcoin at heart. For a discussion of which is more in line with satoshi's vision click here: (link to a referenced piece that's like ten pages minimum.) This project represents the on chain solution. Something like this would be more neutral and still factual. I would then follow that up with the merits of BCH and why it's valuable and doing well as a project. Moving into opinionated and not biased positions. 
6	1522837149	5	That’s not true though, the core-team and fans keep claiming that satoshi didn’t get everything right, that the white paper and pow needs to be changed, schnorr should be used of Satoshi’s very explicit elliptic curve decisions.None of what BTC represents is what satoshi expressed.

0	1522798751	12	Nice. Trolls hate this.
1	1522799316	4	Yes they do, it's not my intent, I just made the graphic to inform (by all means, share it).
2	1522832488	0	If “bitcoin cash” is bitcoin, why call it bitcoin cash? 
3	1522838598	3	To differentiate from bitcoin (BTC)
4	1522863620	1	So “bitcoin cash” is not bitcoin?
5	1522864083	1	how did you come to that conclusion?
3	1522846219	3	To never forget that Bitcoin has been always meant to be used as cash.
0	1522800844	11	It is a lie to even suggest that the Bitcoin Cash fork and Segwit adoption happened at the same time.  Segwit adoption happened because proponents of Bitcoin Cash left the BTC consensus to start a new consensus for BCH.   BCH forked, allowing for BTC to undergo a consensus-based change into segwit support.  In between the two events, there was a whole month in which the "legitimate" pre-segwit BTC chain wasn't being built on by BCH supporters.  The "consensus mechanism" determines legitimacy (white paper), which BCH outright ignored and created anew.
1	1522804452	12	Segwit was not an effect, it was a cause. The fork occurred because of the disagreement as to how to scale. Big blockers did not want Segwit, so a fork was created before it was implemented, resulting in BCH and Segwit BTC. 
2	1522806694	-4	The reality of it was an effect.  The conjecture of it was (allegedly) the cause.But we don't have blockchains because we favor conjecture, do we?
1	1522802512	10	> Segwit adoption happened because proponents of Bitcoin Cash left That's really not accurate. SegWit was planned for a long time despite tons of criticism. If you ask many here they will say it was intentional to allow a smoother transition to **unnecessary** "off-chain solutions" like lightning or liquid. You're putting so much emphasis on "the consensus mechanism" and it tells me you haven't really read the whitepaper.  Do a CTRL+F [on the whitepaper](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/whitepaper) for "consensus" and tell me how many times the word appears. It is in reference to the simple function with which mining nodes signal blocks as accepted or rejected - that is it, nothing more or less. There may've been a pre-segwit chain but each day the other chain gets closer to Bitcoin+Segwit+Lightning and that is less "Bitcoin" than ever.
2	1522803188	1	> That's really not accurate. SegWit was planned for a long time despite tons of criticism.It was also stunted for a long time, because there was a consensus against it.  That part of consensus withdrew its "contribution" to the network, which allowed the actual adoption of segwit via consensus.>You're putting so much emphasis on "the consensus mechanism" and it tells me you haven't really read the whitepaper.It literally is referenced to as the single way that Bitcoin can evolve and adopt new rules.  The white paper outlined how Bitcoin was designed.  The conclusion asserted how it is allowed to change.  >It is in reference to the simple function with which mining nodes signal blocks as accepted or rejected - that is it, nothing more or less.More.  "Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."
3	1522803591	6	Since you didn't mention how many times it appears: the answer is one. One time. I am sorry to be the one to tell you this, but the needed rules and incentives it is talking about enforcing are parts 2-10 in the whitepaper.
4	1522804033	3	So you are going to disregard the 177 words that were written to establish it as a function?  It wasn't mentioned just to be ignored.  The fact that there is a whole section dedicated to it shows that you are trying very hard to disparage its existence.  It mattered very much when BitcoinClassic, BitcoinXT and BitcoinUnlimited were contending for acceptance, but now it doesn't matter because it was too difficult to achieve?  That's kind of the point behind the immutability of a blockchain, isn't it?Let me ask you this.  How many times was bitcoin referenced in the white paper?  Once.  And the rest of the paper was all about it, including the aspect of the consensus mechanism, and its function to determine the legitimacy of a chain.  Don't you see how ridiculous "how many times the word appears" statement is?  Why should I respond to it?Also, "any needed rules" is more than "existing rules". 
5	1522804268	6	We can argue programmer semantics until we go blue in the face. I've said what was necessary to be said.
6	1522804685	-1	Since you bring up semantics, there is a difference between arguing and bargaining.
7	1522805765	12	If you're looking for some kind of bargained compromise, that ship has sailed when the fork arrived. 
8	1522806065	-1	I weep that the NYA was even a thing.
0	1522821215	7	I really don't understand this "closest to the whitepaper" argument. It's easy enough to make your case for bch over btc, and you're making it seem like you have no argument.
1	1522849962	0	It is because the "closest to the whitepaper" argument is flawed and really just an [appeal to authority](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority). They are quoting scripture, claiming they are [the true scotsman](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/no-true-scotsman).Satoshi himself added the block size limit, and Satoshi himself implemented numerous changes to the protocol that were not in the whitepaper. The whitepaper were the ideas of a single man/woman/team on a novel data structure that would enable cryptocurrencies viably. Since its release, ~~dozens~~/~~hundreds~~/~~thousands~~ loads of people have looked at it, thought about it, and made new insights and discoveries that have changed the original ideas. It is like saying you want a computer made of vacuum tube technology, because that was how the first whitepaper about computers described it.
2	1522852385	-1	I agree. It's undermining the whole project and is making it hard to have discussions that are worth having.
0	1522825780	9	Completely false, bcash forked before Bitcoin did the optional segwit upgrade (soft fork)Never go full bcashtard.

0	1522803955	7	Looks good. Only thing you can add is that segwit activated about 3 weeks after the BCH fork divergence. 
0	1522820777	5	Lol, this is all you guys have. Good luck convincing anyone of this.Just a question, in the 3 weeks from before segwit activated after bcash forked off, how many bitcoins did we have?
1	1522822146	4	> this is all you guys have> bcash forked offI see you're stuck in the misguided top box :/ http://reddit.com/r/btc/comments/83av1m/100000_merchants_start_accepting_bitcoin_cash/https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dtbew/bitcoin_cash_a_reflection_on_how_far_weve_come/https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/83h4o7/bitcoin_cash_highlights_from_the_past_few_months/http://reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88udzy/lets_remember_why_were_here/I guess that's all we have   ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
2	1522824961	6	And yet tx count is comparable to doge and ltc lolhttps://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-ltc-bch-doge.html#3m&search=dogEdit doge has actually had more tx for some time =D
3	1522833910	0	In times of dispute, where there are two competing chains, the nodes will find the longest chain and deem that chain to be the true chain. BCH has a longer chain than BTC. If we set all the mining software to start at the origin block and find out which chain is the right one, they would all universally decide that BCH is the right chain. Objectively by the founding rules of bitcoin BCH should be viewed as the true chain. Transaction count was never the guiding metric. Semantically that's probably bullshit, but those are the rules that bitcoin run off of. We can abandon protocol if we want, but we should at least be honest that that is what we are doing. 
4	1522836663	4	Oh lord. I think you mistake longest for most [accumulated pow]( https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cdojm/question_how_is_accumulated_proof_of_work/) and if you go back and look to the most recent compatible client before segwit activation and bcash fork you'll notice it keeps following bitcoin, and not bcash.Also from the whitepaper:> The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in itIm sure you will find some excuse why this is suddenly not what determines the "true bitcoin" though.
0	1522806507	10	I'm getting really sick of posts like this. You're making yourselves look stupid by trying to take over the Bitcoin name. If Bcash was the "real" Bitcoin, everyone would call it "Bitcoin". Change the name of your altcoin and you just might be taken more seriously.
1	1522806819	1	I'm sorry - you're stuck at the top of the graphic. You've been misguided. I'm sorry for the dissonance.  Bitcoin Cash is the better Bitcoin. ("Bcash" is something else entirely, probably a craptastic token).
2	1522806975	1	No, I am not. Bitcoin is not a soft fork of anything. Tell yourself what you want, but what  I said in my first comment is true.
3	1522807312	4	True like if I cut a pizza in half and eat half of it, I still have a whole pizza true. Well OK then, so you're somewhere between the top box and the middle box - maybe you're just a little confused. 
4	1522808211	8	You'd have half a pizza... but if this is your type of logic, I understand your confusion.
5	1522808366	4	Something tells me you never even looked at the bottom of the graphic.  https://i.imgur.com/cfHHZeJ.jpg
6	1522810103	6	Adding the word "cash" to the title of this Bitcoin fork and claiming it is the real Bitcoin because the whitepaper also used this word is scammy.
7	1522811048	2	They were both Bitcoin pre-August 2017. Afterwards one is closer to the [whitepaper](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/whitepaper) than the other. Differentiation is completely necessary- especially when you are talking about avoiding the loss of people's money. You wouldn't call proprietary NeXTSTEP+ open-source FreeBSD "FreeBSD", that would be dishonest, but that's what the other chain is still doing even though there's SegWit and everyone's excited about Lightning. If you want to be honest, you'd give it another name like "Lightning" or "Liquid".But, alright, I can see that this graphic probably isn't going to help clear things up for you, and honestly this does reflect on how approachable the concepts and complexities of Blockchain and Bitcoin Software is to the larger public and how that relates to the challenge of mass-adoption. 
8	1522811988	5	You mean Bitcoin was Bitcoin until August 2017. It still is. Just like miracle whip is not mayonnaise, Bcash is not Bitcoin.
9	1522814708	4	That's a terrible analogy that sticks at the [top of the graphic]( https://i.imgur.com/cfHHZeJ.jpg). But since you insist on using mayo. If you want to call Bitcoin mayo: then Bitcoin+Segwit+Lightning is artificial 'lite' mayo with added corn-syrup, while Bitcoin Cash is just straight mayo.
9	1522837993	0	AXA/BlockStream token is Bitcoin only in nameThe best option would be to rename BCH to BTS - Bitcoin Satoshi and BTC to BAB - Bitcoin AXA/BlockStream. Then there would be no confusion :)
2	1522821501	4	It doesn’t matter how strongly you feel about it, or even how right you are. If the majority of users don’t agree with you then you are wrong. And that means big exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, etc. If they don’t call BCH simply bitcoin, then it isn’t 
3	1522821659	1	Yeah that isn't accurate. It's like saying "it doesn't matter how strongly you think a wheel is round, or even how right you are—it isn't round, it's square. (Even if the majority disagrees and thinks it's square)."
4	1522831395	4	You couldn’t even think of a good example, really? Your example is literally an indisputable fact that nobody has ever disagreed with. You could have brought up flat earth theory or bacteria (maybe you are just that uneducated)Anyways, majority consensus being fact is absolutely true when it comes to linguistics. When it comes to nomenclature and language, majority becomes fact, always. You can try to fight it but until exchanges agree with you, you will always be wrong. Feel free to open up any exchange and feel bad
2	1522821577	1	Actually, they have value. They are pegged one to one to the Brazilian Real and are currently worth about $0.30 each.https://bcash.com.br
1	1522835295	3	They are constantly trying to rewrite history.
1	1522832654	1	I don't get your emotional connection to this topic. Why does this matter so much this you?
0	1522803744	7	This group reminds me of flatearthers...
1	1522803801	1	Why is that then...
2	1522808694	9	Full of mystery and conspiracies...
3	1522808928	3	That's mostly projection from outside this sub or "this group". I'm not going to say there isn't some small degree of mystery or uncertainty though - people ask how things work and debate related conference topics all the time - but to compare it to flatearthers is quite off the mark.
0	1522798511	11	Wishful thinking. Graph at the top is correct, consensus rules haven't changed after bcash fork. Bitcoin is going on as usual, and on top of that we have another altcoin in the name of bcash.
1	1522820156	7	Who is upvoting this bcore spam?Hint: upvotes are not organic*Edit: so my comment got 7 upvotes but upvotes for the comment I replied to remained the same (also ~7, number changes because of caching/load balancing)? I'm pretty sure that's not how things work here organically. It seems that such comments are being monitored and automatically upvoted if their score drops below a certain threshold.*
2	1522832580	1	I mean, I'm thinking all of the upvotes on you are organic. All posts decay in upvotes, maybe that is what you're observing?
3	1522833066	5	What I'm saying is that how it usually goes on Reddit is that if there is a pair of opposing comments and if the deeper comment gets upvotes, the upper comment gets at least the same amount of downvotes.Not to mention that "bcash" comments are **always** downvoted.If you spend a lot of time in this sub, it's easy to notice when something's off. It's one of those cases.
4	1522857832	2	I saw some of the bad comments in here get 8-9 downvotes over a few hours while suddenly getting 20+ upvotes in a matter of minutes. Definite vote manipulation going on
4	1522833310	-1	Yeah. I've taken to no longer bothering to downvote Bcash comments. I think they like it too much. 
5	1522833682	3	Every little helps.
1	1522799729	12	Bitcoin is going on as usual as Bitcoin Cash. Hardly wishful thinking, adoption is growing fast. On the other chain, Bitcoin+SegWit+Lightning is where you're headed (soon it would be dishonest to still call it Bitcoin). You're stuck at the top of the graphic, you've been misguided. I'm sorry for the dissonance. Bitcoin Cash is the better Bitcoin.  (And "Bcash" is something else entirely, probably a worthless token).
2	1522821094	4	I mean my primary holdings are in BCH too (and I’m banned from r/bitcoin) but like he said the top graphic is literally correct since the original bitcoin consensus has held steady since the very beginning. The bottom graphic is literally wrong because it’s implying somehow that the original consensus and chain somehow just stopped existingOn top of that the graphic also shows that the BCH fork happened at the *same time* as Segwit + lightning decisions and that’s absolutely false too
3	1522824345	2	Careful.  Those are some dangerous facts. 
3	1522846991	3	You can drive your car on a straight road, no need to move the steering wheel, but when a curve comes if you don't begin steering it your car will crash. Sure you may argue you are not at fault because you didn't change anything about your driving.The point is that the economic incentives did change by not wanting to hard fork in order to increase the blocksize, and having the "same consensus rules" as before do nothing to fix the broken Bitcoin system when blocks are full.

Ask about it on r/btc)
1	1522846437	2	Maybe technically you could argue that? But they for sure changed dramatically the economic incentives, ensuring a fee market, breaking 0-conf, etc., and without the correct economic incentives, the Bitcoin idea is broken.
2	1522851497	-2	Who are you to say bitcoin is broken or not? 0-conf is still as it is. 1 MB limit has always existed, the only reason a fee market didn't develop before because there weren't enough transactions to warrant it. They changed economic incentives? Wtf does that mean? Who is they? How did they change economic incentives? Bitcoin is still as it was. Set up a node from 5 years ago and see which consensus rules it follows. That's bitcoin.
3	1522852613	2	The economic incentives changes by introducing unnecesary friction like RBF, which breaks the simplicity of 0-conf, and doesn't offer anything of value outside of a double blind bid market, which is also an unnecessary economic aberration.We can now have all the transactions we need without congesting the network. That is how Bitcoin is supposed to work. That's not how Bitcoin core works anymore. That's how it has changed for the worse. And that's why BCH is getting all the adoption now.
4	1522852915	-2	Your personal views are what defines bitcoin now? Great to know. Most of it is bullshit anyway, RBF is just an optional feature, no idea how you got that it introduces friction. It doesn't break simplicity of 0-conf, it adds to it. Bch getting adoption is the biggest joke I've heard in a while, considering [blocks are empty](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/blocks), as always.
5	1522853410	3	You have to understand that you first make the highway, and then the cars and trucks can use it and services cand be build upon. Not the other way around.Doesn't matter that RBF is optional. It still introducing friction in the economic transactions with merchants, that now have to have protocols to deal with it, like for example clients paying with RBF and having to wait 10 minutes to receive their service, and complaining why they have to wait. Those things harm adoption.No idea how you consider being widely adopted by merchants and industry a joke by any measure, but to each their own.
1	1522805459	0	I dont not know why you get down votes. This is clearly the unadulterated truth.
1	1522832326	-2	I don't really get the heat of the Holy war between these two sides. BCH worked better than BTC post fork with faster transactions at lower fees. But now BTC is doing well with good technological strides happening. I'm optimistic about both projects.What is your opinion on BCH having a longer chain than BTC? If you put brainless computers running the algorithms BTC and BCH are built on, they would universally agree that BCH is the longer chain and objectively the true chain as a result. Semantically I think it's a meaningless distinction, but you seem to think otherwise. Why is BTC the true bitcoin, why is BCH an altcoin?
2	1522838180	5	Longest chain means the chain with more accumulated proof of work *that follows consensus rules*, not the chain with the highest latest block number. Even if bitcoin cash had more accumulated proof of work (it doesn't), it couldn't be called bitcoin because it doesn't follow the consensus rules. Semantics, technology, whitepaper or no matter how you look at it, bcash is an altcoin.

0	1522794918	8	Bitcoin has forked many times in the past.  Your entire graphic really makes no sense, bcash has nothing to do with Bitcoin

2	1522796281	6	ah, gotcha, still strange to even mention it...
3	1522798330	7	I had to show that the same people who are misguided about the shared history are often misguided on the name too.
0	1522800392	2	Best post I have seen in here in a long long time 
0	1522824434	4	That BCH argues to be closest to the whitepaper and therefore is denying  the fundamental development of segwit — although it wants to act like visa or mastercard — is completely the wrong way. Segwit will enbale 1000x more transactions than BCH will ever be able to make.
1	1522833247	3	I want to believe you, but why was the memory pool so much more full in BTC than BCH in November, December, January, Febuary? That does not demonstrate more throughput it demonstrates less. Even post this time the difference in mempool fullness is directly correlated to a reduced number of daily transactions, not an increased throughput. I'm hopeful about these improvements. I have no skin in the game, I don't fuck with either BTC or BCH, but the evidence does not show that these improvements are working.

4	1522834595	1	U cannot compare nano with btc but btc with bch. Nano is trying something completely different, such as iota does as well. It could work out but for obvious reasons nano is at least at the moment million miles away from btc — such as every other crypto. Lets see what the future brings.

1	1522830397	2	Funny how the "production" version has more bugs/issues than the experimental one. 
2	1522833344	3	Source?
3	1522835304	1	Look up the issues with the EDA and the several node crashing bugs of Bitcoin Unlimited, for example. 
2	1522860615	2	Don't you get it? The experiment has ended. The next phase has begun.
0	1522839839	0	Things this post ignores:* BCH is also getting a malleability fix, but it will be implemented via hard fork rather than softfork (unlike segwit).* BCH still has a maximum block size, higher than BTC but not specified in the whitepaper.* BCH will also get lightning network.* BCH has a different difficulty adjustment algorithm than specified in the whitepaper.* BCH is not backwards compatible with older bitcoin node software, BTC is (although BTC will likely hardfork eventually).* Lightning network and base block size are two unrelated issues.

Forcing your opinion by calling people misguided or confused isn't going to get them to change their opinion. I think it'd be better to start with the first graphic and provide some evidence why BCH is the original Bitcoin.

0	1522858852	0	I can send a segwit transaction to Satoshi's Genesis address and have Bitcoin appear because Bitcoin is Bitcoin.I can't send a btcoin cash transaction to Satoshi's Genesis address and have Bitcoin appear because it is not Bitcoin.The first graphic is right because segwit didn't break rules so old clients worked with new ones. Bitcoin cash broke rules so Bitcoin cash nodes can't work with Bitcoin ones.If you want to go by whitepaper rules the chain with the most accumulated proof of work is Bitcoin. Bitcoin cash has less proof of work than Bitcoin.The last picture makes it seem like both forks work with Bitcoin. That's false because if it worked like that people would buy Bitcoin cash and send to have Bitcoin accredited. Right now 1 Bitcoin cash is worth .09 Bitcoin. It is not 1 Bitcoin cash is worth 1 Bitcoin.The fact that this is wrong while being upvoted by this community shows that r/btc is the misguided subreddit.
0	1522858980	-1	This is not really fair in my opinion. The length of all chains should be the size of all proof of work done, so it is the same before the fork, but Bitcoin should be longer/thicker than Bitcoin (Cash) as a result of more miners. The ideology that the chain with the most proof of work being the main chain would suggest that Bitcoin (Core) is still the true chain. But yes, the style should be that of a literal silverware fork, with multiple prongs of different lengths pointed parallel to the original starting point
