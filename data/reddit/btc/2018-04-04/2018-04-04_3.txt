Exactly perfect.I would add - there seems to be a push to insert code into the protocol that would change the economic incentives of the that secure BCH.*RED ALERT*That's the same attack that crippled BTC. Trying to fix something that's not broken will equal BCH getting turned into just another shitcoin! 
1	1522822200	6	> there seems to be a push to insert code into the protocol that would change the economic incentives of the that secure BCH.Can you provide more details?
2	1522822514	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=643&v=anB4wPRkiRsThis guy and Peter Rizun are making up windmills for us to fight. Changing the code to protect against non-issues. It's becoming more clear the more I read their stuff. 
3	1522823079	2	Yeah, that does seem a bit weird (infighting between dev groups).Though by my previous question I meant can you name specific technologies you're referring to so that I can do some research? Is that this "bloxroute" thing from the video? What about Peter? "Weak blocks" or something else?(not debating anything, just genuinely curious)
4	1522824509	19	Yeah they're advocating for some code to harden BCH against a "selfish miner" attack. They wrote a paper last year and they're claiming it's gospel and preaching doom and gloom about scaling hurdles. Sounds a lot like Core.
5	1522834479	7	Voice of reason. Thank you. 
5	1522824743	4	Got it now, thanks.

4	1522839488	2	The developers bitching each other is pointless end of the day. Only miners like Jihan and Roger with enough hashrates will determine which code gets hardforked, as satoshis design.Miners will fork and keep the network alive. Rizun bitching isn't going to change anything if all miners decides to ignore him.
2	1522836595	3	This is the one that makes me nervous, but, I have no real evidence it is dangerous to BCH's future:Expected soon...OPGroup = coloured coins implementationI found this link in the discussion below:https://www.yours.org/content/on-representative-tokens--colored-coins--bb7a829b965c/
3	1522837059	3	Yes, this one seemed to be too rushed. Wasn't it decided to postpone enabling this op code though?
4	1522838614	3	Personally I don't think want it at all.  OP_RETURN and counterparty is fine. Implementing OP_GROUP might result in feature creep (i.e, well now that we have colored coins we should add xyz because ethereum or something). 
5	1522838814	2	Personally, I don't care about such features at all. I'd like to focus on the part of being "the best kind of money".On the other hand that might bring back some people from other blockchains.
6	1522840783	4	But in a way we already have colored coins - the code for XCP exists, it just needs to be activated on the BCH chain. But XCP is better than OP_GROUP in that you can do so much more in XCP.
4	1522849138	2	Ya, until Sept. Hopefully experts will vet it by then. Tonight I watched the Ver-Mow (full) video from the most recent conference. I saw Mow say something about how we should go ahead and assume we have unlimited block size and implement colored coins and stuff like that. I think he may have let it slip that they (blockstream corp.) think colored coins will add a burden to the size of the full blockchain that might break our scaling. I could be imagining the problem and seeing something that is not really there.
5	1522849795	2	>Hopefully experts will vet it by then.This type of thinking is how BTC got into trouble.The focus needs to be on adoption of BCH as peer to peer electronic cash because that's what people use today. Unless OP_GROUP supports adoption of BCH as cash, it's feature creep and should be ignored.Both Peter R. and Sergio L. have been pushing for changes we don't need in BCH and are at best distractions and at worst dangerous, especially Lerner's "trusted hardware" schemes.
6	1522851576	1	I agree ! I'd like to go with "don't fix what aint broke". However, we do have to worry about competition to some extent. I am thinking we need a few features like fungibility to be good to go.
1	1522851093	1	you get it :)(look into the reason both greg & peter/emin, etc, base their "Proposed change lncoin/weakblocks change") .. seem familiar?:light:
0	1522817509	47	Well said :)
1	1522829684	12	Can I also out forward... The onus is on us to downvote these intentional posts designed to create division.I'm not saying there shouldn't be debate ... I'm saying that some posts are intentionally designed to inflame matters... 
0	1522849154	4	Everyone dislikes frauds so of course he causes drama. I have not seen any hate like that for anyone else besides Roger. Roger is a special case and has some interesting past things that open him up for attacks etc... Craig straight up lied about being Satoshi and that is simply never going to stop haunting him.
0	1522826216	30	The only reason you see an uptick in anti-CSW posts and comments is because anytime he gets on the speaker docket of a conference we go through another round of PR manipulation, with the same (or brand new) accounts repeating the same cycle of talking points. Whether you realise it or not you just repeated a bunch of those talking points in your rant.> trolls will try to attack BCH from every angle, including the big names associated with it.Cricising CSW is not criticising BCH, but it’s really useful for his puppets to imply that anyone who is against Craig is against “us”.> If he is Satoshi and doesn't want to be known, creating doubt was a brilliant strategy that seems to be working great.If he really was Satoshi and wanted to create doubt the best thing he could do was say “I’m not Satoshi”. That’s if anyone was ever actually asking that question before all this started. There are plenty of more credible candidates who have simply said “nope, not me” and besides the occasional redditor pointing at Nick Szabo no-one cares. Craig, by contrast, turned himself into one of the most recognisable and contraversial figures in crypto. Does that sound like a cunning Satoshi plan?> If he's not Satoshi and you're upset he's getting too much attention, then why do you help him by giving him even more attention when you fuel the drama/controversy?If he’s not Satoshi, then he’s a fraud. Those are the only two options. And since he’s not Satoshi I’m going to call out any post I see promoting a fraud within an industry that has been *plagued* by scams and massive financial scandals. > People tend to give credence to Dr. Wright BECAUSE he is strongly in favor of on-chain scaling, which we believe in.This is a line I can agree with. People in this community are only willing to blind themselves to Craig’s attempted fraud because Craig constantly spouts big-block soundbites and frequently criticises the Core devs. The problem is you’re still using this line to back up your fallacy that Craig’s critics are anti-BCH. What the line really means is that Craig new exactly what to say to ingratiate himself with a certain subset of the Bitcoin community. After his Satoshi claims had been repeatedly debunked he had almost no chance of ever being taken seriously in crypto. But he exploited the rift caused by the scaling debate, told people here *exactly* what they wanted to hear (because he was recycling points that had been made 100 times before), and managed to cause just enough cognitive dissonance to get people to start thinking “it doesn’t matter if he’s Satoshi or not, let’s listen to what this gigantic fraud has to say”.
1	1522834220	0	Well said.  
1	1522828982	-1	> Craig, by contrast, turned himself into one of the most recognisable and contraversial figures in crypto.Yes, you the haters make him more and more popular. 
2	1522841282	5	And the paid CSW shills posting threads about him here every hour of the day, all day, every day since months and months and months aren't trying to make him more popular? Get fucking real.
3	1522854405	2	Wouldn't it be much more likely that [Bilderberg/AXA/ and the CIA](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d02ee/some_thoughts_about_the_possible_bitcoin_segwit/) are hiring the paid shills for anti-csw trolling?? This tophernator guy is a prime example, constantly trolling BCH and CSW, pretends to be a big blocker, yet he loves Lightning and defends it to the death.  Please watch out for the concern troll fake accounts.  Its all about creating "controlled opposition". Right out of the Saul Alinksy playbook.
4	1522854712	1	> Wouldn't it be much more likely that Bilderberg/AXA/ and the CIA are hiring the paid shills for anti-csw trollingDon't you worry about both who is paying for the pro-CSW trolling or what happens when a cult of personality around CSW is solidly established and you step out of the party line of CSW worship?
5	1522854866	1	Sure I worry about people worshiping him as a King, which is maybe good why he won't prove publicly like the trolls are begging for. [There is no fucking king](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1_gxvx_QGo&feature=youtu.be&t=57m32s) as he says.
3	1522855483	1	Yes, both his fans and his haters who post all day about him make him more popular. 
4	1522858357	1	Surely you realize that it wouldn't be good if nobody who dislikes him never said anything while his propaganda machine astroturfs the social media singing his praise right?
5	1522859794	1	Most of those who dislike him have no arguments. They don't argue against his opinions. They just call 'fraud, fraud, fraud' like the North Coreans who just call 'bcash!, bcash!, bcash!' and 'Roger!, Roger!, Roger!'.
6	1522860368	1	You don't seem to understand that fraud is the appropriate label for somebody who's attempted to impersonate Satoshi by means of lies, deception and manipulation. It's sad that you only seem to pick up on the word, and not the reason. It's also sad that unlike real-person impersonations there is no legal steps that Satoshi can take to defend himself from it (though he could post a signed message saying that CSW isn't Satoshi).If you commit an offense of such proportions such as CSW did, you will have to live with the stigma that's following you around, forever. That's the only way it can be.CSW has two choices. If he had the ability to sign a message proving he is Satoshi (which he can't do) he can do that. Or he can publicly admit he made it all up, which would not silence the stigma, but maybe at least limit its volume somewhat. He does neither, so he has to live with the full consequence of his actions.

8	1522861052	1	Satoshi himself wrote the code that lets you sign a message using a private key belonging to an address so anybody can prove to be in control of an address. This feature is found in nearly every Bitcoin client in existence. There is only one valid proof, and that is signing such a message from an address known to belong to Satoshi.What you just pasted there is nothing but heresay at best, or is fabricated whole cloth. It's no proof of any kind. Satoshi specifically wrote code exactly so this kind of nonsense is not required. Anybody can create a website saying whatever. Only Satoshi can sign a message.
1	1522849837	0	Thank you.
1	1522856071	0	Projecting hard troll.
0	1522821738	19	> Also, giving away tons of money to various BCH endeavors doesn't seem like fraud either.This.  A good portion of the people criticizing him I would wager haven't done nearly as much as Craig has done to help out BCH in terms of support.  CSW puts his money where his mouth is.  He's not a parasite on the community at all.  Far from it.I wonder how many of the people that are so critical of him have done as much?Not that it gives CSW carte blanche to be toxic in the future -- just so far he's proven to be overall "one of the good guys" in my mind.Is he perfect? No.  Am I perfect? No.  Noone really is.  All you can hope for from people is that overall they do more good than harm around them.  I categorize CSW as in general a person that does more good than harm -- at least as far as this community is concerned.
1	1522841324	3	> This. A good portion of the people criticizing him I would wager haven't done nearly as much as Craig has done to help out BCH in terms of support. CSW puts his money where his mouth isCitation needed.
0	1522821159	30	> I think its unfair to accuse him of "fraud" because claiming to be Satoshi (and then not proving) isn't fraudFalsely claiming to be Satoshi is fraud, especially when CSW went back and **altered an old 2008 blog post**, to make it seem like he was working on cryptocurrency in 2008, to bolster his fraudulent Satoshi claim in 2016.- https://i.imgur.com/hAbPhW3.png- https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89bui6/buterin_about_csw_why_is_this_fraud_allowed_to/dwr1fwv/If Bitcoin Cash is ever to be the #1 mainstream cryptocurrency, it can't do it with a toxic brand like CSW running around on stage as its public face.I'm autistic, so I'm not going to let this go. 
1	1522822320	13	> If Bitcoin Cash is ever to be the #1 mainstream cryptocurrency, it can't do it with **CSW running around on stage as its public face**.Great, that's resolved then because CSW is far from BCH "public face".One time it's Roger who is "public face", then it's Rick Falkvinge, another time it's Amaury or Peter Rizun, now CSW ... pick one! We can't have a dozen people as a single "public face", can we?
2	1522822458	13	I'm fine with Roger & Rick and everyone else serving as the public face for BCH.Just not CSW.If he really cares about BCH, then he should do his work from a lab, not from a stage.
3	1522826534	8	> If he really cares about BCH, then he should do his work from a lab, not from a stage.So anyone wanting to step on to a stage should seek a prior permission from you? Look, get used to it, not all the people speaking at public events are going to be liked by everybody, that's normal for a non cult-like community. If you'd like *everybody*, that's a sign of something wrong, not the other way around.
4	1522827329	4	> So anyone wanting to step on to a stage should seek a prior permission from you?No, this is free speech on all sides.  I present my arguments, others present their arguments, and everyone else can decide whether to promote CSW as a public face of BCH or not.And with enough public pressure, and with the free market deciding not to book him as a speaker, hopefully CSW will realize his best path forward is to step off the stage, and into a lab.
5	1522831952	1	> hopefully CSW will realize his best path forward is to step off the stage, and into a lab.It's the best path forward for BCH, not for Craig.Him stepping into a lab would reveal him for the fraud that he is. His entire shtick is over promising and swiping it under the rug that he never delivered. 
2	1522863254	1	It's easy!CSW is Satoshi (along with all of us)Roger is Bitcoin JesusRick is Bitcoin CEO (& so am I) Amaury is Bitcoin ABC Lead DevPeter Rizun is BU Chief Scientistand Samson Mow is a travelling hat salesman ;)
1	1522835668	4	Claiming to be Satoshi wasn't the only fraud he's been accused of either. He's still wanted for questioning by the police in Australia for [defrauding the Australian Government of millions of dollars](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/atos-fraud-squad-probes-bitcoin-creator-craig-wright/news-story/9bfe1841079da0cb1e4481061ad77677). He literally skipped the country to evade them.He has a chequered history of near bankruptcy, legal disputes with business partners, contempt of court charges, restraining orders by other business partners, and suing yet other business partners for $84 million then withdrawing the claim.He successfully [scammed the Australian government for $54 million by defrauding them for a massive R&D grant](https://www.bitsonline.com/wright-supercomputing-liquidated/) to develop a supercomputer that never even existed.I'm surprised that his long history of scams and fraud gets mentioned so infrequently.> Mr Wright’s former wife, Lynne Wright, has made it clear she doesn’t want anything to do with her ex-husband, describing the Nakamoto claims as “rubbish”.
2	1522847386	3	And given that he scanned the Australian government it off so much money, it's not hard to imagine that his crypto wealth actually covers from his scams (converted into Bitcoin) rather than from being Satoshi and having mined it (Satoshi's known coins still haven't moved).
2	1522852156	-1	Not True. His ex-wife said she heard CSW talk about digital money
1	1522858113	1	Mostly agreed but allow me to make an autistic correction:1) There is no proof that CSW is or isn't Satoshi. Given how hard it is to prove a negative, I believe this state of affairs will persist forever.2) There *is* proof that CSW has faked and manipulated documents (like his blog post, and the signing). Already this raises red flags and anyone dealing with him should distrust him. Meticulously document everything and refuse to sign any coercive contracts like NDA. This also remains true forever even if he does later produce proof of Satoshi.3) Calling CSW a fraud is technically not justified at this point. Proving fraud requires actual testable material facts that were lied about, which caused damages, and were intended to cause those damages, *and* that are provably wrong. Fraud would be if someone like nTrust comes out and reveals something like "We came to believe CSW is Satoshi because he showed us the faked blog post and we lost money for it." It is not fraud just to say "I am Satoshi" because you can't disprove that statement.
2	1522866201	1	> Proving fraud requires actual testable material facts that were lied about, which caused damagesI think you're confusing legal fraud and regular fraud.  Regular fraud doesn't require damages.  It doesn't require intent to cause damages.  It requires "deception".  That's about it. ([m-w](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fraud) [oxford](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fraud))> It is not fraud just to say "I am Satoshi" That's not all what happened.  He provided proof that he was Satoshi.  False proof.  With deception.
0	1522817467	19	Hear, hear!
0	1522817441	20	Amen
0	1522825296	23	Your company/product Electron Cash received millions of funds from Craigs company nChain. You are NOT unbiased.https://news.bitcoin.com/coingeek-announces-funding-the-electron-cash-development-team/
1	1522829115	12	Yes, Craig organizes the funding of so many great Bitcoin Cash projects. Shame on him!
2	1522845041	3	Am I the only one who remembers that Alex Green (aka Moolah) also funded lots of great initiatives (clean water in Africa, racecar advertising, payment gateway startup)? You know, the guy who we eventually found out bought out an exchange to exit-scam, and mentally abused people working for him?
1	1522834556	7	Electron Cash is a good product, I use it myself.If CSW has helped then that is also good.
1	1522835231	3	He may be biased, but, if you read the OP's post you would know he is not saying CSW deserves extra respect or appreciation. In other words, any possible bias does not seem to have affected his comments. So, your comment seems like the exact kind of rubbish he was complaining about. I guess if your point is that rubbish posting and dishonesty should not be attacked like this, I just missed your point, sorry.
1	1522825809	7	His content is still valid 
1	1522834620	5	I have received $0 funding from nChain. I agree with everything said here. So?
1	1522835146	3	Is there anything specific you disagree with or what is the point you are trying to make?
1	1522834092	5	When Vitalik shouted "Why is this fraud allowed to speak on this conference" the answer was "money". It's always money. nChain is just the blockstream on the other side ... 
2	1522835723	6	You may be correct about financial motivations all around, however, there seems to be a big difference. Blockstream is killing a cryptocurrencies' ability to be used freely by the people of the world. NChain seems to be supporting a cryptocurrencies' ability to be used by the people of the world.
3	1522837218	1	That is what you are being led to believe.. but is that the truth? 
4	1522848728	1	Well, I don't trust NChain, but, I know Blockstream and the core developers have nearly destroyed Bitcoin-BTC. They gave away the most valuable thing it had (first mover advantage). Will they try to save BTC as a person to person currency with a hard fork and bigger blocks? It looks unlikely at this point. Will they find a 2nd layer solution not controlled by gatekeepers and KYC requirements? I don't see anything on the horizon. If you have been around a while, you have to bury your head in the sand (a censored forum) to not see what's happened to Bitcoin.
3	1522836209	0	By filing for patents for every possible innovation their "chief scientist" can come up with? By not having written a single open source code line? By not having revealed any of their ideas or protocols to the public so they can be scrutinized and/or improved upon by the community? (Although we haven't still seen anything produced from nChain other than big words and "soon" twitter posts)
3	1522835971	-1	Perception is everything and support is different from contribution. nChain is sponsoring or investing in a lot of project.  For what purpose? Who knows. 
1	1522831915	-1	What about the money you receive?
0	1522845402	3	> The trolls would like to have everyone believe that we only give credence to on chain scaling because we "believe in our leaders".On that note, I think it would be good to more often, instead of saying "We believe in on chain scaling because that was Satoshi's original vision," say "We believe in on chain scaling.  That was Satoshi's original vision, and we have investigated it for ourselves and concluded that it is the best solution."
0	1522851242	3	> First of all, Bitcoin (BCH) is trustless, permissionless, and agnostic. It's not about people and personalities. At least it shouldn't be.People and personalities do matter, as evidenced by the last three years.A personality with a platform can successfully attack Bitcoin. So this becomes very simple.CSW claimed to be Satoshi. He said he was going to publish proof. Not only did he not produce proof, but in its place he spouted streams of misinformation and obfuscation. Instead of mathematical proof of his grandiose claims, he gave us NDAs, backstage bamboozlement, and promises of the great things he's going to do in the future.Now CSW is trying hard to position himself as a Thought Leader on Bitcoin Cash. Imagine if this guy's mug becomes the most recognizable face in Bitcoin Cash. Not only does he not understand Bitcoin at a technical level, but he's repeatedly demonstrated his intention to mislead people.There's nothing wrong with speaking frankly about this con man. If he doesn't go away, there's nothing wrong with repeating the truth.
0	1522832176	11	I agree, I give credence to Dr. Wright because he is strongly in favor of on-chain scaling, and was outspoken against SegWit.
1	1522834672	12	That’s fair, but that shouldn’t give him any further credence than the guy above or below you in the comments.  The fact that he bothered claiming to be Satoshi (odd, but ok), and went so far as to try to prove it and failed (odd, but not ok) should lessen his credence below other commentators in this thread.  And the fact that he was called out by vitalik on three seemingling pretty important topics should at least call some of his credibility into question.  Are we really following anyone one who agrees with us on a couple topics? Does the fact that they agree with you on topics A and B really mean you should agree with them on topics C and D any more then you would have without their assertion that they agree with A and B?  Are you sure they really agree with A and B and aren’t just saying that so you’re easier to pull into line with them on C and D?
1	1522843363	3	And the fact that he spouts put a bunch of technobabble nonsense that actual crypto devs agree is fake BS?
0	1522822223	13	> claiming to be Satoshi (and then not proving) isn't fraudBut forging the proof is.
0	1522829726	17	There are some very legitimate concerns about CSW, these concerns are being expressed from within the BCH camp and outside. CSW is a high risk factor for BCH and the sooner he is ostracised from the project the better it is for BCH and cryptocurrency in general.  He once said he doesn't want money, he doesn't want fame, he wants to be left alone and yet the opposite is true.  He flaunts his wealth on twitter like a boastful child posting pictures of his supercars, smoking cigars and drinking wine.  Meanwhile posting insightful quotes and slogans, telling the BCH camp exactly what they want to hear about worldwide adoption and saving the world.  Reality check: His prime objective is to drive adoption so his and Calvin Ayres (coingeek) mining operations make millions.  
1	1522833103	6	> Reality check: His prime objective is to drive adoption so his and Calvin Ayres mining operations make millions upon millions Good. That's my objective too.
2	1522834652	-3	Is deceit your objective also? 
1	1522833375	3	>CSW is a high risk factor for BCH and the sooner he is ostracised from the project the better it is for BCH and cryptocurrency in general. Bitcoin is for everyone, not just the people we like. So go fuck yourself
2	1522833930	2	Thank you for your well though out and insightful reply :)
1	1522835374	2	can you characterize the risk?
2	1522838060	4	Craigs downfall is in the making and when it comes it will have a deep effect on the credibility of BCH and it's scaling project.  Better he gets ousted before that happens. 
3	1522838216	1	BCH credibility comes from the working code not from people
4	1522838774	4	Code, Network, Mining and the character and actions of the main promoters are all integral to the credibility of BCH. 
5	1522840111	3	The main promoters are not attacking him so they clearly see him having a positive benefit or at least not negative.
6	1522845711	2	Of course Calvin wouldn't, he and CSW have been buddies long before BCH and are aligned in this endeavour.  Peter Rizun, the Chief Scientist of Bitcoin Unlimited also views CSW as a phoney and a threat to the project
0	1522821645	21	Or maybe he and everyone else could just admit CSW did, in fact, lie, and inviting him to conferences, and upvoting crap about him - even deflecting bullshit posts like this - hurts BCH and this subreddit.Every time BCH doesn't cut off the bullshit and ignore the frauds, it becomes harder and harder for people to take BCH seriously.CSW is a dead weight around BCH's neck.  If he can't correct the lies and stop the nonsense, BCH suffers by not cutting him loose.
1	1522834316	8	Absolutely this.  
1	1522841509	5	I agree with you completely here. I do have a sincere question for you, though: **what about Roger Ver?**[Roger Ver has verifiably lied on countless occasions, too.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87t3ot/comment/dwh4n51) Do you think that "inviting him to conferences, upvoting crap about him, deflecting", etc is causing BCH (and this community) to suffer in a similar way? If not, isn't that inconsistent?
2	1522851985	1	I think you're a low effort troll and you're full of shit basically every time you open your mouth.I haven't found any convincing proof of any lies that Roger told that are both 1) relevant to issues at hand, 2) objective facts, 3) on an issue that matters, 4) not attributable to human mistakes, and 5) provable beyond reasonable doubt.  I've written elsewhere that I'm not a huge fan and don't personally trust him, but he's simply not comparable to CSW and I find him to be more honest than about 75% of Core and 90% of /r/Bitcoin censoring assholes such as yourself.If you think anyone with half a brain is going to actually dig through that steaming pile of garbage you linked, you're a moron.  If you want to convince people of something, link to something directly relevant, instead of linking to that bulbous unreadable blob.I know you think you're on the side of right and that the facts support the Core bullshit that you've forced down everyone's throats for three years, but the reality is you're just a bunch of asshats that have ruined the beautiful thing Satoshi created for all of us and created an opening for Bitcoin to become obsoleted by non-horseshit uncensored competing crypto's.
3	1522856561	6	>I think you're a low effort troll and you're full of shit basically every time you open your mouth.That's nice and all, but not what I was asking about. In any case, I'm not trying to promote BCH, so my own reputation isn't going to do it any harm through association, as you are arguing CSW's does.>I haven't found any convincing proof of any lies that Roger told that are both 1) relevant to issues at hand, 2) objective facts, 3) on an issue that matters, 4) not attributable to human mistakes, and 5) provable beyond reasonable doubt.There are about 20 that I just provided proof of, so if you take the time to read through what I just linked you to, you'll find plenty of examples. It's unclear what you mean by "the issues at hand" and "an issue that matters", because the subject right now is simply "people with provable histories of lying (and whether or not them being liars is doing harm to BCH)"... you originally made a very compelling case about Wright in this context, and I asked you whether you felt the same about Roger Ver's influence (who has been caught lying just as many times as Wright has, as you can see from my links).You'll notice (if you do take the time to look it over) that many of the lies I provided proof to include explanations for why they cannot be mere "mistakes" and are, in fact, accompanied by proof beyond any reasonable doubt. Each of your 5 listed criteria are met here, many times over.>I've written elsewhere that I'm not a huge fan and don't personally trust himWell, that's good to know. I suppose that at least partially answers my question. I suppose it is fair to say that you *don't* believe he is harming BCH through reputational association, though.> but he's simply not comparable to CSWI'm not sure I follow you on this one. They seem comparable (in more ways than one) to me.We have a few more examples of direct lies that Ver has told, and the nature of the lies (most of the time) are different, but both of these men are relatively famous in this space, both aggressively promote BCH on a regular basis and are associated with it at this point, and both of them are proven liars, so they seem quite comparable in the respects that are relevant to this particular discussion.>I find him to be more honest than... assholes such as yourself.Perhaps that is a result of you refusing to read the documented lies that he has told. You seem to dislike me (likely as a result of the fact that I have thoroughly and methodically explained errors in your reasoning on multiple separate occasions at this point) so much that you are willing to accuse me of dishonesty and lying *even without having any examples of me doing so*, while outright refusing to acknowledge a long list of examples of Ver doing so. This is logically inconsistent in obvious ways, and highly irrational.>If you think anyone with half a brain is going to actually dig through that steaming pile of garbage you linked, you're a moron.I can't force you to read facts that you don't want to read, but they're there if you're interested in learning the truth. There are links there to give you direct access to everything you need to know to verify what is being explained; the proof is bundled in.>If you want to convince people of something, link to something directly relevant,I just did. Again, the conversation here is about CSW being a liar, and the potential harm this is doing to BCH by association; I asked you whether you think that Roger Ver being a liar might have a similar effect, and gave you access to a long list of instances of Roger Ver lying (replete with accompanying proofs). Again, I can't force you to read it, but it's there, just in case you want to dig into the matter.>I know you think you're on the side of rightWell, in this case, the proof of correctness is included in the links provided. I'm not talking about Satoshi, Core, or even Bitcoin here; those aren't particularly relevant to this specific discussion. I was just asking you what your opinion on Roger Ver being a proven liar was (and whether you thought that his history of dishonesty is harming BCH like you argued that Wright's was).Thanks, in any case.

With one solid example, we can then discuss.
5	1522864669	1	One really nice go-to example (because there is no way to construe it as anything *but* a lie) is [when he said "I've dumped a few hundred BTC for BCC" and then two weeks later said "I haven't cashed a single Bitcoin, or altcoin, or cash, or anything for Bitcoin Cash up until yesterday, and I sold like about a dozen Bitcoins for Bitcoin Cash."](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fmvix/when_you_invite_someone_to_do_a_video_interview/dqdc44h/)The nice thing about this example is that in the direct self-contradiction, you don't really need *any* information on what Ver actually did at the time (in other words, whatever he bought or sold is irrelevant; no matter what happened, *one* of his statements had to be false). Note that *even* the "futures" gimmick represents [Ver lying](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fmvix/when_you_invite_someone_to_do_a_video_interview/dqdh3ff/), so there's really no way to wriggle out of this one: Ver lied, and then rather than honorably admitting his lie later on when he was called out and apologizing for it, he doubled down and lied again.____________________I'd also like to point out that even in cases where [Roger tells a string of lies](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61r678/rogers_latest_lie_is_out_on_twitter_acuses_aaron/dfhe7r3/) while accusing others (who are telling the truth) of "twisting the truth", he'll refuse to apologize after it is revealed that he was the one spreading false information, instead saying: "[At the time I thought it was accurate, along with the hundreds of other people who up voted it to the very top of /r/BTC.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/61qxu4/excellent_job_twisting_the_truth_by_core/dfgp8ha/)" as if that somehow absolves him of blame for misrepresenting things so dishonestly. These are the moments that really show his true character... and when you add in the moments like where he said "[I made Andreas a millionaire.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7kf43b/bitcoincom_wallet_2_out_of_5_stars_531_ratings_we/drei7jx/)" it just puts the cherry on top.I know, you've already said that you don't personally trust Ver (and you specifically asked for "one solid example"), so even this minimalized comment might be a bit overkill, and for that I apologize. If you insist on focusing on *one* example I have to go with the top one (the one where he "dumped a few hundred BTC for BCC" and then suddenly hadn't sold "anything for Bitcoin Cash" a couple weeks later), just because it's so "in-your-face" obvious, but the others deserve honorable mention, at the very least.
1	1522828395	2	> Or maybe he and everyone else could just admit CSW did, in fact, lieEveryone does, in fact, lie. Life is an incentive system and there are many occasions where a lie is better than telling the truths to malice persons or organisations. > upvoting crap about him - even deflecting bullshit posts like this - hurts BCH and this subreddit.Yes, 'everyone else' should listen to your advice. The voters should not vote, they should just listen to you and your soulmates. Then life would be perfect.

Communities that reward those type of people are bound to fail.
0	1522844960	5	I'm not a "fan" of CSW as I used to be. He is becoming increasingly rude to other people in BCH and outside. He makes more and more promises and less results. He keeps publishing pseudoscientific papers which are not supported by anyone. I trust Vitalik much more than I trust him on technical matters. I also believe Falkvinge might be correct on toxic people.I think the community should not give much attention to him until he delivers something and we should seek funding for various BCH projects outside of CSV/Calvin's pool of money/influence.I think I'll unfollow him onTwitter, he is becoming annoying even if he is Satoshi.
0	1522822429	14	Craig Wright literally thinks he embodies the Bitcoin Cash movement, HE is trying to take credit for the movement, trying to lead. He does the OPPOSITE of what you are saying. And all the sheep who follow him make the entire movement look bad. I have been downvoted and berated for even daring to go against the groupthink that CsW == Satoshi. Its not funny. So you can say this now, because people like Vitalik spoke out. So yeah, it is important to nip CsW in the bud. 
1	1522828789	4	> HE is trying to take credit for the movement, trying to leadYou are also trying to be an opinion leader. But you and many haters are lacking the charisma that Craig has. That's where the hate comes from. 
1	1522830051	2	One of the first things he said when he came back into the limelight was that there will be no ‘King’. Edit: sorry I was being vague. I was referring to this video. I remember him being gone from the public eye mostly and then he showed up at this conference in the middle of last year.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1_gxvx_QGo 49:29Embodying the Bitcoin Cash movement may be different than pretending to be the king, but that comment just made me think of this video... I think he's said it a few other times, too. He's also said on several occasions that he wants leaders in the Bitcoin Cash space, not followers, and he would like to support others in their work to make Bitcoin Cash better.
2	1522836282	3	I think that's his way of saying he is as much the king of BCH as anyone.
2	1522830982	3	‘Came back into the limelight’What the fuck?
1	1522855977	-1	> important to nip CsW in the bud.No. This is not appropriate. You have no proof. You are a pathetic whining jealous crybaby.
0	1522826122	4	The debate of last night. (no CSW but both roger and csw have the same views) https://youtu.be/zSbPz4g9rZQ
0	1522822985	7	If you're sick of hearing about CSW then this post is exactly not the thing you should be posting.
0	1522830633	7	You seem to misunderstand the meaning of the word ’fraud’. If I claimed to be the Pope, but couldn’t present evidence, you could very correctly call me a fraud. If I claimed to be the inventor of the automobile, but my explanations about internal combustion were generally incorrect, you could very correctly call me a fraud. CSW is a fraud, a charlatan, an ersatz expert, in every sense of the word. He appeared from nowhere and has wrangled his way onto the world stage with nothing, absolutely nothing, to justify his public position. Stop hiding behind algorithmic trustlessness as if that translates immediately into humans. 
0	1522836905	4	Your post is quite deceptive. You try to appear unbiased but then you go on and say>We're going to scale Bitcoin (BCH) on chain to be a global peer to peer electronic cash system. If you think you're going to stop us by discrediting any one individual (whether they deserve it or not), well, you won't.Known fraudsters and impostors should be called out for what they are and marginalized by the community.   How exactly are "we" trying to stop "you" by calliing out CSW for what he is: A fraudster and impostor? Are you affiliated with him? A commenter in this thread posted that you have received funding from CSW's company. Why wouldn't you disclose this fact in your post?  Additionally the problem with CSW is not just that he is a fraudster. He is also a toxic personality, attacking other members of the community for what appear to be his personal megalomaniac agenda of "supremacy". Personalities like him should be marginalized by the community because they usually drive away the honest people.
0	1522841070	5	> First of all, Bitcoin (BCH) is trustless, permissionless, and agnostic. It's not about people and personalities. At least it shouldn't be.Tell that to CSW who makes every attempt to make it a cult of personality.> I'm pretty sure there's a concerted effort to troll around this particular point, because well... trolls will try to attack BCH from every angle, including the big names associated with it.And the endless every day for months and months and months plastering and cultivating the CSW cult on this subs reddit is no manipulation of some sort is it?> I'd like to point out that at the end of the day, all such ad hominem attacks are still ad hominem attacks, and therefore weak.Pointing out that somebody lied and manipulated to appear to be Satoshi isn't an ad hominem attack. It's facts. Citing facts now "ad hominem attacks" are they?> But they are especially weak for those trying to prove Craig wasn't part of Satoshi as if that even matters.You got that backwards. It's on CSW to prove he was. There is no proving he wasn't, but there is near certainty he wasn't because he tried to lie and deceive his way into beeing seen as satoshi without the ability to prove it. The burden of proof is squarely on CSW.> Regardless of whether he's SatoshiIsn't.> I think its unfair to accuse him of "fraud" because claiming to be Satoshi (and then not proving) isn't fraud.Using lies and manipulation to try to impersonate somebody he isn't isn't legally fraud. It's just factually fraud. The legal fraud part would be when he commits other crimes in the act of impersonation (such as forgery, wire fraud, etc.), which is usually difficult to avoid with real non anonymous entities (but fair game for an anonymous persona who can't sue).> Also, giving away tons of money to various BCH endeavors doesn't seem like fraud either.Citation needed.> And if he is SatoshiIsn't. Burden of proof is on him.> SATOSHI was on record calling for on chain scaling and an electronic cash systemAnd that's where most everybody has their idea that this is what should be done from, not from CSW.> The trolls would like to have everyone believe that we only give credence to on chain scaling because we "believe in our leaders".I bet they do, that doesn't mean you can't take a hard stance on CSW.> We're going to scale Bitcoin (BCH) on chain to be a global peer to peer electronic cash systemI don't believe you're talking about the same "we" that CSW included himself into when he said that. Cause he's done jack squat other than hoarding software patents without offering them under an open source compatible and harm limiting and non discriminatory fashion. Far as I know he can't even code, and neither he nor his company have ever contributed a single line of code to anything.> If you think you're going to stop us by discrediting any one individual (whether they deserve it or not), well, you won't.I have no desire to stop you from scaling. I support on-chain scaling. I don't support CSW in any way shape or form. Supporting on-chain scaling and criticizing CSW are not exclusive. And it's not discrediting, that's what CSW did to himself. It's reminding everybody of the facts.

2	1522830856	6	No my little friend, he actively defrauded people when he went through the whole ‘private signing’ show. If that doesn’t speak volumes to his character, then I don’t know what does. Would you ever claim to be the inventor of something, and go through an entire public ceremony to knowingly fake it to experts for personal gain?
3	1522862811	1	If you were Satoshi, you'd broadcast that to the whole world?? Think McFly!He proved it to Gavin, because Gavin grokked bitcoin & put the work in back in the day to help get the thing off the ground. Craig is blatantly the type that does not suffer fools gladly, his ire and disdain knows no bound for those that proffer their idiotic misunderstandings of bitcoin. Quite a different person to those who earn his respect.Gavin earned his respect and in return I suspect CSW felt Gavin deserved to know. He proved it to Gavin's satisfaction. Gavin was convinced. For me that's a strong indication. The content CSW has put out since then only serve to strengthen the notion.The public don't deserve to know anything, why should they it would just create a media circus which would make the person more important than the thing, so he decided to put that to bed once and for all by botching the public proof to give him the perfect alibi. Plausible deniability, the peanut gallery have there 15 minutes of "faketoshi" then move onto the next melodrama. Leaving development of the Bitcoin Cash network to continue unabated.
1	1522861886	1	Consider that CSW not having proven that he is satoshi (which is in fact impossible to do), is not the same thing as it having been proven that he is not (also impossible).Right now, only CSW knows for sure. You don't, I don't. Most importantly it doesn't matter to anyone that is interested in the technology, as opposed to the celebrity drama.Which matters to you?
0	1522856932	2	>because claiming to be Satoshi (and then not proving) isn't fraudHmmmm, interesting.  This quote will not age well.If this is the type of logic that is collectively celebrated, its quite telling why Bitcoin Cash has not progressed at all since inception.

Just to clarify I do not think Ethereum is a shitcoin, but I do think that outbursts like this from the founder of a cryptocurrency developed by a centralized development team doesn't help the community keep their faith. Maybe some immature kids may think it's "cool" that he has balls to do that, but it just makes me take a moment to rethink things, especially since Ethereum has already crossed the DAO hardfork line. I think to myself "wait a sec, so this #2 cryptocurrency that so many people are relying their future on is run by a person who behaves in this immature way?".

0	1522832698	0	It's hard to imagine what fraud he's trying to pull of. I mean he is employed as the cheif scientist at nchain. How can a charlatan be a cheif scientist for a company unless the whole company and all the employees are also involved....And if so why are they currently advertising for a programmer job position?
1	1522834199	2	Not sure where you’re going with that, a position within a company is pretty meaningless, and charlatans are practically defined by being able to maintain positions they aren’t actually qualified for.  And if the particular brand of charlatanism is good at pulling in money, advertising for employees isn’t odd.This has nothing to to do with saying he, or anyone else, ‘is’ a charlatan in any way, just that your particular argument against it doesn’t have anything going for it.
2	1522835725	1	I'm sorry but that's Bs a position in a company is not meaningless.
3	1522839506	1	One man's meaningless is another man's meaningful.
3	1522850892	1	Depends on the company and how you got the job and if the job is really doing anything useful. In this space, a company can be one person or a few.Someone might have helped start the company or might even own it. The job title/ position may be meaningless and provided in return for investing in the company and/or the whole company could be all smoke and mirrors. I don't know, but, assuming any job-title has actual meaning is flawed thinking. Assuming it might be true is OK, just don't be so sure. Especially when dealing with someone many claim is a flim-flam man.
4	1522852837	1	We run a company and anyone who runs a legitimate company does not have meaningless job positions. As you say it can be so but only when the whole company is a fraud or engaged in it. Therefore Nchain will probably be the best place to look to prove CSW is a fraud if he in fact is.
5	1522854075	1	Having a job title with no duties would not make him a fraud unless they pretended he had duties to trick someone into something related to those duties. If the job title was not a real job, it might not even be a big secret and it might be easy to find out. Does N-Chain even accomplish any scientist work? I have no idea. He could be a fraud or legit and his position at the company might not tell us anything other than that he likes grandiose job titles.

Yet the reply is either a deafening silence (from the more knowledgeable members) or a "*But the White Paper says so!!!*"  from the others. If you can challenge the WP, so can I. And if we can't have a conversation where every single point of the WP is being challenged - Note: Not necessarily rejected, just challenged - Then no rational discussion can be had. And I'm personally not interested in religious wars, where we each offer different interpretations of The Prophet's word and then go to war for it.&nbsp;Can you see my reply to your second question? Got a notification it got removed because I used a short URL for one of the links, but I can still see it...

0	1522827300	1	> We're going to scale Bitcoin (BCH) on chain to be a global peer to peer electronic cash system.Yes! This is what I signed up for. Bitcoin Cash provides the global economy a sound basis for commerce.
0	1522846100	1	Is CSW *really* a Bitcoin Cash supporter, or was he forced to side with the Bitcoin Cash camp to corroborate his story about claiming to be Satoshi, as it is the only remotely believable side to take: The real Satoshi would never support current-day Bitcoin Core. 
1	1522850182	1	Or does he just like to be the center of attention and sees BCH will be the best moon rocket for that goal? He says great stuff we all want to hear, though, I'm not sure about his technical accuracy or his long-term motives. He does seem to be supporting BCH well every day so far...
0	1522821178	2	> First of all, Bitcoin (BCH) is trustless, permissionless, and agnostic. It's not about people and personalitiesWhere's the github if Bitcoin Cash?
1	1522821904	9	Sure, from which client? We have:- BitcoinABC- Bitcoin Unlimited- Bitcoin XT- Parity
0	1522820796	1	If he is satoshi he could prove it. Obviously he wants everyone to think he is since he started running around saying it and trying to get patents. So if he didn't prove it he's obviously a bullshit liar. There is no speculating "if hes satoshi" amongst any rational humans. Roger Ver wreaks of scammy as well. Still can't get over that Mt Gox thing where hes reading off a cue card like a POW.  
0	1522827762	1	the thing is if I know a fake person trying to chill for something I would think twice before I get involved into it. 
0	1522853599	1	> The trolls would like to have everyone believe that we only give credence to on chain scaling because we "believe in our leaders".They want to believe we just blindly follow someone because he is Satoshi.  Most of us [don't want a fucking king of Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1_gxvx_QGo&feature=youtu.be&t=57m32s).  Most of us were advocating and predicted BCH before csw even publicly supported it.  For example [here I am on record predicting and advocating BCH before it existed](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68jja0/dont_forget_money_and_bitcoin_are_just_a_ledger/dgyysp0/).  For me I like Craig's ideas, he has helped me better understand how Bitcoin works.  He has vast knowledge of not only Bitcoin, but of history, politics, religion, economics, many things, which I find fascinating as well.  He seems to really understand things better than most people, and I could relate to him on that.  This was the only reason I liked the guy, not because he had been rumored to be Satoshi.
0	1522833390	2	Despite what anyone says, Mr Wright is a very smart guy and great speaker. A successful entrepreneur who shares the same values as many in our community. I don't give a shit about if he is or isn't Satoshi, because Satoshi isn't relevant anymore. He's a spirit from the past, a legend if you will.Let Mr Wright deliver his promises. If he doesn't, nothing changes for the worse. Regardless of this, his company nChain received over 300 million USD in venture capital and is working to improve Bitcoin Cash. What's not to like about it?
0	1522823156	0	Please excuse my ignorance, but is CSW the chap making those ‘why is 10c of Bitcoin not 10c of Bitcoin anymore’ comments before Vitalik’s criticism at Deconomy? Regardless of who it was, those comments seemed inane to me, what have I missed?In any case, good rant sir!

0	1522847753	0	Craig has a cool personality. If I was a famous person I would be much like him. Also, his confidence has helped me a lot restoring my faith in big blocks, on-chain scaling and instant payment finality. Without his insights I would also believe the fallacy that the Bitcoin network is a mesh. I've even grown to think that the reason why small-blockers don't believe in on-chain scaling is the same as why people are bad at grasping really large numbers.
0	1522821526	-3	Word.
0	1522823145	-3	Yep right on.Now we're just waiting for that muppet /u/contrarian__ bot to appear and say the opposite.
0	1522830248	-1	How can BCH be trustless when it has only 5-10 % of the same Proof of Work as BTC? You know there is a reason all the altcoins took another consensus than Bitcoin?

0	1522836171	-1	Good clarification, I'd tip you if I wasnt dirt poor right now.
0	1522841302	-1	 Exactly.  I appreciate having CSW helping to build BCH, regardless of all the haters.
0	1522847552	-1	Completely agree. I'm happy how [we can arrive at the same conclusions in our own way](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89oqi8/the_reason_we_are_in_this_side_of_the_fork_how/).
