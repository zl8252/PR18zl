0	1522836369	61	When did you first realize MtGox might not be solvent?
1	1522837093	37	This was in late February 2014. From there MtGox entered in contact with the Tokyo District Court and followed its suggestion of shutting down the website until the filing for civil rehabilitation went through.
2	1522850612	14	Why did you ask Roger Ver to read a letter saying you were solvent?
3	1522852262	19	Roger Ver never said they were solvent, he just said that the withdrawal problems were due to banking problems rather than insolvency (which was true).
4	1522861291	1	I know he never said anything incrimination it was all qualified with "what I've been shown." 
4	1522855351	1	> solventExactly and he wasn't reading a letter either it all impromptu. 
3	1522852169	3	Do you mean this video, that was made in July 2013? Or another video? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP1YsMlrfF0
4	1522856226	2	Yes that is the video he means 
4	1522861469	1	Yes, that one. Thanks for looking up the date, I was thinking the MtGox bankruptcy and withdrawal issues were one and the same and this video occurred around the same time.I find it hard to believe Mark was clueless about the state of his business when he asked Roger to make that video. 
2	1522850974	7	Why was MtGox kept open for trading after that while Bitcoin withdrawals already weren't possible anymore?
3	1522853194	12	Because he is a criminal who committed fraud and no one should listen to a word out that comes out of this serial liar’s mouth
3	1522854271	0	It took some time after the withdrawals were suspended to audit all the wallets, and after it was found a large volume of BTC was missing discuss with lawyers/court how to proceed.
4	1522854694	4	As the story goes, it first seemed like all the money was gone, but then you suddenly found 200k BTC. Is that accurate? It seemed like you really had no clue how much money you had or were supposed to have. Did you have any logs or checks or monitoring in place or was it really the mess it sounds like it was?
4	1522855259	2	Why not closing the deposits too?
2	1522844569	6	What are your plans for the future? What are you going to do with the billion dollars?In my opinion, you should build something cool for the crypto community with it. Like grants for developers and projects. And let a trust handle the money. It could last a long time like the Howard Hughes Foundation.
3	1522850620	21	If I ever get that kind of money as indirect shareholder of MtGox I'll do my best to distribute it to creditors.If they want to invest this into cool stuff then it's their call, not mine.
4	1522853228	9	if you're going to give extra money to creditors, can you please please please refrain from giving any money more than required by law, to greg maxwell, luke jr, and peter wuille? 
5	1522861406	2	Maybe a funny joke to some, but this is a terrible idea. Distribution shouldn't be based on political or any other beliefs.
6	1522863892	1	If the distribution isn't required by law then it's just "doing the right thing".  Giving unethical (and arguably dangerous) people more power is at certainly at odds with "doing the right thing" from an ethical perspective.
3	1522857935	1	Or a brand new bitcointalk forum. /s
2	1522857635	1	Retrospectively, at which timeframe in the past did the events take place which lead to the later insolvency? 
2	1522856190	1	Oh wow, my seismograph is showing a *massive* earthquake. No, wait, this is my lie detector.
3	1522859211	2	No, you had it right. It was your seismograph. It was registering your last trip to the fridge.
1	1522853801	22	Don’t listen to anything he says. He first realized MtGox wasn’t solvent when the hack happened and then used willy bot and new customer deposits to make old customer withdrawals. It’s clearly a lie he found out right before the announcement. Shit was going down for a long time. He committed multiple crimes and will go to jail for a long time. Japan has an incredibly high conviction rate. They don’t press charges if they aren’t sure they have enough evidence for a conviction.If this was truly an honest mistake and he didn’t try to cover it up, things would have gone down VERY differently.Don’t forget the employees that came out and said he was using customer deposits for his stupid coffee shop side business
2	1522855310	1	coffee shop?
3	1522856374	4	Yeah there was a mtgox coffee shop (in the company headquarters). 
4	1522856529	3	truly visionary.
3	1522855861	2	Yeah he had some side business he was taking customer deposits to help fund. Clearly illegal
4	1522855975	2	MtGox was probably already a good business with future potential. Why would he do that.
5	1522856074	2	I don’t know because some criminals are really stupid? I have no idea.Why did he continue running the business when there was a theft? He could have just made a statement when it happened. Instead he committed massive fraud and kept it going. That was a stupid mistake as well as the embezzlement for his side business. I don’t know why he is an idiot, only he can explain that
2	1522861596	1	>Don’t forget the employees that came out and said he was using customer deposits for his stupid coffee shop side businessAll the talk about excessive spending was to skew the story. If you add up all of the excessive spending it is equal to less than 1% of the missing Bitcoin.
2	1522855812	0	What's wrong with you Robinson5? Why so much hate? You don't see the guy is trying to help people and make this whole story ends well for everyone? You would have preferred he told something like "OK, thanks for the BTC, and now I will buy Lambos?". Try to stay positive please. MtGox ending well will be a good news for the market, and a new victory for Bitcoin and our community.
3	1522855926	6	There’s so much hate because he committed massive fraud! And now he’s trying to pretend to be a good guy, which he clearly isn’t. He will be in jail soon anyway so it doesn’t matter.Does everyone here have memory loss? MtGox did not end well and it certainly wasn’t a victory for our community. Not sure what you are referencing
4	1522861811	2	> he committed massive fraud!Maybe, but no proof of this yet. Maybe you believe in "guilty until proven innocent" rather than "innocent until proven guilty."Edit: BTW - that would be making an assumption, and you know what they say about that.
0	1522837793	49	> But the author points to an interesting quirk in the data: The Willy trades continued to be executed even when the MtGox site went down. In January, over the course of half an hour when the site was offline, four trades were executed that bore the hallmark of the bot. "At a time no one else was able to trade, be it via API or otherwise, Willy was somehow able to continue as if nothing ever happened," says the author.Did you run the Willy bot?
1	1522852632	20	He has said elsewhere that he cannot comment on the Willy bot, but at this point it's known that it was operated by Mt. Gox/Mark.
1	1522840142	7	Qui ne dit mot, consent.
0	1522837252	44	If you could wind the clock back to 2013 somehow, what would you do differently in regards to Mt.Gox operating procedures, including the Willy Bot, and why?
1	1522838367	47	The main thing would be to hire people to handle the administrative/legal side of the business (US funds seizure in may 2013, coinlab lawsuit, etc) while I'd focus on keeping the tech team up to speed.
2	1522838525	14	Do you still get angry emails?
3	1522843558	40	Actually it's been quite a long time since the last one, if you exclude random anonymous reddit comments.
2	1522853225	3	What are your excuses for the willy bot? You know that’s illegal right?
2	1522854376	4	When do you think you'll be able to talk more about the May 2013 US funds seizure?  I feel like there is a massive (and very important) chapter of the Silk Road story that lies buried in there.
2	1522854115	0	.
0	1522835680	38	I am sorry to ask this question but will the Mt Gox case risk/cause you prison time in the future? Is there some crime the prosecuters are charging you with?Other than that, I am glad you decided to make good with the users of your site. That would be the right thing to do.
1	1522836175	50	Right now I am still being prosecuted in Japan on charges of "falsification of data" and "corporate embezzlement" with two layers of backup charges (another type of "corporate embezzlement" and "breach of trust"). Obviously I cannot comment in depth on this subject because it is an ongoing legal issue, but I'll at least say that I consider myself not guilty of any of the charges brought against me and pleaded as such. You can [read my initial trial statement](https://static.magicaltux.net/documents/2017/07/20170711_trial_statement_final_english.pdf).
2	1522838524	16	The gox saga was unfortunate for everyone. I'm glad you are trying to make peace with everything and I sincerely hope that things look up for you.Thanks for coming here and putting yourself out there.
2	1522838662	9	"After taking over the business, I realized that Mt. Gox faced the problem of managing a debt portfolio. If the debt portfolio was not properly managed, there was a possibility that Mt. Gox would go bankrupt and cause serious harm to its customers."What do you mean by this? Is this suggesting the theory MT Gox had 400k missing all along is true?Was MT Gox operating on fractional reserve?
3	1522843535	7	I'm afraid I can't comment further at this point due to ongoing legal proceedings.
4	1522856789	-5	I'll read that as "Mark Karpeles knows and admits that he is guilty," because if you could have found a way to say "no" without blatantly lying, you would have.
3	1522842701	2	A debt portfolio should be what is owned to customers by an exchange at any given time. You are reading into it.
3	1522862208	1	There is strong evidence that Bitcoin went missing when the business was being transitioned from Jed to Mark. As I recall it was somewhere around 87k +/- 5k. After Jed had sold the business, and he was transferring assets, he told Mark that some Bitcoin had gone missing. There is a chat log that has been made public out there.
2	1522837086	7	Thanks for the answer. As the case is ongoing, I shall not ask further.
2	1522854954	2	Why are you doing an AMA while you are still being prosecuted? Wouldn't lawyers advise against that?
2	1522862902	0	I hope you rot in there, you fucking crook. 
2	1522853519	-1	Do you have any rough idea on how long the trial will take? I’m very excited to hear how long they decide to lock you in a cageEdit: Are you also at risk for the fraud charges in France you were convicted for but fled?
1	1522864608	1	He hasn’t done shit for the users of the site. (I had btc in mt gox — haven’t gotten back a dime)
1	1522853404	0	He hasn’t made good with the users of the site. He is claiming he will, but he is a serial liar who committed massive fraud so I wouldn’t hold your breath. I’m not sure why people are so quick here to forget al the crimes he committed. The willy bot alone is illegal. Continuing to operate the exchange after the hack without notifying people and using new customer deposits for old customer withdrawals is illegal as well. Hopefully he rots in jail for a long time
2	1522862010	2	>He hasn’t made good with the users of the site. He is claiming he will.More specifically, he claims that he will "do his best" to do so. Right now Mark doesn't really have any control of the situation. Hopefully a court determines the correct course of action is to distribute the remaining btc to creditors, which is actually what Mark claims he wants to see happen. 
2	1522854035	1	I am sure many people dislike him. I don't disagree with that. However, I have no beef with this guy and I am only speaking from a personal capacity.
0	1522838228	30	Is there any truth to the story that you created WillyBot to manipulate the Bitcoin price?
1	1522844043	16	I unfortunately cannot comment to that at this point due to ongoing legal proceedings.
2	1522847369	8	This tells me the answer isn't a simple "no". 
3	1522848448	13	It could be anything, he is just in a legal proceeding, so people have accused him of it I guess
4	1522849964	8	Yeeeah, it's generally best just not to say anything if it can remotely be taken out of context for legal preceedings
5	1522852021	4	That’s what I was trying to say ^^^^too ^^early ^^for ^^words ^^and ^^stuff
3	1522854470	0	No it doesn't
0	1522835729	27	Would it be possible for you to take control of the remaining 160,000 Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash and personally distribute it back to the creditors?Edit: added a 0
1	1522836264	31	I do not have any authority on the MtGox bankruptcy. The MtGox trustee is in charge under supervision of the court, and it's unlikely for this case to be resolved quickly at this point of time because there are so many involved parties with different views on how things should end.As far as I'm concerned I only hope the bankruptcy will result as soon as possible in distribution of all assets to creditors.
2	1522837372	20	According to Japanese law, to be able to process The MtGox bankruptcy, trustee Kobayashi has to sell all assets(BTC,BCH, BTG) and convert them to Japanese yen. Is that correct? 
3	1522838236	22	Yes, this is correct. Actually this applies to most jurisdictions, bankruptcy means a liquidator is appointed to investigate assets and "liquidate" them, ie. sell everything for cash.
4	1522839808	15	Since Bitcoin (and other crypto?) is technically legal currency in Japan, could one make the argument that it's already liquidated? 
5	1522843604	25	Bitcoin is not legal currency in Japan. Bitcoin fits within a new regulation on "virtual currencies" that provide some framework on exchanges/etc, but in no way does that make Bitcoin equivalent to currency.
5	1522844977	2	As /u/magicaltux mentioned in his main post, bankruptcy law only works by using the local currency. Bitcoin may very well "work" as a currency, but the bankruptcy process dictates that it had to be converted into Yen.
4	1522842904	2	This should apply only to the assets needed to pay back creditors right?Afaik the remaining assets should be distributed to shareholders "as they are" and shouldn't get liquidated. Am i wrong on this?
5	1522843629	7	I understand assets distributed to shareholders also need to be liquidated so taxes can be properly assessed.
6	1522855832	12	So 160 thousand btc left to just dump on the market because of technicalities. Even though literally **no one** involved wants that, at all.
7	1522864123	1	Or maybe **someone** does want it. Follow the money. Who would benefit from Mark getting all the money AFTER taxes, and then Mark distributing the money to creditors AFTER taxes?
6	1522845361	6	Thanks for your quick and honest reply.So basically all the assets need to be sold, and will likely be sold in batches and on OTC markets, like the last times.Good luck for the trials.
7	1522850670	9	Thank you.Civil rehabilitation may help avoiding assets being sold. Hopefully more will become clear about this as we move forward in the process.
8	1522852610	1	Is there any chance that a good amount of the bitcoins that need to be sold for liquidating all assets will be sold on exchanges and not through OTC?
7	1522852515	1	That's far from a given, and we're not sure that was the case even in the past. It will likely be sold in batches, but an auction is probably more likely than OTC.
0	1522844593	19	Is it true that "Ulbricht is not the not the real Dread Pirate Roberts either. The real Roberts has been retired many years and living like a king in Japan"?Ok, lets rephrase that, was Jared Deryeghiayan barking up completely the wrong tree with not even a shred of real evidence when he assumed you were connected with Silk Road? I know saying incriminating things would be dumb, but can you say things on this topic? What are your beliefs about Ulbricht?(thanks for doing this ama)
1	1522851201	26	I think there are various factors that lead to that impression:* Silk Road opened in March 2011, when I took over MtGox* The Silk Road operator created a home page with my hosting service (the only one to accept BTC at the time) to advertise silk road, resulting in silk road advertising page hosted on my own servers* The bitcoin world was very small at the time, meaning MtGox would automatically profit from Silk Road* Silk Road used multiple MtGox accounts to move bitcoins, resulting in a lot of connected transactionsYet, after 2 years of reading my emails and investigating me, seizing 5 million USD from MtGox, US law enforcement couldn't find evidence I was behind Silk Road - and for good reason as I was never involved in Silk Road.
2	1522864975	1	> seizing 5 million USD from MtGoxThis bears repeating, as this was NOT your USD, but the USD of thousands of US citizens!
0	1522836700	65	did you lie to Roger Ver regarding insolvency when he was going public saying you were solvent? Did he know?
1	1522837138	97	At this point of time nobody knew about the situation or that a few weeks later MtGox would end filing for civil rehabilitation. I am really sorry for what Roger had to go through due to this.
2	1522839616	22	Let's rephrase. Was he reading from a script and did he get any sort of compensation for backing up mt. gox with that statement?
3	1522843772	48	I do not know exactly for the script, this was handled by someone else at the company. I haven't authorized any payment related to this video however. I can't say enough how sorry I am about the result this video had on Roger's reputation.
4	1522857258	2	What are you going to do about it.
3	1522840806	6	~~Was he reading from a script and~~ Did he get any sort of compensation for backing up Mt. Gox with [the statement that he made regarding "liqudity"]?Fixed the question for you. (Roger normally read scripts that way when he makes any announcements)
4	1522846492	2	I imagine he received compensation in the form of the Bitcoin price not plummeting quite as much as it otherwise might. I don't see why they'd have to pay him for it to be in his interest to make such an announcement.This could be a tricky question to answer though because, what if they said "we'll pay your travel expenses out here and buy you lunch if you want to see our books and operations for yourself" or something like that. Is that "compensation"?
5	1522850011	2	As long as he didn't knowingly lie, I hope he did see it as "in his interest.">This could be a tricky question to answer though because, what if they said "we'll pay your travel expenses out here and buy you lunch if you want to see our books and operations for yourself" or something like that. Is that "compensation"?It is tricky indeed.
4	1522842657	2	lmao good luck with this one
4	1522857393	1	I imagine it was conditional on him getting his account unlocked. So I don't think Roger was doing anything wrong just reflecting what he had been shown in exchange for his own bitcoins.Rather Roger was mislead
5	1522860901	1	The question is about whether he was explicitly paid to do it. Not what else might have been taking place or why he went there etc.
6	1522861219	1	Thanks for the explanation of your question, It was explicitly understood before I responded. I was just expressing there is a motive and no need for remuneration to create a motive.  
7	1522861741	1	You said >I imagine it was conditional on him getting his account unlocked.but then go on>So I don't think Roger was doing anything wrong just reflecting what he had been shown in exchange for his own bitcoins.If it was a condition for Roger to have his account "unlocked", what did he do to have it locked in the first place? At best, you make it sound like extortion and Roger complying with it. That's not a good thing and should have raised suspicions.I don't really want to go on about this however. Someone else will have to continue if they want. I'm not interested enough.
8	1522862307	1	> what did he do to have it locked in the first place?What did anyone on MtGox do to have their funds in their account locked into that exchange?  Everyone did what they could to get their funds out. 
9	1522866215	1	If it were due to the usual issues, then you seem to be implying more but still havn't said. I'm personally gonna drop this for now.
1	1522852742	1	Roger Ver did not claim Mt. Gox was solvent. He claimed that the withdrawal issues were from banking problems rather than insolvency.
1	1522852480	-7	is this the whole point of this AMA? to prove that roger is innocent and didnt manipulate thousands of people by spreading disinformation about the state of mtgox, just like he is doing right now with bcash?mediocre and pathetic, even laughable attempt, roger.
2	1522852491	3	Redditor /u/sumsaph has low karma in this subreddit.
0	1522837924	15	Are the 160,000 Bitcoin part of the stolen bitcoin or was it just a reserve? If they're part of the stolen bitcoins, how did you get it back?
1	1522838825	24	These were initially part of the cold wallets held by MtGox. 35,000 were sold by the trustee in dec 2017 ~ feb 2018, so only ~165,000 remains today.
2	1522841640	5	Market sold, crashing the market twice.
3	1522842406	11	Afaik the trustee has said he didn't use an ordinary sell order on an exchange.
4	1522844409	11	The person who bought hem might have.
5	1522844916	5	Yes, maybe I sold some coins too, once sold it's not the responsibility of the seller.When the coins are eventualy distributed what do you think is going to happen ? If it's in a downtrend at the time then I can guess and it's going to be nasty. If it's in an uptrend then nothing will happen.
4	1522846279	6	So he claims, but the claim is ridiculous. Selling OTC still affects the market price. If the purchaser hadn't bought the coins through the trustee, he would have bought them elsewhere. In the grand scheme, more bitcoins enter circulation (supply increase), and demand on price setting exchanges went down.
5	1522849911	3	I never said it has no effect on the market. But the claim that he did a market sell is just false...
6	1522858106	0	I never said that either!
0	1522835481	46	How are you planning on returning my 58 bitcoins? 
1	1522835761	46	I am currently working on a plan for Civil Rehabilitation with purpose of seeing all creditors eventually seeing returned to them the exact amount of BTC/BCH they had on their MtGox balance as soon as possible, by working with a sponsoring exchange that would support the civil rehabilitation, make it possible to distribute all remaining MtGox assets as soon as possible and put a large share of its revenue toward supporting a 100% refund (100% as in 1 BTC = 1 BTC/BCH).
2	1522836355	12	>  seeing all creditors eventually seeing returned to them the exact amount of BTC/BCH they had on their MtGox balance as soon as possibleTo do this would the BTC/BCH that was already sold to yen have to be converted back to BTC/BCH? If so, why was it sold in the first place?
3	1522837001	20	> To do this would the BTC/BCH that was already sold to yen have to be converted back to BTC/BCH? This wouldn't be enough to return all BTC, but may end being required.> If so, why was it sold in the first place?I have no control over the current process, and I learned about the sale at the same time as everyone else, when the creditors meeting on March 7th 2018 started.
4	1522840087	9	But the sale of bitcoins must mean that the bankruptcy process is about to finish?Or do you think that the bankruptcy managers just want to sell off the Bitcoins slowly in order to not disturb the market?
5	1522844102	20	If only. I think the MtGox trustee sold Bitcoins following the filing for Civil Rehabilitation in order to secure the possibility of CR happening at all. As things are right now even if Bitcoin's price was to fall overnight creditors would still be repaid close to 100% of their claim.
2	1522848420	1	For that to work you would need to crash the price by selling the 200K BTC/BCH? Then buying them up again at half price (or lower). Then you can get back 400K Bitcoins or whatever that was lost in the hack. Then repay all the creditors.
2	1522844647	2	What does “working on a plan” mean?  Does it mean you are imagining a plan as you type and will one day possibly write it down and later execute the steps?  Or does the plan already exist and you are already following the steps?  If so, share with us the plan. Previously you said your biggest failure was lack of delegation so does that apply to this “plan” of yours?      Seems you had a plan to run mt gox too but it has taken millions of dollars and thousands of hours to decipher that plan.  How are you delegating on this new plan you are “working on?” Who is helping with that and what documentation can you share with us right now today that there is a plan being worked?  Have you filed anything with a court? Have you hired an attorney who has advised you this plan will work?    “Working on a plan” are weasel words. Actions matter but my guess is those don’t exist. You say you are an engineer. If so, write out the plan you are working on. List the exact steps to take the plan into production.  The community can decide if you’ve actually been working on a plan. 
3	1522850932	4	Putting together such a plan involves discussing with lawyers what is possible, with potential partners if they'd be willing to pitch in, spending money and creating a new future for this bankruptcy. It means talking with creditors to evaluate what they'd like to see happen.

It means talking with creditors to evaluate what they'd like to see happen.I'm from Missouri. 
2	1522837821	1	Wow this sound so great, I really hope that this would become reality sometime.What i dont understand though is why would a random exchange just give away most of it revenue? Or would you start a new exchange?
3	1522838120	11	I never said it'd be easy to do, but if no one even tries then it'll never happen.
4	1522838471	-6	Did you ever think about just creating a new company and a new exchange? Maybe you would find some investors. How many USD would it cost to start a new exchange? This  new exchange could than gift the creditors shares
3	1522837832	4	Redditor /u/adolfaberHitler has low karma in this subreddit.
2	1522852364	1	My situation is that I had invested in one of the many asic startups that were abundant around this time. They fizzled out along with my funds, and the explanation was that they were stored on gox. What chance would I have of ever seeing coin here? The owner was/is a bit of a shit and will likely pocket whatever he receives...
2	1522865451	1	I'm not holding my breath for a return.
1	1522847028	3	Thank your lucky fucken stars you’re getting anything ... do you know how this shit normally turns out. I honestly can’t believe the luck of everyone affected by this .. it sounds like you’re gonna get not only your money back but also way more from being forced to hold. You scream black and blue that you were going to hold but this happening may have stopped a lot of people that would have sold and thus a blessing in disguise. The fact that you couldn’t sell could have also been a factor into why we had such a huge run up in the first place so whinging about not being able to get out at $19k may have never been possible. In the end I’m happy that people are getting their money back but feel it’s worth acknowledging this at least that’s how I see it. 
2	1522847041	5	Redditor /u/bullrun99 has low karma in this subreddit.
3	1522848132	3	He's right though. I was involved in a class action type situation where we were trying to get our money back. I was owed around $500 and for 4 years I received e-mails every few months updating me and showing the several hundred thousand dollars the guy put in charge of our case was syphoning off for himself in fees.By the end of it I received a cheque for around $17.
4	1522855061	1	I'm a victim of the BitGrail theft/insolvency... I highly doubt I will see any of that ever again.
3	1522858201	1	Oh come on! Leave him alone!
2	1522865632	1	Au contraire.I lost EVERYTHING on MtGox. Started reading about the situation, and realized even moreso that Bitcoin was not going away, and bought more. I never once considered selling, even when withdrawal issues were starting to happen. 
0	1522841174	24	Hi Mark, thanks for doing this AMA! My question is, how do you feel about the path that Bitcoin has taken since you departed from the community back in 2014? What do you feel about Bitcoin being a “settlement system” versus electronic cash? Also one other question, how closely did you work with Luke Dash Jr on the Mt Gox code? Did he write a lot of code or just a one off script to integrate with Eligius mining pool? Did he play any other roles with Mt Gox? Thanks. 
1	1522843913	45	I think right now Bitcoin fails both as a settlement system and as electronic cash. For now I feel Bitcoin is more of a wild horse traders are trying to ride and end up either very high or very low. Bitcoin's volatility isn't helping making it useful for any kind of financial transaction other than high volatility trading.Luke Dash Jr didn't write any of the MtGox code, nor did he ever had any role within MtGox. MtGox only worked with his mining pool Eligius because it was a rather large pool at the time and willing to connect with MtGox to facilitate confirmation of transactions issued by MtGox.
2	1522844033	8	Thanks for replying! I hope all is well with you and wish that all of the Gox drama soon goes away and creditors get some of their money back so we can all move on.  
2	1522853919	1	> I think right now Bitcoin fails both as a settlement system and as electronic cashAre there any coins that you think are actually useful, and have a good future ahead of them?
3	1522857455	3	Short answer is no. Work hard, earn money like normal people.
2	1522845038	-31	Take a look at Nano which doesn’t fail as a settlement system and electronic cash!
3	1522846248	14	Working overtime?
4	1522846644	-14	Yes indeed :D
3	1522852006	8	>doesn’t failOn a small scale. Bitcoin did not fail on a similar scale either.Nano is completely untested on larger scales and any claimed maximum throughput is pure theory.
3	1522862663	0	Can somebody tell me why is this comment down with 30\+ points? Saying to someone to do a research about a cryptocurrency is now considered as... bad?
4	1522862864	0	Yes sir! This is crypto. Whatever people haven’t invested in is bad :DBring those downvotes ;)
5	1522863339	0	Great :). All those people saying that r/bitcoin is bad because they ban you for mentioning BCH and now you guys downvote for mentioning other altcoins. See that? You are guys not better. This sub is so much more ruined than r/nanocurrency or r/cryptocurrency. 
0	1522840018	16	In the early stages of this bankruptcy process, creditors were asked if we wanted to be paid in fiat or bitcoin. I opted for getting my coins back. Why did they ask this question if there was no avenue for such?Thanks for doing this AMA. Stay strong.
1	1522844860	17	The question was actually just a poll, to know what creditors wanted as a whole. The court could still issue an order to allow (or try to) payments in Bitcoin, but now that civil rehabilitation is on the table it's a much easier choice.
2	1522859755	3	Back when I read it.  It seemed to me like it was saying that if I wanted a Bitcoin payout I had to open an account with Kraken and have my claim associated with it which I did.Subsequent updated were pretty unclear as to whether or not my claim was being considered valid or anything so I feel like there's a real lack of information at least available in English that tells me anything about the status of my claim.

0	1522837712	18	Has this whole ordeal changed any of your views about crypto and/or people (including yourself)?
1	1522838488	33	Yes, quite a lot. Not so much about crypto-currencies on a technical level, but about myself, and about the people involved.The main part would be that I learned about my own limits. There is only so much someone can do, and there are times when delegating and finding the right partners can mean the difference between life and death.

If you use his public PGP key to decrypt the above, there should be a plaintext message that gets spit out. This shows that he is the real deal as guessing his private PGP key to create the message in the first place would be pretty much impossible (assuming he didn't have to forfeit this in plaintext during his ordeal).

5	1522848363	1	I'm sorry but I don't understand what are you referring to.
0	1522835026	28	What are your views on Bitcoin Cash?
1	1522835230	47	I'm trying to remain neutral as much as possible on the fork. In theory when such a fork happens one of the two branches will eventually die, however in this case it's difficult to say what will happen.
2	1522835467	21	Would you advocate bigger blocks or is 1MB fine? Thanks.
3	1522835583	127	As storage and bandwidth become cheaper, it makes sense to increase the maximum block size from its original value set almost 10 years ago, so I do believe it makes sense to increase block size over time, but this doesn't exclude also improving the technology itself, as long as done with proper testing.
4	1522835962	21	Nice position.
5	1522842858	3	Slash, phrasing.
6	1522859044	1	That's what she said!
5	1522848914	-1	(Cultists taking out pitchforks)
4	1522838293	15	Exactly. Limiting blocks to 1 mb is absolutely silly. Computers have improved so much in the last 10 years and we are still debating if floppy disk capacity is the maximum network can handle. Bitcoin Cash is focused on innovation not only in software but also hardware. This is a long term solution which will allow it to scale and make it truly mainstream.
5	1522848929	1	It’s like useing land line phones instead of smartphones!
5	1522848929	1	It’s like useing land line phones instead of smartphones!
5	1522844587	0	hence its 2MB ;)
6	1522853496	3	8 MB actually. Seems like the protocol is currently limited to 32MB.There is a plan to bump the limit to the 32MB supported by the current protocol somewhere in May.
6	1522844687	7	That's some insane innovation going on right there. /s :)
6	1522857943	1	The transaction limit is 1MB the block limit is now called a block weight limit. And the old block size limit is now conveniently called the none witness data limit.If you find that confusing get a BS/Core shill to explain it.
5	1522842374	-4	Bitcoin has that same drive. The projects are eventually going to learn from each other to see what is safe or possible.
6	1522846671	10	BTC cannot scale above 1MB block size because so many of it's users have been conditioned to view larger blocks as a slippery slope to inevitable failure. The BTC community will always have many 1MB4EVAs.To upgrade block size would therefore require that the large block "upgrade" implement replay protection to protect the small block "original" chain, which would make the upgraded chain an altcoin, no better than BCH.
7	1522848726	3	Lightning Network whitepaper says that blocks of 133Mb will be needed to scale globaly.
8	1522865570	1	Well, good luck with that.  If you think there won't always be a group sufficient to stymie an upgrade, you're in for a bad time.As long as people keep mining and holding the 1MB coin then that chain will keep being "BTC", upgrades will require replay protection and therefore be an altcoin.
7	1522848389	1	Bigger blocks are needed whether the main devs want to admit it or not. I think you and I agree there. Bch serves as an experiment to see what happens when larger blocks are used, so it may be influential to them. 
8	1522861640	2	I disagree. There is already a big block fork of Bitcoin. The community of people who support big blocks are already here. BTC is the community for people who support 1MB + Segwit.  An attempt to raise the BTC block size will merely split that coin again.
9	1522865096	1	The plan was to increase the block size to 2mb as well as include segwit. That was the roadmap. When bitcoin cash broke off from bitcoin, it split the community and made the idea of another hard fork very hard. But this is a short term problem. Saying bitcoin will never have a blocksize increase is like saying that bitcoin cash will never include things like lightning network. 
4	1522849238	1	Sounds exactly like bch to me. 
2	1522846487	2	> In theory when such a fork happens one of the two branches will eventually die, however in this case it's difficult to say what will happen.I disagree with this theory. Who postulated it?Coin A has two possible divergent use cases. Coin A splits into A1 and A2. Each satisfies its use case. Holders of coin A are better off for the split because each coin can best adapt to its use case.

0	1522846103	10	What would you say to people who find it not entirely credible that so much money could have started to go missing without being noticed?  As the CEO, how could you not have an idea of how much money was on hand?  
1	1522851453	3	I am sorry for how things happened. I unfortunately cannot comment further at this point of time because of ongoing proceedings.
1	1522866073	1	I’m still convinced he has a private key somewhere with loads of bitcoin on it
0	1522837902	21	Mark, don't listen to those few trolls here.  Those who listened to Kim Nillson's talk know that the truth of what happened was far more complex than people realize.  I'm not trying to remove blame from you but shit happens and people who held BTC at the exchange knew the risk.  Unfortunately I was one of them.  My question is this:  How realistic is it that creditors would be paid back fully?  I know the crypto world has expanded to many alt-coins now so you coould make profit from more than just Bitcoin itself, but to we are talking about over half a million BTC you would need to reimburse creditors.  That seems far beyond the revenue of any exchange even over multiple years, or am I wrong?
1	1522838779	21	Actually most exchange are making quite a lot of profit. CoinBase made the equivalent of some 150k BTC revenue last year, probably more because the price was lower at the beginning of the year.There also remains the possibility bitcoins are found following the analysis of Alexander Vinnik's computers and other electronic devices. I wouldn't put too much hope there, but one never knows.
2	1522840318	-1	I have a suggestion for you .  You should tell Kim Nilsson of WizSec to do some blockchain analysis on Nchain and Craig Wright.  The reason for this is that documents released in the Kleiman v Wright case indicated Craig may have claimed to hold private keys to Gox addresses.  Kim Nilsson already released an article stating this was proof Craig was a fraud, but it could also be proof Craig is a thief.  I doubt Craig is a thief and I actually think he is Satoshi, but if the documents in the case are legitimate and Craig claimed to own private keys to Gox addresses then the Gox creditors deserve to know why as that is highly suspicious.  His Tulip Trust is supposed to complete in 2020 so Kim Nilsson should just watch and ensure that he can't trace the coins that Craig moves out of the trust back to stolen Gox coins that he has been moving around through wallets owned by his associates for years to cover his theft.  Again, not trying to stir up heat in this community about CSW, I think he is Satoshi, but if he is a thief we need to know so someone should investigate the Bitcoin addresses in the claims in the documents of the Kleiman v Wright.
3	1522843945	16	I think [he already did an analysis on Craig Wright](https://blog.wizsec.jp/2018/02/kleiman-v-craig-wright-bitcoins.html).
3	1522846406	11	I have done that blockchain analysis, hence my claim that he's a fraud and not a thief (at least not in the sense of stealing those coins). In addition to claiming to own coins stolen out of MtGox as well as coins clearly controlled by MtGox, several of the other claimed addresses can also be confidently tied to other people rather than to Wright. As far as anyone can tell, Wright himself never historically owned any significant amount of bitcoin, and just runs around pretending to own other people's bitcoin instead. That he included stolen MtGox coins in his list simply reinforces that he had no idea what any of those addresses were, or he would have presumably avoided "implicating" himself.When the news of the lawsuit hit, Wright quickly denied that these coins were the fabled "Tulip Trust", so I guess now you're supposed to believe that there's *another* million BTC in a trust somewhere out there that he totally for sure owns (pinky-swear), unrelated to the million BTC in a trust that he was just caught lying about? Uh-huh.When you find yourself jumping through hoops to still extend him the benefit of the doubt after so many patently untrue claims, haven't you gotten the burden of proof all wrong here? Just write him off as a pathological liar already and don't let him waste your time. If he wants to be taken seriously, he can provide proof of his claims at any time -- as it happens, Satoshi Nakamoto invented a great system for it.
1	1522838037	2	Not to reply to my own post, but I am referring to your plan to have an exchange sponsor the civil rehabilitation.  I don't see how you can fully reimburse creditors from a sponsoring exchange.
2	1522844007	6	It'd involve the exchange sharing part of its revenue with MtGox creditors. That'd be a bold move, but people in the crypto world are known to be bold.
3	1522844735	-7	Did you think about asking Satoshi if he would donate some of his stash towards the creditors?It would help bitcoin immense if its final clear that satoshi doesnt have anymore coins and for himself he would also be much more safe if he doesnt own that much anymore.Please contact him or ask nick szabo

1	1522844555	14	Actually, it turns out this might have been possible, as has been shown afterward by some exchanges. I think the main issue was the political pressure on the exchange which made entering civil rehabilitation a requirement.
0	1522838308	14	Thanks for such thread at this subreddit
1	1522844384	10	Thank you for your kind words.
0	1522842327	11	It must take a lot of nerve to do this, and it's a sign that you are going through a time of personal reflection, so let me ask you this: how involved do you plan on being with crypto, and rebuilding a reputation here?You could take a behind the scenes role and still enable massive growth in the community, re-invest in projects, create better solutions . . . Being transparent a nonprofit could be a good idea. Huge mistakes create wisdom. Few rich people are truly wise , having never suffered a crucible. Crypto could use someone who is both humble and empowered.

1	1522844799	14	In two words: pretty bad. I spend the first 4 months and half of custody at the police station, where I was fed as everyone else simple cold food. Morning was some soup (actually the only thing hot) with a plate containing rice and a few extras, lunch was two breads with some jam and a small extra, dinner was a plate with rice and some extras (I write extras because it's mostly Japanese food, if I say chikuwa or aji-fry, I don't think everyone would understand).The following 7 months were spent at the Tokyo Detention Center, which had actually warm food and more variation. I actually took on close to 5kg during those 7 months.My cat was initially looked after by reported Jake Adelstein (despite his cat allergy) until a friend of mine could take over.
2	1522863358	1	What were the other prisoners like? Did you get to communicate with them much? I’ve read before that not much talking is allowed in Japanese prisons. 
0	1522840790	4	Would it not make more sense to now close the bankruptcy as soon as possible and then you can go on to distribute the remaining BTC/BCH/Candy and what not proportionally to claimants?
1	1522844960	3	I'm afraid it wouldn't be that easy. Doing so would make MtGox resume to pre-bankruptcy state, but then Bitcoins wouldn't be enough and MtGox would be bankrupt again.
2	1522850346	3	Not sure I get it. All claims are covered, right. So in theory they trustee could proceed to payout. Then the rest belongs to the shareholder. I understand that is mainly you. So you could then just distribute. I may be naive.
3	1522851495	2	Everyone knows, including the trustee and the court, that this is not an ideal situation. The problem is that both court and trustee are bound by law, so there are limits on what they can do.
0	1522838382	7	it is obvious that there was and still is massive market manipulation going on.    methods like wash trading or painting the tape, spoofing are a every day reality on crypto exchanges.    what is your stance on this?    why do exchanges obviously do NOTHING against it?    Mt. Gox seemingly did nothing against the WIlly Bot back in the day neither. why ?
1	1522844503	10	MtGox has always tried to keep a neutral stance, and minimize impact on the market of internal issues such as banking issues/etc.It's not always easy for exchanges to act against things, however some things such as wash trading can be easily prevented (in MtGox system, if an order was about to match another order by the same user, it'd simply stop execution there).I cannot comment on your last question at this point of time due to ongoing legal proceedings.
2	1522845534	2	thanks a lot for even answering. really appreciated.
2	1522860019	1	> some things such as wash trading can be easily prevented (in MtGox system, if an order was about to match another order by the same user, it'd simply stop execution there).What if the user had two different accounts selling back and forth to each other? Would exchanges be able to track this and say "these two high volume accounts mostly just transact with each-other" and shut both down? Would a current major exchange have any incentive to shut a practice like this this down when they collect fees from all these trades?
1	1522864612	1	> why do exchanges obviously do NOTHING against it?Newsflash buddy: The exchanges are the ones behind the manipulation.

0	1522840231	7	Did malleability play any role in the mtgox demise?
1	1522844912	16	A very small role, with over 1000 BTC stolen that way, but nothing [in comparison to the 530,000+ BTC stolen Alexander Vinnik ended laundering](https://blog.wizsec.jp/2017/07/breaking-open-mtgox-1.html).
0	1522849834	6	What advice would you give to the leaders of exchanges like Coinbase and Bitfinex today? Also, do you think Bitfinex/Tether is acting in bad faith?
1	1522852142	6	The crypto exchange industry is lacking a lot in transparency, and while some movements happened back in 2014 after MtGox bankruptcy, everyone stopped providing transparency information on crypto holdings.Smart contracts should allow exchanges to not actually hold crypto currencies to allow trading, that would be a good way to start making exchanges hacking-proof.

1	1522844972	8	MtGox never allowed wash trading.
2	1522846017	3	Not for users, no. 
0	1522849347	6	I fully respect you for posting in both r/Bitcoin and r/BTC.
1	1522851809	4	Thanks. I wasn't really sure what was the best so I decided going with both, despite the fact it may mean a lot of duplicated work.
0	1522838544	13	Oh hi mark
1	1522845331	12	Hi.
1	1522842202	5	I did not down vote, I did naaaahhhht
0	1522839784	8	Thanks for doing this. I met a guy that lost coins from this. I was buying mining gear from him. He was explaining what happened and before he could finish the story he was sobbing. What's your favorite ice cream? 
1	1522844620	14	I can only hope the person you bought equipment from, if he is a MtGox creditor, will see his funds paid back as soon as possible. If he didn't file, civil rehabilitation may make him able to.
2	1522848633	7	But what’s your favorite ice cream
0	1522840169	9	1. Where can we check (in real time) how many BCH are left in the Mt.Gox Trustee wallet? Has the wallet itself been announced publicly?2. I think we can all agree that MtGox security was Swiss cheese and easy target for script kiddies with minimal hacking knowledge. However, you weren't the crappy coder who built it, it was Stellar's creator. Yet you're taking all the blame and /r/cryptocurrency is rushing into buying McCaleb's shitcoin which is staying stable as a top 10 in market cap.Don't you think it's fair not only for you, but for the entire crypto community to educate them about the earlier history of MtGox and the fact that it was already insolvent when you bought it?
1	1522844357	9	1. Some people have made scripts monitoring MtGox bankruptcy wallets, and list of addresses are mostly known, so it's just a matter of watching the blockchain.2. Fair or not, I can only hope things will be clear with time. To be quite honest I'm spending much more time on trying to make things better for the bankruptcy to care about my own image (until people really pushed me to do an AMA because most people don't know about all this).
1	1522844983	2	https://www.cryptoground.com/mtgox-cold-wallet-monitor/
0	1522841059	6	Did the 200k bitcoin which were found "under the rug" come from a benefactor of sorts?Who holds how many shares of MtGOX at this date?
1	1522845012	10	The ~200k BTC found were stored safely in cold wallets.MtGox is held 88% by Tibanne Co Ltd (bankrupt) which is held 100% by myself (also bankrupt), and 12% by Jed McCaleb.
2	1522850407	1	Jed seemed to have tweeted that he sold his 12% for 1$ to a benefactor that tried to save the exchange. Is that not true to your best knowledge?
3	1522851263	7	MtGox, as a private company, requires share transfers to be approved & recorded by the company. Because it is bankrupt I do not believe anything was approved.
4	1522851706	2	OK, thanks for the clarification. So Jed will probably have to give back that 1$ then.... which will be a good deal for him...
0	1522836320	10	What's your opinion (if you have one) whether Craig Wright could be part of Satoshi? 
1	1522837037	70	He's clearly not.
2	1522846133	2	Do you have any ideas who is Satoshi?
2	1522853258	2	Then who do you think it is? Have you ever talked to him?
2	1522838614	8	What make you think he is not Satoshi ? 
3	1522844139	25	[A whole lot of things that are not right with Craig Wright](https://blog.wizsec.jp/2018/02/kleiman-v-craig-wright-bitcoins.html).
4	1522848939	4	Glad you along with most others can see him as a fraud. I am amazed how many people think there is even a chance he is Satoshi...
4	1522863275	1	Thank you. Take care and good luck.
3	1522845894	2	He's not
3	1522851818	3	Bc it is glaringly obvious he is not. He lied about his credentials. He studied theology. He’s a sham. More than likely it is Tatsuaki Okamoto or someone who knows him. It isn’t some guy who read the Bible and googled ‘how to crypto.’ It would be someone who had a long history of working in the industry in academia, government, and private industry. I mean all three. IE a university, writing research, and working for the NSA. Like Tatsuaki Okamoto. This sort of knowledge doesn’t just spring up over night. “Recently, several “divisible” untraceable off-line electronic cash schemes have been presented [8, 11, 19, 20]. This paper presents the first practical “divisible” untraceable1 off-line cash scheme” “we prove the security of the proposed cash scheme under some cryptographic assumptions. Our scheme is the first “practical divisible” untraceable off-line cash scheme whose cryptographic security assumptions are theoretically clarified.” “Note that coins divided from the same coin can be linked each other in the proposed scheme, although they are anonymous, i.e., “untraceable” from the customer’s identity. In other words, the unlinkability among divided coins is not satisfied, although the untraceability is satisfied.” This is from 1995. Annual International Advances in Cryptology Conference. Tatsuaki Okamoto submitted his paper in conjunction with NTT laboratories. PhD in Applied Math entirely achieved through University of Tokyo. Was working on this and wrote about it since the mid 80s. Also worked with the NSA. If it is not him it is someone who knows him very well. He may not know who it is but he likely has a good idea. It may not be him but someone followed his work very close. 
4	1522860953	2	Someone...like you?!
5	1522861344	1	the thick plottens
4	1522865111	1	This is interesting. First time I hear about Tatsuaki Okamoto
3	1522845590	2	Common sense. 
1	1522838371	6	Must we keep hearing this
2	1522846545	-1	Why does it make you uncomfortable? 
0	1522843409	6	I had no idea this was still rolling on.  I hope you get through this OK.  I don't know if you have much of an opinion on this but what are your recommended ways for new people to get into crypto.  Are there any exchanges you recommend today, and vice versa, any you think are currently very dodgy? Finally, have you followed any of the senate hearings with the SEC, CFTC, etc and do you think the US Gov is 'waking up' to crypto in a good way?
1	1522845323	7	Government approved exchanges (CoinBase, BitFlyer, etc) are less likely to face government opposition (duh) and as such are probably much safer for users as long as the use remains within what is allowed by law (ie. no tax evasion, drugs, etc).Anyone who wants to engage in risky behavior will end having to take risks.As to recent hearings a lot has to do with ICOs which in many cases see a lot of money funneled in projects not ready for this (or just plain fraudulent), and consumer protection comes first. This said cryptocurrencies will be an ongoing challenge for governments around the world for the years to come as it already been since at least 2013, and it seems so far the US is taking a positive stance toward crypto currencies.
2	1522845694	1	Thanks for taking the time to respond.  All of what you've been going through happened before I really knew much about Bitcoin, but the whole episode is something I looked into during my research before getting involved.
0	1522844952	6	Why not a dog?
1	1522851536	5	Japan homes are small and I don't have time to walk a pet, so a dog would be sad here.
0	1522845545	6	Do you still like frozen coffee drinks? If so, What's your favorite?
1	1522851563	2	I drink Japanese tea, such as sokenbicha. It's not coffee but it still contains caffeine.
0	1522845856	2	What is your opinion on the Bitgrail insolvency and Francesco "Bomber" Firano?
1	1522851617	5	Bitgrail is that exchange that implemented client side balance checks on withdrawals?
2	1522851766	2	Yeah, not sure if that's been proven, but we're thinking of the same one probably. Bitgrail was the first exchange built around Raiblocks, now called NANO.
2	1522858910	0	Are you sure about that?!?!?!?!
0	1522850424	3	Can you please add an edit to your post to tell people to join the https://www.mtgoxlegal.com group of creditors if they are a creditor and have not done so yet. This group is helping to push things forward.
1	1522852299	3	I do not feel comfortable endorsing MtGox Legal for reasons I cited before (mostly the fact it involves collecting money). Considering my position I would never tell creditors to spend money.
2	1522852487	0	mtgoxlegal is collecting money to fight for the billions at stake. You can't do that for free. Mtgoxlegal is literally the only voice the creditors have in the fight right now.
0	1522839678	6	How much money did you steal?
1	1522845341	9	None.
0	1522843874	4	What would be the process of getting back USD balance one held on the exchange, or even is there a place I could check my old record of trades on the exchange before it disappeared? I did not file at the time you were supposed to because I was emotionally devastated. I have my old login info and MtGox Yubikey. Most of all I would like to check my old trades to see how insanely stupid they were.
1	1522851680	3	It's likely civil rehabilitation, if it happens, will open a new window for filing claims. Hopefully this will allow people who couldn't file to file.
0	1522846636	3	Do you have suggestions to what to watch out for before deciding to transfer funds to an exchange? 
1	1522851708	3	It depends on what your goal is, but using main exchanges such as BitFlyer or CoinBase is probably the safest.
0	1522846884	4	You seriously want **NO MONEY**? You are going to give away a hundreds of millions that you can legally obtain *(but ethically should not get)*   I can't get my mind around this and shocked this is not the number one question. I think the vast majority of people in your situation **including me** could not resist taking at least $100m and enjoying life.  How can you resist?
1	1522851758	10	I don't need money to enjoy life. What's important is to have the right people around.
1	1522854220	1	You're assuming it's hassle free millions. You forget there's 25000 people who want their Bitcoins and will file lawsuits for the rest of Mark's life. 
2	1522859329	1	Would they have a leg to stand on? They would be compensated for the value of the btc at the moment of the bankruptcy.
1	1522848125	-1	hes saying this to justify all his fucking lies and trying to save his own life cuz in his position u will never "enjoy life".
2	1522851346	2	You'd give away hundreds of millions so people robbed four years ago can get 30% back instead of 10% of their original amount?That's a principled man.  I could find a way to enjoy life with $100m even if everyone hated me 
3	1522864954	1	I don't know.  Think about the security and fear you'd have to live with at having 25,000 people justifiably angry with you. If it were me I'd fear for my life every day. Not very enjoyable. 
0	1522848137	4	Can I ask how you feel your other post is going, have you noticed a lot of your answers and people's questions are disappearing?
1	1522851782	6	I'm too busy writing responses to notice. Hopefully this is not in vain.
2	1522851874	4	I've noticed most of the questions about Ver are going and one of your replies saying that he was not paid for the message is gone
3	1522854374	2	If it's true it's sad. I'm sorry I don't have time to check this :(
4	1522861558	2	From what I can see:https://www.ceddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89o16y/im_mark_karpel%C3%A8s_exceo_of_bankrupt_mtgox_ask_me/>1097 comments 1117 scanned 25 [removed]3 comments were removed for having a Bitcoin address.This comment/question by u/Sherlockcoin was removed:>Is Jed McCaleb, your ex colleague, from MtGox, ex Ripple and now Steller founder a scammer that moves from project to project and a honest person?And the other 21 were removed before being cataloged by snew. This is normal for r/bitcoin, sadly.
0	1522842404	2	Great of you to answer questions!As Bitcoin was created to be a “Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” what are your thoughts on Bitcoin Core (BTC) taking the chain in such a drastically different direction, in contrast to BCH community efforts?
1	1522845141	9	Right now the main issue for Bitcoin to act as "Electronic Cash" is the volatility. Years ago we used to think as bitcoin matured volatility would get better, but it turns out it isn't getting much better at all, and price still does those huge swings. Hopefully, one day...
2	1522858653	1	Dai stable coin would be a good electronic cash if scaling on ethereum goes as planned
2	1522858695	1	Wolitility is diminishing as the transaction volume grows. This is evident even with this crash.
0	1522845210	4	It’s interesting how the questions here are far more intelligent and knowledgeable than on the other sub, which is full of people who’ve been under thought control for three years. The rest of us have been banned to this sub. Just an observation I’ve made this morning. I’m curious your opinion on the corruption and censorship that has overtaken the main bitcoin social outlets. I suppose you can remain neutral on the fork debate, but what about this topic?Thank you for acknowledging this sub by conducting the AMA here as well.
1	1522851917	3	I'll avoid taking any position on this, mostly because I'm not involved in Bitcoin anymore to be informed enough.As soon as you have communities with large number of people there will be various factions forming, and it can be positive just as it can be negative. I know everyone on both subs are hoping to see a better future, so I can only hope everyone will learn to accept each others.
1	1522848242	1	I admit I had to check the other sub too and see what the tone was like. Much more negative over there. People seem very much on edge in that sub.
1	1522847975	1	Ask a  meaningful question and stop jerking off to r/btc 
0	1522844848	2	Keep up the good work Mark, keep the windfall that might come your way but this has been a very weird lesson for everyone to learn.you look a lot better now, hopefully after this is all done and dusted you can get on with your life happy without this hanging over your head.The people crying about getting the value back in BTC would be the people also demanding the value in JPY if the value of BTC were to drop to zero. So fuck them.
1	1522851991	3	Thank you very much.
0	1522846510	2	If you give that billion dollars back to the people who lost their coins then that would be a seriously good move.  I hope you do that.
0	1522848267	2	No question.>  I don't want this billion dollars.Then give it to the community in ten thousand dollar increments. Nobody's forcing you to be rich. It's easy to spend or give away money. It's hard to take someone seriously when they complain about not doing those things. I don't believe this sentiment for a nanosecond.
1	1522852047	3	If it comes to it I'll find a way to distribute it to creditors as much as possible. For now I'm trying to avoid such a result.
0	1522848579	2	If the bankruptcy proceeds to sell off bitcoin until it's creditors are repaid and MtGox is allowed to keep the rest of the assets,  would you (as a rebuilt exchange) pay back the crypto anyway? 
1	1522852064	3	Ideally, yes.
0	1522849929	2	Is is true they only got Ulbricht because they couldn't get you?
1	1522852181	3	I never was involved with Silk Road. I don't know about Ulbricht and quite frankly I feel sad about what happened to him.
2	1522852291	1	Bit of a coincidence the timing of events I have to say. 
0	1522850214	2	Do you own/use any crypto at the moment?
1	1522852185	3	None.
2	1522856003	1	Wow, did not think you will reply! Thank you, and good Luck to you!

1	1522854579	2	I have 200+ messages right now, but I'll probably get there eventually. Thanks.

0	1522845534	0	Have you ever played Magic the Gathering?
1	1522852313	3	Never, actually. 
0	1522845899	3	Hi MarkAssuming civil rehab fails and normal bankruptcy ensues, is there anything (legally or otherwise) stopping you from distributing your 160,000 bitcoin proceeds back to deposit holders who held BTC balances and didn't get full face value? The list of claims and claimants are public record so you already have the information you need to do this fairly and properly.
1	1522852372	3	I will try to if it ever comes to that, but for now I'd rather focus on trying to make Civil Rehabitation happen, it'd avoid a lot of costs/taxes/etc.
0	1522845513	1	Do you know who Satoshi is?

1	1522858321	2	Engrish please!
0	1522853836	1	thats bizzare... this goddamned Mt Gox will rekt the whole markets, years after it has rekt itself. 💩
0	1522854628	1	have you heard about the Nano(raiblocks) exchange "hack" bitgrail.com?  Do you have an opinion on this and do you think Ill ever get my Nano back?
0	1522854652	1	I expect that your reply to this will be along the lines of 'it was always theirs', but have you considered how your ideal plan (returning the original BTC to creditors), however unlikely it is, is just rewarding people for their own ineptitude?I'm sure you will agree that holding a large number of coins on an exchange in the first place was a foolish exercise, and if your plans come to fruition you will have made some people very wealthy not just because of the first mistake of leaving the coins sat on Gox, but also by forcing them to 'hodl'. If Gox had never happened, the vast majority of your creditors would have traded away, wasted and sold their BTC over the years. You would now be returning BTC to them and instantly making many of them extremely rich, by virtue of their own incompetence. If you buy a winning lottery ticket but are stupid enough to lose it, the lottery aren't going to give you the winnings anyway.Surely a fiat compensation for the value lost at the time is actually the fairer system to adopt?
1	1522864029	1	The fact remains that it was their BTC to lose, not Marks or anyone else’s.
0	1522855204	0	My brother paid me 50$ in bitcoin cash to ask you this.  Do you really think you and Roger will get away with this? He says its game theory impossible.
0	1522855273	1	What are your criticisms of government post My Gox and have your views changed?
0	1522855374	1	I had about 40 bitcoins stolen from MtGox in 2012. The transaction was made from an IP address that was not my own.  I am from North America and the IP address that the transaction was made from was in Eastern Europe. I had sent an email to support and received an initial reply but no satisfactory follow up was made. At the time I chose not to pursue the matter further given the relatively low value of bitcoin. I was also disappointed in your system that sent me an email saying that a transaction was done from an IP that was not my own but that gave me know recourse and that did not make the site more secure.  A good security system would have blocked the transaction coming form a strange IP address until some sort of confirmation could be made.I had given up hope of getting my coins back when I heard of the MtGox bankruptcy.  Now however I wonder if there is a chance of reopening the investigation into my stolen coins and if I can be considered a creditor that is owed money by MtGox.  If you require more information I can send them to you by PM or email.  Thank you.

0	1522857419	0	Wise choice that you have come to /r/btc/ instead of the other place where this whole topic could have been deleted due to a comment that you made hinting to the support for bigger blocks.

0	1522861003	1	Thief.
0	1522861212	1	I've read through most of this, and the only question I have is more of a "what if". So if it all works out that the people that held on Mt Gox get paid back in Bitcoin, would they be getting their original coins back, or would they just be given new coins? I got into the crypto game a year or two after this all happened, so I don't know if those lost coins are truely gone forever, or if they're able to be released somehow back to the rightful owners.
0	1522861541	1	Can you tell a bit about market making? Did your exchange had some partners that secured the spreads? Just curious. Would also like to hear your general opinion on algotrading.Thought about doing such things, but often I have the feeling that some players might have special deals since the spreads are sometimes so low.Thanks!!!

0	1522843924	1	What is your thoughts on the hardfork of Bitcoin?Are you in support for keeping blocksize low, making them higher or adding third party management tools like Lightning Network to *help* with transaction speed and price?
1	1522852340	2	I'm not involved enough in Bitcoin anymore to have an informed opinion on this.
0	1522846271	1	Are you willing to share the exchange source code? 
1	1522852392	2	It's not up to me to decide since the code IP (or part of it) belongs to MtGox.
2	1522854583	1	Thanks for dropping by and answering questions for us Mark.
0	1522845461	1	As i've only came into the cryptocurrency ecosystem in the past several months, I have only learned about you what others are saying. I had an image that you were an asshole and conspiracy theories as to who the hackers of MtGox here, which darkened the judgement even moreYou seem fairly devoted to saying sorry and fixing whatever damage you canI hope it all goes well for you...
1	1522852454	2	Thank you. I don't know how far it'll work, but I do know that not trying means it'll get nowhere.
0	1522845834	1	Hi Mark and all the best in the future! (Un)fortunately I wasn't aware of what Bitcoin is at that time :-( My question to you is - I read that Mt.Gox was created by Jed McCaleb who runs Stellar (Lumens) now. Seems like a smart guy. Have you had any discussion lately with Jed about some new projects or you don't talk to each other?
1	1522852479	2	I am currently not allowed to talk with Jed.
0	1522847912	1	Any idea of the method in which the 35000 btc were sold off and if this had any major contribution to the drop in usd price of btc since December 2017? 
1	1522852014	2	Unfortunately, no idea. I learned about this at the same time as everyone, and didn't get any more information.
0	1522851585	1	Why not make a crypto fund of 160,000 btc for the crypto world and related philantropic endavours in the sense of pineapple fund etc. Could make a big difference and make a good name for crypto. 
1	1522854415	2	I do not think MtGox creditors would agree with that.
2	1522854487	0	They don't have a say in this though. They have no legal right to claim anymore than the value at the time.
0	1522851648	1	I missed my date to apply for my refund, is there anything I can do?
1	1522854443	1	Actually civil rehabilitation may be good news for you as it'll likely open a new window for filing claims. I'd suggest keeping up with updates on mtgox.com.
0	1522851981	1	What is your opinion on identity on the blockchain and related protocols like BitID and BitAuth?What is your opinion on the UI/UX of blockchain related software now, compared to back then?
1	1522854509	1	Identity on the blockchain can be interesting, however I fear it may be difficult to scale. UI/UX of software has improved a lot, including by adding failsafes and making everything easier. I like how some people also implemented custom address format with detection of where input errors are/etc.
0	1522852142	1	Heyyas Tux. We chatted a bit on irc back in the day, around $30/btc. With hindsight, do you think you and your engineering team we're up to running an exchange as large as Gox? Have you come across any consultants that you wish you had access to back then?
1	1522854559	2	The engineering team was lacking, but what it was lacking most was my attention, as I had too many issues to deal with.
2	1522855688	1	That's fair. I'd be interested in reading an article about the lessons you learned trying to scale. I think you'd have a unique perspective on it. I hope you find the time to do something like that. Once you clear the current legal challenges, of course. Good luck duder.

0	1522840268	-4	Hi Mark1 During the heydey of Mt Gox you were the most popular bitcoin exchange. A lot of child traffickers who accepted bitcoin via pedophiles using backpage.com would have laundered some of their ill gotten gains on your exchange. Did you help authorities identify and arrest these sick people?2 It's impossible for a gaijin like you to do millions of dollars worth of business in Japan without regularly paying the Yakuza. How much were these payments worth and did you ever suspect that the stolen coins, which you covered up for months, involved organized crime?3 Did you create Willy Bot to artificially pump Bitcoin?
0	1522854696	-1	How does it feel to be a scumbag?Also, how does it feel knowing how many people you fucked over?Do you believe in Karma?edit: You said this further down "If I can be useful to anyone, I'd be happy to help."You can be useful to me. Give me my 84 BTC back.
1	1522856105	0	Japanese law dictates that you will get 400 bucks for each bitcoin which is what they were worth when bankruptcy took place.So STFU.
2	1522856326	1	Ok, so give me my $33,600 then. Thanks.
0	1522855033	0	If only you'd had managed to stay in business you'll be a mega brand now. How much did you pay for the exchange and how did you make that money in the first place? I'm just curious.By the way https://www.dropbox.com/s/rzu028n2pm8qkr4/IMG_7472.jpeg?dl=0Donations appreciated bitcoincash:qzh8mml89uddjemj8rgkwckxaaylvrajvv4q5jwft2
0	1522846324	-2	Keep 5% of the coins. You did a lot of good with the bad.
0	1522835063	-1	When lambo?
0	1522846101	-1	I lost 10 bucks when you went down can I get that back? 
1	1522852514	2	Did you file a claim? The bankruptcy should be able to return most of your cash assets.
2	1522852631	1	Nope. But it was in Bitcoin. I would like to thank you for making such an easy exchange that allowed me to use it without jumping through a crapton of hoops and your exchange was awesome. Thanks!
0	1522837121	-59	You're a douchebag and you are with Roger Ver in this. You are the one that has caused Bitcoin to crash and you are the reason that BCash exists. BCash wouldn't exist and Bitcoin would be $100,000 if you weren't an idiot. I'm sure you and your friends have stolen it then decided to keep it quietly and distribute it over the years. You are a FRAUD just like everyone in BCash. Roger checkCSW checkrawb0t checkJohn McAfee check
1	1522838523	21	BCH exists because of frauds that took over bitcoin's development, nothing to do with Gox.
1	1522837127	19	Redditor /u/EIectronBoner has low karma in this subreddit.

0	1522845556	-2	Could you try to ask satoshi if he would donate his coins to the creditors? Satoshi would benefit as he isnt a target anymore if he has nothing left. Also all the rumors would finally stop and the coins are finally distributed. I think he never wanted to get rich.maybe you try to contact satoshi or ask nick szabo to help you
1	1522846780	1	If Satoshi sent 0.001 bitcoins from his wallet, wouldn't it mega-crash Bitcoin for a little bit, because it would increase the circulating supply by 1,000,000?
2	1522846883	0	Whats the problem if it crashes? We dont think in us dollars but in bitcoins;)
3	1522846948	1	You're right, I'm sorry. 1D=1D
