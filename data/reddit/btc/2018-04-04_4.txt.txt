0	1522794213	80	I actually don't think about him at any point in time. If he makes something cool, awesome, I might use it. If not, sure, no worries.
0	1522788510	97	THIS SO MUCHI don't care about CSW enough to see more than 1 post about him MAX on the front page. This is getting ridiculous. Looks like a coordinated social attack to me.
1	1522797095	-29	[removed]
2	1522797555	21	Roger Ver never said that. Stop propagating lies.
3	1522805982	-22	My post was deleted. But you have to admit, this [picture](https://i.redd.it/4ldo01roplsz.jpg) is pretty embarrassing to BCH right now. It seems like this sub might have been on the wrong side of history again.
4	1522806054	14	What, they aren't allowed to have a glass of wine together? Who the fuck cares?
5	1522806585	-12	That’s a good point though. Seems like they might have just bumped into each other while they were both having a glass of wine.
4	1522825993	3	Wow big deal! /s
4	1522842571	2	1) Again? LOL2) Why is that embarrassing to BCH? If you insist on focusing on personalities - Is it more embarrassing than having people like Samson Mow representing Blockstream and hence Core? Or what about Luke Dashr? There are plenty of controversial people in crypto in general. At least, _unlike_ BTC with only one dev team (Bitcoin Core), BCH is not defined and controlled by a few individuals and a single team. 
2	1522797337	27	>Ver’s been saying Craig is Satoshi for a while nowSource?
3	1522797629	39	there's no source, its an "discredit by association" tactic ;)what you do is link the person you're trying to discredit to someone who is "allegedly" already discredited with some :handwave: :magicmagic: (*ver's not saying he's satoshi*) and voila, to those without critical thought the initial person has suddenly become suspect:eyes:**edit:** ohh look, see, the comment above trying the tactic i mentioned was deleted :magicmagic: :light:
3	1522798652	1	While Roger hasn’t been saying Craig is Satoshi as OP falsely claimed, he has posted multiple comments like this, which imply some belief of legitimacy.  https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/87213o/comment/dw9srra
4	1522800614	10	So no...he may be questioning whether he is or not, showing some evidence for the pro side.If he honestly believed he was Satoshi, he would simply come out and say it. It isn't as if he has problems taking controversial stands.
2	1522797112	16	Redditor /u/Spartacus_Nakamoto has low karma in this subreddit.

1	1522790529	-29	why are you tipping his silly post?some people like CSW because he does have a career in computer tech and was involved with bitcoin from early on. Not everything he says is wrong, and there is some stuff of value there.but most people dislike him for being caught in lies, a long record of fraud and misrepresentation, and the fact he claimed to be satoshi and couldnt back it up with a single shred of cryptographic proof (such as signing a statement with one of satoshi's keys)
2	1522790645	53	Because I felt like it, and because that's the joy of bch. I can spend my money however I damn well please.

2	1522803429	6	>why are you tipping his silly post?Cuz he can
2	1522807867	2	My money is still on him losing the keys. Failed HDD no backup or something.
3	1522840012	1	Of any and all forms of proof he could have? Doubtful that not a single key was backed up someplace, or he can't get some other valid evidence that didn't require a closed door meeting.I honestly think the satoshi announcement was an attention grab for money. He is a candidate for satoshi, but there are far more compelling alternatives such as Hal Finney  (or another name or two I forget), and there's more proof against CSW than there is for him
2	1522791149	7	My particular problem with him is that he is a computer science illiterate who passes as an "expert", and many fall for his technobabble.
3	1522791869	4	yeah, i hate people like that in every discipline.i just dont advocate jumping on a hat train, since its never productive and the person you're disregarding as worthless typically got into the spotlight by demonstrating *some* extent of worth and knowledge.be it CSW, luke-jr, ver, or any other publicly-reviled character - they can be 95% bullshit but that remaining 5% can be worthwhilejust my 2c about tolerance

4	1522793343	1	In all honesty I seen a lot of posers in tech who are only there because they are "friends of" and completely useless
3	1522823844	1	Can a computer science illiterate author something like [this](https://coingeek.com/app/uploads/2018/03/SSRN-id3147440.pdf)?Just pasting the last two paragraphs below:*In this paper, we have demonstrated that bitcoin’s 2PDA  is  capable  of  computing  any  value  that  is computable  in  a  system  compatible  with that of Godel’s  logic  system.  Consequently,  we  have demonstrated  that  bitcoin  script  language  is  Turing  complete.  The  relative  power  and  functional implementation of a problem using bitcoin script is a separate issue. In a paper to follow this one, we shall extend Godel’s predicate system using bitcoin script operations. In being able to compile a script in bitcoin language, we have a system that always works within a defined bound. A deterministic and matched nondeterministic optimisation problem can be created within such bounds.**The richness and power of bitcoin scripting language has been overlooked due to the complexity of the system.  In  this  paper  we  have  demonstrated the  true  power  of  the  system  and  how  a  complete implementation can create a script of a determined length and known maximum processing difficulty.*As a computer science literate, you will surely be able to show where the paper goes wrong. Don't attack the man, but the message..
4	1522827568	1	That is precisely the document that made me conclude he is a CS illiterate. Quote:> Consequently, we have demonstrated that bitcoin script language is Turing complete.False. It is a homework level demonstration to prove otherwise. Quoting myself:> Proof: Assume, by contradiction, Bitcoin script to be Turing complete. Take a Turing Machine that never halts and encode it in Bitcoin script (which should be possible because, because we assumed it to be Turing complete). Since the Bitcoin script will always halt, the encoded Turing Machine must halt, too. But that Turing Machine never halts! Contradiction! Thus, we know Bitcoin script can't encode that particular Turing Machine, so it can't possibly be Turing Complete.If you take that the major conclusion of the paper is plainly and obviously wrong, you can imagine it is not hard to find wrong claims throughout the text that enabled a wrong conclusion.The major error is to assume a TM must have an infinite tape in order to execute indefinitely. That is wrong, a finite TM with a finite tape can run forever (and that is why it is so obvious Bitcoin script is not TC).A few other examples:> only decidable programs are known to run to completion on a Turing complete systemFalse, because an undecidable program (I am assuming he means by this a TM attempting to solve an undecidable problem, because he made up that concept and failed to define it) might stop on particular instances of the input, even if it may not stop on others.He repeats the same wrong thing a few paragraphs below, with a more convoluted wording:> The set of programs that run on a Turing machine and halt that are not decidable is a NULL set.He also makes a laughable attempt at showing that Turing's original tape was finite, as if Turing himself hasn't demonstrated is is impossible to know if a TM will ever stop, thus he (wrongly) concludes:> The process have to halt if the system is Turing complete.Which is amazing, because to be Turing complete means to be equivalent to a TM in what it is able to to, and he said himself that we can't know for sure if a TM will ever stop.At least I must give him credit for the creative use of the proper jargon, giving credibility to the technobabble, and for citing some some of the most fundamental works on the field, which are the references for theory of computation textbooks, even if he completelly fails to understand contents of those works.
5	1522830438	1	> Proof: Assume, by contradiction, Bitcoin script to be Turing complete.

Since the Bitcoin script will always halt, the encoded Turing Machine must halt, too. But that Turing Machine never halts! Contradiction! Thus, we know Bitcoin script can't encode that particular Turing Machine, so it can't possibly be Turing Complete.How does Bitcoin script always halt and how is halting a problem? Isn't a TM supposed to be able to simulate the logic of an algorithm? How are the physical attributes of the machine related to this at all? It seems to me like you're trying to redefine what a TM is. I mean, take a TM that outputs bananas. No known programming language can output bananas, thus Turing completeness is impossible. C'mon now..> The major error is to assume a TM must have an infinite tape in order to execute indefinitely. That is wrong, a finite TM with a finite tape can run forever (and that is why it is so obvious Bitcoin script is not TC).Take your never halting TM, e.g. one that calculates all the digits of pi. How is it going to get by with a finite tape?
6	1522843580	2	Nice attempt at deflection.Let's reframe your question more to the point. Given your beliefs about TMs (i.e. that they must NOT have finite tapes), does Bitcoin script have an infinite tape?Bitcoin script cannot loop. Hence it is finite.So by your own (faulty) model, bitcoin is not TC.And by /u/lcvella's correctly formulated contradiction, bitcoin is not TC.So please tell me how bitcoin is TC.
7	1522844663	1	Does Craig not define in the paper the recursive system that exists within bitcoin script? Is that not the same than loops? All the stuff about halting and finite/infinite tapes is addressed in the paper too. I only have a CS minor and very little interest in trying to comprehend the paper fully. I'm not trying to deflect anything. I asked lcvella to address where the paper goes wrong. As far as I can tell, he hasn't been able to show that and neither have you.
8	1522852127	2	> As far as I can tell, he hasn't been able to show that and neither have youTherefore CSW must be correct, because *handwaving*You know where he goes wrong? Exactly where he goes wrong? Where he claims bitcoin script is recursive. It isn't.> very little interest in trying to comprehend the paper fullyAnd yet you insist our interpretation is wrong.
6	1522860540	1	> How does Bitcoin script always halt [...]Bitcoin script always halt by design, because we don't want a node to get stuck processing a transaction forever. If someone manages to place script that never halts inside a transaction, it will DoS every node that tries to validate that transaction.>  and how is halting a problem?It is a problem because by definition, a Turing complete system must be able to do everything a Turing machine does, and Turing machines can run forever (even with finite tape), thus a system that always halt can't be TC.> Isn't a TM supposed to be able to simulate the logic of an algorithm?It is much stronger than that: Turing machine is the very formal definition of an algorithm. People had the notion of algorithm since much earlier in mathematics (the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) is an ancient algorithm, for instance), but the notion was only been formalized by Church and Turing in the 20th century.> How are the physical attributes of the machine related to this at all?Don't understand, TC's are not physical, they are a mathematical concept. Every TM must be able to be encoded in every TC system, by definition of what a TC system is.> It seems to me like you're trying to redefine what a TM is. I mean, take a TM that outputs bananas. No known programming language can output bananas, thus Turing completeness is impossible.I said a machine that never stops. TM's may not be able to output bananas, but there are a infinite number of TM's that never stops (and CSW said as much as himself in the paper). Take the following code in Python (which is TC):    while True: passthis code is perfectly finite (18 characters), uses a finite amount of tape, and never halts.> Take your never halting TM, e.g. one that calculates all the digits of pi. How is it going to get by with a finite tape?Just because your example of TM does need infinite tape (it does, for the digits of pi are not periodic), doesn't mean there aren't non-halting TMs that works with finite tapes (like my Python code above). But tape size is irrelevant: neither my example or yours can be encoded in Bitcoin script, while every TC system can be programmed to calculate all digits of pi, and that program takes a finite amount of code.
0	1522786431	37	> attack on the BTC sub itselfWouldn't be nearly the first time, certainly wouldn't be the last either.
1	1522807429	-13	“Also, the earth is actually flat.” - /r/BTC probably
2	1522808000	7	Man, you're really angry about something.
3	1522860076	1	Of course I am! I sold all my actual bitcoin for BCH!
2	1522810668	3	Funny because that is actually luke-jr's thing...
3	1522825214	1	hahaha that's true, great point.
3	1522842428	1	No, it's not. This is a lie repeated about Luke-Jr in this subreddit very often, even though he has never claimed such a thing. Geocentrism (arguing "the Sun revolves around the Earth") is not the same argument that "the Earth is flat", **at all**.In this subreddit, when I point out that this is a lie and then explain the truth, I am always downvoted, while the liar I am responding to always seems to be upvoted.
4	1522845526	1	Like it is any less stupid? 
5	1522847497	1	Regardless of whether the two stances are "equally stupid", the claim that you made above is totally false. It was a lie.
6	1522847694	1	Cool story, bro.
0	1522796250	11	Just stop posting about him until (unlikely) he does something useful other than empty promises.
1	1522826451	5	As one of his detractors I would fully support this notion. The day people post about something Craig or nChain has *actually* produced I will be happy to stay quiet.
0	1522790158	18	Stick together team!
1	1522795719	12	Actually, I must disagree, but I think the disagreement is healthy to conversation and improvement. If something is wrong, we should discuss it. I'm not promoting trash talk... discussion!
2	1522798063	16	Agreed! I like when people post intelligent critiques of CSW even when I know he has something right. It's a chance to learn. 
3	1522803921	2	r/Outoftheloop ... what up?
2	1522796038	4	It should be discussed critically, respectfully, with good intentions and while sticking together. 
2	1522826104	2	Spot on!This should be top comment.
1	1522799259	-1	There's people on this thread & sub tipping in USD. Hopeless
0	1522794126	15	That is what I was thinking. Witnessed now people justifying themselves with Ricks video - which they see as confirmation/call-to-action to go on a witchhunt. Whereas Rick said during this video it is definitely NOT pointing anyone out - which he then reconfirmed in the comment section of the video -- after people losing their minds there already.Since that video came out the situation has escalated and became a general annoyance.The agenda to create an artificial problem/ threat/danger/FUD around CSW is a win-win situation for malicious forces of any kind.I take all arguments of witch hunters with a grain of salt now. Very disturbing what is going on within bitcoin.
1	1522797231	3	I had a lot of respect for Rick but now I'm just not sure what was the goal of his video. If he knew some specific details regarding CSW he could've said that in a constructive way and it would be fine.The way he actually went about this seems pathetic.
2	1522798506	9	Can't blame Rick here. It was a general video. 
3	1522798846	0	It was not. It was made to appear like it was a general video but it also was made so that even low IQ viewers could connect the dots. I'm referring to remarks about doctor degrees and one of them being in Christianity studies or something like that.
2	1522797419	-6	Rick is with Peter and Emin. Trolls.
0	1522802501	8	Wouldn't it be something if Craig was secretly a Core/nocoin actor?
1	1522824402	-5	How about this: Peter and Emin were compromised. They're now BlockStream agents..
1	1522809422	-5	They planted him here to make the bcash community look like a hellscape. 
0	1522808630	7	I can practically guarantee that's a bunch of shills/bots specifically with the goal of doing exactly that. They're all "new" users to me (no tags or upvotes/downvotes in RES).
0	1522787530	34	Core shills are pushing this. Posts get upvoted by bots.
1	1522825558	4	Hi I'm neither a shill nor a bot I've been banned in the past from r bitcoin for pushing for a blocksize increase and yet I think this CSW fraud is hurting BCH and that's why I upvoted this thread.
1	1522794224	3	This ^
1	1522794457	4	You mean anything about him is upvoted because he is a divisive figure, regardless of his true motivations?
1	1522839537	1	I'm not a bot.
0	1522796320	11	The creator of the 2nd largest crypto calls out a well known name in another, that is huge news and worth discussing. Regardless of the truth it is entertaining to me. BCH will survive.
0	1522796820	13	CSW is CSW.  He's got some good ideas.  He's got some bad ideas (intellectual property, and Bitcoin not smashing the state).  He hasn't proved he's Satoshi.  Life goes on, and Bitcoin Cash is fantastic.
0	1522790049	3	Agreed. I don't know about you, but I guess it's time for me to retreat until all this subsides. I just hope I won't return to find a community much different than the one I know and love.
0	1522809365	3	I completely agree.Not every whisper from CSW or Peter needs to be amplified on here.
0	1522789284	8	It's been unbearable for awhile now...
0	1522792792	10	There was previously a series of attacks on this sub by CSW, using tactics that are identical to Core. This is the natural reaction to that.Relax, breathe, and it'll pass.
1	1522797018	7	Agreed. I have seen an increase of people blindly singing his praises over the last year and it looks almost entirely manufactured. They say “judge him by his ideas, not his past,” so I’m happy that he has *finally* put forth some ideas and that they are being vetted by crypto-academics. If his ideas don’t have merit, combined with his past I think we can dismiss him as someone who is just eager to misappropriate attention towards himself.
2	1522799751	6	I'm one of those people that say to judge the idea, not the man.  What do you have to lose?  If it's a good idea, awesome; if it's bad, then dismiss it.I'll even listen to someone like LukeJR, or Adam Back if they have something interesting to say.  You don't have to agree with them, and perhaps you will see something from a different perspective.This community must be open and inclusive.  We must not filter ideas based on who submits them.  Ideas stand or fall on their own merit.I wonder what would happen if we removed ALL names from this sub.  Usernames hidden, and names are removed from comments.  No names = no namecalling = focus on the issues.tl;dr  I'm sick of the fucking namecalling no matter who is the target.
3	1522826815	0	> I'm one of those people that say to judge the idea, not the man. What do you have to lose?When people say this I wonder how they can be unfamiliar with the concept of con-artistry. Step one of any con is just to get an audience with the target. Beyond that point convincing people that you are onto something cool, and they are really smart and special for recognising the opportunity; that’s the easy bit.The single best way to avoid getting conned is to avoid any contact with people who you already know are dishonest. 
1	1522835752	1	The more CSW is involved in Bitcoin Cash, the better for Core. So on their sub they ridicule him on ours they praise him. 
0	1522793969	4	Oh well. We'll have to use our minds, and our hearts, with the power of reason.
0	1522800212	2	I agree with OP.
0	1522809319	2	I sent you a tip of 0.00029001 BCH ($0.20 USD) with [BCH Tips](/r/bchtips)!
0	1522828571	2	What about the constant stream of posts complaining about the posts that take sides on different topics :-D
1	1522835625	1	Touche!  I had to take a really long pause to think twice before submitting this one.  :-)
0	1522792229	6	He really screwed up making pretend he was/is Satoshi.  Really sad.  If he was concerned he would just prove it.  Getting Gavin to retire was a low move, something only a low life could come up with.  Oh yea, central banking.  
0	1522794722	2	This must be more a twitter thing.  If you filter out Twitter links with RES you don't get to witness the petty drama play out as much.
1	1522798283	7	Segregating the posts to witness the sub... there's a segwit joke in there somewhere
0	1522803500	2	Lots of posts about CW drama on here and 4 different reposts on it on r/cryptocurrency. Didn't see the samson  ver debate on r/cryptocurrency. 
0	1522812738	2	> I'm starting to think it's an attack on the btc sub itself by making it unbearable to actually read.Communists wreck communities by wearing masks and making false accusations and demanding the removal of certain people.
0	1522788518	1	First: He should never have said he was Satoshi. (I still don't understand to this day why he did this)Second : He should give us more subtle clue that he's really SatoshiThird : Time will tell
1	1522789812	11	We are far beyond the point if he is or is not Satoshi: we are struggling with the fact that a computer science illiterate is passing as an "expert" in the field, gathering followers, attaining leadership status inside Bitcoin Cash community and spreading nonsense any minimally competent programmer can see right trough, tarnishing Bitcoin Cash reputation by association inside one of the main public for cryptocurrencies: the computer geeks.I have close friends, graduated computer science MSc from the same university as me, who dismissed Bitcoin Cash as scam on a first look at /r/btc because of CSW bullshit were all over front page. It is costly and painful to recover from hits like this.
2	1522798806	2	>I have close friends, graduated computer science MSc from the same university as me, who dismissed Bitcoin Cash as scam on a first look at /r/btc because of CSW bullshit were all over front page. It is costly and painful to recover from hits like this.This makes no sense. In what way is CSW, any sort of authority over BCH? Having a CS degree makes you qualified to determine how important or unimportant someone is? He's literally just some guy with opinions and a platform. Show me one git commit by CSW to BCH and I'll change my tune, but at this point he is so unimportant that I could care less about any of his opinions. Explain to me as a BCH owner why I should give a damn one way or the other about this guy?
3	1522800116	2	Because how the public views the folks it associates with a crypto, rightfully or not, is often the determining factor of whether they invest in said crypto. And CWS’ recent communication has certainly made him a more controversial figure; which is causing some to wonder what is his value to the cause from a pr perspective?
3	1522800513	2	If commits had any correlation to the influence of the person on the community, Mike Hearn and Gavin Andersen would be Bitcoin Core heroes.You make it seem, as a BCH owner, you should only care about people actually contributing to BCH (which CSW does not). But you should also care about people harming it, too, specially if it is for personal gains, as CSW does.And explaining how he affects you, as a BCH owner, your money value is based on its acceptance and adoption. If CSW manages to tarnish Bitcoin Cash reputation within one of the most important crypto audience, he harms your money value.
4	1522804761	1	I guess we are just very different people then, because yes, I do think Gavin and Mike were critical parts of BTC getting as far as it has. I also think that when it comes to open source, contributed code is the only thing that matters.There is a fairy well know saying:Cypherpunks write code.https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Crypto/Crypto_misc/cypherpunk.manifesto>Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all to use, worldwide. We don't much care if you don't approve of the software we write. We know that software can't be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.
1	1522789090	-4	> First: He should never have said he was Satoshi. (I still don't understand to this day why he did this)Lol so you never even watched the footage? Crazy people have so many opinions yet so little information. 
2	1522789608	3	give me link to the footage
3	1522789970	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DCAC1j2HTYPay attention starting 0:50And then again starting 3:50
4	1522790626	6	I have already seen this footage over and over. What I wonder if I take a look at 3:50. He says: "There are people who have decided for me." Who decided for him exactly when he was unknown ? What does that mean ? 
5	1522795239	-1	> Who decided for him exactly when he was unknown ? What does that mean ?It's clearly just the vagary of a bullshitter. If queried on it he'd probably say he couldn't talk about it or respond [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6qPo1zzU7s).
0	1522791838	2	Well CSW is very loud. That's for certain.
0	1522790204	3	I don't know about what the "other side" is thinking but IMHO, CSW is toxic and needs to be gotten rid of. He is giving BCH a bad name and the longer he is around the more damage he does. 
1	1522791140	2	> CSW is toxic and needs to be gotten rid of.what do you propose?
2	1522791360	4	Replace him with a machine. 
3	1522792790	1	That'll never fool anyone! Even a stopped clock is right twice a day. It'd be a dead giveaway.
0	1522792273	1	It was about time.
0	1522804759	1	what is csw?
0	1522807122	1	he's a polarizing guy, not intentionally i dont think.
0	1522807786	1	CSW?
0	1522808593	1	This question of mental health was briefly a troll talking point last week (or two weeks ago?). In and amongst the suspiciously upvoted sh*tposts, the community needs to continue to help "curate" the content of the top posts.
0	1522815480	1	I think it must be, I haven't heard CSW mentioned for months on any other crypto subreddit until a few hours ago because of Vitalik
0	1522825854	1	This is what you woumd expect for a place with free speech.If CSW bother you (lole for me) just downvote and move on.
0	1522843516	1	Trolls trying to "Divide and Conquer". Let us show people that the BCH community is stronger than that and focused on results, where big egos are not heralded as leaders but simply as contributors - if they contribute. 
0	1522844625	1	Bcash fanboys have no idea how to act about this. On one hand Scamtoshi (CSW) promotes bcash so he's inherently a god in this sub, on the other hand the guy is a scamming piece of shit but so is roger ver and jihan wu... so I guess that doesn't qualify as a negative in this sub lmao.
0	1522846341	1	It's needless to say whether CSW is SN or not is irrelevant to bch at this point (tip: he isn't), but I can understand why people like to post about him - without him there'd be no drama here. He's like the court's jester for some providing the gap from no memes and no famous faces.
0	1522855123	1	OP is right, there are too many upvoted posts about CSW, so therefore I upvoted OP's post about there being too many upvoted posts about CSW. Job done!
0	1522861557	1	What is CSW?I only poke in here now and then, unsubbed from r/bitcoin a while ago for obvious reasons.
0	1522791667	1	One CSW shilling post per week one way or another is enough. It's just spam at this point.
0	1522796467	1	Yes I think so
0	1522798814	1	I don't know who CSW is and at this point I'm too afraid to ask
1	1522799093	2	Don't bother. He's just some guy who talks big and is trying to be associated with BCH. Honestly I think we're better off ignoring him.
1	1522804457	2	Craig Wrighthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Steven_WrightI think he once claimed he was Satoshi Nakamoto and it was easily proven that he wasn't
0	1522805256	1	Buy the fraud, sell the great??
0	1522817202	1	I support BCH, but if you think Craight is Satoshi you are deluded.
0	1522811986	0	I was disgusted by Vitalik's attack towards Craig Wright. Does not matter what you think of the person but public-shaming someone like this without giving a chance to response was very childish and uncalled for.
0	1522791447	-7	we trust VB more than CSWsimplebitcoin cash been going down ever since craig been a voice in it
1	1522792404	3	love to see your personal rebuttal of any proposition. go for it.
0	1522799322	-3	Let's play a game called What's Worse.... Claiming to be Satoshi? OrReading from a cue card like some kind of prisoner of war "Mt. Gox is Solvent"?
1	1522803416	0	lmao
2	1522803424	2	Redditor /u/kingp43x has low karma in this subreddit.
0	1522804100	0	Agree. This sub had good intentions but has become an intolerable echo chamber of vested interests where many common posters are also noobs with limited perspective who aggressively defend their extremist views. I’ve unsubscribed, this shit got boring and is going nowhere. 
0	1522805879	-4	Craig is a fraud and Bcash is a scam
1	1522806869	2	Cool story bro.
1	1522823932	1	Lol
0	1522800210	0	But CSW is simultaneously the greatest thing ever as well as the greatest scam ever. The best of both worlds 
0	1522818568	0	If you dont like it, dont read it.
