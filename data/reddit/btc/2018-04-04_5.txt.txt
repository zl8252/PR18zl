0	1522780272	27	Could anybody here who understands both papers, the Selfish Mining from Ittay and Sirer, and the one CSW wrote which is supposed to refute it explain like I'm 5 what the thing is really about?I actually read both papers, but I don't have the knowledge needed to get what's actually going on. I need some help to understand it.
1	1522780726	12	Selfish mining shows 2 things:* It can in theory be profitable not to publish a newly mined block immediately* Even with < 50% hash power can it be profitable to orphan other miner's blocks on purposeYou still need a lot of hash power, and before you can make a profit, you will incur a loss, so the "attack" is not practical. But the math does work out in theory. Somehow this makes some people very angry (or pretend to be angry), including CSW. CSW's paper is a combination of pure nonsense and some incorrect and some obvious math.
2	1522788411	17	Could you point out where the nonsense and the incorrect math is?I know it takes time to actually quote paragraphs and so on, but I really cannot read it on my own. I tried and I didn't understand it. Math was never my strengh.For your trouble u/tippr $1
3	1522789772	4	Thanks for the tip! Have you seen Peter Rizun's review?https://bitco.in/forum/threads/wright-or-wrong-lets-read-craig-wrights-selfish-miner-fallacy-paper-together-and-find-out.2426/
4	1522790442	12	I did read that thread, but my understanding is that at that time CSW was working on a paper that he finally canceled and now he issued a new one.Did you see the new one?Peter said the old one was technobabble, and he did a thorough review, but I haven't seen the same for the new one. Didn't CSW change things there?Maybe he made some corrections...https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3004026
5	1522790705	3	I saw that he fixed the offsets in the diagram but other nonsense from the review seems to be still there.
6	1522803697	11	Calling something nonsense is not an argument
7	1522818557	13	The whole point of this comment thread is that Peter Rizun critiqued a previous version of the paper, and that, regardless of whether or not you refer to it as nonsense, most of the paper has stayed to same. So the argument is in Peter Rizun's response. You can call out dskloet for needlessly calling it nonsense, but it's not like he was using that as his argument.
8	1522819639	3	Thanks for the elaboration
6	1522806657	2	Still waiting for actual facts.  kthx.  
7	1522818625	4	As I mentioned in another comment, the whole point of this comment thread is that Peter Rizun critiqued a previous version of the paper, and that most of the paper has stayed to same. So the facts are in Peter Rizun's critique. Did you read Peter Rizun's critique?
8	1522818882	2	Also, the content is so nonsensical that it doesn't really matter what version it is. It's not like small mistakes that are easily fixed. You can't excuse nonsense technobable by saying it was a draft.
3	1522788424	1	u/dskloet, you've received `0.00140738 BCH ($1 USD)`!***[^^How to use](https://np.reddit.com/r/tippr/wiki/index) ^^| [^^What is Bitcoin Cash?](https://learnbitcoin.cash/) ^^| [^^Who accepts it?](https://acceptbitcoin.cash) ^^| ^^Powered ^^by ^^[Rocketr](https://rocketr.net) ^^| ^^r/tippr  ^(Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin should be.

2	1522786048	12	Either it’s profitable and worth it or it’s not. It can’t make sense in theory but not in practice. Then there is something missing to the equation.
3	1522809494	6	If it was truly this profitable wouldn't miners be doing this now...?It's been 5 years....
4	1522818974	5	Many people are, as far as I can tell, correct in asserting that miners are unlikely to perform these attacks because it would destroy the value of the currency that they're mining, and so would destroy their profits.It's important to note, however, that we used to assume that for someone to attack bitcoin they would need more than 50% of the hashrate. The selfish mining paper shows that someone could attack Bitcoin with 33% of the hashrate and seriously disrupt the network. The smaller the hashrate required to successfully attack the network, the more vulnerable Bitcoin is to an attack from, say, a government who has run out of other options for stopping Bitcoin but still has a lot of fiat to throw around.
5	1522819406	2	Assuming this is true, under these conditions, its more profitable to be an honest miner than a destructive one. Sounds like its not a big threat unless bitcoin already has crashed to an irrelevant price and 33% hashrate can be attained by someone who is not looking to make a sustainable profit - just destroy bitcoin. The price would have to be quite low for that - again assuming this is correct. Governments have plenty of much easier options for stopping the usage of bitcoin.
6	1522821325	1	>Assuming this is true, under these conditions, its more profitable to be an honest miner than a destructive one.Yes, so we're probably safe from attacks by existing hashpower as long as their motive remains profit. One of those ways which a Government might try to stop Bitcoin, though, is by covertly taking control of a large amount of existing hashpower. I don't know how likely it is, but it's worth being aware of the possibility.
3	1522786236	1	What about a 51% attack?
4	1522786754	5	hint: read the SM abstract 2nd hint: "revenue"(this is only 1 of the problems)
2	1522802315	6	> CSW's paper is a combination of pure nonsense and some incorrect and some obvious math.Have you ever read this [medium post](https://medium.com/@ProfFaustus/poisson-processes-201d9d14c038)? I'm not certain it was posted around here... I guess u/Contrarian__ could learn some math too
3	1522819902	2	> however, if the HM finds a block, the SM process restarts immediatelyThat's a giant red flag because mining "restarts" after every hash, regardless of what any other miner does or doesn't do.Is that anything specific in that post you think is worthwhile?
4	1522832577	1	Craig phrases things atrociously. If there's one thing we all know, it is this. That's why the game of reading into single statements he makes without looking at his whole argument is getting old. 
4	1522823068	1	Just the fact that it's 3 days old and, 8 months later, He still doesn't get it. Usually His writing is more convoluted to hide the nonsense of the thought process, but this one is *surprisingly* clear and no less distorted than all the rest. "there is no mercy when fighting cancer." huh
5	1522826474	2	Is Marlow CSW?
6	1522832391	3	Yes, almost certainly. ProfFaustus -> Marlow wrote Faust. Atlas Shrugged avatar, makes same points, etc.
3	1522803667	2	The bet states that no block is found before t=0. This ‘explanation’ ignores that. 
4	1522804556	2	Shouldn't you be debating /u/geekmonk on youtube?
4	1522804929	0	> The initial time for the system is t=-10. This is defined from the *last discovery* (of an event being a block issue). [...] As such, we know that the HM finds blocks from t=-10 and has no time event at t=0Oh he considered that and still tortured the "result" in his favor. How can anyone believe this guy regarding the SM strategy math?
5	1522805333	-4	So sorry, thought you were a True Believer for a second. Sometimes I don't pay enough attention to usernames. 
2	1522802835	3	That's incorrect.  It works out in "theory" if the Bitcoin network is a mesh network.  Craig has shown that Bitcoin is not a mesh network and therefore Sirer's theory doesn't hold.  
3	1522819421	2	Are you referring to the selfish miner trying to share his block faster than the honest miners? That's not at all necessary for the math to work.
3	1522839853	1	The selfish mining is even more profitable, if the selfish miner wins the race, when both publish their blocks at roughly the same time, but it's not necessary for the selfish mining strategy to be profitable in general.
2	1522783744	2	> You still need a lot of hash power, and **before you can make a profit, you will incur a loss,**This is true, but in the case of BCH, you only lose for less than a day before you become profitable if you have > 42% of the hashrate. In BTC, you have to lose for weeks, at least. 
3	1522798484	7	It's not practical because other miners will respond to the SM strategy being employed by also employing a SM strategy, meaning everybody is just hurting themselves. Your modeling does not take this into account. I detailed this here:https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88irk1/the_selfish_mining_debate_toxic_and_unnecessary/You actually responded to the thread contrarian but didn't address this point at all.
4	1522800883	3	I agree. A lot of these attack theories only employ micro-economics in isolation and not the macro level nash equilibrium which is exactly the effect of the competition countering competitive moves.
5	1522809556	1	I couldn't have said it better myself. Kudos for such an eloquent explanation
5	1522832768	1	Too complex for most. It's a Keynesian beauty contest, hard to come to grips with unless you have an easy familiarity with thinking in terms of incentives - which most academics don't.
4	1522800151	1	> It's not practical because other miners will respond to the SM strategy being employed by also employing a SM strategyIs this a certainty? I agree that's one *possible* result. But to say it's such a guarantee that it should be an *assumption* is not fair. And why did Craig say it would take three weeks before they started getting a profit? With BCH, you become profitable in a day.
5	1522800652	5	Bitcoin rests on the premise that miners are rational profit seeking entities, and I think it's clear that a rational profit seeking entity would do just that. I have no idea why craig thought the difficulty adjustment was 3 weeks, maybe he is thinking about BTC not BCH, maybe he just doesn't know what he's talking about. Regardless, the fact that miners are rational profit seeking is enough to guarantee that selfish mining is not a problem. This is a legitimate point made by craig. Even if plenty of his other points are bullshit, this one is not.
6	1522800867	1	>  Regardless, the fact that miners are rational profit seeking is enough to guarantee that selfish mining is not a problem.Wouldn't a majority of miners turning into selfish miners basically be a 51% attack? How would this go on long-term? I feel like that would be shooting themselves in the foot, and would potentially crash the price. That would not be rational.And even if what you're saying is true, that doesn't mean it's not an avenue for *malicious attack*, instead of *profit-driven* behavior.
7	1522802425	3	I'm not sure I follow how this would be like a 51% attack. Let's set aside changes in price for a second. Let's say there are 3 miners with 1/3 hashpower. One of them starts using a SM strategy. The other two will increase their total blocks per min in the long term (e.g. after the difficulty adjustment) by countering with a SM strategy too (run the numbers if you don't think so).Now that everybody is employing a SM strategy, the total hashpower of the network has been negatively impacted, thus impacting the overall security. This could, as you say, lead to a crash in price. But that just adds more reason for the first person who started SM to not do it in the first place! Why would they want to start this vicious cycle of everybody resorting to SM if it's going to tank the price of the thing they invested so much in mining?You are correct in stating selfish mining is prevented by profit-driven behavior. I 100% agree with that statement. I also agree it is an avenue for malicious attack against other miners and the price, but it is an attack that is ultimately profit losing.
8	1522805712	1	> Let's say there are 3 miners with 1/3 hashpower. One of them starts using a SM strategy. Since it requires a pool with greater than 1/3 hashrate, there could only be *two* SM pools at most. And it would require many different pools coming together and colluding to do so. It's not an individual strategy. > Now that everybody is employing a SM strategy, the total hashpower of the network has been negatively impacted*Much* more than just apparent hashpower would be affected if there were two selfish miners with combined hashpower over 80%.> But that just adds more reason for the first person who started SM to not do it in the first place!Don't do it because everyone else will collude to totally destroy the system? I do agree that the risk is small, but the outcomes are nowhere near obvious. 
9	1522845488	1	>Since it requires a pool with greater than 1/3 hashrate, there could only be two SM pools at most. And it would require many different pools coming together and colluding to do so. It's not an individual strategy.First, I was modeling under the (very generous) assumption that the SM would win every propagation race, meaning SM can be employed by a miner of any hashpower. Second, there is no collusion between the miners, I don't know where you get that idea. It is an individual strategy for every miner. You're totally wrong about this.>Much more than just apparent hashpower would be affected if there were two selfish miners with combined hashpower over 80%.they are not colluding.>Don't do it because everyone else will collude to totally destroy the system?Don't do it because it affects YOUR profits. Because you know the miners will react by doing SM too ultimately resulting in a loss for everybody. This is a clear cut profit driven incentive. The outcome is obvious here if miners are rational and profit seeking.
3	1522825211	1	> you only lose for less than a day before you become profitableI guess this is not true given all the sha256 capacity just waiting for an imbalance in the difficulty to jump to BCH and take the SM extra revenue. These new miners wouldn't know about all the orphaning going on, just that the difficulty is lower and that it should be profitable to mine BCH. OTOH, once HM realize the orphan rate is unbearable, they might just leave BCH and make it easier for the SM.
3	1522784095	-3	True. That still doesn't make it practical in my subjective opinion.
4	1522784228	2	Agreed. I thought it was an interesting result nonetheless. Another thing I found is that selfish mining is **never** profitable under 40% hashpower on BCH. It is on BTC, but it takes months. [Here](https://repl.it/repls/UnfinishedGigaOperation) is the code. 
5	1522786356	2	> never profitable under 40% hashpower on BCHHow can that be? Once the difficulty has adjusted, it's profitable for 34% and higher, isn't it? Then you just wait long enough until you've made up for your loss. What am I missing?
6	1522786900	3	> How can that be? Once the difficulty has adjusted, it's profitable for 34% and higher, isn't it?That's what I thought, too. I think the issue is that the BCH DAA is too erratic. Since it only measures a short block-span (144 blocks), the orphan rate (~36% at alpha=0.4) makes it jump up and down. Long-term, the average time per block is 12 minutes or so.
7	1522795766	2	How can the orphan rate matter? The DAA never sees the orphans. In steady state, how much does the difficulty vary over time?
1	1522783366	3	I did an ELI5 a while ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/Long story short, CSW is right, Peter is wrong. /u/dskloet lies when he says>Even with < 50% hash power can it be profitable to orphan other miner's blocks on purposeI have proven his math wrong. there is no way it can be profitable with <50% hashpower. Just read my post and the comments. I even discussed this with Peter and his  final reply was "I know this is hard to understand but that's how it is trust me"
2	1522796181	13	You are either CSW or his PR I assume. Every post you make is always trying to make him sound legit. Give it up, everyone here is not stupid enough to believe his bable. When you have Rizun, Emin, Vitalik, and countless others who are not the so called "Core Shills" all agreeing it is hard to deny he is a fraud. Now can we stop posting CSW threads and get back to useful things like new tech?
2	1522789881	9	Oh look, Craig's here, fighting for his reputation. Give it up nutcase, it's over, you're everyone's laughingstock, based on your ideas.
2	1522783826	4	> I have proven his math wrong. there is no way it can be profitable with <50% hashpower.False. If you have 45% of hashpower, selfish mining becomes profitable in less than one day in the BCH chain, due to the difficulty adjustment algorithm. 
3	1522784067	8	Source?
4	1522784113	5	[Here](https://repl.it/repls/UnfinishedGigaOperation). Click "run".
5	1522784275	8	Your simulation which was based on Emin's paper whose mathematical model was proven to be wrong. Moreover, your simulation is obviously flawed because it does this:[if the honest miner mines a block but it counts for the selfish miner instead] (https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/dwjvm83/)So if anything your model is proof that SM is BS.
6	1522784493	1	> if the honest miner mines a block but it counts for the selfish miner insteadYou're misreading the code. It never 'counted' for the selfish miner instead. The step is described in the paper's algorithm on page 6, line 26. Here's the authors' description:> Lead was more than 2, others win. The others decrease the lead, whichremains at least two. The new block (say with number i) will end outsidethe chain once the pool publishes its entire branch, therefore the othersobtain nothing. However, the pool now reveals its i’th block, and obtains arevenue of one.
7	1522784763	-6	Yeah but that paper has already been proven to be wrong.Moreover, how about that Youtube debate? I see you are on my d*ck following every comment I post. Get on camera and let's debate face to face.
8	1522784782	7	> Yeah but that paper has already been proven to be wrong.Where? Craig's paper? I don't even see where it *tries* to refute the main claim of the paper: that colluding selfish miners who control > 1/3 hashpower will get **more than their hashpower's proportion of the blocks that end up on the blockchain**. That is to say, for a fixed **length** of blockchain, their blocks will make up a **disproportionate share** if they control more than 1/3 of the hashrate. This does *not* imply that they will get more than their share of **all blocks solved** -- it's only the ones that end up on the blockchain. The reason for this difference is that the strategy works by orphaning honest miner blocks, at the cost of orphaning *some* of the SM blocks. It 'works' by orphaning **proportionately more** honest blocks than selfish blocks.
9	1522791330	3	You kind of have to ask yourself, if you truly believe that selfish mining paper is correct, why are there not selfish miners taking advantage of it? Why not even once has it been tried? IT would be an easy tell if there was any consistency to it.The answer is, regardless of being wrong, is not a long term profitable solution. Even if the SM paper WAS technically accurate, robbing Peter to pay Paul (splitting the HM chain) isn't going to be profitable long term. HM will react and orphan the bad actors. But since SM isn't even viable, we haven't had to deal with it. All we've had to deal with is the theoretical arguments around it.
9	1522787563	4	fuck off greg

3	1522794862	6	Prove it then, Selfish Mining is only a hypothesis and has never been proven, yet people want to go around like it is fact.  Its has only been modeled on flawed simulations which have flawed assumptions about the network topology, and do not exist in the real Bitcoin economic game theoretic environment.  If SM is real, then go prove it on Bitcoin or an alt-coin, or get lost.
4	1522795091	1	> Its has only been modeled on flawed simulationsPoint out the flaw in [my simulation](https://repl.it/repls/UnfinishedGigaOperation), then.> If SM is real, then go prove it on Bitcoin or an alt-coin, or get lost.Are you suggesting it's only 'real' threat if it has actually happened? 
5	1522795189	6	Its a simulation, and does not model the topology of the network, or other factors, its only a limited model.  You need to prove on a real economic system and a real network.  If SM is so real can you explain why it has never been found on Bitcoin or an alt-coin?
6	1522795330	7	> Its a simulation, and does not model the topology of the networkI'm assuming a gamma of zero, so this doesn't matter. > You need to prove on a real economic system and a real network. If SM is so real can you explain why it has never been found on Bitcoin or an alt-coin?Again, does a threat need to actually come to fruition before it's considered 'real'? Here, an attacker needs a huge proportion of hashpower, which is hard to get.
7	1522795441	3	Its easy to get on some shitty alt-coin, so prove it on a real system.
8	1522795472	3	That seems immoral. 
9	1522795599	7	No it would be immoral to try to change Bitcoin because of some SM hypothesis that has not even been proven on a real network.

7	1522853005	1	> I'll say this: SM has been deployed in practice, on an altcoin. My lips are sealed beyond that.LOL what a joke, his lips are sealed.  What about the fact that it would be detected easily and stopped if the alt-coin were ever a real alt-coin.  [As csw says](https://www.yours.org/content/the-cancer-in-bitcoin-e75381d0fd75):> In fact, a large number of the existing miner community will just black list you if you tried this… So, you start this attack, you start causing the honest miners to orphan blocks, and they will just sit and lose money.

Painting miners as evil has become a hobby as painting any capitalist as evil is the corresponding norm.> The selfish miner strategy leads to a loss of up to 33% or more of direct revenue.

LOL what a joke this is.  This is not science, LOL
6	1522795560	1	False, there was a crowd-funded simulator that took the full topology into account. For no reason, I should add, just for the sake of accuracy so people like you could not make this claim. SM itself does not depend on any network topology.>If SM is so real can you explain why it has never been found on Bitcoin or an alt-coin?How do you know that it has never been done on any altcoin?

Did you drink some Core Koolaid and it gave you the power to change reality?> SM makes no assumptions about the network topology.The models do not take account of network topology at all.  So its not proven on a real system.
6	1522837014	2	The debate of SM. Like Core, it results in changing the code that doesnt need it. SM is cancer. People who think that there is a problem with the network is essentially a destructive bitcoin killer. First perform a Selfish mine. Then it will prove if the protocol needs changing. 
6	1522796140	-1	>So its not proven on a real system.Lame. You do not have to see everything in every configuration for it to be true. Prove to us why you think SM would not work. Arguments can range from "this assumption made on page ___ of the SM paper is broken" to "here's a math error I found."So far, both math and conceptual errors have been found in all of CSW's writings, and not a single one in the SM paper.
7	1522796191	5	This is the difference between economists and developers.  Devs look at code and miss the forest for the trees.  While economists actually understand the system.

Sometimes they don't even know when they are supposed to be acting toxic, so they keep rabidly posting against something they do not personally agree with, and have decided no-one should agree with.Toxic, it's the new policing of what science is approved, and who can be listened to.
1	1522803833	2	 Correct.  argumentum ad hominem is not a valid argument and anyone who performs these fallacious forms of argument are bad people either by ignorance or by malevolence. People need to be aware of the different types...Another popular one is the argument from authority. Wish they would teach our kids this in school. But then, I guess, it would make them less susceptible to propaganda.
2	1522810904	0	If people where taught how to think in school and not just _what_ to think how long do you think it would take until the system crumbled?Argument from authority is what 99% of science is based on btw, especially the social sciences but largely also the hard sciences. Repeating experiments all the way down is simply too impractical & uneconomical. That's why they have to trust that the scientists presenting experiments aren't just full of shit. Which of course makes it even easier for our masonic & jewish overlords to control the narrative.
1	1522814883	2	His ideas were thoroughly debunked and he still kept at his bullshit. Given the tangible impact BS can have in this space, calling out the BSers directly needs to happen when calling out their ideas fails.
0	1522789923	10	Hopefully this will be the push Roger and Bitmain need to Kick CSW out ASAP, the guy is unstable. 
0	1522786615	7	Emin rubs me as someone who has been agreeing with everyone to gain acceptance and credibility, but intends to fuck things up.
1	1522787312	27	I've met him at a conference and had a chance to exchange a few words. He strikes me as somebody who makes an effort to be polite, even when others aren't, and goes blunt cleartext only when nothing else has helped or when the situation is just too dumb to take seriously.
2	1522790101	10	Rick, have you written anywhere about the CSW situation specifically? Personally, I've been with BCH since day one and CSW has worried me from the beginning. Is there any reason that folks like you, Roger or Amaury are not publicly speaking out about this fox in the hen house?
3	1522798329	6	>Rick, have you written anywhere about the CSW situation specifically?Rick doesn't discuss people, he discusses ideas. My guess is if you ask him to discuss CSW ideas or papers, he will do that./u/falkvinge please make a video on selfish mining. I'm curious about your take on it. 
4	1522842292	2	>Rick doesn't discuss people, he discusses ideasHe was literally just [discussing Emin](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89gqp3/emin_right_now_i_have_btc_bch_eth_and_zcash_devs/dwr34pe/).
3	1522810712	2	Stop to justify your bloody witch hunt with Ricks video already - it's getting odd.
3	1522795790	4	He did: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOLZNtbLUTY
4	1522802488	4	If that's your conclusion after watching the video it means Rick tried to teach you how to fish, but you are eating the bait instead. 
5	1522802747	3	There are, like, thousands of toxic people with fake PhD or PhD in theology trying to profit over BCH community, I can't even tell who he was talking about...
6	1522803196	4	not CSW he has a PhD in Computer science and economics, stop trying to manipulate
7	1522804705	0	Awarded at a later time he claimed he had, which confirmed him as a fraud (as Rick puts it: such lie is always deliberate): https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/12/11/bitcoin-creator-satoshi-craig-wright-lies-hoax/#27c95fee6794
8	1522804955	2	1) Rick is speaking of the present, not of 20162) It was awarded in 2017 but it was completed in 2014 as his record shows. 
9	1522816006	2	> Rick is speaking of the present, not of 2016Let me quote Rick for you, starting at [t=12m21s](https://youtu.be/nOLZNtbLUTY?t=12m21s) (emphasis mine):> Somebody who claims they hold a degree, in any subject, at any level, where the university asserts that this is not true, or where the university can not be verified, is an immediate and ***permanent*** red flag, because this particular lie is always deliberate.

3	1522791350	1	I followed CSW's charade - demonstrating cryptographic ownership of early Satoshi keys to the world's media very closely. I too find it very hard to take this community's apparent blind acceptance. I like BCH, but need to stop following this sub. 
3	1522836357	1	Money. It's always money. nChain has invested in to Bitcoin Cash related projects all over the space. That's why CSW is at all these conferences.  Money and politics. 
2	1522810686	3	How polite someone is is mostly irrelevant to me in regards to their understanding of bitcoin and their vision/agenda. I've met plenty of polite assholes. As far as I can tell he's wrong about selfish mining, yet he is making personal attacks rather than explaining how he is right.
2	1522856176	1	Go fuck yourself toxic piece of shit.
1	1522797694	1	The last thing I'd say about Emin is that he's a warm and cuddly guy who has been agreeing with people. He has been calling out all the bad actors in the space since the day I entered Bitcoin.
2	1522810120	2	like who? From what I can tell he never lead any charge against any Core members, he joined the fray long after.
0	1522787848	9	Looks like geekmonk has deployed some vote puppets in this thread.
1	1522802946	3	... Or you're getting downvoted for grouping bitcoiners who disagree with you as 'vote puppets'
1	1522790178	0	Sure, how could anyone not love your contributions? Must be like 90% of them attacking CSW with attitude.
2	1522803948	0	Well said.
1	1522789344	-6	There is something dodgy going on, you're right! Either him, or the clown CSW.
2	1522790082	1	Or they are both the same person.
1	1522810992	-1	Ah, the 'ol jewish reversal of reality. Like when they say it's the palestinians fault that 500 children are killed in gaza. Yeah that's a good one. Core people like that one a lot.
0	1522808842	1	My thought remain the same. Having any type of community spoke persons, champions, or thought leaders for decentralized cryptocurrency is a really bad idea. Allowing these people to lead $BCH's FUDs with $BTC, especially name confusion and social media take over of twitters, domains and reddits create even more toxic environment not all $BCH supporters agrees with.How can a $BCH community grow organically in a  toxic environment? Everyone dislike FUDs and rather choose to just stay away. 
0	1522838379	1	DPoS and trusting Intel SGX is shite. Emin is more mixed a bag than CSW. It seems that there is a Wedge being driven in here by some people who have gained a technical reputation, if BCH fragments now it will die.
0	1522790074	0	I like CSW.  He said LN and Segwit was shit years ago and he was right!!
1	1522790774	3	I notice you posted the same thing two minutes apart!
2	1522794831	2	I noticed you posted the same thing eleven seconds apart!
1	1522790795	0	I also liked it when he said people who think Bitcoin must run on a Raspberry Pi forever should piss off. He can be funny, but I'm afraid he's done now.
2	1522804380	4	I listened to his rationale for that comment and he made a VERY valid argument.
3	1522806775	4	But.  But.  Bias!   He dislikes CSW’s personality therefore everything he says is wrong and “he’s done”.  Ahhhhh such relief.  
3	1522819140	1	Yes, that was funny and true.
1	1522795989	1	The enemy of my enemy is a friend, right? This attitude serves him well.
0	1522796285	1	Emin could find one person in every country of the world, then he will claim the entire population of the world worship him as king.
0	1522783269	-13	Hey u/geekmonk -ey, do you need any more convincing that fakesatoshi is a fucking clown??? You don't like fraud, and actually neither do I. Clown... technobabble spouting clown.Do you think you know more than BTC+BCH+ETH+ZCash devs, altogether? Nobody knows jack shit, except for you and that clown. I think I wanna bow in front of you.
1	1522789180	12	Even if you are right, does this form strike you as the best possible way to convey your message?It's not.
1	1522783743	13	Hahaha fuck off
0	1522835710	0	This douchebag and Peter both projecting hard on this one.
0	1522780374	-19	Emin is a toxic troll.
1	1522782954	10	Says a toxic troll.
2	1522804241	3	His history doesn't make him sound like a toxic troll at all. Yours, on the other hand, does -- especially where you're talking about your bots. in r/Bitcoin. LOL.
3	1522819824	1	Do you mean how my bot can send BCH to post or comments in r/bitcoin? Nice eh? Circumvent the censorship :D

0	1522789982	-6	I like CSW.  He said LN and Segwit was shit years ago and he was right!!
1	1522804346	4	I agree with you. There's nothing he is supporting that I find dishonest or obviously incorrect. The people who attack him, on the other hand, are always involved in some horrible practices of propaganda and censorship and pushing Bitcoin (and crypto) in directions that are easy to find fault with.
2	1522809154	1	>The people who attack him, on the other hand, are always involved in some horrible practices of propaganda and censorship and pushing Bitcoin (and crypto) in directions that are easy to find fault with.Keep making solid, logical correlations like that and you're gonna have to be downvoted
