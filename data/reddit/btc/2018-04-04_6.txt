0	1522832155	57	Jesus Christ ... what a cringe-fest. Samson just repeats the same old bullshit excuses that we hear from all the /r/bitcoin Lambo kids. He presents his opions as fact with absolutely no substance. He lacks argumentative skills of any kind. Every time he makes a rebuttal to Ver's points he just spits out buzzword soup.His responses are of the caliber that I would normally expect from a child; he resorts to name-calling on more than one occasion, makes retorts like "good for you" when Ver provides a lengthy explanation.Even his body language is pure cringe. Constantly facing away from Ver when talking to him, nervous twitching, won't even make eye contact.That being said, Roger's dying baby quote was also very cringy and totally unnecessary - I think he got a bit carried away there. He is obviously very passionate.
1	1522832817	49	Less economic freedom literally does cause people to die who would otherwise be alive.  It isn't an exaggeration. 
2	1522837585	19	Roger... What an outstandingly brilliant debate you put up. Thank you so much for doing Bitcoin justice. Many will proudly watch that. Hopefully many more will have their eyes opened watching it
3	1522863253	2	Roger is the man! What a guy. Tirelessly promoting what he believes in for the last 8/9 years despite all the idiots that slate him and totally miss this admirable quality. Keep it up good sir!
2	1522833529	17	Roger, Doge has unlimited supply since 2014 (before it had a limit) and BCH has already an adjustable blocksize limit based on demand. You can be more confident on those two facts in the future in a debate like this.
3	1522833726	16	Mow said a lot of bullshit
4	1522833832	14	Basically r/bitcoin echo chamber.
3	1522839251	5	While that is accurate, it would not have worked as a counter to Mows claim that it has a limited supply _now_.You would still have to get into project philosophy and potential ideas to future-proof the limit somehow.
3	1522855016	6	"Unlimited", while not wrong is misleading. There's a flat tail emission once the bootstrap curve is complete. Monero and others have similar tail emissions (although Doge's has the prestige of being a bug that became a feature)
3	1522862570	4	Thanks.  I wasn’t prepared to debate the intricacies of Dogecoin with Samson.
4	1522863738	1	and LOL, he pointed out you can't do large transactions with altcoins, then does on to advocate Litecoin as a viable alternative because it can handle large transactions with a faster block confirmation time. 
2	1522852281	4	I totally agree with Roger. As a war child, I live now in The Netherlands. Far away from my native country, suffer from racism child abuse and all kind of harassment. I confirm that the war in my country has crippled my childhood country, kept the population poor over decades and 90% of the bright young people there still don't have access to international market. While not being able to participate to the economy, 70% of your clothes and lots of you gears are from our country. To be on-topic, we can't even manage to buy proper baby nutrition, while our country is getting poisoned by the industries and smogs. 
2	1522833942	8	I see what you mean. It just felt odd to me, but only in the sense that Samson seemed incapable of discussing even minor technical issues, let alone a significant topic such as that. In any case, thanks for the debate, it’s always good to hear you speak.Edit: Spelling.Edit2: wording.
3	1522841114	0	sorry you have a hard time with critical thinking 
4	1522842473	1	>I do see what you’re sayingUhh, what?
5	1522843501	1	Edited. Better now?
6	1522844216	3	It's easier to read. I was actually calling out Kook for not being able to read critically and bashing your critical thinking skills.
7	1522844323	2	Haha ok, all good then. Cheers.
4	1522841195	1	Huh?
5	1522842384	1	can't make the connection roger is drawing because you don't understand free markets or sound money.  What he is saying is literally true. Nothing crigeworthy about the truth.
6	1522842645	3	Dude, calm down. I never said it wasn't true.I just think his comments were lost on Samson and audience.Edit: Just to clarify, I think it's cringeworthy as I immediately started thinking about all the /r/bitcoin trolls that are going to take that quote out of context just to bash Ver. E.g: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mu2i/roger_ver_vs_samson_mow_full_video/dws6bbe/
2	1522836035	9	> It isn't an exaggeration.I agree. But it will be viewed as an argument from emotion when brought up under these particular circumstances. It is very likely to appear to the majority of the audience to be either out of touch with reality (real risks), the current subject of the debate (also out of touch with reality) or appealing to their less rational side (dishonest).
3	1522846495	1	How is bitcoin not emotional? The code is not. The philosophy behind it though...
4	1522849377	1	There's a clear difference in making _arguments from emotion_ and merely _experiencing and sharing emotion_. Arguments from emotion are ignoring what lead up to the emotion itself and the full context of the cause. By using it in debate you are attempting to shortcut the reasoning process, either by appealing to the audience respect for your own unexplained opinion or by appealing to their own emotions without presenting a logical basis for your position.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotionSee also Rand
5	1522853279	4	Usually I would agree with you but this particular rant is what finally hooked the audience and gave them something to think about when they go to sleep at night. This is not lawyers in court, this is POLITICSThis debate is probably going to mark a turning point. I hope a lot of people watch it.
6	1522853902	1	I reblogged it, so I hope so. Imo that particular argument was an "outside, but still on the line" scenario. In other words, it was still descent ish and could have been much worse. Roger had in part already "earned" the ability to say something "typically Rogerish" like that by communicating well prior to it and I think the audience was more forgiving than they would have been in some other circumstances.
5	1522851826	1	Debate is not only about reason. Emotions feed our values, motivations, and commitments. Making emotional appeals is wise in most cases, but probably even necessary in this one.
6	1522853278	0	Emotions are important, but they are not "tools of cognition". You can make a reasonable argument that connects properly in the logical realm and then lead to emotions. That way you are not attempting to dodge the reasoning process.
7	1522855003	1	I didn't say anything about emotions and cognition. And emotional appeals done properly bolster logical argument rather than obfuscate it. Ver's is of this variety.
8	1522861017	2	I'm making an important distinction.Appeal to emotion is never an acceptable argumentation technique in this type of setting. It's a logical fallacy that should be frowned on. That's entirely different from _involving potentially emotional subjects_ in the debate. Entirely different from being passionate or trying to get the audience passionate and so on.
2	1522833635	4	You are absolutely right, but I think you would reach a larger number of people if that part was toned down a bit. 
2	1522852219	1	I agree and am wholly on the same side as you, but if you want your ideas and arguments to be taken seriously you should try to avoid emotional appeals and just make the arguments in a rational, matter-of-fact way. Emotional appeals are not characteristic of intelligent people.
2	1522862702	1	I absolutely agree with you, Roger. The problem is, most people are not even aware there is a problem... so when they see you say something like this, they think you are being overdramatic simply because they either don't care or are unaware of the realities of the problems that are plaguing this world today. It's quite sad to see. Us Westerners live in our bubble and don't care about the rest of the world.
2	1522863602	1	Thanks, Roger for doing what you do you are a true revolutionary, glad I got the thank you in person in Japan. Just a quick reflection on what I watched. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89p20t/just_watched_the_roger_vs_samson_debate_does/dwsxlbs/
1	1522832376	4	I also think that saying bitcoin cash will "simply" scale on-chain does not give all the technological advances/optimizations (like graphene) justice that will come to enable this.
1	1522859066	2	Yeah everytime Samson spoke I cringed hard.  It really is a cringefest -- from his side.Roger was really well spoken and made a lot of sense.
0	1522823276	13	Anyone have Roger or Jihan's presentations? 
0	1522826362	18	Crossposted to rbitcoin. Banned in 1... 2...
1	1522834745	28	>BashCo: Also worth noting that OP is a very obvious sockpuppet shill for CSW.Lol.Also worth nothing that BashCo is a piece of shit.
2	1522839687	18	Shit can be used for fertiliser. /u/Bashco has no such redeeming features.
2	1522835439	-4	Well, in all honesty 1 month old account with 130 karma is quite easy to get as a sock, so you can see why they might accuse you of that. As for the rest, we indeed do have CSW shills around here as well. (Which is of course not to imply that anyone linking or defending a certain pov of CSW is automatically a shill for that matter)
1	1522837857	8	And 3:> You have been banned from participating in rBitcoin. You can still view and subscribe to rBitcoin, but you won't be able to post or comment.
2	1522838978	-5	You posted it. That was fine by the mod. You proceeded to poke the mod. "omg look guies, bant". A+. 
3	1522839428	13	Yes, it is true that I was banned not for posting the video itself but for responding to mod's accusation of me being a "sockpuppet shill" made in the same thread (or to be more specific, my response was the tipping point).What does that change? I was being civil and I responded in the same manner mod accused me.Can you think of some reasons why would I need to have a possibility to be able post to sub where I can only post someone else's opinion and not my own?
3	1522841830	11	BashCo poked first then banned him when he defended himself.Certainly says a lot about their integrity when the mods bans users who challenge their insults.
4	1522842586	-2	He posted there intending to get banned and needed to come through. Don't try to make it anything else. 
5	1522857809	0	So knowing the censorship and post it to prove is "the intention to get banned" ? Wtf mental gymnastic is that? And you justify his ban is due to his intentionWhat a mindless idiot
1	1522836802	3	He said Beecash, that's a must watch for the other subreddit.
1	1522834106	2	:D 
1	1522839618	1	I was going to suggest for someone to crosspost this. Got a link?
2	1522839646	1	https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89nc25/roger_ver_vs_samson_mow_full_video/
0	1522837090	11	Not sure it was intended to be an actual debate, but it ended up being one of the best on this subject so far. You do tend to cram in maybe too much when you speak Roger, but this was a very strong performance.
0	1522845293	7	Wow, Samson is very out of his element. Both started out pretty nervous, but Roger got more confident over time. You can tell by Samson's body language, he wasn't processing half of what Roger said and was struggling to find an argument. I watched the episodes of "Magical Crypto Friends". The first episode was somewhat interesting, but the quality went over time and they just wasted 45 minutes talking about memes and jokes.  At some point, you need to start taking a (once) $850B industry seriously. Sometimes, I feel like it's just a bunch of kids. One point I wish they would have hit on is whether or not fully validated clients are necessary or provide any value. If yes, Samson's argument may have some weight. If no, Samson's argument of validation doesn't matter. 
0	1522841935	15	I met Roger at the Satoshi Vision conference. My first impression was how energetic, passionate and driven he is and has been in promoting Bitcoin (BCH) as peer-to-peer electronic cash. His motivations seem to be based on a life's purpose of improving people's lives by increasing their economic freedom. Roger is very wealthy. He doesn't need to put himself in the spotlight and he certainly could send his energy elsewhere and would be just fine.In contrast, look at the motivations of Samson Mow. He started as a Twitter troll before being hired by Blockstream months later. He has continued to troll, only now he is paid for it. As a non-wealthy individual, he depends on Blockstream's salary for survival. He's not a developer or an economist, yet will still say anything affirming Blockstream's 2nd-layer middleman-settlement business despite having no real authority to do so. You can't get a man to understand something when his job depends on him not understanding it.
0	1522841178	8	lol Samson got rekt!!! 
0	1522837371	13	Wow.. Samson is a total jerk. How can he shake his head at the fact people are dying? What a fucking looser!
0	1522840619	6	rekt
0	1522858945	4	Wow Samson came across so weak in this.  It made me cringe.  Really cringeworthy.  I can't even look at the screen while he's talking it's so painful.OUCH.
0	1522851127	4	The hubris is oozing out of Mow, this is crypto, the price could change dramatically, and he is so confident the market will keep choosing BTC as the de facto global currency.
1	1522859203	3	Ha ha yeah.  Reality sometimes hits you late -- but when it does it can hit you very hard.  Stay tuned -- it'll be interesting how this will all look in hindsight in the next 2-3 years.
0	1522844467	3	I can’t wait to buy a hat at Mow’s store. Maybe I can use a tab since it doesn’t work yet. 
0	1522829799	8	he did an awesome job
0	1522833339	7	"Dogecoin has limited supply" Samson is scared as fuck to debate with Craig on stage. Threatens to leave the room. lol.Here Samson, Craig's talk, you've missed, you should take notes:  https://youtu.be/RpWt2RKTTjQ
1	1522836437	1	I think more than anything he is afraid that he will not have a good comeback when Craig starts bringing up philosophy or for that matter math that Craig himself can't even explain to most developers or mathematicians in the industry, if it's at all accurate. It would be an embarrassment in either case and the community might attack him for appearing weak in front of a weak opponent.
2	1522838034	1	What makes you think Craig can't explain his math. Lel
3	1522839046	6	Because it regularly takes others here to do it for him...
3	1522852060	2	Csw is a lot of things. But one thing he is not is a cogent public speaker. I think we all understand that by now, including him.
4	1522852340	1	I understand what he says. 
5	1522852933	1	Good for you. 
0	1522846776	2	Nutter.
0	1522847084	2	Sampson's really really thirsty & figety. It made me nervous to imagine what would happen if he hadn't had that water bottle.
0	1522829987	2	why did they cut the important part with vitalik?
1	1522832866	11	Vitalik always have some quality speeches but why include him in a Ver vs. Mow video?.. 
0	1522843292	1	Mow's smugness does him no justice. But I also have never liked Ver's debate style and rhetoric. 
0	1522861209	1	After watching that I wouldn't hire Samson to bus tables in my restaurant.  How the fuck did that clueless idiot become CSO of Blockstream?
0	1522863712	1	I would like to thank Mow for participating in the panel/debate. It allows everyone to see and judge first hand their positions, rather than 2-dimensional forum posts.
0	1522865038	1	Samson's smugness reflects the whole of blockstream. I don't care what he said at the beginning.
0	1522865816	1	I can see why Samson was trying his hardest to avoid a debate in the past. 😏

1	1522848212	5	Failing to allow bitcoin to grow has resulted in more deaths than would otherwise have been.But you don't give a fuck because you are a privileged prick that spouts Hodl or Die
2	1522849549	-5	>Failing to allow bitcoin to grow has resulted in more deathslmfao, lying clown.said the btrash liars denying the fact satoshi stated offchain payment channels were the future. piss off, liar.
3	1522865164	1	> satoshi stated offchain payment channels were the future.Where? Here's an actual quote from Satoshi, in a e-mail to Mike Hearn:>There is only one global chain.>The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.  If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size. >By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10.  Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions.https://pastebin.com/Na5FwkQ4One global chain, meaning no Blockstream sidechains are necessary. It also means that no other network or means for transacting is necessary.Mike Hearn is doing an AMA on tomorrow, maybe you can ask him what Satoshi meant?Here's a few more informative quotes:>I think client-only nodes should receive full blocks so they can scan them for their own transactions.  They don't need to store them or index them.  For the initial download, they only need to download headers, since there couldn't be any payments before the first time the program was run (a header download command was added in 0.3.18).  From then on, they download full blocks (but only store the headers).Also, referring to the blocksize limit:>A higher limit can be phased in once we have actual use closer to the limit and make sure it's working OK. >Eventually when we have client-only implementations, the block chain size won't matter much.  Until then, while all users still have to download the entire block chain to start, it's nice if we can keep it down to a reasonable size. >With very high transaction volume, network nodes would consolidate and there would be more pooled mining and GPU farms, and users would run client-only.  With dev work on optimising and parallelising, it can keep scaling up. >Whatever the current capacity of the software is, it automatically grows at the rate of Moore's Law, about 60% per year.https://pastebin.com/wA9Jn100I think this is what you were looking for:>>I haven't fully understood why sequence numbers are a property of the tx inputs rather than the tx itself.>It's for contracts.  An unrecorded open transaction can keep being replaced until nLockTime.  It may contain payments by multiple parties.  Each input owner signs their input.  For a new version to be written, each must sign a higher sequence number (see IsNewerThan).  By signing, an input owner says "I agree to put my money in, if everyone puts their money in and the outputs are this."  There are other options in SignatureHash such as SIGHASH_SINGLE which means "I agree, as long as this one output (i.e. mine) is what I want, I don't care what you do with the other outputs.".  If that's written with a high nSequenceNumber, the party can bow out of the negotiation except for that one stipulation, or sign SIGHASH_NONE and bow out completely. >The parties could create a pre-agreed default option by creating a higher nSequenceNumber tx using OP_CHECKMULTISIG that requires a subset of parties to sign to complete the signature.  The parties hold this tx in reserve and if need be, pass it around until it has enough signatures. >One use of nLockTime is high frequency trades between a set of parties.  They can keep updating a tx by unanimous agreement.  The party giving money would be the first to sign the next version.  If one party stops agreeing to changes, then the last state will be recorded at nLockTime.  If desired, a default transaction can be prepared after each version so n-1 parties can push an unresponsive party out.  Intermediate transactions do not need to be broadcast.  Only the final outcome gets recorded by the network.  Just before nLockTime, the parties and a few witness nodes broadcast the highest sequence tx they saw.https://pastebin.com/JF3USKFTThe idea of the Lightning network, in simplistic terms, is basically making a whole separate network aside from the Bitcoin network, to relay these payments and transactions. But as stated by Satoshi, this is meant for contracts and "high-frequency trades between a set of parties." High-frequency would generally mean multiple trades per minute, and set of parties gets really complex beyond just a few. Now, the lightning network aims to create of network of the open contracts, can you not see the complexity and uselessness of telling people who only make one transaction per day to use this for every single transaction?
