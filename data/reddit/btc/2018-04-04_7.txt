0	1522790502	91	Yes, another distraction to silence the fact that Samson Mow got totally BCH slapped in the debate by Roger.
1	1522792209	55	Bitcoin/litecoin fan here. Also not a fan of Roger. But damn, Roger slapped Samson over and over again. All Samson could say is "lightning network" without actually saying what it could do. Roger kicked ass man.
2	1522846647	1	> litecoin fan hereOy vey.
3	1522848047	1	Litecoin is the real bitcoin/s
1	1522821419	9	Yeah, no reasonable person thought Mow won that debate. That's probably why there was no live stream from this conference. They fear the truth getting out.
1	1522795565	29	"BCH SLAPPED" made my day, thanks! :)
1	1522843122	1	it actually pissed me off when samson mow pulled out the "bcash" attack, a tactic to make him lose his cool. All it did was make samson think: 'the bastard has a point'.
0	1522795025	36	For those who don't follow the absurd propaganda war:Bitcoin Cash reintroduces fast, cheap and safe payments to hundreds of thousands of vendors around the globe.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is one of two relevant bitcoin types from the chain split on aug. 1st. The other is Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin Cash is not an altcoin, the chain starts jan 3, 2009, and is the same for Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), from the genesis block and up to 1.aug 2017, when the split occurred. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is arguably the bitcoin version which is closest to the original bitcoin (which stopped to exist with the inclusion of segwit in the BTC chain). Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the high capacity, low fee, instant payment version, the only coin with a vision to conquer the world.Bitcoin cash is non government, free market, sound money for the world, easily transactable, relatively anonymous, hideable, protectable, backupable and teleportable.
1	1522813337	4	I totally support forking the blockchain to create bitcoin cash and try an alternative to the main protocol. It's one of the advantages of the software.However, there is no social media war on Craig Wright. He can't move any of the Satoshi coins and he is a fraud. If you support bitcoin cash, you should shun him for lying about being Satoshi. Many people hate him for being a liar, and they're just taking the opportunity to point out that he is a liar.If he was Satoshi, he could easily prove it. His "proof" has always been debunked.
2	1522822855	6	I don't fucking care what he is
2	1522837577	1	If you support bitcoin cash, you shut the fuck up with such idiocy and focus on the source code you gossip shillbot, go back to the tabloids idiots. 
1	1522815884	-7	It's an alt coin, the EDA made sure of that. 
2	1522836918	2	So now that it no longer has EDA I guess it's real Bitcoin.
3	1522837295	-2	Oh, is that right?The next time someone asks you for a payment Bitcoin, just send him Bitcoin Cash, I'm sure there won't be any confusion over the fact that he didn't get any Bitcoin in his wallet.
4	1522838136	3	If someone asked me to pay them in "Bitcoin" I'd assume they meant BCH since BTC is no longer intended for peer to peer payments -- but first I'd be sure to make sure they hadn't been bamboozled into thinking BTC was still "[Bitcoin: a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)." The Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash version of Bitcoin is Bitcoin Cash.
5	1522838560	0	>but first I'd be sure to make sure they hadn't been bamboozled into thinking BTC...OK, make sure you explain to him that on the exchange, he'll have no trouble getting the X amount of dollars he asked of you in actual Bitcoin, in BCH. Because I'm sure exchanges, or other merchants will also understand.
6	1522846197	1	BCH is in fact accepted on all exchanges
2	1522821311	1	What is "EDA"?
3	1522823081	5	Emergency Difficulty AdjustmentA mechanism to ensure BCH  survived in the initial time after the fork, by keeping it profitable enough to mine.It has now been replaced by a new DA algorithm which adjusts more like some other altcoins (every block).
0	1522791430	25	What i dont understand is, why did vitalik call him out like that. The host asked did any of the attendees have any questions for roger or samson, craig had a question, then vitalik wanted to ask a question, but instead he just called out craig. The host on stage seemed a bit confused. 
1	1522792072	12	Try to place yourself in Vitalik shoes: If you saw a con man repeatedly deceiving people on a subject you are expert on, you also would grow frustrated and call him out if you had the chance.
2	1522800736	23	But Craig asked a question and said he didn't understand about 10 cents argument.Vitalik responded by saying "I don't understand why Craig Wright should be able to ask a question"Which I understand as: "he shouldn't be able to talk because he is wrong sometimes". My only impression of vitalik is now bad
3	1522804476	8	I think what Vitalik said was going against was Craig’s presentation not his question. But I could be wrong.
3	1522804536	18	I agree. There is something very out of character for Vitalik there. It wasn't a logical argument...it was a malicious one. I'm not so sure I like Vitalik anymore. It's not even that I really like CSW...it was just that he stepped into that arena with nothing but insults. There's nothing logical about that.
4	1522805224	-1	Are rational comments that put another person in a negative light but are good for a community considered insults?
5	1522805664	11	They are never good for the community. Emotional arguments are never good for the community. It appeals to our baser instincts which are not good.What is good for the community is making a reasoned argument that puts that person in a negative light. That further explains some concept so it can be understood in more nuanced ways that lead others not only to understanding why, in this case, it is right but to then also applying it to future cases.Give a man a fish and he eats for a day. Teach a man to fish and he eats for life.Furthermore, it doesn't damn the insulted. It gives them the opportunity to change their opinions, to think through their arguments and to present something of value to the community if they choose to be honest. 
6	1522806144	-1	> Emotional arguments are never good for the community.But I said rational; not emotional. But what if an argument is both rational and emotional? Just discard it and find one who's only rational? The idea that emotional arguments are never good is silly. Our "baser" instincts are always bad? What kind of world do you live in? Ever fallen in love? Always bad? 
7	1522819568	2	Also we do have to remember how young Vitalik is. He’s 24 and doesn’t have some board helping him figure out when to say what. Remember Zuck in the beginning? Emotional intelligence takes time. And he wasn’t wrong..
7	1522817423	1	You just love to argue, huh?
8	1522825938	2	#No! /s
4	1522833926	-1	Why would you treat a fraud with anything but contempt?"debating" frauds is a non starter. Having a "debate" with these people would make it seem as if there are actually doubts out there that this guy isn't a fraud.By your reasoning, we should have debates with creationists on whether or not they should be allowed to teach at schools.Respect is something you exercise among your peers, not con artists.>What is good for the community is making a reasoned argument that puts that person in a negative light. That further explains some concept so it can be understood in more nuanced ways that lead others not only to understanding why, in this case, it is right but to then also applying it to future cases.Umm, No. The guy shouldn't be given a platform to begin with. But if he is given one, I'm glad people will quickly point out that the guy has no business having one.
5	1522860751	1	But CSW isn't anything to do with Bitcoin core. All the altcoiners and core supporters crying about CSW over the last couple of days is pretty funny. 
2	1522804628	3	Why not just elaborate on how he is deceiving others and explain why he was wrong. Instead this seems like the type of thing to do when you have no argument.
3	1522806047	1	Vitalik explained where he was wrong. I did it too, on multiple occasions. If you are really interested, I can dig it up for you.
4	1522810729	2	please dig, im interesred
5	1522815330	1	https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/87v21i/the_csw_case_in_a_nutshell_if_i_told_you_my_name/dwi0s8e/?st=jfkkdztc&sh=33d5cacd
2	1522805677	1	Maybe but there's more to it.  I think Vitalik actually sees himself in some kind of contest.  Remember when BCH market cap exceeded ETH, he congratulated people.  He was trying to be gracious, and he's a nice guy.  I'm just saying consider that he is also engaging in dividing his perceived competitor.
2	1522792488	-1	Try to place yourself into Vitalik's brain, he is 200% logical, if something doesn't make sense for him, he will call it out.
3	1522804203	9	No.  Publicly shaming someone with personal attacks and calling for censorship is not logical at all.And then all the back-slapping afterwards caught on another video was just sad to see.
4	1522812244	3	he just called him out for what he is, a failed fraud. There's more than enough evidence that supports it.I find what csw tried to pull off disrespectful to the whole community and downright scummy. I too wouldnt stand someone who pretended to be staoshi spewing bullshit about "negative gamma"
3	1522804585	5	Your comment is illogical. You cannot be more than 100% logical.Secondly, that comment was not logical at all. It was completely an emotional attack which is not only out of character for Vitalik, but very disturbing to see him heading down that path.Ethereum might be dying.
4	1522807972	2	Yep.  With the SEC cracking down on ICOs, what use is it?
4	1522843360	0	CSW has said before that BCH can completely replace Ethereum, I think Vitalik might be scared of that happening.
1	1522791828	1	He's always been outspoken about it. Hes just being himself.
2	1522791996	3	any sources? havent seen him mention before and ive been in the space for some time now
3	1522795572	5	https://youtu.be/2qLI3VIHuKU
4	1522804788	12	Vitalik is naive. And his answer is naive. There are lots of good reasons why CSW wouldn't want to prove it to the world. One big reason is that he likes having his head attached to his body.I'm not trying to argue that CSW is Satoshi. I am arguing that Vitalik is brilliant in one small area but is naive and ignorant to a lot of things and it shows in his responses. 
5	1522811315	7	I see three possibilties:1) CSW is not Satoshi and was stupid to beleive his fake proof would go smoothly.2) CSW is not Satoshi but he knew his fake proof would fail. He did it anyway for whatever reason.3) CSW is Satoshi and he was scared to be doxed at some point, so he made a fake proof and he knew people would never believe he was Satoshi after the fake proof and he's safeI'm personally leaning towards 1) however I still like some of his arguments about BTC and I think these should be judged indenpently.What's also concerning is the amount of his master degrees. Never seen a person whith so many master degrees - seems very unlegit/fake as time in human life is a limiting factor.
6	1522811640	5	The law firm taking on the Kleiman estate case against Craig is a big, serious one. It seems unlikely they'd invest the resources in building a case against someone unless they had some real sense that they know who he is and what he has.
7	1522813964	5	My mind is open to change anytime if they can prove it. Main argument is to judge his arguments about BTC independently, what sometimes isn't happening.Claiming an argument is wrong because of the person that is saying it doesn't make sense at all. However being (even more) ciritical in that case makes sense.
8	1522815912	5	The problem with Wright is that he seems to be unusually bad at explaining himself clearly, but when people finally understand what he's talking about it's often insightful, as with his claim, a couple years ago, that Bitcoin is Turing complete: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6j-11H2O7chttps://www.yours.org/content/craig-wright-s--negative-gamma--and-the-curious-lack-of-intellectual-c-191f72455730I don't have enough technical knowledge to evaluate Craig or Vitalik's technical knowledge, but when you see this sort of dynamic (everyone scoffs to begin with and later realizes he was on to something), you have to wonder if he's really as dumb as some other experts seem to think or if he's just bad at explaining himself/has a prickly personality.While again noting I don't have the knowledge to evaluate their relative technical expertise, I will also say that I have an especially negative reaction to seeing someone impugn someone else's right to speak who wasn't even born yet when the latter began working in the field.

4	1522802743	2	oh hi it's you :)
1	1522835849	1	Craig shouted something first, the Vitalki got angry and said the "Why is this fraud" part ... 
1	1522843177	1	Afaik Craig has said multiple times that Ethereum is unnecessary now that BCH is here, maybe Vitalik generally just doesn't like him.
0	1522802382	3	As a supporter of both coins, this whole fight takes down the credibility of both names.. kinda sucks really.
0	1522808831	3	Yeah, and you're fuelling the fire. Give it a rest already.
0	1522791825	20	You can look at my post history & 16,000+ karma.- I consistently smash the rBitcoin trolls with their ["Bcash" comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88pgzo/rcryptocurrency_usually_automatically_downvotes/dwmjlaw/).- And I also consistently point out that [CSW is a unrepentant fraudster](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89bui6/buterin_about_csw_why_is_this_fraud_allowed_to/dwr1fwv/) who shouldn't be the public face of BCH, and shouldn't be allowed to have power & influence in the BCH community.In both cases, I am doing it to clean up the BCH community, for the long-term benefit of BCH.
1	1522804171	9	There's no such thing as 'cleaning up the community'. BCH is uncensored and the people within it will always have varying opinions. That's the point. This is not /r/bitcoin. CSW is not the face of BCH but he is liked by some and that's just fine.
2	1522805430	0	Up- and downvoted are tools for censorship. Also brigading are useful tools for that. Even commenting on other peoples posts by either bashing their opinion or character defamation works. A lot of people are worried about such things and if it happens often enough people will either stop posting or never even comment. Social pressure is an excellent tool that has been used since we first started communication with each other. Do not be naive that our beloved sub can't be turned into an echo chamber.
1	1522804141	1	I have a similar post history.OP should know that just because someone says things you like doesn't mean you have to like them.
1	1522795664	-6	> And I also consistently point out that CSW is a unrepentant fraudster who shouldn't be the public face of BCH, and shouldn't be allowed to have power & influence in the BCH community.You have been brainwashed. 
2	1522796590	2	And you aren't?Someone is 110% provably a liar, which makes him unfit to be the public face of something you care about.And yet you keep on insisting he's Satoshi, worshipping the ground he walks on, defending him at every turn, claiming that "yes he pulled a jape but he had REASONS"Are you incapable of understanding that during a time where there's more proof of him being a Goofus than a Gallant, then he should be considered to be bad advertising?
3	1522797618	11	>And yet you keep on insisting he's SatoshiWhen?> worshipping the ground he walks on, defending him at every turn, claiming that "yes he pulled a jape but he had REASONS"Where? What are you on about? All my recent discussions have been about focusing on the content of his papers instead of discussing his ways/attitude. 
4	1522801511	4	Don’t feed into this narrative. I’ve definitely noticed there’s something odd going on towards CSW now. One common theme, as you state, is that those who have something negative to say about CSW use character assassination as their supporting evidence for their arguments and completely ignore the content of his papers, or any other logical information.
1	1522800397	2	As someone who generally does support Core but sees value in BCH, I'm glad there are moderate voices to combat the obnoxiousness coming from either extreme. Apologies on behalf of the moderate BTC'ers for anyone coming here and still wasting space with ad hominems or brand related slurs instead of useful discussion/debate.
2	1522804930	3	You cannot both support core and see value in BCH. Their philosophies and paths are mutually exclusive. The success of one will destroy the other. 
3	1522821708	2	>The success of one will destroy the other.Exactly! The value I see in BCH is that it could have merit and be the better direction for cryptocurrency to grow into longer term. I don't think it is, but I see lots of ways I could be wrong about that, and I respect the efforts that have gone into developing it, and so at the very least it's a good hedge.People who are 1000% sure one or the other is clearly, objectively better should have a little humility and take a look at the pile of smart people that disagree with them, in my opinion.
1	1522821379	-1	Wow! Such smashing lol I got totally pwnt after you posted that and left. I wad clearly bested in a duel by the mightiest of keyboard warriors!Delusions of grandeur. Check.
0	1522794213	6	Just Blockstream doing their thing.
0	1522791366	13	CSW owns his brand.  Ideas stand or fall on their own merit.   I say let him go down with the reputation he built.   If he wants to contribute to the cause, he can do so by doing, not by talking.   Talking isn't very effective if nobody can believe you.  
1	1522798074	5	>If he wants to contribute to the cause, he can do so by doing, not by talkingIf he really wants to contribute, rather than just build a reputation, he could even use a ~~synonym~~ pseudonym  and contribute anonymously, kind of like...... some other guy, the name escapes me.

0	1522808942	2	Not really, Vitalik created the wave. Most people are here for the drama. No engineering necessary. 
0	1522796078	6	Ohyeah? And the months and months and months of posts every goddamn hour on this sub about CSW plastered all over the goddamn frontpage where not some "social media engineering"? Really? Get the fuck real.Oh no, now that finally some people speak out, it's all a conspiracy of a sudden. Yeah funny how that works.CSW can man up and admit he lied and manipulated in claiming to be satoshi, or he can sign a message providing the proof whose burden is squarely on him. Doing neither is cowardly and is doing himself no favors and I welcome any backlash from that. If you destroy your reputation as thoroughly as he has you deserve neither pitty nor second chances. Whatever blemish you brought upon yourself shall follow you around, forever, to be a thorn in your side and so that people will know you to for the fraud you are.
1	1522799168	-4	Claiming to be Satoshi is certainly a whopper of a lie. Kind of like reading off a cue card like some kind of prisoner of war "mt gox is totally solvent"

3	1522799750	-2	Me Ether. 
0	1522791283	6	Explain me how exposing a fraud, a computer science illiterate who passes as "expert" conning people with technobabble, is bad for BCH community?
1	1522802821	1	wtf do you mean technobabble, the things he says make sense to me, maybe you just don't understand them??
2	1522804493	4	The whole piece is a worthy example, but I particularly like the last paragraph of page 2, where he tries to twist the meaning of Turing completeness to fit his claims: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3147440
3	1522808289	2	that makes sense to medo you not understand the point he's makingit's ok to admit you don't understand somethingis what you mean by "technobabble" simply, something you don't understand
4	1522815278	2	To make sense doesn't mean its is rigorously correct, and you might know Turing Completeness is a well known rigorous (i.e. not open to interpretation) mathematical concept, right?Then he goes on redefining mathematical concepts (which might be fine in the context of your work only, because if you start telling people about turing completeness they will think you are talking the thing that is explained in every computer theory textbook published to date, not the unreviewed preprint you published online), but fail to make rigorous formal definition, even make wrong factual claims during a definition, for instance:> only decidable programs are known to run to completion on a Turing complete systemwhich is plain false, as undecidable programs might complete on some particular instances of input data.Finally he goes about formally proving something rigorously defined (Bitcoin script) fits to a poorly and informally *redefined* concept, making the whole thing a big waste of my time.
5	1522823736	1	i found it an interesting ideai hadn't thought of itdo you understand the idea he's presentinghad you thought of that
6	1522844360	1	According to your answers you are trying to hide the fact that you have 0 clue on what the paper is about. Saying "I found it an interesting idea" "do you understand" "that makes sense to me" without actually describing anything is kinda fishy. Can you elaborate?
0	1522791959	3	Got to give it to CSW for having a thick skin on the attack so far.  He went off the rails a bit I think with the bevis and twig twitter comments towards Vitalek but he seems to be going ahead full steam, undaunted, balls out for BCH despite all the noise. 
0	1522793578	4	No, it's the other way around. Whenever Craig, aka "geekmonk," is involved in a discussion, the entire thread is heavily brigaded by his minions. He is no different from Greg in his tactics.
1	1522795059	-2	That makes me think geekmonk is Greg sowing discord 
2	1522795723	0	I'm greg? I just called out the lead anti CSW troll for a live face to face debate. And he refused, for now. That alone tells you who is greg.
3	1522799561	-3	It was regarding Greg's tactics rather than a real opinion on you.
4	1522802602	5	Greg's tactics are censorship and vote brigading. CSW and everyone who takes his side is heavily brigaded and never trying to censor anyone. The exact opposite.
5	1522805935	-2	It's simple Craig, until you present a mea culpa and explain why you lied to Gavin and the rest of the community, everyone is gonna hate your ass. *Everyone* hates a liar. 
0	1522801144	2	interesting theory and pretty true. Also why did Vitalik call CSW a fraud during the Roger debate? 
0	1522804834	2	So now Vitalik is a paidBlockstream shill? 😐
0	1522805095	2	BCH is great.CSW is crap, so great! Kick him to the curb. 
0	1522794099	1	Maybe csw is about to release some tech for BCH, and they are preparing for the troll fest battle.
1	1522795123	5	That would be nice if csw did release something useful, he said May, and I hope he doesn't disappoint otherwise prepare for another shitshow.

0	1522800201	2	CSW = Satoshi. dont care what you noobs say.
0	1522799970	1	Yep, definitely a coordinated conspiracy by a small number of individuals, not a large group of unrelated individuals coming to a similar conclusion independently from publicly available facts/information. Just like it always is.
1	1522800708	5	Says the Blockstream puppet handler before he rushes to the next account to give another "unrelated" opinion.xD
2	1522802748	-2	So no non-sockpuppet can reasonably disagree with the view that people you disagree with must be driven primarily by sockpuppet based misinformation campaigns? Regardless of whether you’re right about me (which you of course don’t know), that sure does guarantee a comfy little unchallenged bubble for your worldview, doesn’t it?...unless you were being sarcastic too in which case xD
0	1522793052	-3	CSW is negan? Or satoshi? Or jesus? He is probably a gold medal athlete during the Olympics.He is a war hero during 9/11. According to himself, Craig Wright is the most interesting man in the world. And that's why he drinks Dos Equis
