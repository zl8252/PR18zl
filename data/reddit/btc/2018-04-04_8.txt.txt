0	1522803598	5	Lool why Blockstream look shy?
0	1522827306	4	Samson got destroyed.
0	1522804551	4	Needs more Adam Back waggle
1	1522805190	2	😏
0	1522812566	3	Well done Roger. You won this debate hands down. You made all of us proud.
0	1522842939	3	You can see from Samson's face that he doesn't give a shit about the success of bitcoin
0	1522805923	2	Quite a few! Two! Thank you Bitcoin Jesus. You'll rise again.
0	1522850707	2	LOL
0	1522826805	4	This doesn't make any sense, BTC has on chain transactions AND Lightning transactions. BTC transactions are as cheap as BCH transactions at the moment, but BTC is used MUCH MORE. LN is an additional, brand new option that just start to grow. I think Roger doesn't beat him, he is just emotional and Samson remains relaxed.

1	1522830604	2	"at the moment"
2	1522831094	-1	That LN is so small is also 'at the moment'. 
3	1522836746	1	> That LN is so small is also 'at the moment'. LN is never getting any **real** adoption. It just doesn't work and cannot ever work.LN is like antigravity. They basically solved all problems, except the little one with generating reversed gravitational force (or: decentralized routing).
0	1522820417	1	Could you add english subtitles to that?:)
0	1522839795	1	Please, what they say in text? :) Thanks
1	1522841950	1	I will post a better quality 
0	1522855114	1	He was about to ragequit
0	1522830671	1	Great argument.The experimental feature that the devs tell people not to use unless you're ok with running into bugs that may lose money still has very few merchants using it...How about comparing BCH and BTC total stores? Ah, right, that doesn't look good for BCH. 
0	1522808826	1	hello super bitcoin cash

0	1522826885	0	I think I can answer this question better than Samson, two weeks ago there were about 10 lightning network stores (source: http://lightningnetworkstores.com) Now, there are probably about 14, I would guess, because lightning is now integrated with BTC-pay.
