0	1522911975	98	Both impress me. 
1	1522932448	51	Just being able to memorize 12 words impresses me.
2	1522935016	14	Here's a trick.  Think of a date in each month that is special to you.  e.g. your brother's birthday or easter or Xmas etc.  Then for the first word, e.g. bike, think of your brother on a bike (assuming his birthday is in January). Picture this image in your mind. Second word (e.g. wooden) picture a wooden heart shape (valentine's day).  And so on.Practice this a couple of times and you'll find it pretty easy.  Even cooler is you can produce them in any order. 
3	1522943003	4	Nice technique. I would still not trust my brain to hold it for too long though. Only for emergencies like the one described in OP.
3	1522945792	2	or just write it down and stuff the paper in your sock, I mean really who's going to see that and immediately go oooo found me a one of them thar crypto wallets.
3	1522945186	1	Instructions unclear. Please elaborate on "Picture this image in your mind." I don't know how.
4	1522951074	1	Remember the last time you used your toilet. Which side is the flusher on? And what is the rough shape of the flusher? If you can answer, you must be able to hold an image in your mind for at least a split second. It's just a matter of noticing it.That takes care of conjuring a recalled image. Now for a new image. If Bruce Lee were to get a little tattoo of a dragon on one bump of his six pack, on which bump do you think it would look best? Does that help? 
2	1522937120	5	If your homeland turns into a gigantic pile of rubble and your life savings depend on it, I am sure you will find it an easy peasy.
1	1522926275	8	Sure, but the former is distinctly a first world convenience whereas the latter is a matter of life or death. Which situation contributes more to decentralization and revolution and which of those guys will fight to the death to maintain those privileges?I can tell you it won't be Greg Maxwell sending money via email. 
0	1522921053	52	This one hits a soft spot with me, my grandparent and his family fled a war zone in WWII, they had to leave behind EVERYTHING, their estate, their family jewelry, their bank notes. They later came here with nothing but their clothes.
1	1522922276	17	So they could have sold everything for bitcoins, but by the time transaction confirms, they'd probably be killed, so nothing really changed 
2	1522923319	11	I think the premise is: All your valuables are already in crypto before some crisis occurs.
3	1522925842	14	Was just making fun of the transaction speed back in December 
4	1522927964	-6	as was your responder who deliberately misspelled crisis
5	1522927988	7	Redditor /u/kaiise has low karma in this subreddit.
6	1522935652	3	Useful troll detector 
6	1522928167	0	thank you?
7	1522934077	-2	troll detected
8	1522936011	3	aftre being bullied by arthur chu with his anti crypto fud and crowd bullying on twitter. i find btc has turned crazy town too now. wtfEDIT: he called me a software engineer. how low can insults get?
9	1522936574	2	Most subreddits are crazy town lol. also software engineer is far from an insult 
5	1522937592	1	Happy to have learned. 
6	1522942977	0	oh i thought it was a clever subtle joke! as in it takes as long as crysis release cycles while still being faster than the guy was making out :D
7	1522943723	1	I should have left it up and pretended that was my intention all along!
4	1522926505	-6	As a general  rule, next time in order to avoid down votes, it's recommended to specify which bitcoin you're talking about ;) 
5	1522926662	1	Lol, of course the old grand pa 
6	1522928133	2	Poor old BTC, slapped by a young BCH. 
7	1522940177	-1	Wait I though BCH was the “old”  bitcoin. And BTC was the fork? Oh wait that’s just what this sub shills to convince/mislead newbies. 
8	1522940190	6	Redditor /u/ryanisflying has low karma in this subreddit.
9	1522946376	1	I like this
8	1522940712	1	I don't think you know what you're talking about. BTC core forked to what is now centralized Segwitcoin. 
9	1522945549	1	Bcore bcore bcore bcore bcore bcore!
3	1522926145	4	>All your valuables are already in crypto before some crysis occurs.The point there would be that your crypto would have to be liquid enough, and useful enough to use like cash.  The reason people often converted money and such to gold was that it was portable *and* easy to convert or directly spend.
3	1522940425	1	Trade real estate for virtual estate in Eve.
0	1522923522	7	We've been able to send money as easily as an email for decades, but this privilege was limited to bank and big corporations. Now peons can do it too.
1	1522926622	8	Until core dev came along 
0	1522921492	15	Sounds good, but still need more merchant adoption and most ppl don't want to walk around with their savings in their head, so we still have plenty of work to do for this to reach mainstream adoption.
1	1522937424	3	Honestly being able to lose everything you have saved up to someone holding you up is pretty terrifying
1	1522931737	5	The vast majority of people DO NOT WANT to be responsible for their funds 24/7.Taking a tragedy and using it as an example when you wish you could use bitcoin is a little disingenuous... if the entire rest of your life you were fine without it. 
2	1522945673	1	The vast majority of people don't want to be responsible for their safety either. It's really a sad state.
2	1522936021	1	Thought that was exactly what I wrote.  Didnt get your comment
0	1522940394	3	How about price fluctuations tho? I mean I'm all for BTC but we can't ignore that, you could be walking through a war zone and by the time you're out your savings could have been doubled or halved, which would fucking sucked if that's all you got left
1	1522949166	1	i think those people who had to leave everything behind because they could only take what they could carry would have been estatic for an alternate deal where their savings don't disapear but merely halve or double
2	1522950434	1	It could very well be less than halved, how much value has lost recently? Take in account that economies at war have already their currency devalued, imagine leaving with 2000$ because thats all you could gather and arriving to a place like Germany with less than 400$ . That would be heartbreaking at the very least, of course you could use bitcoin to take your money to websites that let you buy us currency but that would defeat the purpose of the argument wouldn't it?
3	1522951270	1	no, the thing that defeats the purpose of the argument is that the other option is to take nothing.
0	1522925396	6	Where on Forbes? Do you have a link?
0	1522923520	3	You can keep your fiat behind your ear....
1	1522925746	6	I keep my Fiat in the garage
2	1522926453	6	Is that because you have to fix it again tomorrow?
0	1522921846	8	Not sure id want to walk through a war zone with my life savings in my head..lot of people get shell shocked or worse in a war zone.And lets not speak of crypto volatility ...not sure Id be happy to see my life savings in the most volatile currency in the world esp. since many experts think bitcoin core is going to zero b/c it has no utility. 
1	1522922615	5	I'm all in ETH, lil BCH & old enough to remember BTC
2	1522926197	1	All your money in cryptocurrency is pretty fucking stupid
3	1522926863	1	Only thing that makes me unconfident is others' lack of research. All cryptos/stocks mostly track each other, despite huge fundamental differences (very irrational!). Also, more mentioning of U$D on this sub than BCH, which is backwards.Edit: not BTHEdit 2: other thing that makes me unconfident: inevitability of UBI.
3	1522926575	0	Depends how much you research. I've been fortunate enough to be retired for over a year now, used to day trade (but just this past week's shenanigans alone will tell you how phony that market is- uninstalled Yahoo Finance yesterday). I spend my days researching, I am confident, so much so I "invested" (held for more than a week) for the first time (ETH).
4	1522927517	3	You can understand fundamentals, but crypocurrency prices aren't, and haven't been for the last year, traded on fundamental analysis. Their traded because people believe its going to make them rich. The price that they are currently at might be inflated, might be too low, might be just right, but because of the way the market is, no one has a fucking clue. It's impossible to know what happens in 3 weeks to the price, as it is currently full of speculative investment. Secondly, the fact that people are fucking investing in a currency is ridiculous. If you want Bitcoin to become a dominant currency, then it would need to see serious reductions in volatility, which unfortunately will not happen if people are speculating, as there will be to many people profit taking at any given moment, and then individuals rejoining. This will lead to rises and falls as individuals dump coins and buy coins, and so unless we see a massive reduction in the investor mentaility with bitcoin, and it becomes a mentaility of lets use this as a tool to buy things, then Bitcoin will be usable as a secondary currency.Thirdly, there is no regulation on Bitcoin at the moment, leaving any individual without massive amounts of either fiat currency or bitcoin open to people to manipulate the market for their own gain, at your own expense. And when regulation does come in, there will be a crash as those who have never heard of regulation run the fuck away. Finally, why on earth are you keeping all your money in one investment. No one should do that ever, even if the company has the most wonderful mapped out growth plan, which cryptocurrencies dont. Its a recipe for disaster, and effectively a gamble on the outcome of ETH skyrocketing.edit: Didn't see your other reply, but the literature suggests, and my own calculations suggest, that Bitcoin does not correlate with stock returns, and that even it acts as a safe haven against fluctuations in other assets, meaning that its so uncorrelated, that it is likely to be safe and calm when the stock market is volatile.
5	1522928568	2	There is no regulation?? Bitcoin is fully regulated by the laws of mathematics via cryptography... laws which can not be broken.If you’re talking about government regulation, um yeah, that’s sort of the whole fucking point. Government destroyed money via printing fiat currency out of thin air. Bitcoin saves money.
6	1522931194	1	Nope talking government regulation, so prevention against insider trading, pump and dumps, manipulation of the blockchain by controlling the network. Those sort of regulations that will help normal market participants from getting fucked by rich people. Also, go read an economics textbook about QE and money. Visa still processes $11 trillion a day, fiat currencies arent detroyed. edit: not $11 trillion answer below
7	1522935808	1	> Visa still processes $11 trillion a dayThis is incorrect.  Visa processes $17bn a day or a little over $6bn per year.source: https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/about-visa/documents/visa-facts-figures-jan-2017.pdfIf you want the daddy of settlement systems, check out CLS which is the largest in the world at $5bn a day.   
8	1522936172	1	Cool thanks for pointing that out, the point still stands. I'll put an edit in to change it.
9	1522937281	1	Agreed, you've made several quality posts ITT imo
6	1522936223	0	But most of the rest of the world is regulated.  So if we want bitcoin to be part of the rest of the world regulation will be part of that.  If we are smart then we would approach this as the banks do when launching new financial products.  They get regulators comfortable with the new products.  The tell them how great they will make the world.  Unlike the banks we actually have something that really can improve things (particularly financial inclusion).  So let's get a positive message out there and be on the front foot, not running off to an island saying GFY govt and regulators we're gonna do things our own way.
5	1522928066	0	I buy physical items like motorcycles and living essentials, but other than that all ETH (5% bch).Volatility is better than consistant inflation (deflation) to me.Bitcoins a joke, [please never mention it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/88snbx/z/dwn1vfr), it encourages lack of knowledge and hurts progress for utilities.I expect to live for over three weeks.If ETH/BCH take half of Visas transactions, you can bet the prices for ETH/BCH will be much higher than current mkt cap, say half of Visas transactions (trillions).
6	1522929187	4	Oh fuck me. You can't answer any of my points. Volatility is only better than inflation when the price goes up. Inflation only reduces your wealth if you have your assets in places where the interest/return is less than inflation. And if your money is there, then why the fuck are you investing in cryptocurrency when you dont know basics of savings accounts?Bitcoin is not a joke to yourself, as you said that cryptcurrency returns are correlated, therefore you should be looking at the market leader to determine what moves other cryptos make. If you disregard Bitcoin, and say that it encourages lack of knowledge, despite being the market leader, with the highest market cap by miles, then you cannot disregard in price analysis. Further, no cryptocurrency is a utility. There currencies.Cool so tell me your prediction for Bitcoins price in 3 weeks and layout your fundamental analysis, and we can see how far off your prediction is.Finally on your point of visa transactions, cryptocurrency will take for fucking ever to reach that point. Bitcoin processed about 400,000 transactions a day at its peak, ETH/BCH have never come close to that. The same amount of transactions happen with VISA every minute. There are so many issues with refunds, usability, volatility, and these or need to be sorted before it gets to widespread adoption, and if your talking about it replacing VISA, then you would need to replace the monetary base of the EU and USA to reach this point. Unlikely to happen. Further, if there is still the passive investment mentality that your displaying, and if its widespread like it is not, then it will never reach adoption due to volatility. 
7	1522929356	-1	Bitcoin's price should be 0 BCH tomorrow if it were* up to me. If you are still talking about inflation vs. volatility and Bitcoin, after I did address those, I'm wasting my time with you.Edit: not was
8	1522931819	2	This is why I dont talk to mechanics about finance. Bitcoin played no part in my point about volatility and inflation. Go learn about how to use interest rates to keep ahead of inflation. And learn that inflation affects your cryptocurrency as well as your other assets. So yeah, trust me the feelings mutual on a waste of time. 
6	1522936807	0	> Volatility is better than consistant inflation (deflation) to meThere's some basic economics here.  If volatility remains high, crypto will never become a currency that people use regularly to transact value.The deflationary nature of bitcoin is concerning from an economics perspective as a currency that is appreciating incentivises inactivity. Why spend or even invest if your value is appreciating?  It would stagnate growth in the economy.  Most economists agree that modest inflation, circa 2%, is healthy to promote growth.
7	1522937890	0	I've read that, but still don't agree. Growth isn't inherently good if it's products like little plastic fuzzy shit getting pumped out n deposited in the ocean, or companies like Dropbox getting an IPO.
8	1522939864	2	Yeah, but growth doesn't just create plastic crap.  It creates cool stuff like technology, healthcare, entertainment.  Do you want to go backwards on this stuff?  Growth = progress
9	1522940381	1	I wonder how big of a difference inflation makes, as there'd be millions of ppl investing/researching for progress/tech no matter what. I do it while telling myself it's not for money (don't earn any directly for my consulting).
5	1522929815	-1	Volatility won't be a problem soon enough. This is modular, programmable money. We can code our way out of being affected by volatility, on an individual level. This is already happening.Read more. 
6	1522932419	4	Sources? Please provide a legitimate source how your going to code your way out of volatility and still keep Bitcoin legitimate as a currency? You going to stop price fluctuations and act as a central bank?  
7	1522933545	1	He can't provide a source because what he said isn't true. 
8	1522934010	3	Yeah pretty sure it's impossible 
6	1522937014	2	volatility against fiat presumably? How do we code for fiat volatility exactly?See how successful the central bankers are coding for volatility.  It works most of the time and then BANG you're fucked.
6	1522946509	2	That's ridiculous
3	1522928908	-4	Universal basic income is inevitable. People gambling their money irrationally proves how irrelevant/invaluable money is.
4	1522946003	1	Ubi'ers are about as stupid as flat earthers.
5	1522947502	0	You just called [Elon Musk](http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-universal-basic-income-2017-2) as stupid as a flat Earther, and that's as ironic as it gets.
6	1522948949	0	Elon Musk's entire business model is just to get money from the government. Get huge subsidies, pay the smartest engineers to work on ambitious pie in the sky projects, and rake in government money.  He is what I consider a fake entrepreneur. Remember ENRON, the genius company that was going to change the energy sector forever and its brilliant business model that would change the economy forever.   Tesla and Enron's business models are eerily similar.  Tesla is using the same accounting gimmicks and will end up with the same fate.  The ENRON/Tesla government subsidy scam keeps happening again and again and each time the CEO is heralded as a revolutionary genius.
7	1522949077	1	Tesla [paid back it's gov loan 5 years early](https://youtu.be/oY7ChVQScDo) with a bonus payment to the tax payers lmao. Fuck outta here with that unsourced BS.
1	1522947312	1	Why are you here?
0	1522932091	2	Very very true
0	1522940751	2	Sounds like a good reason to torture anyone moving their family through a war zone without cash
0	1522930456	3	Couldn’t you do both of them with PayPal?
1	1522935596	1	Only is email required a bank account linked to your email address, and if the government could freeze a crypto transaction with a phone call.   
2	1522935838	1	But what if you deposit all your money into Paypal? Then you don't need the bank account.
3	1522936397	1	Can you get money into PayPal without a bank account? I guess I was arguing that it isn’t ‘as easy’ as email since, unless your life savings is below $X, or your email provider is EXTREMELY nosy, then PayPal is certainly not as easy as email. They can and will lock funds for seeming ‘suspicious’, or if you send it to someone who may have transacted with someone else who has ever done anything suspicious.  And I would guess if either sender or receiver wasn’t linked to a bank account, or didn’t have 3 forms of ID, that would be enough to track as suspicious.  Once locked, funds can stay in limbo easily 3 months or more...perhaps indefinitely since the only recourse is through their own internal arbitration process.
0	1522940533	1	impressive!, too bad my head is not bulletproof though :(
0	1522941813	1	gamechanging
0	1522942059	1	Reminds me of Fahrenheit 451. But I'm impressed with BCH's progress. I'm seeing Andreas Antonopolous in April. He's a huge advocate of giving Bitcoin to people that can't afford banking, so curious his thoughts on LN w/ Watchtowers.
0	1522942648	1	I don’t see this on Forbes right now. Can someone send me a link?
0	1522944558	1	I’m kinda confused by the second one. Depending on the country it’s not like you’re just going to physically walk across a border. They might not let you leave. I understand the argument that your crypto will hold value globally whereas your native currency might crash in a time of war though.
0	1522950527	1	This is a good quote. The vast majority of people I encounter view crypto in very geocentric ways. The developed world doesn’t see or understand the rest of the unbanked world population. They see crypto merely in USD, yen or won values. No comprehension of other countries and their strife. 
0	1522951496	1	This was always the use case that stuck in my mind as having the most golden combination of obviously useful, massively useful, and uniquely useful (no other way to do it). A question I haven't been able to answer is, why isn't everyone in such a situation doing it by now? In 2013 I understood it was a matter of no one realizing it was an option, but how could they still not?
0	1522951546	1	hope they didn't walk out of the war zone with Verge... "oh sorry your currency is worthless now, SFYL"
0	1522924392	1	This might be impressive - but it's not something most people need to do. Indeed this should be strongly discouraged in all but exceptional circumstances because it's extremely hard to do this safely.
0	1522921776	-1	Does that mean that if i'm shot dead, my family can cut my head and carry it with them and then retrieve the seeds from it when they're in a safe place? Wow,  that's fantastic! I love bitcoin!

0	1522936970	1	This quote is deeeep! I LOVE it!
0	1522917734	-8	Not to mention getting shellshocked and not being able to remember the seed words because of PTSD. Or caught by the army and getting your whole family interrogated with a truth serum to reveal the words.Bitcoins are no different than medieval-age gold. It's just that you don't physically own the gold, only know where the pot is buried.
1	1522921276	8	Realistically, when there's a mass refugee wave, physical gold will be quickly taken by border guards & TSA agents, but it's far less likely they will bother torturing every refugee for "seed words".Carrying physical gold long distances is also a hassle, since $1 million in gold weighs about 50 lbs.Also, some wallets (like Edge Wallet) are based on a password you create, which is easier to remember than seed words.  You just have to download a new Edge Wallet when you get to your new country.
2	1522934825	3	The median net worth of an American is $80K, so 2kg of gold. Refugees from war torn countries might have a bit less. 
1	1522917801	4	What?
2	1522920274	3	I forgot to add, if the over-the-border carriers are smart enough to remember 2 pairs of seed words, so to have plausible deniability in case they're forced to reveal their Bitcoins.
2	1522918195	2	The point is valid. All systems are fundamentally insecure. Total security is an illusion. What crypto makes possible is amazing and a boon to the world but its not like the family in the above scenario has successfully secured their wealth in some definitive fashion.
3	1522918593	3	Who was claiming absolute security?
4	1522919073	1	who was claiming someone was claiming absolute security? I was just pointing out the validity of the parent comment. Great technology but its not the ultimate panacea for the family in the question.
5	1522919539	3	a asteroid could also hit earth rendering the entire planet useless. See? i love playing hypotheticals.
6	1522920051	1	You understand the initial quote is a hypothetical right? I didn't create the hypotheticals. I'm also very pro bitcoin. Your point about the asteroid is totally true and serves my point. Lets not pretend there aren't fundamental limitations at play here. It is a good technology and represents a lot of potential gains for people in the areas of financial security but there is no technology that unequivocally saves the day for the family in question. That was the initial point made, someone said "what?" and I pointed out that the parent comment had a point. That isn't to say crypto is bad or evil or defective. A point was made. It was valid. Not that earth shattering...
7	1522921369	0	It's a valid but irrelevant point.The point in the OP is the value it brings to humanity and those who are the most vulnerable.Did the OP claim it gives them god-like powers? Nope! The response is irrelevant and stupid.
3	1522918394	0	At a cost of basically nothing too.
1	1522919906	1	Still much versatile and secure than any kind of money that came before.
2	1522920178	2	With a good enough opsec, yeah.
