1	1522931549	10	Wonderful things happen with crypto in the drawn out bear years, when it loses its lustre for get-rich-quick speculators and gamblers, and the remaining people still active in the scene are there because of other reasons, like vision or tech.We might be entering these times again.
2	1522932206	3	We are almost certainly in those times

0	1522925600	19	Ping /u/memorydealers you killed it when [you reiterated our old mission.](https://youtu.be/zSbPz4g9rZQ?t=36m6s)How do we make this THE message?
1	1522945334	2	it's amazing how they twist his words to fit their own fucking agenda. all he's saying is that HALTING and limiting the upgrades to fir their own agenda  is making people who actually NEED bitcoin continue with their current lack of freedom lives and continue having their children dying because of low access to money and other things (not because they don't have hospitals, but because their governments sucks) this is just crazy. round of applause everywhere but gets twisted once it hits twitter and sockpuppets everywhere. 
1	1522928396	1	Get rid of the HODL mentality, find a way of providing the third world with mass internet coverage and devices to access Bitcoin, get banks and governments on board to regulate it to take away the threats of pump and dumps, encourage people to buy it and spend it, so that we see more circulation and less volatility. Create mass mining factories to reduce to the cost of Bitcon by supplying more, and to reduce the cost of production. Ensure those mass mining factories are operated by a number of different companies to prevent control of the network by one party. That, to me, seems to be a basic blueprint, but if involves westerners and the rich to leave Bitcoin, and as HODLers will tell you, they ent giving up their bitcoin
2	1522946425	2	> Create mass mining factories to reduce to the cost of Bitcon by supplying more, and to reduce the cost of productionYeaaaaaah, I'm not sure you have that whole part of Bitcoin figured out.  Mass mining factories are going to make it more costly to produce.  There's also a finite supply so you're not really going to "increase" it, just expedite its issuance.
3	1522946779	1	More was thinking that the power needed would cost less, as they could get better rates than individuals or smaller mining rigs. I figured if you created giant rigs in warehouses, needed a few people to monitor them, set up as a business to get electricity at cheaper rates, then yeah it would be cheaper than getting individuals to set up mini ones. Is there something I'm missing? I understand that as we get closer to the blockchain limit, the cost of mining increases, however we could minimise the increase as much as possible, by reducing the cost of production.  
4	1522947573	1	> I understand that as we get closer to the blockchain limit, the cost of mining increases? Where did you get that idea ?The cost of mining a block is almost *entirely* unrelated to the size of the block.The cost to mine is almost entirely driven by the price of the coin.
5	1522947897	1	Yep true, my mistake thanks for picking it up. But yeah, wouldn't it be more beneficial on a costs basis to do what I outlined above? Genuinely just wondering right now? 
6	1522948431	2	The variable cost of production is almost entirely equal to the cost of electricity consumed.  This cost normalizes over time to approximately equal to the value of the block being mined, ie the cost of production is essentially always roughly some factor of the price of the coin.And yes, this is exactly what has happened. Most mining is industrialized in areas with the cheapest electricity, usually places that are subsidizing mining.This was, btw, expected from the start.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306> The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  **Those few nodes will be big server farms**.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.\- Satoshi Nakamoto
7	1522948609	1	I'd assume so apart from start up and maintenance costs, what other costs of production apart from electricity are their? And yep cool didnt see that second bit initiallyOkay cool, I wasn't sure how far down that road cryptocurrency has gone. It would make sense to do it in this way. 
8	1522948803	1	>I'd assume so apart from start up and maintenance costs, what other costs of production apart from electricity are their? Plant, property, personnel, training, security...  Mining equipment depreciates *very* quickly too so it starts to feel like variable cost. Running a farm requires highly skilled personnel.  To be at the top of the game you must even design and manufacture mining equipment and your own computer chips, which is a whole other level of investment.But yes the lions share of variable cost is electricity.
9	1522949427	1	Sweet so essentially my assumption was right about mass mining factories being more beneficial. Makes sense to do it that way. Actually this is more about marginalism, than what we discussed before.
4	1522950457	1	The scenario you're talking about is already in play.  There are few small home style miners. The majority of hashpower is in large warehouses scattered across the world where power costs are lowest.There is a fixed total supply of 21M, with some small number of Million of coins outstanding.  The rate of issuance right now is 12.5 BTC per 10mins *ideally*.  That fluctuates but there is a metric called difficulty which regulates the easy/ability of a miner to generate coins.  The more participants, the higher the difficulty, the higher the average cost to generate a coin.  In a couple of years the rate of issuance drops to an ideal of 6.25 BTC per 10 mins.
5	1522951149	1	Yeah I struggle with being 100% all the time with bitcoin knowledge, especially on the mining side but yeah I knew the first part but not the details of speeds of generation. And cool sweet cheers for confirming 
2	1522929056	2	If you want to relieve volatility, let me pose a thought experiment.Which will probably be more volatile:1. A coin held by 1 billion people each earning $2/day2. Same coin held by 2 people each earning $1B/daySame buying power.
3	1522929821	1	I am confused as to how this is relevant to my point.Surely a better experiment would be to work out whats more volatile. 1) 20% of coins owned buy passive investors, who want to cash in at a certain amount, 80% owned by users for transaction purposes.2)100% of coins owned by users for transaction purposes. 
4	1522930158	3	>I am confused as to how this is relevant to my point.I'm generally agreeing with you / chiming in.
5	1522930443	3	Cool thanks, not used to supportive views on Bitcoin here :) 
6	1522930895	1	You said Bitcoin. You didn't specify a particular variant, so I assumed you meant in general.
4	1522941932	1	It's the same reason stocks split. With lower price its more accessible. When it's more accessible it's more valuable. 
0	1522925521	3	Empower the poor !! Seriously isn’t the purpose of Bitcoin to empower the early adopters ... I think even Andreas accepts that it is the new 1% that would take over the world.
1	1522925669	15	At one time, Andreas used to be one of the people most staunchly advocating Bitcoin as a way to empower the poor.Since then he has completely lost the plot.
2	1522926601	1	What about if international aid funds were converted into say a new premined crypto that would then be given to poor people in poor countries. Not sure what distortions this might cause. Anyway something along these lines.
3	1522931326	4	Read on why aid is actually the problem that's not letting the Third world grow rather than the solution. 
4	1522933621	2	That's because "aid" usually means "loans"
5	1522939015	3	Aid can also disrupt local industry by flooding the market with donated goods.
4	1522944434	1	I have and you may be right at least in part. Emergency aid is generally useful. I live in UK which keeps up aid but there are some controversies recently about payments to consultants and targeting etc etc . There is strong political dimension.
3	1522927608	2	What if the same funds were used to airdrop actual BCH?
3	1522927680	2	airdrops are nice and all but in the end they need to find ways to earn money.
4	1522928219	2	I agree.Then the solution *must* be to create jobs that pay in BCH and markets that accept BCH.
5	1522932240	2	I agree this is the solution, but also the hardest thing to pull off. How will we make employers in Venezuela pay their people with BCH?
6	1522933438	2	Here's two ideas off the top of my head.Supply side: Pay offshore workers BCH. Venezuela has people who are currently working for USD. Pay BCH instead.  Promote a job board to help people find jobs that pay in BCH.Demand side: Get landlords to accept BCH. Most people spend a disproportionate amount of their income on rent. Just being able to pay that one person in BCH would represent BCH becoming a significant monthly expenditure and would be a serious incentive to earn in BCH.
2	1522935977	1	I love Andreas and his talks have provided me a wealth of knowledge. I have noticed that his earlier talks versus his later talks were more focused on the zero fees aspect. The language now seems to be "nearly zero or low fees". While I see 2nd layer solutions as inevitable, I don't understand why there can't be *some* flexibility on block size as storage, processing, and internet infrastructure improves over time. Seems it could buy us the needed time to grow adoption while also proofing out 2nd layer solutions. 
0	1522928079	3	The only reason that bitcoin can not be used by the poor is blockstream.
0	1522929472	3	back to the roots
0	1522934745	3	I 100% agree. I believe that if Bitcoin is to succeed, it will be in developing countries first. Why? Because for people to use Bitcoin instead of the local currency and credit cards, it must be economically advantageous to do so. For most first world uses (other than drugs, gambling, etc), there is little advantage using Bitcoin over existing systems.The biggest advantage for using bitcoin comes in the countries with the most unstable currencies and undeveloped payment systems. That is where bitcoin will succeed or fail. Nothing would help adoption more than a few employers paying their staff in Bitcoin Cash in developing countries.
1	1522935359	1	Nailed it.  This is exactly my view.
1	1522944562	1	Definitely!Now do these people in these developing countries value a more centralized crypto-currency or a more decentralized crypto-currency?
0	1522943937	3	Thank you. And I think it's great Roger pushed the boundary by using a baby as an example because it's made people talk, whether they're aware of the level of truth in it or not.
0	1522949981	3	I'm a long-time resident of Colombia and am gearing up to do a big crypto adoption project in Medellín precisely to create a template for mass adoption that can be applied elsewhere, precisely to improve economic freedom for the poor.Looking for advisors and collaborators. I'm already working with some folks here and we are still in the early stages.
0	1522935123	2	To qualify things, I'm mentally slow and this is my opinion.Basically, we have a problem with adoption because the banks cut off easy ways for first worlders to purchase crypto which arguably crashed the market. Oh, and the first world governments made it so you have to pay income tax/capital gains on your "investment". And this happened after a giant tax cut for the rich...We essentially _need_ the poor to onboard it or it's not getting onboardedThink South American and African economies. Think first world poor not paying taxes on their crypto income is either going to cause a shitstorm or cause change.to add: You should pay your taxes. It's the _fair_ thing to do. (_pay attention oligarchs_|)
1	1522935246	6	>We essentially _need_ the poor to onboard it or it's not getting onboardedYes, basically this.
0	1522935534	2	Online marketplace that connects developers and entrepreneurs like Elance would be a great way to move BCH into third world countries for work.
0	1522928985	5	I really can’t believe that y’all are eating up the “but what about the children” comment. To even think that Bitcoin would have an impact on MOST people who are not economically free is ignorant. Most people are not economically free because either their leader/government does not want them to be or because their leader/government are irresponsible and have no idea how to create a functioning economy. For example, I’m sooooo sure that if Bitcoin was adopted worldwide right now that North Koreans would be free as fuck. Don’t forget about the African villages, I’m sure the war lords will just leave everyone alone because bitcoin. /sI’m not saying that it wouldn’t help anyone escape economic peril, I’m just saying that third world countries are what they are for a reason. Introducing bitcoin to third world countries will more than likely have almost zero impact.
1	1522929524	8	Not only did I swallow the story I find it delicious and satisfying, and your rebuttal strengthens my argument.  By the way, this argument was fleshed out years ago, before you ever heard about Bitcoin. It's sad that you're just now getting exposed to it.First off, economics happens at the margins. Will ALL poor people be able to participate? No. But billions could, and perhaps tens or hundreds of millions will.Secondly, cryptocurrency does not require government endorsement.  In places where people are already regularly violating laws to deal with their collapsed economies, including using foreign currency or printing their own paper currency, cryptocurrency is definitely a viable alternative.Next: you can't have your cryptocurrency savings confiscated in the same way as savings in a bank or even a stash of gold or banknotes.Finally Zimbabwe and Venezuela are not run by "warlords" but rather by highly corrupt factions of people in official political positions.  These people depend on printing official money to stay in power. Anything that routes around their inflationary money is empowering to the holder.
2	1522932356	1	Jess, come on man. Let's not become extremists ourselves.Roger, and anyone else who says "economic freedom for all", is COMPLETELY right.Blockstream killing babies? Come on. Especially since Adam Back and crew have given so much other material over years. Tabs.  Censorship. Toxicity.Let's not become PETA.
3	1522933552	6	https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89t1cc/think_roger_was_exaggerating_when_he_said_samsonReal economics happens at the margins.That means: take away a source of empowerment, *literally* (though indirectly) kill a baby.
4	1522940280	1	[deleted]
5	1522941194	1	Economics works like this: when you take away people's money through hyperinflation or confiscation, people at the margins die.Ethics works like this: failing to take an action that could save a life is morally equivalent to assisting in killing.Those are the dots. Connect them if you will.

2	1522934463	-3	If you think for one second that bitcoin can’t be shut down by a government, you’re wrong. Sure, a small minority will still get their hands on it if they want it bad enough, but wouldn’t that defeat the purpose of bitcoin? If it’s hard to get ahold of and hard to spend then what’s the point? That’s what I’m talking about. Bitcoin is not going to magically turn corrupt and greedy people of power into generous sympathetic leaders. As long as humans exist there will always be greed. Bitcoin won’t change that. People of power will more than likely control wealth for a very long time, if not for the rest time. 
3	1522934841	6	>If you think for one second that bitcoin can’t be shut down by a government, you’re wrong. Oh my. It's like the 2011 buttcoiner days all over again....No, government can't "shut down" Bitcoin.FFS these governments can't even keep their people from using USD cash and paper money literally has to cross a physical border.In Greece they even started their own illegal payment networks:http://www.wsj.com/articles/alternative-currencies-flourish-in-greece-as-euros-are-harder-to-come-by-1439458241Orhttps://www.thebrokebackpacker.com/changing-money-venezuelas-black-market/The official exchange rate was 6 bolivars to the dollar, in reality the black market rate was 250 bolivars to the dollar.Did Venezuela "shut down" the dollar?  If it's illegal to use, why do people want it so bad?> If it’s hard to get ahold of and hard to spend then what’s the point? Because it's still better than holding cash that LITERALLY will be worth less than toilet paper by tomorrow (Venezuela) or having your life savings "bailed in" (Greece)
4	1522935576	0	We are obviously never going to agree on wether or not bitcoin can be shut down. This arguments going to go in circles so I’ll just have to agree to disagree. What I’m saying is, if only an extremely small amount of people can use it, then it’s not changing anything as a whole. 
5	1522936220	2	If you think that government can shut down Bitcoin and that only a handful of people can use it, then I must assume that you hold no crypto?Regardless of whether or not Bitcoin can be "shut down", the best way to make sure that only a tiny handful of people can use Bitcoin is the block size limit, so hopefully we agree that BCH is the way forward.>What I’m saying is, if only an extremely small amount of people can use it, then it’s not changing anything as a whole. I know. I heard you. I repeat: real economics happens at the margin.
6	1522939311	1	I just think you underestimate how powerful the government can be. I hold plenty of crypto, I run a mining operation. 
7	1522940475	2	> I run a mining operationO_oBut the all powerful government can just take it away from you!I doubt you've ever mined a coin, but if you have, then your money and your mouth are in two different places entirely.  Anyone who thinks that cryptocurrency basically exists at the pleasure of the state would be a fool to mine a coin.
8	1522941293	1	I don’t think the US government will shut it down so I set up a mining operation. Is it a risk? Sure, but what start up business isn’t? I didn’t say MY government will shut it down. I said a government could if they wanted to. I’m actually putting my money where my mouth is, not sure what you’re talking about.
9	1522948357	2	By that logic the Russian government can shut down the internet?  Sorry, I don't see it.
4	1522939707	0	No, government can shut down a distributed cryptocurrency, but they can implement regulations on its usage. This severely limits the users of the currency, as its only purpose would be for illegal means. It means no legal wallets, or legal exchanges. So no, they cannot directly shut it down, but if the four main markets got together and outlawed cryptocurrency, then it would be fucked, and solely used on the dark net. Worst case scenario for Bitcoin would be for USA, China, EU, UK, Japan to ban its use. Force all exchanges to move servers. Massive loss of mining power, as people flock to other cryptos. Mass sell off. Price craters. Hits a bottom, no liquidity left, so HODLers are left holding a hard drive worth more than its contents. Only way of exchanging is to go through a third party exchange. Essentially, governments can shut down Bitcoin, just not in the way you think. If they cooperated on this issue any secondary currency would be absolutely fucked, let alone Bitcoin.
5	1522940650	2	So explain why Greece can't shut down the *centralized* illegal payment networks taking the place of banking and why Venezuela can't shut down the *physical* USD that literally has to cross a border, is illegal as tender, and yet is *prized above all money?*I reiterate: *real economics happens at the margins.*And no, hurting the price isn't "shutting down Bitcoin." 
6	1522941116	1	Keep reiterating, I'm not arguing about economics at the margins. Greece can't shut down illegal payments because the government is weak and so is the currency, therefore there is an incentive to have a second currency that doesn't suffer from the same issues the primary currency does. The reason Venezuela can't stop currency coming in is because that currency is not inflating massively, and so the public want it, because USD is stable. Secondly, the government is weak in Venezuela as well, with massive civil unrest. Bitcoin is used primarily in those five countries. These countries don't have another secondary currency as for most citizens they find fiat acceptable. The governments are rich and powerful in these countries. There are a number of legal entities gaining the majority of their revenue from Bitcoin. These countries get together, ban Bitcoin. What happens to the legal businesses? Do they sell in an orderly manner, or is it a fire sale? This is worst case right? So fire sale. 100,000s Bitcoins on the market all at once. Demand and supply laws, means that price will crater (yes real economics). So then who has an incentive to use Bitcoin? Not the investors, or the stores, or those buying stuff with it, or anyone doing anything legally. Only criminals, who want to keep their money outside the hands of the law. 
7	1522942380	2	> I'm not arguing about economics at the margins.I am, because that's where real economics happens.> So then who has an incentive to use Bitcoin?The people of Greece and Venezuela. The people at the margins.
8	1522942880	1	Guessing you took one class in economics, heard a phrase and now parrot it when you think economics is involved. Margin theory is about additional units, so please point out where relevant in my argument at all? Also, dont be stupid, the people of Greece have been banned from using it in this hypothetical.
9	1522943585	2	>Guessing you took one class in economics, heard a phrase and now parrot it when you think economics is involved.That would not be an accurate guess.> Margin theory is about additional units, so please point out where relevant in my argument at all?I'm guessing you googled the terms "margin economics" and skimmed an article on "margin theory" to come up with that answer, and thus can't understand the relevance.Here, this is as good as any place to start.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarginalismIf you have more time I'd consider this.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0289.1989.tb00485.x> Also, dont be stupid, the people of Greece have been banned from using it in this hypothetical.And that my friend is exactly why they are on the margin.
5	1522940021	1	Thank you for putting it into words for me lol. 
1	1522943080	3	Because bitcoin (the concept) is NOT about white college kids going in debt with their credit card to buy a fucking Moon Lambo. 
2	1522943385	1	The concept is not, I agree. But the white college kids wanting a moon lambo is why bitcoin is so popular right now so don’t hate on those guys. Bitcoin is for everyone, how it is used is up to whoever acquires it. That’s the beauty of it, no? 
3	1522944065	3	It can't be for everyone with high fees. 
4	1522947965	1	whem I say bitcoin, I mean bitcoin as a whole. 
3	1522948041	1	> Bitcoin is for everyoneWrong. Please reread OP. According to BTC's leadership, BTC is NOT for everyone.
4	1522949470	1	I don’t give a fuck what btc leadership says. I believe Bitcoin should be for everyone. 
5	1522949766	1	So do we. That's why we split the chain and created Bitcoin Cash.
6	1522951472	1	Which is good! Now we can let the best bitcoin win. 
1	1522933232	2	> Most people are not economically free because either their leader/government does not want them to be or because their leader/government are irresponsible and have no idea how to create a functioning economy.It sounds like you agree that taking the control of the economy and monetary supply out of these people's hands is a good idea.And how can giving these people *more* options be a bad thing ever?
2	1522934665	1	How do you suppose we get it out of their hands? I’m not saying it will never benefit poor people. I’m saying that it’s not going to benefit the majority of them. 
3	1522935804	3	>How do you suppose we get it out of their hands? Stop using the money they depend on for power.>I’m not saying it will never benefit poor people. I’m saying that it’s not going to benefit the majority of them. There you go again. Real economics happens at the margins.Who cares what the majority does anyway?  Why is that important? Sure I'd be happy if *all* the world's poor could use BCH, but I'll be absolutely delighted to help "only" 30%, or even say 10%, of the world's billion-plus poorest people.Edit: actually I'd be incredibly delighted to reach only 0.1% (1M) of the world's poorest billion people, *if those people formed a closed BCH economy*.  Once we get there, it's really game over for fiat, just a matter of time.
4	1522936323	1	Ok, so the government WANTS to use bch. Starts paying employees in bch. They still get to choose how much they pay them. 
5	1522936517	1	>Ok, so the government WANTS to use bch. ???Where did you get that?> They still get to choose how much they pay them. And people can still choose if the pay is fair, or take a different job. However if they accept a job that pays BCH not bolivars they won't be getting paid in toilet paper.
6	1522938465	1	So if the corrupt government decides to tax the shit out of everyone what’s the difference between toilet paper and .00001 bch
7	1522939958	1	Before I continue, do you or do you not hold any crypto whatsoever?  If so, why?  If not, why are you here?
8	1522940564	1	I hold quite a bit, I run a mining operation of 84 miners. I believe that bitcoin will succeed and I think it would be great if everyone could use if it becomes fully adopted. I suppose I just take a realistic(pessimistic?) view on a lot of things and I feel like there is this narrative that bitcoin is going to set EVERYONE free and it’s just not. There will always be poverty and unethical leaders in this world. I just think it is silly to say that blockstream is killing babies.
9	1522947826	1	I'll tell you what I told the other guy.Economics works like this: when you take away people's money through hyperinflation or confiscation, people at the margins die.Ethics works like this: failing to take an action that could save a life is morally equivalent to assisting in killing.Those are the dots. Connect them if you will.
1	1522931113	3	I, as a core supporter, still have that as an end goal. Difference is, I'm not going to sacrifice "uncensorable, distributed" for "fast, cheap". We need to make the core layer as uncensorable and distributed as possible, and if *that* means we have to push "fast, cheap" to a layer on top of it, then that's what we'll do!Simple.And I don't buy the "1 TB is possible today!" crap. Technically it is, but *not* without sacrificing on "disitributed, uncensorable" properties. Not at all.And being able to run a full node matters. It increases your own financial security, and the financial security of the coin is the sum of all peoples financial security! Remember that!
2	1522933697	7	>I, as a core supporter, still have that as an end goal. Difference is, I'm not going to sacrifice "uncensorable, distributed" for "fast, cheap". We need to make the core layer as uncensorable and distributed as possible, and if *that* means we have to push "fast, cheap" to a layer on top of it, then that's what we'll do!Yeah but you aren't doing that. The layer you've built isn't scalable, nor is it decentralized or uncensorable.  You've been bamboozled.>And I don't buy the "1 TB is possible today!" crap.Neat. I don't buy the "it has to do it *today* or its impossible" crap either.>And being able to run a full node matters. It increases your own financial securityThat is sheer balderdash.
2	1522943472	2	WTF makes you think a 1mb limit is the optimal output of bitcoin? Is that some holy number? It is pure nonsense. Anyone who bothers to run nodes can EASILY deal with slightly bigger blocks. The whole idea of an artificial cap during the adoption phase is crazy. That's why BCH. 
3	1522944796	1	I don't think that 1 MB is the optimal number. However, I believe allowing more adoption without increasing the block size is *much* more important than cheap and fast, now.

If political corruption and oppression are keeping these countries down, then surely more choice to escape their influence will help. One *major* choice is how to engage in economic interactions. If you have a choice *other* than barter and/or inflationary fiat, surely you have a better chance at improving your lot in life. We shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking bitcoin or other cryptos will be an instant liberator, but we also shouldn't abandon properties of these protocols that allow it to have a chance in these corrupt countries. 
2	1522938983	1	I agree 100%. It’s just that so many people need to be realistic and not say things like “blockstream is killing babies”. Like I said, this will certainly help some, but not all. 
3	1522939061	1	Agreed. That language actually sets conversation back because it's like reaching for the nuke button (by calling your 'opponent' a murderer). We will work all these details out in the end, it will just take time. Calling someone a baby killer just makes ironing out these details that much harder. 
4	1522939556	1	I know, it’s so hostile right now it’s insane. I really wish people would just let everything go, shake hands, and let the best bitcoin win. I personally think this situation is perfect for bitcoin. We have both sides of the scaling debate covered.

1	1522940899	1	That's simply not true.To use BCH one only needs *access* to a computer.To receive, one needs only an address.To send, one needs a device. Any phone with SMS support will do.

1	1522950578	1	1. Odds are very good that Lightning will never work as promised, as it is, it's a joke2. If Lightning does ever work as promised, it can trivially be implemented on BCH3. But by then I expect BCH adoption to have already left BTC adoption far behind4. If Lightning was actually a good idea I'd still be holding 100% BTC5. But if Lightning was actually a good idea I'd probably not have been kicked out of rbitcoin for criticising it

1	1522949481	1	Fine, I'll play. So what cryptocurrency do you recommend?
2	1522950617	1	Right now clearly the least volatile one. 
0	1522937735	0	What might be a possible way for something which cannot be used by people making less than $2 a day, to empower the financial freedom of those making less than $2 a day?
0	1522942488	0	The way I see it is Bcash was designed to empower guys like Roger Wu

0	1522939990	-1	I do not understand this post at all so I'll just ask what we all really want to know. What does this mean for the price of BCH?
