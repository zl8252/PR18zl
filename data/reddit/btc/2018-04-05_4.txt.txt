0	1522876380	25	LOL, love how Samson nervously shakes his water bottle.
1	1522897997	11	The body language is telling in this interaction. Mow is trying to appear relaxed but the fidgeting betrays his efforts. Roger is definitely looking aggressive, but no more than I would expect from a successful entrepreneur.

0	1522887549	14	I don't get it, LN is quite new, why would there be a bunch of stores using it?   What does that prove?  Genuinely curious. 
1	1522892020	15	Because Lightening network was promised as scaling solution for 1mb block limit years ago. 
2	1522911266	2	Exactly! The point wasn't lightning vs BCH. It was lightning vs the original BTC solution and the opportunity cost of splitting all the adoption and transaction onto other alts. 
2	1522936686	1	Ahhh, so it's taken quite a while for adoption then.  I see.
1	1522897245	3	You are too thoughtful to participate in this thread.
1	1522940501	1	> What does that prove?That removing the use case for existing stores, for example Steam, in favor of a new, untested and not finished LN was idiotic.
0	1522872717	14	BOOM!

0	1522885010	7	Why should a shop accept LN payments if its still in beta phase? nobody accepted bitcoin as well in the beginning
1	1522888087	1	most of my crypto is bitcoin... there are a few bitcoin ATMs in my area, but my main *use* for bitcoin is for trading small positions in alt-coins.
0	1522879532	16	I fail to see the "destruction" and looking at the graveyard of similar comments on other threads I suppose I will suffer the same fate, but so be it, I will still try to understand.How are these two systems even comparable at this stage? Bitcoin Cash has benefited of what the ecosystem developed for years for Bitcoin, it required only few adaptations to systems such as Bitpay to "adopt" it, making it available to virtually all the existing merchants that already supported Bitcoin through them. Lightning Network is a system for which the first beta working on mainnet was released less than 3 weeks ago. Before a malleability fix could be implemented in Bitcoin there was no incentive to develop this technology, it wouldn't have been testable/deployable on a significant scale, anyhow development still continued and it made it possible to have a release on mainnet within months of this fix being implemented. So this comparison seem like a false equivalence by the sheer magnitude of both systems, which is a logical fallacy.Later in this debate, the only argument he brought to the table for being in such a rush for this adoption to happen is that babies are getting killed, without much context/examples or in other words by vaguely generalizing a situation claiming that this was the direct cause of babies' deaths. While sound money might be a solution to this problem at some point, it isn't in any way the announced goal of any of these projects. Before anyone rains on me, I would also love for Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in any of their form to solve this, but clearly it would be an indirect resolution. So this turns out to be the perfect example of a "will someone think of the children" fallacy (appeal to emotions/pity), it's unbelievable how this very old trick seems to still work on crowds these days.So someone please enlighten me on how using fallacies lead to "destroying" the other party in a debate? In my book, if you have to resort to these tactics you have actually lost, not just the debate, but credibility.
1	1522882516	22	> false equivalenceBlockstream forced the whole world to wait for that shitty system with a forced small block size, bribes for developers, censorship and a divided community.The fact that LN is so shitty the two can't even be compared is decidedly not a point in your favour at all.
2	1522888860	4	> The fact that LN is so shitty the two can't even be compared is decidedly not a point in your favour at all.Slain. 
2	1522917938	0	> The fact that LN is so shitty the two can't even be compared is decidedly not a point in your favour at all.Your opinion on the merits of LN does not make Ver's argument a valid equivalence though, so it remains a fallacious argument. You can judge the system on its own as you've just did but comparing them like this in a debate is dishonest due to the current difference in magnitude of both systems.I'm also not sure how any of this is in or not in my favour, I was only pointing out fallacies in Ver's argumentation and certainly not claiming that one system was better than the other.
1	1522884020	9	The thing is, almost everyone agrees that Bitcoin isn't the best crypto out there, technically. But that it has "network effect".To define the "network effect" in any sort of meaningful sense, you'd have to either talking about merchant adoption, or number of people who own coins. Forcing everyone to upgrade to LN throws merchant adoption out the window. So all you're left with is the distribution of coins. Which, as of the fork was exactly the same for Bitcoin Cash.LN is starting over as far as merchant adoption goes. It's on a level playing field with every random shitcoin in that respect. Except it's not even done/stable right now.Everyone who owned Bitcoin before August now has BCH as well, so regardless of what "network effect" BTC there's literally no reason at all for anyone to stick with BTC. Except name recognition. That's literally *all* it has going for it, aside from a faint hope that LN will somehow be better than everyone just moving over to some other coin.

1	1522882453	3	Nah man, segwit and lightning network has benefited from what bitcoin created. Now those software takeovers have taken all the exchange pairs and the price that BCH should have had.What is funny is that software has yet to prove it's utility and benefits yet people like you still cling on to it and talk a bunch of smack and have nothing to back it up.BCH is bitcoin, and it's adoption is telling. The old bitcoin is still relying on the old tech that made it a once good currency. Now it's fee ridden centralized garbage.
1	1522910044	1	You can see how many babies your transaction has killed in the blockchain soon. There are a few wallets who will change the sat fee by "amount of killed babies/transaction". Samson told them.
0	1522888277	11	Roger's general tone and attitude is quite off-putting

0	1522878460	3	Just got shadow banned again on Twitter for talking bad about BTC :( Seems like each time I call out Samson Mow I get shadow banned. 
0	1522891220	1	And how many merchants accept BCH compared to BTC? 
1	1522891255	13	Through bitpay over 100,000 minimum 
2	1522898697	3	I bet every single one of those and more also accept BTC payments. 
3	1522915988	3	Of course they do, most Bitpay users don't care one way or the other - they convert to cash and have it transferred to their accounts.
0	1522881746	4	this is stupid.  A: "how many fully autonomous cars are currently on the streets"  B: "uhh zero?!"  A: "you see folks! autonomous cars are shit!" 
1	1522884854	18	Your analogy is stupid.Bitcoin has worked fine for years until guys decide that we stop scaling at 1 MB.Lightning is just an excuse to stop scaling bitcoin.
2	1522896553	3	Does anyone remember when the goal post was : lightning is vaporware?And now its not so the goalpost is : not enough shops accept this beta product that is upgraded every week?So when multiple exchanges accept lightning, and then the exchanges settle transactions and trades with lightning and dont hold funds anymoreWhat will the criticism be then? Lets just speculate on it“The mobile user interface sucks because the lite client is still vaporware, this was all a ploy from blockstream to force people to use desktops, bitcoin worked fine for years with spv clients on mobile”Then someone releases good mobile softwareWhat will the critique be then? Just speculate with me

2	1522896774	2	Non autonomous cars also worked fine for years, does that mean we should just stop there?
3	1522929131	3	Gonna put in a soft fork to slow down non-autonomous cars to 20 mph so that the autonomous cars work better. They'll be lightning fast in future, just you wait! 
2	1522913945	-2	yeah it's a big conspiracy /s
1	1522882505	13	Well they’re comparable products so not really. Bitcoin Cash can already facilitate transactions. So the point being made is that BCH is the more successful product given that it is already ready for use. And the only reason BTC can’t do what BCH does is because the developers are making it shit. Edit: I am hoping lightning network makes BTC not shit. I don’t want them to fail but I’m also not going to hold my breath. I’m simply pro-use. 
2	1522913656	1	the manually driven car is a successful product too and it's perfectly comparable to a fully autonomous car.
3	1522929206	2	Gonna put in a soft fork to slow down non-autonomous cars to 20 mph so that the autonomous cars work better. They'll be lightning fast in future, just you wait!   
1	1522940911	1	Your analogy is wrong.A better one would be forcibly replacing human driven cars with autonomous cars. Before they exist.
0	1522890841	1	Did anyone else find it just a little comical that he brought up dying children!? That's a bit of a stretch I think. Lol
1	1522899303	5	I don't think he is wrong, but it kinda took the conversation to 100 real fast. Mow couldn't get basic points across without putting his foot in his mouth, so he for sure wasn't ready to address something that heavy. 
1	1522902604	2	> just a little comical> LolYep, dying kids are comedy gold.

0	1522881560	-3	This is sad actually. When you think about it for any new tech it always takes times to be adopted or changed to something better. same story for bitcoin.
1	1522885060	7	Interesting brain conditioning you guys have been sucked into.Bitcoin has been adopted since 2009. Scaling has been halted with a 1 MB block limit.There would be no scaling debate at all when core developers would allow blocks up to 2MB or 4MB.

1	1522884414	11	Not the same at all. You're being fooled for thinking " it just takes time"They promised it as a solution to the current backlogged tx problem. They used it to trick everyone to agree with them then stop honoring 2x blocksize to ease the backlog. After 2 yrs, they now say it just takes time and you bought it. Seriously, the only reason they want to cripple on chain is because their plan to change bitcoin for their private investors. If it is just about the tech, there is absolutely no reason NOT to increase the network capacity until LN works. 
2	1522886706	0	Any engineer know's that it takes a lot of time to develop software.  This is especially true for crypto technologies.  You can't just push something to production, see what works and what's broken, and then push a fix.  It's gotta be completely correct on the first try.I'm sure you're going to disagree, but I'm personally glad the devs are taking the time they need to get this right, letting the perfect get in the way of the good, so that Bitcoin can become something that will last for thousands of years.One does not simply overhaul the entire global financial system.
3	1522891006	7	The point is noone is asking them to "push" their new "cool" tech. They cripple what is already working for their "cool" tech and lie their way through. Your mental gymnastic is amazing. 
1	1522885462	5	I don't oppose LN, I just find it ironic that people have insisted you can't remove the transaction limit in the meantime because of LN. 
2	1522885925	-1	I think for each a valid reason to go with. the big question is which one will prove itself a better solution in the long run. To only think of one way solution for anything is not how things go for the better.

Both could have been possible simultaneously: On-chain and Off-chain scaling.But most likely the second layer would have been rendered as a useless solution as soon people realize that bitcoin actually scales and always had scaled before.
