This was always ground zero of adoption.You proved your inexperience with the project when you laughed at Roger. He was repeating the first, and still *best* case for how crypto achieves world adoption.  It is moreover a noble cause that could better all mankind.And you laughed.
1	1522885799	13	People are joking and laughing about it, seriously this is the first time i want to call them names i guess its a f****ing weakness to me but i will just ignore, this was one of the main reasons i joined Bitcoin.
2	1522918620	1	he didn't just laugh at it on stage, he went on twitter and started saying bad things about Roger. 
1	1522882570	9	Right on!
1	1522919549	2	He was laughing at Roger's over the top approach--the delivery not the message
2	1522921789	6	It only appears "over the top" if you think people dying and societies staying stuck in various forms of slavery is trivial or funny.When you understand the mission as Roger and myself do, then you realize that Roger has every right to be worked up, and frankly, to punch Samson's smug round smirking face.  Seriously, that man is a cancer.
3	1522922110	-1	Or if you think somehow enabling people who don't have money to transmit money creates wealth....that could also be humorous 8/
4	1522922428	5	I see.To you, someone who earns less than $2 a day **has no money.**That is the **entire** problem with you elitists.  Seriously, go pound sand.
5	1522922645	0	Um what? What I said was *solving the cheap money transmission problem does not solve poverty.*Roger is implying that somehow being able to send small quantities of value for almost zero fees will help poor people. It won't. They don't have any money to remit. The problem is much much further upstream. Please prove me wrong with a logical argument. I want to believe.
6	1522922980	6	O_oSurely you understand this.Solving the cheap, sound money problem allows people who currently have to earn in hyperinflationary money to earn instead in deflationary money and allows them to participate in the global online workforce which requires some way to receive funds online.Does this singlehandedly "solve poverty". No. But when you have no access to banking and live in a hellhole, having access to a currency that doesn't devalue 10% per day and can't be trivially confiscated, and having the ability to receive and transmit funds online is a necessary precondition.
7	1522923243	0	You're either purposely obtuse or still learning. Guess how much of an impact inflation has on a $700/yr income? Guess how life changing a 3-10% inflationary change is in that income? Guess how many computers and "online skills" and wifi these folks have? If they could participate in this global economy (they can't, for reasons having nothing to do with currencies) then this conversation would be moot and we'd be discussing a marginal improvement in their financial means (or 3% credit card fees charged by PayPal et al). Please think about this because YOU are doing more harm than good for these folks by believing in a propping up lies. 
8	1522923652	4	>Guess how much of an impact inflation has on a $700/yr income?Venezuela has inflation of **over 6000%** and climbing to a projected **13,000%** this year.In 2009, Zimbabweâ€™s inflation reached **500 billion percent.**The effect can be *extreme.*>Guess how life changing a 3-10% inflationary change is in that income? 3-10% PER DAY can definitely be life changing.  1000% *per day* can mean life or death.>Guess how many computers and "online skills" and wifi these folks have? Literally **billions** have access to computers but no access to banking or online transactions.
9	1522946115	3	Thanks again for using the two extreme examples at your disposal.In these two cases you are correct and I applaud your commitment. Continue your honorable mission. 
9	1522926885	2	Even 3% a year is bullshit anyways. On the aggregate thats a fuckton of wealth.
2	1522944245	1	No, truthfully the "laughter" was an act.
0	1522873013	29	But they need to have gatekeepers if you're trying to scale to a global system otherwise how would they be able to control people that have no money?
0	1522885279	34	I don't think people get it, especially the new Bitcoin adopters. This always was one of the motivations for Roger Ver to start to promote Bitcoin (pre-Blockstream), he talked about wars and deaths caused by them many times, and Blockstream just stopped adoption literally for years. This was also one of the main reasons why many people joined Bitcoin, including me. The amount of people joking about it, currently, is extremely scary, i can only conclude that money > people lifes. 
0	1522873023	59	Thanks /u/MemoryDealers for showing just how damaging Blockstream has been to Bitcoin!
1	1522909986	2	Equating this to a diminution of economic freedom in Africa and babies dying makes you guys come across as absolute nutjobs though ...We can all thank Roger Ver for making it clear to everyone what kind of logic goes on in his head.
2	1522916073	0	> Equating this to a diminution of economic freedom in Africa and babies dying makes you guys come across as absolute nutjobs though ...to be honest, i think everyone kind of new it before.basically every argument for BCH being better has been disproved, and so they are instead saying that Blockstream kill children in the developing world. 
3	1522919019	1	Soo, the tx is not faster? No cheaper tx? You know.. bch work as intended, it's a currency. A fast and cheap one.Tell me why bcore is better than Bitcoin cash, give me one solid argument for why bcore is a better currency 
1	1522909570	3	This has to be a joke? Firstly, you're putting words in his mouth and trying to make his statement seem less erratic - because he specifically references children dying because Core hurt adoption, because they didn't raise the blocksize. Because the blocksize was not raised immediately without any research the people responsible for the delay helped to kill children? This side has hit a completely new low in terms of morality and logic. I'm all for raising the blocksize on BTC and it is annoying that not doing so hurt adoption, but to link it to dying children is literally insane. I didn't think it was possible that this sub could lower its credibility, but standing behind *that* statement as valid.....incredible.Edit: I mean just to really ram the point the extent of this idiocy in this thread you are "revealing" to everyone that poor Countries have bad hospitals and that bad hospitals means more people die, including children. The implication is Bitcoin can provide economic freedom which would improve the wealth of more opressive countries, this would allow them to lead higher quality of life with better Hospital care, then saying that not increasing the blocksize delayed that process.....I mean, seriously? 
2	1522912662	4	Hi /u/BCHisRogersCoin,It seems as though you're fairly new to the crypto scene based on your account age and username, so hopefully you'll forgive me when I say that it seems like you've jumped to a few conclusions prematurely.Firstly, I feel you've misjudged the purpose of Bitcoin Cash, and by extension Roger's public position on and promotion of the fork. Second, while I can only truly speak for myself in this,(although from the impressions I get from this community the majority of us here feel the same way) the true goal I see at the end of the tunnel for this movement is a global financial independence the likes of which we have not really seen in human history.The argument that the OP is supporting here is not *primarily* directed at the actions of Core (although it is saying they're somewhat culpable given the roadblock to technological progress they've imposed), but at the current global financial system that I see Bitcoin (now Bitcoin Cash) as the silver bullet to replacing.There are **a huge** number of hurdles that cryptocurrency has to overcome to become a financially viable option for 2nd and 3rd world nations, but the sentiment from this community (including Roger), is that we no longer have hurdles being imposed, deliberately or otherwise, on this goal from within the movement in the form of a questionable scaling roadmap, or artificially high usage fees.The aim should always be to keep the barrier for entry and usage as low as humanly possible, so people who only earn $2 *a day* can experience the financial freedom that most of us 1st world redditors are used to experiencing, and so that a censorship-resistant, pseudonymous digital currency is available to anyone who needs it at any time.I urge you to read more about the scaling debate, and look deeper into the *actual* changes which each August 2017 fork made, and then make your conclusions based on those details rather than knee jerk reactions from the BTC fans.This movement really does have the power to change the world, but to do this we need to work together and build it into something unstoppable, otherwise (as is the case with the US) we run the risk of these token becoming just another speculative asset to store (fiat) value in, and which are taxed according to profit...
3	1522926048	-1	>It seems as though you're fairly new to the crypto scene based on your account age and username, so hopefully you'll forgive me when I say that it seems like you've jumped to a few conclusions prematurely.Sorry to disappoint but I'm actually a Bitcoin whale that regularly changes their name because of the rise of the price and what that means for me and I've been here since the beginning. I've been on the forums since the beginning too. I'm more qualified to present my opinion than, hmm, just about everyone that doesn't personally own a large successful company in this space.
4	1522928885	1	> Sorry to disappoint but I'm actually a Bitcoin whale that regularly changes their name because of the rise of the price and what that means for me and I've been here since the beginning.So I take it you sold off your "RogersCoin" then? Do you perchance have txids from this huge selloff so we can verify?> I'm more qualified to present my opinion than, hmm, just about everyone that doesn't personally own a large successful company in this space.Bitcoin.com for example?
5	1522928892	1	Whales are mammals. They breathe air, give birth to live young, and nurse (i.e., feed milk to) their young.
5	1522941681	0	> So I take it you sold off your "RogersCoin" then? Do you perchance have txids from this huge selloff so we can verify?Your tone has changed since you've realized you can't indoctrinate me. Were you born yesterday? Or do you think I was? Btw I did sell them all and you can see it on the chart, nice big red stick on the candle, probably liquidated some of your friends trades.Yes Roger has a voice in the community, well noticed, and he uses it to say Core helped to kill children - as a marketing technique.
2	1522915930	1	> Because the blocksize was not raised immediately without any research the people responsible for the delay helped to kill children? pretty much is the rationale by the majority in this sub. they aren't self aware enough to see it, even the ones that come across as someway intelligent. it is an absolute joke, and a shame to Bitcoin as a whole. 
3	1522918322	2	Ridiculous. The censorship backed devs (devaluators) fight against an increase since years and then implemented that crazy Rube Goldberg construct by changing nearly every line of code. 
4	1522918668	2	Please explain how what you said kills children though?

3	1522925881	1	Right now Bitcoin is not for people aren't highly educated and right now this is a barrier to its use. Bitcoin *will* be for people on less than $2 a day, but right now it simply isn't. If he said Bitcoin will never be for people on less than 2USD a day I would take exception in the way you have.
0	1522896472	9	I actually didn't think he was exaggerating at all. I think the sad part was that the audience didn't understand because they live in a bubble. 
1	1522916108	-1	> I actually didn't think he was exaggerating at all.seriously? seriously? so you think not raising the blocksize has caused children to die?
2	1522938814	3	Would you agree that the lack of economic freedom in places like Venezuela are causing children to die?
3	1522939548	1	Yes I would agree that it's a factor, but not the only factor. However that has extremely little to with Blockstream or blocksize. 
4	1522940425	3	One step at a time young grasshopper.Do you agree that people with very little money to live cannot afford the transaction fees of BTC but can afford the transaction fees of BCH?
5	1522941532	1	> Do you agree that people with very little money to live cannot afford the transaction fees of BTC but can afford the transaction fees of BCH?no, i don't agree with this, as you are making an assumption that people with very little money have enough to buy either BCH or BTC. hint: they don't. 
2	1522932358	1	slowing BTC adoption at all allows structural violence to perpetuate further, thus causing more children to die than necessary. It might be difficult for people to understand that from the aforementioned bubble but simply increasing velocity of money , reducing dependency on banks, and lowering remittances barriers would transform the lives of billions for the better.The die hards who have been in the industry since day one mostly got in to be part of that process but find ourselves arguing with idiots like Samson instead.
3	1522933520	0	> reducing dependency on bankswhat are you on about? the fractional reserve banking system afforded the building of the majority of the world's infrastructure. without it, where would we be?> The die hards who have been in the industry since day onei have been here since that time, but i see the zealots in BCH basing arguments on nothing but air. yes, Bitcoin was built to disrupt incumbent systems, but that's all it can do. it's an anarchists manifestation, not a structuralists. what framework for governance did it put in place, what framework for resource mining and distribution did it in place? what legal or moral framework did it put in place? nothing. it tries to break the existing system, but offers nothing in return. all it is a monetary system divorced from state - yet the whole thing rests on the state (laws, governance, resources, infrastructure). are you blind to this?
4	1522934020	2	We would be in a world with less wealth stratification and less suffering, thats where we would be.Suggesting that one needs to control the money multiplier to build infrastructure is a false premise.And this isn't just about Bitcoin, it's about the industry as a whole. By slowing the market leader they dampen our forward momentum towards everything we might do collectively.Or are you really suggesting that Blockstream has it right and we should have created an artificial supply restriction on txs and raised fees so that BTC could serve fewer and fewer markets?
5	1522934387	1	> We would be in a world with less wealth stratificationwhat are you on about? there are Bitcoiners with literally Billions of dollars and some with none. how is that less wealth stratification?> By slowing the market leader they dampen our forward momentum towards everything we might do collectively.no. they have their own roadmap. it may take more time than others, but its their own - and they have been proven right. they stuck to their guns, concentrated on making BTC as secure and robust as possible, and are now working on layer 2 solutions, that can actually onramp the world. > Or are you really suggesting that Blockstream has it right no, i am suggesting they have a roadmap, and are consistent in how they achieve what they said they want to achieve. they are literally helping build the protocol that will onramp the next 50-500m users. nobody else is doing that.  
6	1522938781	2	Their roadmap was not Bitcoins roadmap until they used AXAs money to buy up all of the devs. Are you suggesting its a good roadmap that we should all het behind though because if you are then you've had your head in the sand these oast 3 years. Blocksttream becoming a major player in the BTC marketplace was the worst thing to ever happen to Bitcoin.
7	1522939646	0	Have you any idea how much good has come from the Blockstream team? Have a look at all the development that has emerged from them, or that they have been involved in. SegWit, RingCT, MimbleWimble, Schnorr Signatures, to name a few.  And it was Satoshi that placed the 1MB limit. At any stage, the market could have removed it and followed a chain that didn't have it in place. This never happened! That's the truth. 
8	1522940965	2	Pushing segwit as something to be proud of... We arent speaking the same language friend. Satishi placed the limit in as a spam filter when txs were free. It was always meant to come off and you are being disingenuous in the reasons why it didn't cone off. Hint, the organization you are supporting used every dirty trick in the book to keep it there thus slowing adoption thus delaying all tje goid BTC and the overall industry can do, in particular in developing nations (as the research around MPESA has proven).So again, if you support Samson Mow and Blockstreams roadmap you are actively harming peole whonare suffering from economic exclusion. Thats not speculation, its direct and distinct backed by 15 years of research.We can help them. Yet Samson Mow has publicly stayed that he doesn't think Bitcoin is for the poor.
9	1522941415	1	> Pushing segwit as something to be proud of... fine take SW of teh list then. there is still Bulletproofs, Base32 addresses, zeroKnowledge proofs, Tree Sigs....> Satishi placed the limit in as a spam filter when txs were free. It was always meant to come off and you are being disingenuous in the reasons why it didn't cone off.At any stage the market could have lifted the limit. its not like the market is malinformed. they would have all been around for a while. The miners could have implemented any of the clients that urged bigger blocks. that is all they had to do. That is the absolute truth. They didn't as they didn't want to leave the Core roadmap. > the research around MPESA has proventhe research? sorry please point me to the peer reviewed papers. > We can help them. sure you can. how many developing nations have you been to trying to help? serious question. 
0	1522874019	7	>"It is the principles of economic freedomâ€”free markets, rule of law, protection of private property, and open tradeâ€”that boost prosperity and reduce costs so that societies can protect their environments, improve health, and broaden access to education."If that explanation makes you have doubts or suspicions I think you like to own a truth that is not so trueI think Roger does not exaggerate, he only evaluates if it is false that the greater the competition, the better the results! The more diversity you have, the more likely you are to get different ways to get the result you want. On the other hand, if you restrict freedoms, you want to be the sole owner of a reality, a reality that may be distorted in favor of those who restrict it.
0	1522888258	4	user that have less than 2 $ per day do sure not use or buy bitcoin...
1	1522893433	4	They should.When you lose 1/4 of your money (200% inflation) a month, bitcoin is a much better store of value. Problem is with adoption logistics aka chicken and egg problem. E.G, Nobody will build a roost (Service or accepting bitcoin) for chickens (users) that don't exist and chickens won't come without a roost)
2	1522894186	3	dude if you have 2$ a day you dont bother about buying some cryptocurrency. you only think about where you are going to buy your food or water today and than that money is gone. this people cant invest
3	1522894319	3	Which is why we have charities like @EatBCH on twitter feeding the poor.They don't have a reliable form of money. The reason they are on $2 a day is because of their government inflating the money supply. It may be too late to stop most of the damage but it's still possible for slow progress to be made.>this people cant investDeciding to hold one form of money over another (AUD, USD, BTC, BCH) ***IS*** an investment. Even if you hold your money in fiat, you are *still making an investment decision by holding fiat*
4	1522900615	2	Post the link next time http://twitter.com/eatbch/media    (Bitcoin Cash is proven to increase economic freedom)     
5	1522900786	2	Cheers

It may be too late to stop most of the damage but it's still possible for slow progress to be made.its really not that simple. I was just in Nigeria - in the first, and largest private University there, giving talks about blockchain tech and crypto - they have greater problems to worry about than whether they have some crypto.seriously, people need to get real here. They didn't even have proper wifi - and this was ina well developed private  university. you guys are idiots for thinking crypto is their major concern. ffs. get real. 
5	1522918475	1	> you guys are idiots for thinking crypto is their major concern. ffs. get real.You are an idiot. Nobody claimed that it is their major concern. 
6	1522918596	3	Well they are claiming that not changing the blocksize kills babies, so I am not sure how you are not saying it's a major concern!
5	1522929431	1	Cointext.com
6	1522929811	1	They don't text, as texts cost money. They use WhatsApp, as their network providers give them free WhatsApp messages for a certain level of top-up, along with minimal 4g. aThis is actually the default method for communication in a number of developing nations. I saw the same in Bolivia. People don't text. 
7	1522930146	1	No reason why cointext couldn't be ported to work with Whatsapp really imo
8	1522931361	2	yes, of course, but you aren't thinking this though. Adoption and usability is more than just the interface. Its also about need case, and education.you can give people a crypto to use, but you also have to educate them from the ground up. who is going to do this? in my example i was giving a talk to about 100 computer science students - final years. of the 100 about 50 knew about Bitcoin. of them about 10 knew anything meaningful. none knew how it worked, none had ever used it. the majority of the perspectives was that it could make them rich - along with all the other 'types of Bitcoin' there are
9	1522931504	1	>you can give people a crypto to use, but you also have to educate them from the ground up. who is going to do this? I will
9	1522952393	1	There's also the problem of storing the keys needed to access coins. I'm assuming that, judging by the never-ending "**FREEDOM!!!!!!**" rhetoric around here, that people expect these poor people to handle their keys safely, without a third-party custodian. Ummm, no. A tiny handful can, maybe, but most are going to use cell phones that could be stolen, broken, or otherwise made unusable out of nowhere. They're not going to have backups either.As much as I'd love to see everybody using cryptocurrencies, it's simply not feasible for a vast majority of the users, at least not without a combination of radical changes in the wallet UI, education, trust in the system, an easy way to recover the coins if the device gets stolen (well, not required but it's ideal), and many other things I'm not thinking of offhand. All of this is difficult enough with third-party solutions and virtually impossible without them, at least for Joe Schmoe. Just shouting "**HURRR DURRR FIAT SUXXX**" isn't going to fix anything.
7	1522946981	1	I wonder how much it costs to have a deal with third-world country mobile operators to let your app not be included in the datacap...|/u/MemoryDealers Hey Roger, you think you can make this fit in your budget? Or would it be a bad idea to attract so much attention so soon?
4	1522894921	1	Sorry but which country except Venezuela currently has such a massive inflation? I dont know any
5	1522895027	2	All countries use fiat currencies and suffer from some form of inflation.Someone receives the money before its spend into existance. This is theft.
6	1522916474	1	> All countries use fiat currencies and suffer from some form of inflation.yes, because normal inflation is used to stop people hoarding money! it is the market driven incentive to spend in the economy, which drives a whole load of positives in the macro economy - jobs, tax, wealth creation, investment, jesus christ. if there was no inflation, and the value of your currency kept on rising instead of decreasing - nobody would ever spend anything today, because their money would be worth something tomorrow! it is hyper inflation that is the problem - not inflation. 
7	1522929415	1	I see you subscribe to keynesian economic theory.
8	1522929891	1	I don't subscribe to any specific theory, but it's pretty obvious that if you don't have a certain reduction in purchasing power year on year, people will only spend what they have to. Investment, and this employment will decline. Have you some evidence to suggest otherwise?
9	1522930084	1	I've been using bitcoin since it was $100 so i havent had a reduction in purchasing power. I've spent more in the last year than i ever have in my entire life.There are thousands of others like me too (Google bitcoin Lambo)
4	1522905423	1	The reason they are on $2 a day is because they cannot get a better (or any) job to earn more money. This often means they don't have enough money for food and basic needs, not saying about holding fiat or crypto. In this situation I  would not recommend these people buying crypto as it would mean they are buying very risky asset with their last money, this is more then they can afford to lose.
5	1522911355	1	>The reason they are on $2 a day is because they cannot get a better (or any) job to earn more money.Why do you think they cant get a job?
6	1522912338	1	Have you ever heard of unemployment? In many countries unemployment rates are above 20%.I know people like this, not on $2 a day, but below poverty level. Not that all of them cannot get a better job, some are just fine living on welfare or casual earnings.
7	1522914613	1	Alright, why do you think they're unemployed?
8	1522916552	2	its a host of reasons, all interrelated. using or owning crypto isn't going to solve the problem. how many developing nations have you actually been to?just curious...
9	1522930588	1	>its a host of reasons, all interrelated.Not an argument. Care to elaborate?
8	1522922297	2	What could be a possible reason for people to live on $2 a day which is obviously not enough for normal life quality?Because some people cannot earn more than this for various reasons. The most likely reasons are unemployment or some low quality low paid job. Isn't this obvious? Do you think of other reasons?Anyway, the point is the people living on $2 day do not have any extra money to be invested in store of value e.g. crypto, they spend all money for food and this is the best store of value for them. 
9	1522930627	1	Alright, why do you think there aren't enough well paid jobs?
0	1522879422	3	Can you please state which "policies" of Samson and Blockstream you are referring to? 
1	1522881045	6	Bitcoin isn't for people that live on less than $2 a day. You're imagining someone with your knowledge & background that is poor. @Falkvingehttps://twitter.com/Excellion/status/783994642463326208
2	1522881341	3	That is barely English. I don't know much about Samson but I do know he comes off as an idiot in public. 
3	1522882362	4	Blockstream Chief Strategy Officer - the company that ran BTC into the ground.
4	1522883339	0	I still blame, at least in part, the Bitcoin Cash fork from Bitcoin for abandoning segwit2x
5	1522883498	7	Bitcoin Cash was an emergency backup plan, incase 2x failed. 2x failed due to a social fork by Blockstream, and Bitcoin (BCH) was adopted by miners, Coinbase, BitPay, and more.Bitcoin BTC deviated from the whitepaper and founders. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin : https://hacked.com/overall-influence-bitcoin-forks-explained/
5	1522883601	5	I'd say a good part, if not the majority of big blockers, did not board BCH right away. Many of us had hopes and were pushing for segwit2x, even though SegWit is a monstrosity, if only to fire Core. It was its cancellation that brought every big blocker together behind BCH.In hindsight, I'm very glad Amaury and everybody else involved with the fork (Jihan, ViaBTC etc) were clever enough to fork before SegWit was activated, instead of waiting for SegWit2x.
6	1522919019	2	/u/deadalnix had the foresight and told many people that SegWit2x will not WORK and that SegWit is a monstrosity. he then made BCH happen. we are grateful that he initiated it. 
6	1522883771	1	Segwit2x wasn't scheduled for implementation until after the BCH though. Because of the fork, the community was splintered and a hard fork was deemed risky. This is my understanding of the progression of events, but I only joined the community after segwit2x failed.

Amaury Sechet forked Bitcoin -> BCH a few weeks before SegWit was active. The BCH chain successfully secured a chain without SegWit and increased blocksize, essentially creating an insurance chain in case the blocksize doubling aspect of the SegWit2X deal was reneged on, which it ultimately was via the NO2X campaign begun by Blockstream supporter and LTC creator Charlie Lee.
8	1522899385	1	The timeline is the same as I know and understand, but the act of creating BCH splintered the community. It was splintered before segwit2x failed, which made me suspect that this was part of the reason.
9	1522901715	1	I misinterpreted "wasn't scheduled for implementation" as "wasn't created as a plan" rather than as you intended. It appears to me that the community was already splintered or BCH wouldn't have found demand. SegWit itself was controversial regardless of the blocksize debate. Speculation abounds as to whether S2X was an effort to achieve SegWit implementation with later plans to renege on blocksize expansion, but judging by the behavior of the original supporters of SegWit I personally suspect 2X was the sugar to make the bitter medicine of SegWit go down.
5	1522887867	3	That is not my recollection at all.  2X was declared dead by most corporate supporters and prominent spokespeople.  BCH went live days after.I personally thought 2X didn't have a chance due to bait and switch.  I also didn't support bch until I saw 2X doomed.  I thought bch was a weird gimmick to work around pow.  A couple of weeks later, 2x failed and I was on board.
2	1522881859	2	That link is so sad to see. It's sad that there are people like this who think they're the de facto deciders for all less fortunate individuals.  And there is concern of context showing what looks to be a llama farmer... Is he really defending his offensive tweet by referencing an earlier offensive one where he is **deciding for** that llama farmer and those like him that they aren't invited to the Bitcoin club either? >Most people in the first world still don't know what #Bitcoin is. Would people in the third world have a better understanding? Doubt it. Classic asshole. Yes, they would! Bitcoin Cash [works](https://twitter.com/eatBCH/media).He then goes on to call Bitcoin a "challenge" because you own your own money? Man. This guy is shamelessly raping the original ideas of what Bitcoin is meant to be and people go along with what he says as he leads them towards "lightning" and away from Bitcoin? And to think, a lot of people have been casually throwing around the word fraud lately.
3	1522882425	2	Yeah - we need to keep engineering good money. Bitcoin Cash solves the problems that Blockstream has created.
2	1522916648	1	he is right. crypto in its current state is not worth anything to anyone on 2$ a day. those people don't even have smart phones - let alone the proper wi fi/4g infrastructure. i have been in these countries. you think a starving person has the education and technical knowhow to use a crypto wallet? to buy on an exchange? to store and back up his private keys, to make paper wallets? get fucking real. 
0	1522874342	3	It seems intuitive, and it's an easy to believe thing. Still, correlation is not causation.~~A link to the article: https://www.heritage.org/international-economies/report/how-economic-freedom-promotes-better-health-care-education-and~~
0	1522914229	2	You cant seriously argue this with a straight face. Hijacking this very real problem to argue your side in the crypto world is beyond fucked up, and I seriously doubt Vers sincerity when he cries for kids in the third world. This just seals the deal.Ver is a fucking scumbag for this, and this is beyond any opinions I might have towards scaling bitcoin.I really hope we at least can find common grounds on this.
1	1522916148	2	> I really hope we at least can find common grounds on this.it's obvious they wont. it's absolute lunacy here. 
2	1522922228	4	"Vers argument cant be wrong because it affirms my belief that Bitcoin is bad and bcash is good"
3	1522922669	1	YYYYEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS you said it brother. say it loud and say it proud. Jesus walks amongst us mere mortals in the shadow of the big green B. We are Bitcoin, we are Cash. We are BITCOIN CASH! SAVE CHILDREN AND B the Cash the p2p currency of the WORLD!
1	1522922716	1	Why not give a few million to these poor folks so they have money to cheaply remit all over the globe....that will definitely feed, cloth, and house the global poor.

0	1522920250	1	Many people have difficulty thinking forward more than 1 step of association. That is why politics and bullshitting often works.
0	1522878249	0	Correlation != Causation
1	1522893175	2	He addresses this in the video.
1	1522884717	4	So healthy people create free markets?Or that it is simply that free markets and healthy people are correlated?Whichever way you take it, we should promote free markets.
1	1522881098	1	The causation is obvious.
2	1522900093	1	The causation is not at all obvious. These graphs don't even show you which country each dot represents. 
2	1522881583	1	Mmm..that's about the equivalent of Michael Scott declaring bankruptcy. Obvious? "Economic Freedom" is a hilarious generalization of what is more than likely in need of a much deeper multi-varied analysis. But, bitcoin.
3	1522882473	4	Get off a plane anywhere in the world, and you can guess the mean income per capita. Economic freedom has enormous effects.
4	1522900018	1	Huh?
1	1522899868	1	You probably didn't travel enough in your life. Places with salaries not matching the very minimal costs of living are crowded and have low life quality and violence. You wonder why.Lack of economic freedom as a whole is the direct result of economical enslavement and corruption. Lower education = too many children, no birth control, more slaves, lack of social mobility. Cheap labor work = sub par production of goods and services = lack of social mobility if you don't accept the low salaries, or if you don't want to employ cheap slave-like labor.It is not a coincidence.If you remove trading barriers, you help social mobility, individual entrepreneurism, broader offer of goods and services, etc.
2	1522943139	1	This is chalked full to the brim with assumptions. Wild imagination you've got there.
1	1522887382	-3	I know right? His bit about babies dying was cringe worthy.These associations are very loose. If Roger wanted to make a point, then areas where bitcoin cash has higher % of use compared to bitcoin should be associated with better outcomes (ideally in a population with lower socioeconomic status).Realistically, any cryptocurrency use is highly unlikely to have any statistically significant difference on any of these outcomes. Extrapolating cryptocurrency association on economic freedom and thus health outcomes is a long shot. Maybe in the future, but till then, killing babies? Really?

3	1522901749	1	And is there a difference between Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin to the extent that babies are dying?
