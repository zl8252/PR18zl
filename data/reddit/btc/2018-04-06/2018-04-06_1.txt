0	1523013920	11	I stopped reading after the first paragraph of *Interpreting the Stats*:> The number of nodes, which bitcoinvisuals shows are numbered around 840 for nodes with **and** without channels and 611 for those **without** channels, shows that only 229 Lightning Network nodes are currently operating with active channels.Well, no, it actually clearly shows that 813 nodes are **with channels** and 600 nodes are **without channels**, so there are overall 1413 nodes. If someone cannot even interpret such a simple chart then I doubt the conclusion he gets to makes sense either.
0	1522982393	33	Nothing about a compromise in this article.  OP did you read it?
1	1522983285	34	I read it, and it does talk about the BitPico attack that dropped hundreds of nodes from the network in just a few hours. It also discusses how that was accomplished and why the capability for it compromises the network as a whole.
2	1522988867	17	Thank you for understanding this article and why it was written. 
3	1522989854	5	It was a hefty one! Well worth it, though, and you can skip past some of the repetition if you already know how to interpret those graphs.
2	1522984735	6	Yeah, it’s BS.  Especially the part where he quotes Alex Bosworth out of context.  Go ahead, go back to the article and click the link that will take you to the twitter feed.  See what Alex said, then read his next tweet.  Decide for yourself if he is acknowledging an exploit or not.Edit:  link for the lazy - https://mobile.twitter.com/alexbosworth/status/976158861722726405
3	1522988964	7	There’s no mention of an exploit. bitPico launched a simple Sybil Attack vector on the network. Alex was smart enough to simply reject any and all connections in order to keep his node “online” 
3	1523029206	-1	Vulnerabilities don't go away because you refuse to acknowledge them.This actually makes them worse.Dozens of people have been warning that this would be a vulnerability for lightning due to the topology of the system. And what do we find? It is. I am jack's complete lack of surprise. The fact the guy you're trying to cite ventured "lightning transaction fees" as a defense against syn flooding really just says it all
4	1523029530	2	I'm not trying to cite anyone, the article did.  I'm not claiming there was an attack on the Lightning Network, the article did.  I'm not claiming the guy cited by the article has a defense against syn flooding, neither is the article.  You brought that up.  My point is simple... let's stick to real facts.  If Lightning Network fails, let's point out how and where it failed and sit back and say I knew it all along!  No need to make shit up like the article did.
5	1523029831	2	> I'm not claiming the guy cited by the article has a defense against syn flooding, neither is the article. You brought that up.I'm pointing out the guy cited by the article refuses to even acknowledge that it's a vulnerability, the twitter feed you linked to literally has him saying exactly "There's no exploit afaik".As for lightning failure? Well it's failed in the sense that someone disabled significant amounts of it just by syn flooding centrally connected hubs. It also failed because it *has* centrally connected hubs, seeing as it was supposed to be a decentralised scaling solution, it also failed because the major trade item flowing over the network at the moment appears to be blockstream stickers, and Samson Mow is crowing about opening a hat store. In fact, basically in every way that it is possible for a product to fail, lightning has failed.Cool fucking name though, so whatever.
6	1523030579	2	oh I see where you are coming from..  Here's where I'm different.  The article doesn't have any proof that there was an attack, just a theory that an attack happened.  To prop up this theory the article claims that the guy cited confirmed there was an attack and linked to his comment out of context.  He was not confirming an attack, quite the opposite.  Does this mean he's capable of recognizing an attack if it fell from the sky, landed on his face and wiggled?  No. and I'm not saying that he is or isn't.  You are doing that by deciding he's clueless.  I could care less.  The only thing about the guy on twitter I'm pointing out is that the article has him as the only support for a theory that LN was attacked by saying he confirmed there was an attack.  And if you read the tweets before and after the one linked to, you can see that he's not confirming an attack.  So the article is wrong.  > Well it's failed in the sense that someone disabled significant amounts of it just by syn flooding centrally connected hubs. Do you have a source for this claim.  I really want to see it.  Please don't link me back to this crap article.  lol
7	1523032500	2	Your ignorance amuses me. But it's what I've come to expect from core fan boys so whatever. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/86fc01/the_chatlog_from_lightningnetwork_discussing/https://coingeek.com/bitpico-claims-responsibility-dos-attack-lightning-network/https://hype.codes/bitpico-takes-responsibility-lightning-network-dos-attack
8	1523034254	1	good stuff.  Thanks!  I'll read through it.  By the way, what criteria do you use to determine someone is a core fan boy? 
8	1523034990	1	The first link was good stuff.  Do you know if the attacks are ongoing?
9	1523035370	2	Stands to reason, if the story the attacker gives about wanting to "test" the network are true. But the nature of those attacks and the topology of lightning network basically means these tests are a waste of time. It is equivalent to someone saying they're studying a new fighting system where they're immune to physical attacks, and then someone comes along after they're finished to "test it out" and it turns out they're not. At what point does everyone accept the obvious and just move on with their lives? That's a social question, not a technical one. And I hate people and how and what they generally think, so have no real interest in the answer.

1	1522989689	-12	 Everyone is smart enough to do their own research. I don't think anyone is in that normie bitcoin is so awesome stage anymore.Your research is just self-indulging crap though. The visceral responses, if you can call them that, were to how poorly written and baseless your article is. If that's what you were going for to get attention, then you can call it a success.
2	1522989988	14	What’s poorly written about it? What was I wrong about? Educate me 
3	1522990296	-9	Everything. You're criticizing a technology thats in its infantile to maturing stages and are calling it centralized. No shit, its still being developed.Formatting is crap, no sources on data, too many graphs presented in succession at once with no context. Then you go on to assume people who disagree with it are sensitive to defend lightning network, but in reality its just shitty information. 
4	1522990439	29	It’s a topology report. A lot of issues I mentioned were echoed by Peter Todd - an actual Bitcoin developer. There are dozens of sources in the article. There’s a heading for every graph. I asked for feedback at the beginning of the article. So, as expected, you didn’t have any legitimate feedback lol. You’re just saying stuff to say it. 
5	1522990897	-14	I just gave you feedback but you didn't take it. It literally looks like you browsed some developers social media, copied and pasted some graphs, and presented it. If you were a paid technical writer this would go straight in the trash. 
6	1522991006	18	 I didn’t reject anything. You said things about the article that aren’t true. You said there are no sources when there are plenty of sources. You’re just trolling at this point and trying to sound like you have a legitimate issue when you done. You mentioned the “formatting” Lol. 
6	1522991325	18	Your responses are over dramatic and emotional too. You’re over here throwing personal attacks at me like a middle school child. The article is well-written and I cover some pertinent stats on the LN. If it’s vulnerable to attacks, it stands as a central point of failure, which introduces centralization. The criticisms are valid. You don’t like them because you support bitcoin and you believe that Lightning Network is critical for its success. So, any article you read, regardless of author or intellectual level will get this response from you. I gave you a chance to prove otherwise and you couldn’t. Be thankful I entertained you this long. Continue sending me replies like a 14 year old female though with the personal attacks lol. I’m laughing. When you’re ready to be a man and discuss this with intelligence, come talk to me. 
7	1522991588	-9	You typed all that out? Lol, someone is insecure ...But really you assume that I like/support bitcoin and believe LN is critical. I never said that, that's just you trying to justify your comments in that mess you call an article.
8	1522992007	13	You can’t identify anything in the article that was false. You don’t have the intelligence to even comprehend anything this technical.Go run along & play while the adults are talking 
9	1522992193	-8	Not sure if you are trolling at this point or just deluded. There was nothing intelligent in that article and sadly after talking to you I can see why now. 
8	1522992069	13	Everyone reading this thread can tell you’re a moron lol, Do you even know what the Lightning Network is? You probably think they bottle lightning lmao 
4	1522993476	5	Too many graphs?  You're not too used to highly technical documents are you?
4	1522998284	5	I have now read half of the article, and I agree with your statement that..> Too many graphs presented in succession at once with no context> Formatting is crapI'd also like to add in that some information is repetetive (same information, same text, same image etc).That said, I don't think "Everything" was bad, nor do I think it was unfairly presented. It was just not a userfriendly experience to read.u/Randomshortdude don't take this critisism as critisism of the actual content; the content is fine. It is critisism of the presentation of that content, and as an article writer for publication that has been rejected several times due to the very same quality issues, I completely understand that you did your best to get to this point, and had the best of intentions.
4	1522999448	4	>Everything. You're criticizing a technology thats in its infantile to maturing stages Lighting Network is coming up on being three years old.  It's a joke.When Bitcoin was three years old it had already survived countless attacks and produced several 10X bubbles.
3	1522997030	-13	What is going to happen is that LN is the killer ap for Bitcoin. There is a very pertinent saying "Only a fool criticizes a project half done" In this case the project is only 10% completed which makes your criticism even more infantile. I just hope you are man enough for when LN is eating Visa's lunch and literally everyone is sending, purchasing, gifting, remitting etc on LN to redo your "Charts" to reflect the absolute winner that it becomes. Probably too much to hope from you, but we live in hope.
4	1522997040	8	Redditor /u/Pipdotcom has low karma in this subreddit.
5	1522997658	-11	What a weird sub. You actually have a robot that  endlessly repeats "has low karma in this subreddit." and a pile of idiots that upvote it. Unbelievable childish, infantile, stupid and plain antisocial behaviour. Go and get a real life....
6	1522998096	12	It helps boost the signal to noise ratio of our communications channel.Goodbye noise.
7	1522998887	-8	It helps boost the signal to noise ratio of our "ECHO CHAMBER"Goodbye fuckwit
8	1523022586	1	Sometimes the bot gets it wrong, or misses nuance (like Luke-Jr participating), and is down-voted.
4	1523006654	4	Yeah, it's already killed Bitcoin about half dead.
5	1523009431	2	Then why has BCH fallen even further?? Dream on dipshit.
6	1523035111	1	This was before the BCH lifeboat even launched.
5	1523015073	1	> Yeah, it's already killed Bitcoin about half dead.Made me laugh :) /u/chaintip

4	1522997849	3	In 18 months? :-)
0	1522993712	9	It has also just reached [10btc](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/)... after what, a month of being in beta? There is essentially no uptake. If I was building something on lightning I'd probably toss at least 0.1btc on mainnet to play with as much as possible.What would be good fun if someone made a lightning network store to buy bitcoin cash. 
1	1523021702	2	LN was built for small purchases like coffee and since its in beta you shouldn't load you channel with large amounts of btc .
2	1523021710	2	Redditor /u/bitusher has low karma in this subreddit.
1	1523021004	1	That would be hilarious. How hard would this be to set up?
1	1523000530	-12	What would be more fun if bcash supported LN so you could spend your bcash on BTC products using atomic swaps!  True adoption! 
2	1523001802	7	Atomic swap has already been performed with Bitcoin Cash.No need for LN.
2	1523002013	4	I don't think very many people who use Bitcoin want Blockstream stickers.
3	1523004426	-2	What about steam vouchers from bitrefil?
0	1522988723	16	This is crap, and if you look at the OP's medium, he has a bunch of articles similar to the style of this one. The author not only has a very poor understanding of the industry, but should take a writing class too. 
1	1523009249	10	> This is crap, and if you look at the OP's mediumI am sorry, but you're going to need something more that this.
1	1522988820	13	This response is generic. 
1	1522993622	9	Pathetic response.  You triggered or what?
0	1523000310	2	Hype? There is no hype anymore. Not even on the other sub. Sure, you see a few LN posts but neither with interesting content nor much discussion. Pretty lame for a "disruptive and revolutionary new technology".
0	1522995645	2	the jig is up!
0	1522999685	8	Of course it’s not.  It’s in beta . Elizabeth stark has made that perfectly clear . It’s not ready yet and is a work in progress .  Y’all have one game and that’s to try and take down bitcoin , work on your own tech . It’s really revealed by that most of this sub is dedicated to taking by shit about bitcoin instead of repping bcash . 
1	1523001341	16	How it is that everytime someone mentions that LN has been in beta for 3 years and a final working version will never see the light, "LN is working NOW"; but everytime someone mentions how crippled and exploitable LN is, "LN is still in beta/early development"?
1	1523000231	8	What's wring with calling out competing tech as broken? If we didn't, people here would wonder why we aren't embracing it.
2	1523001689	-2	That would be fine if it was learn something and try to improve it so you could implement it on bcash at some point.Instead all we see is strawmen, misinformation, FUD and pointing out faults in a system that has barely left beta, all in an attempt to legitimize bcash. Its really quite pathetic to watch.
1	1523016256	-4	What tech? Bcash doesn't have tech, they are just increasing blocksizes and trying to hijack bitcoin brand lol. 
2	1523018469	4	I don't think anyone from Brazil has ever confused [Bcash](https://bcash.com.br) with Bitcoin. In fact, I bet most of them have never even heard of Bitcoin. They just use the app for it's one to one link the the Real.
3	1523025797	-2	Pretending you dont know what he leans with bcash is pathetic.
0	1522986250	3	Brutal
0	1522990910	1	Why not let it mature before declaring the hype is all lies? There's likely a whole lot of truth behind the issues mentioned, but I kind of expected it? Most open source projects seem to go through this phase.
1	1522994095	5	read to the end. He is not declaring "the hype is all lies". OP is just sensationalizing for that delicious karma
1	1522996647	3	>Why not let it mature before declaring the hype is all lies?Ask blockstream, they shoehorned it on to the main net when Elizabeth Stark told them it's far from ready.LN might turn out well, but it needs a lot more work and time.
0	1522993505	3	Excellent article
0	1523024248	1	All these upvotes you're getting for your accusations and brigade  of downvotes for anyone that calls you or anyone here out on it, don't let it get to your head.  If the subreddits weren't split the vast majority would vote the opposite of what you are accustomed to here.  If you really wanted to know the truth about this accusation on lightning you'd post on Twitter and ask those that actually know about it instead of using it as a typical misleading propaganda piece.It's  clear that lightning network is absolutely fine, uncompromised, And continues to grow and evolve with apps continuing to be built on top of it and this is just in beta.
1	1523024577	1	I already posted it all over Twitter and I’m r/bitcoin. You’re just another person in the sea of “This Article sucks!” That can’t articulate one solid reason why. Break down my arguments if it’s bullshit. Point out specifically what I’m wrong about. People in r/btc think critically, that’s why this is upvoted. You, on the hand, respond w emotion. 
2	1523034698	1	People on btc here downvote every single reply that sited what was wrong with the article and why you and the article are wrong let alone how you exaggerate.  You can go ahead and dig them out since you love this sub so much, the btc sub that welcomes all as long as they don't  support btc!
3	1523036064	1	Once again, this was posted on r/bitcoin, but that doesn’t fit your narrative so you ignore that. I’ve yet to see any substantive comments. Just triggered emotional feedback like “This Article sucks!” No one has challenged the actual content of the article 
0	1523005741	0	Why am I on this sub? This was the final straw, unsubbed.
1	1523013511	-2	Don't do that. It's good to see how desperate the bcash supporters are. They seem increasingly desperate lately. 
0	1522984571	-8	It’s was a deliberate stress test you shill. 
1	1522988995	15	What am I a shill for? These random buzzwords crack me up 
1	1522994331	5	OP exaggerates what is stated in the article, but even as a pro btc person you should not shrug it off based on it being done from a dev, it still means lightning is nowhere near where it needs to be.
1	1522996560	3	Which, unfortunately proved that LN is still far far away from real world usability.
2	1522999721	4	I don't have a horse in this particular race but I do love how LN exists simultaneously as "only 10% complete" and "absolutely functional right now" depending on the context.I still don't see how it is intended to get traction with merchants but then again, perhaps it isn't. We'll see in a few years I suppose.
0	1522993865	-5	Nice Shitpost Shorty
0	1522998623	0	Ha ha 
0	1523000658	-1	I thought it's "digital gold", why is it of any concern?..
