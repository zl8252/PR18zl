0	1523002111	113	/u/Windowly pingNote: this isn't about censoring Craig. I'm happy to have him come here and say whatever he wants and I'll probably upvote that.  And I have no beef in particular with Windowly.I'm downvoting the ad campaign for the CSW brand.
1	1523009157	27	+1
2	1523019302	14	It's funny how 2 hours ago this post had 100+ positive vote status, then 1 hour ago is had 50+ positive vote status, and now it has 100+ vote status once again. That is an extreme anomaly. Somebody bought 50 downvotes.
3	1523033729	4	If only there was a way to attach a tiny cost to making a post.... 😉
4	1523033962	1	?
5	1523034430	9	For example, we could have each person solve a tiny math problem, to incur a little cost on each post.  We might call it "Hashpost."
3	1523021916	3	Actually, I think there are quite a lot of Core bots here. They don't activate all the time but they do make the number of users artificially high, and they seem to often activate when there are somewhat posts about Craig Wright or quotes by Craig Wright. (voting them down).
4	1523022225	13	Actually, most everything friendly towards CSW has been heavily upvoted on this sub for the past several months. Even lame tweets are shot to the front page quickly. It was only this CSW-negative post that got a sloppy and sudden 50 downvotes.
5	1523022562	3	I think people like a lot of what he has to say. Whenever I've posted CSW related posts it has felt like the upvotes are organic and the downvotes are sudden. (That doesn't prove they're bots, but it definitely seems like it often.) Also the anti-CSW troll comment swarm come pretty sudden as well around the same time.Almost everybody in the Bitcoin Cash space has good stuff to say. It's definitely curious when certain people at different times get the vitrolic anti comment swarms and down votes. Several months ago it was Roger Ver. Now it seems to be Craig Wright. 
6	1523022907	2	> Whenever I've posted CSW related posts it has felt like the upvotes are organic and the downvotes are sudden.I've never seen that before. It has always been a very smooth and normal-looking progression of upovotes eventually landing nearly everything CSW-positive on the front page.Why do you compare this to Roger posts? I haven't seen any sort of voting anomalies in that case.
7	1523023435	3	Any posts related to Roger used to stir up a lot of trolls. (Still do I imagine, but they seem less than before. Trolls seem to focus on Craig's  'fraud' instead of Roger's 'fraud' these days. (Of course neither of them defrauded anybody.))It seems the general progression for CSW related post these days -- they seems to get attacked pretty fast and go to 0 points. (Not usually more than needed to keep it at 0 though.) I assumed those were bots. Then it seems as people see the quote, they generally get enough up-votes to get on the front page. Then they are often attacked again, like they were suddenly today. A couple CSW quotes were on the front page and suddenly fell off.
8	1523024236	8	There's a clear difference. Roger didn't claim to be Satoshi. Roger didn't promise to prove it publicly. Roger didn't fail to deliver on this promise because he changed his mind. As a result of Wrights actions, a number of people got in some real trouble.But aside from all of this, the important thing *in context of OPs post* is none of the above. It is that most posts are just silly tweets that are basically as generic as they could be.
9	1523031561	4	>But aside from all of this, the important thing *in context of OPs post* is none of the above. **It is that most posts are just silly tweets that are basically as generic as they could be.**#THANK YOU
6	1523029045	3	> Several months ago it was Roger Ver. Now it seems to be Craig Wright.Roger is a legitimately contraversial figure. He clearly sits at the extra “big L” Libertarian end of the spectrum, and he’s done certain poorly thought through things in his extensive history in the Bitcoin industry.Craig’s only notable contribution in his 3 year involvement has been falsely claiming credit for having invested Bitcoin, then getting caught. Offline he has no real world supporters. Just a well-funded sponsorship company and people who feel like they have to tolerate him.Drawing comparisons between the two is ridiculous.
6	1523033451	2	> I think people like a lot of what he has to say.No, we live in a time when bullshit artists are given a pass for some reason.CSW is toxic, the best thing he could do to support BCH is STFU, which is also the *one thing he will never do!*
5	1523036354	1	You mean "all the lame tweets posted by u/Windowly"?Looking tgrough his post history I have a hard time believing he's not paid for it, just happens that all his posts make front page... 
4	1523032250	1	I've noted the same thing. In earlier times, highly traffic'd posts with 200+ upvotes rarely surpassed 85% upvoted. Now that mark is dropping below 70%! I posted a question the other day and it had 58 views within a minute and a perfect score of 0 and gone to oblivion. 
4	1523035506	1	Oh, yeah - it's not you spreading bs people disagree with - it's bots. Never gets old. You just switch from Core shills / Roger's sockpuppets as needed.
3	1523028611	0	Why would someone buy 50 downvotes? What would the point of that be? I’m inexperienced but 50 downvotes doesn’t seem like an “extreme anomaly” to me.
4	1523029091	1	It was the quickness and subsequent cease of downvotes which was an anomaly. 
4	1523028623	-1	Redditor /u/choose_your_own- has low karma in this subreddit.
3	1523019691	-7	Is /u/memorydealers going to take a stand or does he still believe that Craig Wright is Satoshi as he has implied with every other response to this question?
4	1523020232	15	The Satoshi question is irrelevant IMO.Craig could very well be Satoshi and still say stupid shit.
5	1523026947	0	I have to disagree with this stance. Craig needs to settle the question about his identity one way or the other. You don't go on BBC claiming to be satoshi, fail to prove it and expect people to forget about it. Unless he puts this identity question at rest, he would not be taken seriously by either bitcoin communities. 
6	1523031025	1	Go and ask him, if he really wanted to do that claim there. And ask him after that, if he is Satoshi. Why all that mob fuss?
5	1523030875	1	You are correct. If Craig would come to conferences as Satoshi it would be different. Craig is Craig and we should be free to judge what he wants to tell us, and he' pretty good to make that telling part. :)
5	1523020729	-4	It is only relevant because he claimed to be Satoshi but failed to deliver proof, claimed he didn't/doesn't want attention yet hired David Bowie's PR firm to help with his Satoshi play. Have you considered he may be a bamboozler? https://qz.com/676834/satoshi-nakamoto-hired-david-bowies-pr-agency-for-his-big-reveal/
6	1523021138	8	> Have you considered he may be a bamboozler?Could be Satoshi.  Could be a bamboozler.  Or both.  Or neither :)
7	1523021516	-4	I can with out a doubt say "bitcoin cash" is not bitcoin and Craig Wright is not Satoshi. There is no confusion, if you do a little research outside of reddit you may find information that challenges your current understanding of bitcoin.
8	1523025271	6	Whether Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin (which of course it is) has nothing to do with CSW. 
9	1523025618	0	True, but how do you draw the conclusion that "bitcoin cash" is bitcoin? You can it is a fork of bitcoin, but it is not bitcoin.
8	1523021836	3	says the person who clearly has no idea that Bitcoin was always supposed to be Cash.Go stick to your settlement layer. I mean, if a settlement layer is your vision for Bitcoin then Yippee for you. We have global cash on our horizon.
9	1523022115	0	Since the leaders of bitcoin cash do not want you to run your own because it "slows down the network", who do you trust to verify your BCH transactions?
6	1523023107	2	Craig Wright delivered a *fake* proof and got caught.https://archive.is/sV9vvhttps://github.com/patio11/wrightverificationhttps://rya.nc/sartre.htmlhttps://dankaminsky.com/2016/05/02/validating-satoshi-or-not/
7	1523031085	-2	So you are personally pissed now? Get a live boy.
4	1523028898	1	He can't say anything because that might cost him money. 
1	1523021276	3	u/windowly is 'shilling' for many different persons:https://www.reddit.com/user/windowly/posts/I guess he is fighting for CSW the most because CSW gets ad hominem attacked and slandered the most by an unholy alliance of BCH supporters/BTC chief officers and their cheerleaders as well as Vitalik Buterin u/vbuterin.
2	1523022221	5	I get that...I don't think op intends anything negative to CSW or Windowly. It's more that 'overdoing it' can end up with a negative effect.
2	1523022528	10	Well if CSW had not continuously made an ass of himself along with 20 posts a minute about the grand unaccomplishments of that nauseating douchebag maybe we'd react differently
3	1523023280	-4	A new account that is interested in CSW only. 
4	1523023692	7	"you account is new so I can disregard what you say because I have no other arguments"Yes it is new, but I didn't choose to make this bullshit the hot button issue  in this sub today. Im not new to Bitcoin or BCH and I am like many sick of seeing several posts a day about that assholes every word in here. He can come talk to us himself and his astroturfers can fuck off, and so can apologists like you. 
5	1523026372	-1	> He can come talk to us himself and his astroturfers can fuck off, and so can apologists like youFuck off
2	1523022025	0	That windowly person is also the head shill for cashaddr. 90% of the post made on cashaddr are made by him.
3	1523029133	0	I will be downvoting every post about cashaddr. If cashaddr has something to say, it can come here itself and say it. 
1	1523007453	-6	There are many more accounts campaigning for that douchebag. See /u/btcnewsupdates in the coments.
2	1523008027	47	Not everyone supporting Craig or giving him the benefit of the doubt, as I have done for months, is automatically a paid shill.
3	1523009121	15	Thank you.
4	1523012439	3	r/punchablefaces mayhaps?
5	1523018317	2	It looks like you haven't gone there in a few years.
6	1523020717	2	repost
7	1523021548	2	Hello.
4	1523010400	3	I wasn't saying you are a paid shill but you most certainly campaign for him. Just look at your post/comment history. 
5	1523010751	-6	Thanks too then :) We campaign for him, guilty as charged. We do it on purpose, it's not accidental. Not a matter of personal preference, it's important for BCH.
6	1523010829	36	Promoting personalities is destructive to BCH.Principles, not personalities, will be the deciding factor.Every human is a flawed representative. None speak for BCH.
6	1523033459	2	CSW seems to want to be King of BCH. I think he has chosen the best moonrocket coin and is saying all the best stuff. I'm glad he is saying and probably doing great stuff for BCH. I don't think he makes a good poster child, and, if the claims about his fake science turn out to be even partly true he should not be representing BCH when we need to be seen as a legit coin. Trying to make CSW look good may be bad for BCH. I see no upside to cheerleading for him. I think it would be better to stick to cheerleading good ideas, even if he came up with them first.
3	1523020226	4	> benefit of the doubtThere is no doubt. Craig Wright is a proven conman, liar and fraudster.In fact, he is the [first cryptographically proven liar in history](https://dankaminsky.com/2016/05/03/the-cryptographically-provable-con-man/)
4	1523027927	2	I don't exactly follow how a lack of proof that he is Satoshi is also proof that he isn't. Seems like a failure of logic there, but whatever...
5	1523031854	2	You don't have to prove that he isn't. He would have to prove that he is since he made the grand claim. Prove to me sasquatch isn't real. Prove to me mermaids aren't real.Prove to me flying squirrel pussy people aren't real.Failure of logic. Ok peter pan.
6	1523032723	1	Don’t get me wrong. I agree that anyone claiming CSW is Satoshi has the burden of proof. But it doesn’t mean they’re a liar if they fail to provide it. 
7	1523035753	1	You’re both right, but tbh I’m Satoshi
6	1523032643	0	No, because I am not claiming he *is* Satoshi. You’re the one who’s committing the argument from ignorance fallacy because you’re claiming CSW is a liar on the basis that he hasn’t provided proof that he’s Satoshi. But all that proves is that we don’t know whether he is or isn’t Satoshi. 
7	1523034172	2	The way that you try to rationalize it makes you and anyone who agrees with you look stupid tbh. 
5	1523036823	1	> lack of proofhe provided fake proof
3	1523018620	1	Not everyone supporting ~~Craig~~ Core or giving ~~him~~ them the benefit of the doubt, as I have done for months, is automatically a paid shill.
4	1523018630	5	Redditor /u/DesignerAccount has low karma in this subreddit.
3	1523010133	-4	Oh thats totally true. You might have seen posts from paid shills or have been influenced by them but that is irrelevant. You certainly have the right to voice your support for Craig.Since you are one of his supporters... I hope you don't mind me asking... Do you see any problems with his personality? Like how he occasionally lies, brags about his "multiple" doctorate degrees, and has an overall attitude of a douchebag? I'm sure you have noticed some of that.
4	1523010300	7	>Since you are one of his supporters... Dafuq?
5	1523011250	0	> giving him the benefit of the doubt, as I have done for monthsSorry as read this as if you are still giving him the benefit of a doubt.
3	1523009982	-10	No, you're just a brainwashed disciple just like the hordes over in rnorthkorea are if you support him and "give him the benefit of doubt".
4	1523010729	12	>No, you're just a brainwashed disciple Dafuq?
5	1523013208	-5	You’re not a paid shill but you’ll upvote his posts anyway? That’s almost worse.
6	1523015169	12	You can't read, can you?
2	1523021762	0	[These where the shills\sockpuppets](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89kfc1/these_are_the_csw_scammer_promoters_ive_tagged_so/) i found so for for that fucking fraudster. 
1	1523012184	-4	I do not wish to hear the words of someone who attempted massive fraud against every single member of the crypto scene, thanks. Just ban him for life.
0	1523013629	23	Your prerogative of course but I'll continue to to up-vote content that I think is interesting and down-vote content I think is trash on a case by case basis.The opinions of the majority of people bashing CSW at the moment don't mean that much to me, Charlie Lee ffs?But I do agree that it's annoying to see every little opinion tweet on here from the various personalties involved in BCH and I tend to no-vote (not down-vote) most of them but not all.
1	1523027468	1	I enabled the reddit feature that hides posts I downvote, so I downvote the annoying repetitive garbage just to clean it off my own feed.
0	1523005037	48	Same here, have been downvoting everything CSW related for the past few days just because we need to discuss other subjects and most of these posts are low value ones to me. There is decreasing returns even for topics
1	1523009602	16	[This is the last one I'm upvoting](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8a7a5i/we_are_all_human_and_we_are_all_flawed_i_dont/) just because I put a few minutes of effort into writing about how terribly he fucked over Gavin.
1	1523005419	8	The only ones talking about CSW are sockpuppets. Everyone else is talking science and some of that science happens to come from Craig.
1	1523032147	1	hashtag(metoo)I'm glad to see this sub evolving. I want to see uncensored TECHNICAL discussions reign supreme here.If I want branding campaigns, idols and shitty one liners, I'll just go to the other sub. Although, can't post CSW there ;(. I may try with some other guy, like Andreas, just for fun.
0	1523010617	21	We are being divided and conquered. Argue the ideas and not the men.
1	1523028395	5	Well noted. First their focus was Roger, now it's Craig. But unlike Roger, it seems Craig actually likes the controversy — even if it means playing straight into the social media and propaganda campaign against BCH. Which makes all of this more dangerous for BCH imo. 
2	1523029815	5	I don't care if it splits BCH in two. I can't like the guy until he comes clean on his crap. 
3	1523030185	1	Amen.
3	1523030027	0	But surely the success of bitcoin is infinitely more important than ascertaining the truth about the CSW Satoshi affair?
4	1523030171	1	If it can't handle something silly as a fraudster then it is already broken. 
5	1523030353	1	But that’s not the point. The point is whether we’re willing to fight amongst ourselves about the status of CSW instead of coming together around a common vision for the future of Bitcoin BCH. 
6	1523030642	2	Yes, fair point - you're right. 
7	1523030771	2	Whatever we think about CSW or whoever, if we can keep this common vision in mind I think we’ve got every chance of making Bitcoin a success. Maybe I’m too optimistic though!
5	1523030408	1	And it just sounded as though you were suggesting you’d prefer the former to the latter. 
1	1523010651	10	My point exactly
0	1523017057	4	I understand what you're saying.  I don't see how there is any liability.  But your vote is your call.  This isn't a very important issue to me, we might as well do as our enemies always wanted and just cast him down.  Let us know who is next on the chopping block.  Vitalik can manage the list.  Hell, put my name on it, I tend to talk too much, too.
0	1523005807	13	That same old picture of him smirking followed by another twitter quotation is literally posted every day for months. 
0	1523017368	6	This would not work. Coingeek, Calvin Ayers and Craig are joined into one entity that is a major investor in the BCH ecosystem and major contributor to BCH hashrate. Like it or not, guys with the money make all the rules. 
0	1523009661	12	These types of posts only fuel the fire. Perhaps better to take your chosen course of action silently, as we should all be doing with any and all off-topic posts. Windowly may not be a sockpuppet, just someone who finds CSW's comments of interest and something others may also want to see. I'm interested in hearing all sides of the discussion, as long as it is constructive rather than bare insults.Fewer ad hominem comments needed. We should endeavour to be more positive in communication with each other or not at all.
0	1523008282	6	i first found out about bitcoin through him, it was around 2011 when he got arrested in australia. it was on the news over here, then i started reading about bitcoin and my young ignorant self was thinking "what kind of idiot would buy something useless like that"
1	1523009109	11	I agree. CSW was the first person I ever heard use the term "near complete graph" and it really changed my views on Bitcoin for the better. There's no doubt that CSW is sharp and has useful insight. So he doesn't need to have his image whitewashed here.
0	1523008421	3	back to the roots
0	1523007287	9	I am downvoting every personal drama because that shit has nothing to do with BCH
0	1523016875	9	*I'm so sick of seeing posts about somone I'm going to voice my displeasure by posting about them!..*
0	1523006464	20	Bch is not one person. I support craig’s efforts and i think he is of great value to this community. 
1	1523007431	7	I agree with you that Craig has made contributions, but if Craig has something to say he should come here and say it instead of having one of his marketing team post it here.
2	1523008197	6	But isn't that the same with many other people?I think this sub is about discussing opinions and ideas. If someone has a good idea why not post it here?It's perfectly reasonable for you to not like it and even downvote, but we've had many posts from influential people linked here because of the content. 
3	1523009020	15	The posts I'm downvoting are not organic posts by people who found a nice quote and wanted to share it. It's the same account posting a daily nonstop pro-csw astroturf campaign.
2	1523008183	1	Dude a guy is doing research and PhD in the same time, he doesn’t have time for reddit like you and me, lets be realistic here. Besides he is posting everything he can on Twitter. 
3	1523008940	14	No time for Reddit he's too busy posting on Twitter. Got it.
4	1523009464	4	Slight correction, being a complete dick on Twitter. He’s openly mocking people.
5	1523014141	2	to be fair, he started mocking after Vitalik et al started the smear campaign IN a conference. that's uncalled for. that being said, yes you're right he's posting on twitter so if he wants to comment in reddit he'll have to post it himself. 
6	1523030012	1	I agree - he should stop mocking people, it really is uncalled for.
6	1523032722	1	God forbid anyone call out an attention seeking liar. CENSORSHIP! "guys who cares if he lies about everything, he gives us money!""prove that he's not satoshi""ad hominems attacks, its not his crazy words that matter but his work"
7	1523035212	1	Call him all you want, but if he's invited to a conference and asks certain questions it's not up to you to say why the fuck is he invited IN the conference. You can take it to the management and voice your concerns. I'm not saying CSW IS ANYTHING, I don't give a damn. And I also agree that this discussion is just getting further and further of technical and business development into pro-csw and anti-csw which is complete bullshit to me.
8	1523035849	1	I have a feeling that this is exactly what Craig wanted. If he is 1/10th as smart as he says he is, he knew this was coming. If he didn't want this sort of thing he would be working. He is an attention seeking fraud, nothing more.
3	1523035746	3	Doing a PhD means doing research. 
1	1523007563	6	What did he deliver of value? 
2	1523009870	13	For me he was the first person I ever heard who used the phrase "near complete graph" which completely changed my understanding of mining vs nonmining nodes for the better.
3	1523010754	3	I don't know wtf that is but him claiming that bitcoin was Turing complete was the biggest (and possibly the only) one.Otherwise he is full of hot air
4	1523014361	4	You need to watch [this](https://youtu.be/v1_gxvx_QGo)
4	1523029255	1	It explains why non-mining nodes are useless — because all of the miners/mining pools are connected to every other miner directly. There is no intermediary. This is why Bitcoin is not a mesh network, and why it is incredibly resistant to sybil attacks. Once a transaction is broadcast to the network, it is with every single miner in less than 2 hops. This is incredibly important for understanding the security and operation of bitcoin.
5	1523029962	2	They arent useless when validating incoming 0-conf transactions...but yes the idea that nonmining nodes provide some existential benefit to the network is somewhat laughable.
3	1523010822	-2	Yes, and he also thinks that can break the speed of light. It explains how he sees Bitcoin. The real world doesn't work that way. 
4	1523011115	11	>Yes, and he also thinks that can break the speed of light. It's a shame to hear you spinning like that, sewso. You've changed a lot in the past year or two.  I've often wondered if the original sewso lost control of this account.  The old sewso never made these sort of snarky low value comments and I probably interacted with the old sewso more than anyone else on rbtc.
5	1523014156	3	It is seweso, not sewso. And I'm simply don't like the group-think and adoration of CsW only because he says things which makes everyone feel good. I'm as critical as I ever was. I've defended opt-in RBF before, I defended Lightning when applicable and I even understand that at some point blocks can really become too big (although that is nowhere near 1Mb). The CsW crap bugs me, that's all. 
6	1523014601	6	What bugs me is the fact we don't have significantly more users thanks to core throttling the network with 1mb blocks.
5	1523023725	-1	Can you give an explanation of how two doubly-spent transactions on each side of the globe could be detected faster than the time it takes each of them to propagate to the other side without breaking the speed of light?
6	1523029575	1	It isn't my claim, so I don't have to defend it, but how'd you get your double spend to the other side of the globe so fast while still ensuring that it doesn't accidentally get back to the merchant before sending the real one, such that their arrival time to the network is timed within a few milliseconds.You know you're going to jail if the timing is off don't you? 
7	1523030162	0	> how'd you get your double spend to the other side of the globe so fast while still ensuring that it doesn't accidentally get back to the merchant before sending the real onePre-planning? Collusion? > You know you're going to jail if the timing is off don't you?This is an argument against zero-conf in general, not Craig's specific claim about 20ms. 
8	1523030575	1	>> how'd you get your double spend to the other side of the globe so fast while still ensuring that it doesn't accidentally get back to the merchant before sending the real one>>Pre-planning? Collusion? Be specific please. You're in my coffee shop. You want to have a cappuccino and not pay for it.Tell me how to get your double spend so far away I'll never see it and have it arrive at the precise moment you send your transaction to me, without fucking up.
9	1523031487	0	> Be specific please. You're in my coffee shop. You want to have a cappuccino and not pay for it.This isn't really a scenario that applies to Craig's claim. It probably makes sense with online virtual-goods purchases. If you're connected to a US server while in the US and make a 0-conf purchase at the same time your associate who's connected to an Australian server makes a 0-conf purchase, there's no way to determine which is the double-spend (or even that there was one) **WITHIN 20 MS**.I'm certainly not arguing that 0-conf can't be detected *extremely fast*, it's just that Craig's **specific claim** of 20 ms is literally physically impossible. Can you justify it without resorting to faster-than-light information propagation? 
3	1523023407	0	That his technobabble. 
2	1523008621	1	What about explaining what bitcoin is, doing research to expose blockstream coin(btc) garbage, investing in mining bitcoin(bch). He personally helped me understand some things also.. 
3	1523009695	3	Do you know what his PhD is in?  I know Wikipedia might not be the best source but they are saying theology .
3	1523009356	0	Investing in mining should be a result of demand and thus price. So if you think investing in mining for BCH is a good thing which should be celebrated, you failed to grasp how Bitcoin works. And if CsW presents this as a good-thing™️ then he also still doesn't understand Bitcoin. You defeated your own argument 💁🏻‍♂️
4	1523009509	3	Everyone who mines supports the network. It is a contribution, although miners have their own incentives..
5	1523009998	2	Haha, that's like paying someone to work on your house, and then he brags about fixing your house as if it was a friendly favour. It makes no sense, sorry. If you claim to invest in Bitcoin Cash mining as if that's a good thing you are trying to fool people into thinking it is a good thing. Incentives secure Bitcoin (Cash). Miners get paid. It's not voluntary work. 
6	1523025675	1	Not all incentives are monetary.You sound bitter.
3	1523008988	0	Heh?
4	1523009319	4	What is confusing? 
2	1523008120	0	Many things, how about all the patents that will be exclusively used for bch? Why so negative? 
3	1523008380	10	I'd like to read these patents, do you have links? 
4	1523008905	0	He posted it on Twitter... search his tweets 
5	1523009705	5	Can't find it, https://twitter.com/search?q=ProfFaustus%20patent&src=typdFunny is that a supposedly positive article about his patents point to prior art (Bitcoin itself + Lightning). Colour me unimpressed. 
3	1523009994	9	patents are for the centralized world.Patents are bad shit.
4	1523010680	0	They are for entities who want to protect their inventions, I won’t debate you, I have seen enough disagreement on this one...you can think whatever you want to think. But you know what’s also bad shit? Giving away bitcoin code and letting some idiots turn it into PayPal 2.0.
3	1523022718	1	Great, just what we need another fucking Blockstream to roll in with doing things the old way. Craig can shove his patents up his ass
1	1523008829	0	I don't think BCH would lose anything if CSW disappeared from this planet tomorrow
1	1523016158	1	What exactly has he done for us?
1	1523010044	-1	CSW is a toxic troll that's harmful to BCH.
2	1523011027	5	And you are..?
3	1523016650	6	...projecting, ofc
0	1523002811	20	I think he's a boon to BCH but thats my opinion.Newcomers that are foolish enough to entirely disregard BCH because this CSW guy with questionable character is making truth statements, are the exact newcomers that are going to be continually manipulated through fallacious arguments like character attacks *instead* of basing arguments on their own merrit.Saying we should focus on arguments when these 'people' are not even looking at the arguments is silly.Truth is, these 'people' are just sockpuppets trying to attack BCH in any way they can.Most of the IRL bitcoin community i have met is indifferent towards him. Yes, of course my anecdote isn't proof.
1	1523003174	2	> Truth is, these 'people' are just sockpuppets trying to attack BCH in any way they can.Yes, and the more we respond to their absurd demands and pressures, the more lame and pathetic we become.
2	1523010027	-1	Funny, I'm thinking you're the socketpuppet trying to attack BCH by shiling CSW.
3	1523013379	2	The whole reason i support BCH is because of [this video](https://youtu.be/v1_gxvx_QGo)So by linking others to it to get them to support BCH, you're claiming i'm attacking BCH?I don't mean to sound agressive but there is no possible way you genuinely believe this and support BCH at the same time.
4	1523014483	1	It's quite obvious that the CSW astsroturfing/socketmuppet campaign is orchestrated and designed to benefit CSW. He is grooming a personality cult to get into a position of relevance (if not reverence).I think that CSW is in this for nobody elses benefit than CSWs. And I think that this kind of cult is extremely bad. It's bad if it emerges around honest, humble and toughtful people. But it's particularly bad if it emerges around proven liars/frauds, grandstanding self promoters and loudmouths that use socketmuppets and social media manipulation to cultivate that cult. You just know nothing good will come of this, that's a given certainty.So yes, if you promote CSW, you're harming BCH.
5	1523015262	3	Ive been in bitcoin since 2012, i will continue to spread information that supports bitcoin. Humanity needs bitcoin.Say what you like but i have never once spoken to craig. Call me what you like but here on in, to me, you are an enemy of bitcoin because you are an enemy of bitcoin adoption.
6	1523015864	1	Well you're just proving my point. You're incapable of separating CSW and BCH. You're thereby promulgating the CSW personality cult and harming BCH. Good job.> to me, you are an enemy of bitcoinFunny, that's what you're to me.> because you are an enemy of bitcoin adoptionI support adoption, it's why I support BCH. I left BTC because of the insane personality cults and the problems with censorship, narrative control, astroturfing and smear campaigns that they bring. That's why you're to me the enemy of Bitcoin.
7	1523016015	0	I couldnt give two shits about craig. If he makes a valid argument and it gets downvoted just because he made it, that is bullshit.>You are incapable of seperating BCH and CSWYou're projecting - you are completely incapable of seperating CSW and the arguments he makes.

8	1523016592	1	> I couldnt give two shits about craigAnd yet here you are cultivating his personality cult...> If he makes a valid argument and it gets downvoted just because he made it, that is bullshitPeople who so thoroughly destroy their reputation have to live with the permanent stigma that brings.> You're projecting - you are completely incapable of seperating CSW and the arguments he makes.I find his "arguments" generally clumsy, badly articulated and presented as well as half-baked and populist. Fortunately I don't have to "seperate the crook and his arguments" there's no problem arising from me simply discarding anything about or from him unseen. It is a problem though if you're grooming a cult around CSW that makes him and BCH inseperable.> How convenient that Roger and Craig (BCH's biggest proponents by speaking eloquently, publically, about bitcoin) are the ones being attacked.How convenient crook and liar is being propped up by an astroturfing campaign executed by his socketmuppets all day, every day for months and months and months on this sub and others. No, that's all alright then is it?> You are either blind or on a payroll. Wake up.Peak hypocrisy.
9	1523016656	0	> And yet here you are cultivating his personality cult...Nope, I'm here because someone's valid arguments for bitcoin are being censored on the basis of character assasination.I'm done wasting my time conversing with you.

5	1523031535	0	Stop.  There is no CSW sockpuppet campaign.  Why do you think he gets to speak at all of these major conferences?  Is it because he pays off the organizers, or is because people actually care about what he has to say?  I urge you to power down your emotions and reconsider what you are saying.I won't try to convince you to like him -- that would probably be a waste of my time, since CSW is certainly not the most jovial person.  However, I will say that CSW is not Greg Maxwell.  He has real, tangible ideas that can significantly benefit BCH.  He is an asset, and we need all the assets we can get.

0	1523021900	7	This sub has become Kindergarten
0	1523008770	10	I'm with you. Already doing this for the most part.To those that say we are "censoring" Craig, you don't have a clue what you're talking about. Freedom is not fundamentally about enabling others. It is about following your own set of principles for your own sake, without being held back by anyone even if they claim that you have an obligation to them.I have no obligation to let Craig speak on property that I have direct or indirect ownership of. I have no obligation to listen to him. It is my right to ignore, ridicule and shut him out of any event in which I have a hand if I so choose. When the control I exercise is over what I made, to the degree that I had a hand in making it or to the degree that my reasons trump whoever is not given that control, I have earned that right.If Wright makes a good argument, that will be good enough and he won't need a dozen posts on this subs frontpage every few days to get his word out. Tweets about nothing new is not news worthy. However there's also a good argument that we should not give him any of our time whatsoever. Gavin Andresen put it really well in a blog post he made after it was shown Craig had been lying.>Either he was Satoshi, but really wants the world to think he isn’t, so he created an impossible-to-untangle web of truths, half-truths and lies. And ruined his reputation in the process.>If he was Satoshi, we should respect his wish to remain anonymous, and ignore him.>The other possibility is he is a master scammer/fraudster who managed to trick some pretty smart people over a period of several years.>In which case everybody except the victims of his fraud and law enforcement working on behalf of those victims should ignore him.>So, either he was or he wasn’t. In either case, we should ignore him. I regret ever getting involved in the “who was Satoshi” game, and am going to spend my time on more fun and productive pursuits.Lastly. Relying on a specific narrow set of community communication channels was a big mistake in the first place. Let's not make this our new central point in the network. That would be setting ourselves up for failure again.
0	1523035314	2	He should just go anonymous. It's clear he can't be a public figure.
0	1523035814	2	I never took you for a fool. CSW is neither good, nor bad for BCH. You can't have permissionless money and then say who should and shouldn't be involved in it. If any one person has power like that, I'm afraid bitcoin is, indeed, a failed experiment, as Mike Hearn has said. I believe BCH will survive this shit storm of CSW propaganda. That is all it is, propaganda.CSW is simply the subject of the next attempt at dividing the BCH community. Clearly it is working, judging by your post.If you give a shit about Craig Wright you are admitting that authority figures matter in this stateless, permissionless revolution.
0	1523011476	6	I'm just not talking about him anymore, at all. 
1	1523022768	3	From tomorrow.
0	1523007515	3	Who cares?
0	1523015364	6	Craig is really supportive of BCH and has been around for some time. I'm trying to understand if your reaction was triggered by Vitalik's comments at the Seoul conference. If it is (i'm not saying that it is), then isn't this the time when Craig needs support the most? How can we be a community if we just forsake our friends when they need us the most? 
1	1523015473	7	My reaction is that I'm really tired of low-effort shitposts repeating Craig's low-value tweets.
2	1523016715	5	He's done some great posts on the selfish mining fallacy.One of the things that stuck out during the Satoshi Vision conf was when Roger said that if gov't's wanted to destroy us, they would do it by breaking apart the community. While not your intention, this move may fracture our community as well.Craig is very loyal and intelligent and BCH needs all the support we can get right now. I hope you take this into consideration before downvoting any and everything Craig related.
2	1523028224	-1	I am sick of your shit posts and toxicity. 
1	1523018864	3	Craig is not my friend. It may be yours, but it's certainly not mine.
0	1523012492	4	fuck me talk about a post full of shit.. CSW is human and does not deserve this crap. 
0	1523008203	5	maybe CSW needs to do an AMA clear the air
1	1523009505	3	Probably impossible here. The combination of Blockstream trolls and the few BCH supporters who think behaving like thugs is ok means he is often harassed when he posts here. It can be a disgraceful sight.Look at Roger Ver's older twitter posts if you haven't. Hundreds of comments mixing abuse, rational sounding critiques, epileptic seizure inducing gifs, random/crazy comments, intimidation, etc. It's not a pretty sight.
2	1523010352	4	comes a time when you need a reference thread so noobs can hear all sides...many of the other high profile people have stood up and if the (ex-)CEO of mtGox can do it while still facing significant legal proceedings...its hard to give CSW a free pass
1	1523008556	5	He will never do anything close to an AMA because he knows the only thing people want to question him about is whether he's really Satoshi or not. He's obviously not but 90% of the questions will be "why don't you sign a transaction from the Satoshi wallet?"CSW being or not being Satoshi is the only reason most people have heard of him
0	1523012472	3	Can't say I disagree.
0	1523013353	4	The upvote/downvote mechanism is so much better and more democratic than censorship. Notice how this user is not saying, "I'm reporting CSW posts to the mods in an appeal to authority to have them removed." He's saying that _he himself_ will personally downvote these posts. He's saying why and he's giving an example for others to follow. If we follow this, we weed out the scammers without censoring them. Beautiful.
0	1523018832	3	Couldn't agree more.
0	1523028039	2	Way to contribute to the toxicity.> Having Craig's face all over this sub is a liability to Bitcoin CashYou don't get to decide who participates in BCH.  Downvoted.
1	1523028525	5	Always suspected OP as an infiltrator. Watch closely those who work to silence others.
2	1523028635	2	I agree with this.  He had a lot of great posts, but just something was not right about him, pushing a lot of weird things, and rubbed me the wrong way sometimes.  Perhaps we could take some cues from [Rick Falkvinge on this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8895yr/how_to_identify_and_reject_toxic_people_in/). User /u/jessquit could be controlled opposition, similar to contrarian, tophernator and others.
3	1523028882	2	Rick isn’t off the hook. The videos he made were all very basic circle jerk topics....”spedn, dont hold”, “LN sucks”, “permissionless blah”.Once he got our attention with basic feel good topics, he dropped the ball and started a witch hunt within the community (essentially  the catalystramping up the anti CSW stuff we have today.) He should be looked at as an infiltrator as well, and if nothing else, one of the toxic people he fake warned about.
4	1523028979	1	Very good point, and made me question things as well about Rick.  If he was calling out csw in his video, he should have just said it too and cut to the chase.
2	1523029769	0	>Always suspected OP as an infiltrator. Hey fuck you seriously.
3	1523029991	2	Back at you. Good luck on your censorship crusade...you are gonna need it......
4	1523030045	1	Censorship!?Oh wow, now you're talking like an rbitcoinerDOWNVOTING IS NOT CENSORSHIP
5	1523030273	-1	It’s advocating censorship. Your post is a call to action to keep certain posts hidden. Make no mistake. 
6	1523030305	2	That isn't how censorship works. You sound exactly like rbitcoin trolls.
7	1523030397	8	It’s exactly how it works...
8	1523030612	1	Said Greg Maxwell.
9	1523030707	5	Repeating “rbitcoin censorship” and “greg maxwell” doesn’t help anything. Only makes you seem like you are trying harder to show eveyone which “side” you are on.(Edit: this comment has 7 upvotes in 13 mins. Just stating before someone accuses me of brigading my own posts)
0	1523002746	6	> Having Craig's face all over this sub is a liability to Bitcoin Cash.No. And the more we see of him the better. Same with Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, Rick Falkvinge, and anyone else who supports Bitcoin Cash and has been smeared senseless by the pigs from Blockstream and Lightning Labs. Same with those who haven't had a chance to be smeared yet but whose turn will come soon enough if we keep doing what you suggest: including Peter Rizun, Amaury Sechet and all those who should be in the limelight and heard by everyone.We want every single one of them in your face and the face of everyone so much so that there is no getting away from them and you overdose.They support Bitcoin Cash. That makes them the best and smartest, people we are proud to be associated with. And as a matter of principle, we stand by them whenever the opportunity is granted us.
1	1523006392	19	I think u/jessquit point is not to suppress people, it is that windowly fills up the subreddit with CSW tweets every day, several times a day.Why don't CSW posts himself here, answers questions, etc? I think the way he handled the SM article was bad, with name calling (SM cancer, this is shit, etc), so he made people irritated and offended.Then you open the subreddit and there are 3 posts in the front page of CSW saying he will release soon some dope shit. Wasn't it exactly the kind of thing we always criticized about "LN is 18 months away?".So, I sort of get his point.
2	1523006746	14	You said it better than I did. Thank you./u/tippr gild
3	1523009145	0	Thx, but gild failed :(Maybe you can gild my wallet with those 2.5 usd? :P I'd certainly like ;)
2	1523010164	4	> I think u/jessquit point is not to suppress people, it is that windowly fills up the subreddit with CSW tweets every day, several times a day.All day, every day, for months and months and months. And if it isn't him, it's one of the other socketmuppets. I'm sick and tired of this shit.
2	1523008663	1	> Why don't CSW posts himself here, answers questionsIf he is wanted here then someone should ask him to come!? Otherwise, I guess he prefers to use Twitter, I don't know why. His choice.I get why some people are worried about or dislike individuals being promoted. But mainstream needs BCH figureheads, if only for practical reasons (interviews etc.) and that's who most of the public hear too. If the community bashes its own figureheads because some think one is getting too much attention or for some other reason, then no one in mainstream is going to want to hear them. Who would call a person for an interview that is not respected by its own community.It ends up undermining BCH. Hence why Blockstream & Co. put so much effort into smearing any public figure who support BCH. They do it literally full time (we can see them) because they know the impact it has.u/jessquit I think this reply should be for you too. I didn't mean to come out aggressively at you personally.
3	1523009402	6	No prob. I don't mean to be personal or aggressive against you or CSW or Windowly either. I'm just tired of the low-value pro CSW ad campaign.
4	1523009888	3	It's useful and I am quite sure necessary though.
4	1523031939	1	Ah, I get you here better, so you feel to be victim of such a campaing and now want to start a react campaign... guess that won't work.I hear you with some of what you feel, but I can only say, that CSW has things to say, nobody else comes up with yet, and he fills some vacuum here with little more sientific / industrial tone than others do. I m more used to such speeches maybe than orhers, so I can follow him a lot. 
5	1523032301	2	I'm FINE with CSW posting information, or someone posting ACTUAL information. READ MY POST. I'm talking about the stream of zero-effort tweet regurgitations with no context, no content, and no merit.
4	1523022305	1	Why not upvote if you enjoy the content? Or will you be downvoting all twitter posts?
3	1523009430	3	>If he is wanted here then someone should ask him to come!?I'm not a fan of his, but can you ask him for me? (I don't have a Twitter account.)I'm not interested in seeing his generic comments all over the front page, but I'd be happy to see him engaged in some actual discussion.
4	1523010037	0	No connection to him so I'd rather not. He has an account here though /u/craig_s_wright so you can ask him yourself, even if he doesn't post he probably comes here to read. 
5	1523010393	3	Consider it done if the ping worked. Hopefully he'll read this. Now let's stop promoting several posts at a time to the front page when all Craig said was something like "_I fail lots of times, but I get up and then I work hard to make Bitcoin Cash money for everyone_" or "_Just got done with some work! Big things are coming to Bitcoin Cash!_"Good for you Craig, but not worthy of being peddled as "News" or radically different from what a lot of other people that never get quoted do as well. Not several times a day/week.
6	1523012351	4	The last post was me in jest... I'm sure I annoyed more than a few.u/windowly's earlier posts were really useful to me though. I spend more time reading here than on twitter (too much noise) and many times I find something very useful on twitter only because someone posted it here.And yeah, I personally dislike the kind of pre-hype CSW likes doing. His tweets about cointext loooong before we even knew what it irritated me xD But we are a community, we should find it in ourselves to tolerate each others' quirks and imperfections or simply different ways of doing things. In the end it makes us more creative and if it helps us work together it's worth it.
7	1523012818	2	Thank you for the kind words u/btcnewsupdates! :)I'm not payed by anyone and I don't want to be payed by anyone.I do think everyone has the right to upvote or downvote what the want. . . or share what they think is interesting or fascinating 'bitcoin cash' wise. And for everyone it will be different. Haha I remember when a bunch of trolls got upset I was posting interesting thoughts from Cornell Prof. Emin Sirer.
1	1523016218	4	What has Craig done for BCH? 
1	1523004131	3	Guy is a pathological liar but we must support him because he likes bitcoin cash! Oh, and he gives us money. Did we mention he gives us money and that's why we turn away and wince when he says shit like "I am the Satoshi". 
2	1523006443	14	This trope that people in this sub are all paid CSW shills is also bullshit. There are surely a few, but most of us have been hanging around Bitcoin since before anyone ever heard the name "Craig Wright"
3	1523033558	1	I'm not saying he's paying people individually. When I say "we must support him because he gives us money" I'm talking about his donations to bch. 
3	1523007752	1	People in here are paid to support Craig Wright???
4	1523012446	3	I doubt there is a single one paid to do it. From what we can see anyway. What u/windowly is doing is smart in our opinion.
2	1523005112	5	You see that's the problem right there. A few people support a fast shrinking "store of value" crippled by incompetent coders, that imposes $50 fees on users and now only aims to fill the pockets of a handful of greedy bastards. These morons tell us that it's for our own good, and also that CSW is a liar. And we should listen to them instead of the smarties who get that BTC is now a scam and that BCH is Bitcoin?? Since when?
3	1523005481	4	Why do you have to be a supporter of Core to realize that CSW is an attention seeking liar?They don't exclusively go hand in hand. You know this because you see it all around you but you are still trying to pass it off as "oh they are just core supporters". No, its BCH supporters who know CSW is full of shit.Its Bitcoin supportersEthereum supportersMonero supportersFucking everyone!
4	1523005860	6	Because you don't have a clue what you are talking about. Just an angry and frustrated boy in need of an outlet to direct his anger. Someone put this shit in your head, you didn't make it up because you sure as hell don't have the skills. The same people who use sockpuppets that masquerade as supporters of other coins to create the identical in all ways "universal BCash hate". Crooks with a vested interest.Unless you are a career judge of course, in which case you would perhaps manage to pass some kind of judgement despite the flimsy information available to you.
5	1523006452	-4	When you listen to clowns like craig wright, don't be surprised when your life becomes a circus. The court of public opinion has no judge. You are a nobody. Craig Wright is a nobody. Anyone else who believes the earth is flat is a fucking nobody. 
6	1523006533	11	And you are a nobody too. So don't judge.
7	1523022259	2	>Just an angry and frustrated boy>You are a nobody. >And you are a nobody too. You literally replied with the best playground insult out there*I know you are but what am I*Go grab all your other sockpuppet accounts to agree with you lmaoBcash supporters are hilariously dense.
4	1523006808	1	I strongly disagree, IMO he is the biggest asset to this community! 
4	1523006596	-1	Forget it. These people can’t follow that train of thought. Downvote and move on. I would honestly be happy with all CSW posts being banned and removed since he is a confirmed scammer, but then his supporters would accuse r/btc for going full Orwell and it would probably just throw more fuel to the fire.But right now /u/Windowly is literally spamming /r/btc with CSW posts.

3	1523007855	1	Yes, he tells the odd lie like we all do, but some of it is not lies.  Mostly he just says things poorly or exaggerates a little, as we all do. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89ea67/im_old_enough_to_remember_when_almost_everyone/dwtgcx2/?context=3
2	1523005309	1	”He might be a lying scammer and a patent troll, but he says so many good things!”That is literally what scammers do. They tell you what you want to hear. But the one that made me fall off my chair in laughter is when Vitalik speaked out against his technobabble presentation that made zero sense and his sockpuppets and supporters (/u/btcnewsupdate is one of them) all rallied together and started claiming Vitalik is now censoring him.

7	1523012682	2	Us @btcnewsupdate, small team. Having said that, I checked and we said it on twitter. My wrong :D It was a good idea to do it anyway.
4	1523008686	2	when you start attacking someone with character smears/assassinations and yelling random noise (insults) to rile the mob its a form of "censoring""quick everyone! this person is a fraud/liar/delusional don't listen him!!! he might tell you some truths and warp your fragile little mind!"CENSORING BY LABELLING-------------------------there are other forms of censoring also1. If person A speaks at all, then unleash the TROLLS, and then the ATTACKS commence.2. If person A "retreats" and someone ELSE (person B) defends person A, then >3. Call person B(+1) TROLLS / PAID SHILLS, etc.4. SILENCE any MESSAGE person A might have been able to provide.5. DEMAND that person A comes back to speak for themselves.6. Goto 1.
5	1523009316	0	If you’re a fraud/scammer (which CSW is), you don’t want to argue with people like Vitalik Buterin, Emin Gun Sirer and Peter Rizun because they are intelligent and have a scientific approach to their arguments. Because if you do you will be made a fool of when you spout technobabble and change the meanings of variables, like CSW did in the presentation Vitalik critized. If half of the ones that are attacking Vitalik would actually have the intelligence to read up on it, they might change their minds.But they won’t because these are the types of people CSW wants around supporting him and his frauds. That’s why you need to do ad hominem attacks, yell ”censorship” or make up another lie to cover it up.https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/981132424875728896?s=20CSW can’t even spell ”Vitalik”  properly.

And screaming and yelling FRAUD LIAR is the best hing to do!;Dor maybe you could question the maths and figure out the truth like a rational human being?

0	1523014397	2	Why?!  What did he do?!  Craig is a kick ass alpha!!
1	1523023597	2	He's an awkward guy who commands no respect from anyone who is technical. "Hurrr, durrrr, 20ms, negative gamma, I am Satoshi. Vitalik is butthead" This is toxic technobabble.
2	1523037322	1	The guy is successful and has more money than you or anyone YOU know, so OBVIOUSLY he is doing something right!!
0	1523003794	2	I start to wonder if /u/Windowly is actually paid by the other sub to make this one here look silly.
0	1523019655	2	I would agree that to have any small group of individuals speaking and representing a decentralized community is a really bad idea.

0	1523026956	2	Will post more of Craig because of this whining.
0	1523008920	2	Funny thing, CSW is very active on this forum and one of the most upvoted members. I am sure even the haters upvote him without realizing it :-)But I agree, "too" much of anyting is never a good thing.
1	1523025250	1	> Funny thing, CSW is very active on this forum and one of the most upvoted membersIs this a guess or do you actually have evidence?
2	1523025982	1	It's a guess based on examination of presentations and papers written by CSW. it is easy to detect when once you learn his view on the system. 
3	1523026059	1	Isn't it possible that it's just someone who follows him closely and religiously agrees with everything he says?
4	1523026169	1	Anything is possible, could be talking to him right now, or visa versa ;-)
5	1523026429	1	Ha, now *that'd* be something!
6	1523026652	1	Why? You are not impressed by him anyway ;-)
7	1523026729	1	I was saying it would be something if I were Craig, considering my reputation around here. 
8	1523027125	1	Well, I guess You are right, that would be something, but I hope he sticks to running his company instead of playing games on reddit.
0	1523005163	2	Same here
0	1523007706	2	Just wait and see CSW move all the bitcoin from genesis block and you all will be really shock
1	1523008453	2	It's interesting that you bring this up.See, holding the keys isn't actually proof of anything, except that today you're in possession of the keys.Had Craig actually signed publicly with the keys, he would have faced a completely different but equally strong resistance called "where did you get those keys?" And I'd be agreeing with that resistance, because possessing keys is no more proof of identity than possessing someone's email or Reddit password.  Anyone might have those keys by now.By setting himself up to appear a fraud in the way he's done, he's created an entire narrative now that says, "if Craig has the keys he's therefore Satoshi.". So if he actually were to move coins or sign a message now, it'd be really hard to change the narrative to "holding the keys doesn't prove anything."Note: I'm not suggesting this is actually what he's done, I'm just saying that if you want to prove you're satoshi by holding keys you need to prove chain of custody, and there's no way Craig can do that.Interestingly, now, he's changed the narrative, and if he now signs with the keys, it will be extremely hard for naysayers to backtrack and say that holding the keys doesn't prove anything.Food for thought, that's all.
2	1523014294	2	> Interestingly, now, he's changed the narrative, and if he now signs with the keys, it will be extremely hard for naysayers to backtrack and say that holding the keys doesn't prove anything.don't underestimate the power of the naysayers.  if they don't want to believe something they will absolutely not. 
1	1523023728	1	He has proven that he is technically incompetent. If he could possibly move the coins, people would demand to know whether he stole the keys.

0	1523030687	1	This is going to be mad, why bother ? Isn't that a free sub here? ok, you can announce what you want, but why try to campaign others? Does that help to any unifying goal?
0	1523030723	1	Please, let's not devolve into mudslinging.  People frequently post about Roger, Rick, Peter, and Emin, and so I fail to see how posts about Craig are any different.  Sure, Craig is controversial, but much like Roger, he has done a lot for BCH and I value his opinion. Core is trying to fracture this community with infighting.  Don't let them.
1	1523030961	1	The only thing I'm slinging mud against is Windowly's daily spamming of this sub with low-effort CSW tweets.
0	1523033834	1	I agree with you. So many of his tweets are posted here and upvoted simply because he says a lot of things that the Bitcoin Cash community already likes. I could post tweets from a hundred other random Twitter users that say the same thing. He is only famous because he claimed without proof to be Satoshi. He is a fraud and a scammer (AUS gov't tax scam reference). He should be the last person this sub cares about, but he's also an excellent manipulator. That is his real talent, unfortunately.
0	1523009826	1	Dito. I'm sick and tired of this fraud being shilled here. It's just spam posted by his socketpuppet, upvoted by his botnet and his brainwashed disciples.
0	1523020792	3	I've had it too, I mean I know that I've defended him in the past, but I'm getting so sick and tired of hearing about the Reverend Dr. Wright, I've personally had enough of him for now *and there will be consequences*. For example, if you post one of the Reverend Dr's tweets, you will be soon afflicted by **My Personal Downvote**. Furthermore, I will give your post the **side-eye**, big-time. Reap the whirlwind!

1	1523006561	9	Yes I know. You had your fill of Craig months ago. I've been giving him a pass to see if he improves his persona or not.  I'm not seeing it.I'm still not "anti CSW" because I think he can redeem himself.  Everyone makes mistakes. But this astroturfing campaign is the opposite of "redeeming himself."
2	1523008293	10	I'm still wondering why we need to "fight" against CSW instead of just ignoring the issue. I cannot help but think that this is just another attempt by the Core side to divide us BCH supporters.
