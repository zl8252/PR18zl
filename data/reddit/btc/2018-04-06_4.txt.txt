0	1522959633	21	Would very much like to see something that improves privacy in BCHs roadmap, asap
1	1522959674	32	Cash Shuffle .... I hope BCH wallets integrate it asap. https://cashshuffle.com
2	1522959998	24	My team is building an Omniwallet with BCH as one of the phase one inclusions. We have been talking a bit about privacy, so I'll include this along with it.Saw some claims that BCH was going to get protocol level privacy features in May but if that looks like just hot air, then I'll take steps towards providing a wallet with whatever viable privacy options we have available.Already paid for it, might as well make the devs work a bit.
3	1522967541	11	I don't think anyone made protocol level privacy claims for May or even later this year, but there were some claims about privacy improvements based on new OPcodes based on nChain patents.Personally, I would not consider those as near term relief.
2	1522961493	19	Cash Shuffle variants where mixing/privacy is opt-in will be important.We probably need to stay away from becoming a 100% privacy coin, as some exchanges may start banning them. Recent examples being Japanese Exchanges removing them due to regulatory pressure.Regulatory pressure will continue increase on coins that are 100% privacy based. Opt-in shuffling is much harder to enforce/ban.
3	1522962128	20	> Regulatory pressure will continue increase on coins that are 100% privacy based. Opt-in shuffling is much harder to enforce/ban.This!
4	1522980144	8	I disagree, some governments / the financial elites that run the goverments are going to oppose / ban / restrict cryptos anyway if they get too big. At the moment their price manipulation in combination with their split of the community in thousands of altcoins worked extraordinary well but it might not work forever.As soon as they want to crack it down and the revolution where we get rid of governments starts we need privacy, otherwise it's far too easy to threaten certain people or groups with their monopoly on "legitimate" use of force and at this point only full privacy coins will survivive and lead the libertarian revolution. I don't think crypto currencies should be designed to stick to regulatory rules.
5	1522989513	5	I think you're correctly seeing the end game - in the end they will have to tax more to make up for their loss of control of the money supply.Not saying this is the only reason why they'd crack down, but if the world ran on bitcoin it would make their jobs of waging war much harder. So in their eyes it's a threat and bitcoin must go or they face possible extinction (of their current form, like how banks would look very different if bitcoin became widespread)Truth is the only one making 'threats' is them - nobody is pointing weapons at them telling them to use bitcoin.The world needs to learn the difference between voluntary/involuntary relationships and the consequences of ignoring morality.>“The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name.” - Confucius"Taxation = theft" is a start.[It's up to you](https://www.yours.org/content/psa--bitcoin-s-success-is-on-you-44fe01ae8fdc) to ensure we spread quick enough.
5	1523000761	3	You're both right. That's why we need to get the code ready and tested but not merged into Bitcoin Cash yet. As soon as we really need it we'll be able to upgrade.
6	1523013924	2	I think a 3rd party solution like Cash Shuffle is a good start. That way, it is not too interfering and still gives people the privacy choice, at least until/if it becomes neccessary with first party protocol privacy.
7	1523014185	2	agree
3	1522963685	8	> We probably need to stay away from becoming a 100% privacy coin, as some exchanges may start banning them.How about an extension block with zero knowledge proofs?
3	1522964989	6	Yeah I agree. Also if it becomes a world currency. I want everyone to be able to audit where the tax money goes. Or at least be able to point and say "why did my tax money get shuffled right here"
4	1522975217	5	Or you know... Charity.

3	1523001277	3	Yes, we need both privacy and transparency.
3	1522970987	3	> Opt-in shuffling is much harder to enforce/ban.Why? Just declare that if you can't explain the source of a coin, it's is illegal to sell/use it. Mixed coins become dirty.
4	1522977076	6	The idea would be everyone would be doing some mixing... So you can explain the source, but all coins are going to have some taint, so the fungibility is protected
3	1522965954	3	and thats  part of why DEX's will likely take over. Just a matter of time...
2	1522963607	3	Have you heard of BOLT?https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/701.pdf
0	1522963660	38	Had my Kraken account shut down for "compliance reasons" that they would not share with me because I did a altcoin swap at btc-e before the fall, then sent the resulting funds to them a a year later.Fungibility is at stake, not just privacy.
1	1522964222	16	Wow crazy story. You should post that in its own thread, to point out the importance of fungibility. 
1	1522964570	12	You should post this. 
2	1522965224	5	I just did, thought it was relevant.
1	1522970651	6	Atomic transactions with decentralized exchanges would be the solution to this.
1	1522982860	3	Did they tell you explicitly that they are shutting you down because of the btc-e swap? I use btc-e a lot and I've never been shut down by any exchanges.
2	1523016357	2	btc-e went under/taken down, replaced by wex.  I haven't used wex.Account shut down following a LTC deposit that originated btc-e last June.edit: No, the exact text was>We're sorry to inform you that we will be closing down your Kraken account, and for compliance purposes, we cannot disclose the reason for this action. We apologize for this inconvenience. Please note that you still have a balance in your Kraken account, so we ask that you please withdraw it within the next 72 hours (from the time and date of this message). After the 72 hours have passed, your account will be closed.>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to respond to this message. Thank you.>William>Kraken Client Engagement>Remember to secure your account with two factor for login and a global settings lock:https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/201396877-What-is-the-Global-Settings-Lock-
1	1523022504	3	How do you know it was due to the alt coin swap?
2	1523022988	2	I don't, *but*:* I was a member imported when they acquired CaVirtEx* I was verified* I didn't use the account for anything except 3 trades, all with funds going into a new wallet, received from btc-e* Verification was undone almost immediately following the trade, and re-verification tickets went unanswered for 2 weeks, followed by the notice* I have verified accounts at 2 other US based and 2 Canadian exchanges and, never traded those wallets with BTC-E funds or crossed inputs or txs that way. What else can be assumed given the only interaction with Kraken I had was "tainted" by an exchange that was taken down by FBI or Fincen or whatever Team America field team was responsible?  My CaVirtEX account had been live (and verified) since early 2012.Impossible to "prove" as US legal regulation prohibits them from sharing that information but I know what I believe, and that's what I'm sharing here.
1	1522986051	1	Proof please
2	1523016317	2	Not sure how to prove a negative.  I can screencap the account closure notice, but btc-e was taken down.  On that matter, I can't get my trade history from Kraken, a real pain in the ass as far as calculating my average cost base as you can imagine.What proof would satisfy you?  edit: signed into wex.nz with my btc-e info and it worked, neat.  No trade history though.  I'll see if I can dig up the LTC addresses involved.
0	1522974584	10	This is the number one reason to have cheap, near-free fees. Coin mixers and high volume can make these processes fail. 
1	1522976666	2	automated coin mixer would be nice?
0	1522962682	3	At Satoshi's Vision, CSW said they were "screwing the pooch" for chainalysis didnt he?
1	1522980509	2	That doesn't mean we should rely on it, especially if he doesn't explain how exactly it will be done. He needs more action / less talking. If they deliver something that's fine but what about plan b?
1	1522985508	2	I thought the transparency of the blockchain was going to hold governments accountable?I'm all for fungibility but are some people claiming both is possible?   If it is, tell me how.
2	1522989500	3	You can choose to make a transaction public or private. The government would be required to conduct public ones.
0	1522970965	4	I'm going to suggest something else - why are we trying to add on privacy and fungibility to a coin which has not been designed to have it from day 1? There already exists a coin which does this very well and takes it far more seriously than any other coin - Monero. What we should be looking to do is facilitate the development of decentralized exchanges with atomic swaps (ideally built right into our wallets). Rather than trying to redesign Bitcoin, we should use what resources already exist to make lives better for our users.I do know that Monero currently has issues with fees and blockchain size. I see both BCH and XMR as complimentary - a truly private coin for savings and a cheap, fast, reliable coin for purchases. Both communities should be working together, not trying to reinvent the wheel.*DO NOT FALL VICTIM TO 'NOT INVENTED HERE' SYNDROME*
1	1522979931	6	Don't you think any coin without fungibility is doomed to fail?
2	1522984890	3	I think trying to add fungibility as an afterthought to Bitcoin Cash will fail.
3	1522987300	1	Well, if it can be added technologically, would you be against it? I really hate that my money can basically be tracked back to it's inception. 
4	1522988054	3	No, of course not. I just think it'll not be done well. Monero also does something very smart - all transactions are private and a minimum safe level of privacy is mandatory. Optional privacy doesn't work very well.
1	1522987460	2	The issue is that with chainalysis and laws, over time most Bitcoins will become blacklisted in a way cash never suffered.  It turns out that to have actual digital cash fungibility is required.  It's not to compete with Monero, it's to remain viable.  Privacy is an effect of fungibility but not a primary goal.
2	1522988139	1	You're correct. I'm saying that BCH is already very behind Monero and the only way to catch up is to effectively just become Monero anyways...

0	1522962655	2	Blinded thresholds.
1	1522968842	7	How does it work?
0	1522973411	2	Jeez! Yes we do
0	1522982051	2	As adoption increases and the average amount held any one address diminishes, does the need for (or value of) tracking also diminish? Only the larger holdings will be of any interest to govt/law? Therefore, wouldn't the tendency already be to create smaller "denominations" by managing multiple wallets? This is the same reason merchants scrutinize 100's but don't blink at 20's or less. I know this makes larger purchases more difficult, but then maybe they should be to some degree.
0	1522983461	2	Just because some investors give a startup a ton in funding doesn't mean that the startup will succeed. A few years ago there were investors putting millions into "facebook for dogs", that didn't automatically mean we need to prepare for a future where every dog in America has a "dogbook" account.Chain analysis already fails on wallets that use a new address for each change output. No solution exists (and probably never will) to deanonymize such wallets.
0	1523013173	2	Yeah, only criminals place importance on their privacy and use privacy coins...whatever.   That guy is a douche.

0	1522964871	1	Bitcoin core is planning for schnorr sigs ( yea they have been saying that every 18 months ). I think it will happen though.Bitcoin cash should have some privacy option at the protocol level. Not a trusted zkp setup, but ring signatures or schnorr. Extension blocks can achieve this without bloat?
1	1522983816	1	I've recently read that Dash devs might prefer BLS (Boneh–Lynn–Shacham) signatures over Schnorr. I don't know anything about either of them. How are they related to privacy?
1	1522983214	1	Wallets that make a new address for each change output already have enough privacy to make any "protocol level" privacy solution pointless.
