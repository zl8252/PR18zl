0	1523010747	4	I don't know much about this guy, but it alway feels like he thinks he knows more than the person he's talking to.
1	1523015318	2	And his body language reveals exactly that, specifically in his last discussion with Roger Ver. 
2	1523015460	3	It's like a creationist arguing with an evolutionist and thinking he's right because god said so in the bible. He might be a good coder, but he isn't a deep thinker.
3	1523023035	5	Hold up, a "good coder"?? I have yet to see evidence that Samson can code his way out of a wet paper bag. His claim to fame is his incessant Twitter trolling
4	1523024354	1	I can't provide evidence. I was just assuming, but you know what happens when you assume...
5	1523025196	3	Well at least when we make asses of ourselves it's just on Reddit. Samson makes an ass of himself on stage with cameras pointed at him
6	1523025257	2	That's true. I know nothing, but he's paid to know nothing
1	1523029951	2	>I don't know much about this guy, but it alway feels like he thinks he knows more than the person he's talking to.As a rule of thumb, it's true. Certainly when it comes to blockchains.
0	1523025418	2	There is no such thing as Lightning tokens, and there are many open source lightning implementations and teams 
0	1523006883	1	Samson's big mouth. 
0	1523017430	1	Whats the big shear?
0	1522994095	-21	Nice Shitpost of a Shitposter w a touch of big scare..  Double Score.. 
1	1522994225	8	What does your user name even mean?  
2	1522999726	6	It means ‚ÄúI‚Äôm edgy look at me!‚Äù
2	1522994615	-20	That the truth (Shitpost) needs no history (reddit history)  to be true.
3	1522997956	11	The data point that is reputation should be discarded so your sock-puppets have the same voice as real people? At least you admit that you would prefer it if it was easier to sybil-attack the community. 
3	1522997503	3	sooo... hitler didn't kill people, because it's truth and we don't need history?
4	1523020215	0	Yes I'm sure that's exactly what they meant by that username. Very smart interpretation on your part, but why are you wasting your talents here? Isn't there somebody on Twitter who said something in slightly bad taste? You could accuse **that** person of defending Hitler and it would get you lots more attention than this will get you around here. In fact, moving this act to Twitter could even land you a $1000 a month Patreon to root out for other Twitterers all of the people who are underhandedly defending Hitler without even mentioning his name.
5	1523025857	1	your name is honouring all of your personality.I could do shit like that all day to clueless twats that deserve to learn the truth.I didn't mention his name. i ment to exaggerate his denial on a truth that has been said on video. If you missunderstand this... well... look at your name
6	1523026127	1	Burned by a tween, ouch!
7	1523033547	2	Truth is Always true, so it needs no karma points or reddit history to be so.. This thread is a shitpost as It represents little emotional children crying out with scare drama for attention, being haters and causing division.  We are all brothers and sisters in Cryptoland who should be fighting against our real enemy, aka Big Brother.  
0	1523023446	0	I don‚Äôt care about this, let‚Äôs focus on BCH
1	1523027239	0	Nah we gotta keep promoting bch is superior for no reason at all.
