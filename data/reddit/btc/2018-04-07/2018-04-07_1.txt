1	1523077994	24	The Polish government is screwed. On the one hand they're pretty popular by protecting the borders, but they keep blowing people's good will with massive interventionist quasi socialist policies like this. Why is border protection *and* a free market so difficult?EDIT: the crippling regulatory apparatus is the reason so many young polish people leave the country at the earliest opportunity. You'll meet poles all over Europe, and most have a similar story: no prospects in Poland. Near impossible to start a business, become an entrepreneur or just get a job.
2	1523084904	16	Why don't people realise that borders are figments of a shared imagination and a social contract upheld by violence?
3	1523090199	11	Most people do, but they also realise that having geographic boundaries on the applicability of laws and type of governance aren't all bad.. 
4	1523092641	2	Yet laws aren't geographically bound, alot of nations have exceptionality in laws that crosses geographical boundaries.For example, I heard that purchasing sexual services in a country that allows prostitution by law, is still punishable for norwegian citizens, even when they perform the legal/illegal action outside of norwegian borders.
5	1523100877	4	You need to be in Norway for that law to apply though, it's not like Germany is going to extradite you to Norway.  Lots of countries claim extraterritorial jurisdiction, but you have to be in their geographic territory for it to apply in any meaningful sense (or within the geographic area of a country that will extradite you anyway..). 
6	1523115220	3	Pluto PeteVariety JonesKim DotcomJust to name a few people that never step foot in a country but have felt the longest arm of the law.
7	1523115918	1	Right..  But now you are moving from a discussion on universal jurisdiction, to one of questions about extradition and edge cases in terms of where an offence is committed. Of those, the first two are the least clear, but based on the discussions out there, seem to have been involved in acts that were criminal both in the countries where they lived (and were detained..) as well as the countries to which they face extradition.When it comes to Kim Dotcom you get a clearer (mostly..) picture, and you'll see that there is a benefit to borders, and geographical differentiation when it comes to legislation and jurisdiction. 
6	1523112554	1	Not quite true. After the fact, if you return to norway, you have committed a crime and they will punish you if it can be proven.This makes for interesting blackmailing scenarios and undermines some of the basic concepts of law, but it is what it is. At least that is what I've been told, and norway is not alone in this.
7	1523112719	1	>Not quite true. After the fact, if you return to norway, you have committed a crime and they will punish you if it can be proven.Yes. So you need to be in Norway for the law to apply... >This makes for interesting blackmailing scenarios and undermines some of the basic concepts of law, but it is what it is. At least that is what I've been told, and norway is not alone in this.Indeed, the point however is that you have borders delineating different laws and different approaches to law.  The borders provide clarity on who is in charge, and what laws apply (even if you can break those laws outside of the country and be charged on return..).
3	1523091882	15	It's easy to realize it when you receive the benefits paid by people on the other side of the border; much harder to realize when you're paying said benefits to people on the other side of the border...
3	1523114929	2	Because mobs of foreign rapists.
3	1523086103	3	Pretty sure everyone realises that!
4	1523088786	2	i don't think so.
3	1523111917	1	So is currency, government, laws, economy, religion, education and the list goes on, so I'm not sure what you are getting at.   Bitcoin is not a push back on the societal construct of currency either, as it is one.  A true push back on the societal construct would be throwing the concept of "fair exchange for goods or services" to the wind and promoting a sharing economy.    That in turn would become the new societal construct.   
3	1523117991	1	I agree, and perhaps borders wouldn't be necessary if the concept of "public property" didn't exist in some sense. By keeping open borders in a country with relative prosperity, you're subsidizing immigration, allowing abuse of taxpayer subsidized property, and, given that there is a welfare state in virtually every country, you're inviting abuse of the social system, which is yet a further offence against the property and freedom of the taxpayers.  In my ideal system public property wouldn't exist and there would be no welfare state, so borders would be unnecessary. But we have what we have and must make the best of it by limiting abuse of citizens. Unfortunately that precludes an open border.
2	1523094974	-1	I don't see how this is socialist at all
3	1523095709	4	Interesting. 1. They want to maintain centralized control of the means of production *of money*.2. Taxation is a form of indentured servitude, you make money by working, therefore taking your money is forcing you to work or spend part of your life serving your "masters" [well, they'll say, your fellow man]. Socialists want your labor to serve the state, hence high (or 100%) taxation, and they'll grant you some money in return to survive, but they consider all wealth to belong to the state. "To each according to his needs, from each according to his ability" which implies the state as collector and redistributor.

1	1523080102	24	Gang of criminals, writ large. (The State)
2	1523104297	1	This warms my heart
1	1523087532	3	i don't think it's a coincidence
0	1523062366	21	And add that people who traded have to fill 3 page form for every transaction... and at the end sign it :D...200 000 trades makes paper to fill 1/4 olipic swimming pool - for realI think this i torture...
1	1523073652	12	If you can automate it, you may be able to screw them by following the *letter* of the law.
2	1523092493	4	Is that just before they screw you?
3	1523092856	1	You can probably limit your losses by making the trades low-value.
0	1523069975	16	Jesus Christ, that sounds horrible.Why is the Polish government anti crypto???
1	1523080153	14	Because it threatens their way of running things ðŸ™„
2	1523080406	34	> Because it threatens their way of running things ðŸ™„Actually this is not the only reason. They are also stupid.They would earn more money by just taxing crypto with a low tax and getting a lot of rich crypto people from abroad to pay their taxes in Poland.But they don't think with perspective. 
3	1523087757	12	>But they don't think with perspective. Exactly, high tax doesnâ€™t mean high tax revenue... (often it actually lead to less tax revenue)I guess the goal here is to destroy..
3	1523103115	2	Exactly. It is similar in Denmark. I know a lot of people that have moved to Switzerland for similar reasons. Switzerland is propably the closest to libertarian country you can find in Europe, it is awesome.
0	1523079976	28	They prove why we are in crypto Each so called clampdown move is another reason we double down and trade freely with each otherNo needs for banks and stupid governments to control your moneyYou own it
0	1523081283	10	Coming soon to other shithole countries. 
1	1523091650	4	Slovakia (neighbouring country) already has a tax in place, crypto is in the category of "other income", which is taxed by 33-39%. fuck my country.
2	1523107514	1	This is way worse.If you buy $99 of Bitcoin, then sell that for $100, you made a dollar and are taxed at 100%. You then sell the ETH at $100 in Fiat. You made nothing. Your are taxed another dollar anyway... 200% taxation. Actually, you were likely taxed on your Bitcoin purchase too, for 99 cents, so that's 299% taxation.That's not a tax. It's a fine.
0	1523058897	14	>Oh by the way for those that didn't know: in Poland the IRS has a time machine. For them, the law works even back in time. I am serious. They don't change the law, they just change the interpretation which can reverse their previous decisions even 10 years back in time.The United States works identically, just with minor differences in statute of limitations.
1	1523087619	8	Really? So law can be retroactively changed too?W T F..
2	1523091642	4	They don't have to change the law, they just decide that they're going to enforce a certain interpretation, and they can back enforce that interpretation. You're able to challenge this in court at great expense.
3	1523094514	2	Oh shit.. ok, so I guess it is the same for my country too.
0	1523073326	6	Vote for Janusz Korwin-Mikke? Or move.
0	1523073875	6	It might only be a thought, but if the EU makes a crypto directive, Poland would have to implement that knt he form of how crypto is classified as an asset. This might help with the taxation, which from my understanding is something each member state can decide for their own
0	1523072800	7	I don't get it; why would anyone tell their government they're trading crypto? my gov thinks I'm unemployed & broke. Why would I ever disclose the amount I'm trading in crypto? If exchanges are ever going to send stats to my gov I'm going full DEX, now, tell me, how are they going to know? Impossible. Therefore, decentralized exchanges is the answer. Fuck government.
1	1523081275	5	Al Capone was only caught on tax evasion
2	1523109405	2	Al Capone didnt have XMR
3	1523110959	1	The exchanges you buy XMR from do not give a fuck what you are buying. You are completely transparent. XMR only works if you work or mine it
1	1523077377	6	Exchanges have been collaborating with govs for a while already....
1	1523091203	3	That unemployed, broke guy driving around in a lambo and living in a mansion will get questions eventually. 
1	1523091757	3	are you keeping your money under your mattress or in a bank account? thats how they are going to know..
1	1523096780	3	Goverment will ask exchanges for the info about users and transactions. It will get some info from the ones based in said country, so there is some possibility that it will catch someone for tax evasion on trading cryptos.
0	1523057512	8	Man this really sucks. By the way did you see the Bitfinex bank account seizure? Is that really bitfinex's? Because in the article in Polish Bitfinex is never mentioned
1	1523057967	7	Yes, Bitfinex was supposed to have a polish bank account before. I am not sure about whether that was really finex. The matter is still unravelling.
2	1523059447	19	It is difficult to tell because Bitfinex operates more like an international mafia comprised of shell corporations and fox holes than a legitimate business.
3	1523062813	7	LOL too true
1	1523115950	1	Here is the info, but still nothing confirmed:https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/04/07/e400-million-seemingly-seized-bitfinex
0	1523062229	8	It's a little hard getting a proper understanding from the translations, can someone explain please how / in what scenario, selling capital of 15000 PLN would result in over 500,000 PLN tax?Generally it seems tax agencies may have a poor understanding of cryptocurrencies and thus come up with unfavorable regulations, but they're not "out to get you" as some make it seem here.
1	1523067077	26	1% tax (stamp duty, "podatek od czynnoÅ›ci cywilnoprawnych") on every transaction. Not on profits, but on total amount.Every single transaction needs a separate 3-pages tax declaration http://www.finanse.mf.gov.pl/documents/766655/4836276/PCC-3+++05+012.pdf and 1% stamp duty within 14 days, same as buying a car or house.The example given is a trading bot with 50 transactions per day * 30 days.And it's for past too. You were supposed to be declaring and paying this every time you transacted crypto since 2009. Even coin-coin pairs.
2	1523083767	5	Just go undergrownd..
3	1523093535	6	They're leaving no choice are they
2	1523102936	-4	Suddenly, it sounds less insane and less targeted towards crypto than the headline suggests.Clearly, this kills high-frequency trading and bots (unless there's a loophole). Oh, wait, this also kills using cryptos as payment (unless there is an exception).OK, that sucks, but tone down the senstationalist headline.
0	1523086568	3	Some guys in the USA could in theory owe 0.5M to the irs for btc they bought for 15K even if they end with less money they started with...
1	1523108293	3	How so? US is taxed on differential when you "realize" the transaction. So if you bought in for $15k and experience 100x growth, you owe nothing if you don't sell. If if sell, you "realize" at the point of sale and pay your cap gains rate on the 99x growth (100x minus your 1x original investment.) Doesn't matter if it went to 1000x growth then fell to 100x, you don't owe anything on the 1000x growth because you sold at 100x. If you lost money it's a tax write-off.The only way I can concieve of you owing money is if you had 100x gains and sold. Then, rather than immediately put aside your tax money you 1) traversed into the new tax year and then 2) did something like put both your money and the tax man's money into a 100x leveraged long and busted leaving you with no money to pay your taxes for the previous year. In that case you were gambling with the tax man's money, not your own. I think there may be a provision for that even though where you can write off a previous years gains with a catastrophic current loss; not sure.Do you have an example scenario?
2	1523117903	1	Sell or trade (which is a tax event at fair market value) for big profits in 2017, lose almost all of your profits back in 2018's bear market. Then you could owe more in 2017 taxes on short and long term gains then you still have left in crypto value now in 2018.
3	1523118758	1	Right, because a percentage of the money made in '17 wasn't yours. You put someone else's money into crypto and lost it. You need to account for your cap gains at time of trade because you owe that money in USD, not BCH and if the exchange rate goes against you....Still, you get to write off this years losses. If you realize them. If you simply cannot pay, end of year it's pretty much a wash minus any penalty, which is generally pretty reasonable if you aren't ouright evading them.
0	1523087463	3	Tax is scary..It will be how governments will kill cryptocurrencies...

0	1523096979	2	Guys, we can choose a currency to do our business with, but why **the heck** can't we choose a country we're living in?Like, there's everything in place. It just takes a group of people to organize and create a free, independent, tax-lax state in the middle of nowhere, or in the middle of goddamn international waters, and watch the people come and do their business and raise their families in there. Like what America used to be way back then.Something like an off-shore zone, but the size of Germany or California.I think /u/MemoryDealers is trying to accomplish something like this, but I see no news updates on the project. Eventually people will have to make a choice: live free, or die as slaves.
1	1523101739	3	> but why the heck can't we choose a country we're living in?You actually can in the EU.
2	1523105480	1	Good thing there is significant diversity of tax policy between different countries in the EU, so you can avoid enormous taxation and having to support a collapsing pyramid scheme. Oh wait...
1	1523101928	1	> Like, there's everything in place.

Go figure.
1	1523117801	1	I think itâ€™s called Alaska. See for yourself.
0	1523064812	3	First I hear about it, sounds surreal. Especially the retroactive part. Hope it isn't set in stone.*Has this reached any English news outlets? I try to make sure something is real before taking it in fully and I can't really understand or validate any of those sources myself (without a lot of work).*
0	1523070803	2	I just don't see how it's anybody's business.If society's overhead was built into the cost of consuming resources, a) none of this would matter, b) everyone would contribute to society what they consume.
1	1523118430	1	A consumption tax instead of income tax would be awesome and encourage savings and stop all this wasted time with tax prep each year. May need a card for low income to avoid some of the consumption tax though.
2	1523118482	1	Yep exactly.
0	1523081719	2	Well that's the Beauty of the EU system. When it fucks up you get to migrate out of the EU.
0	1523070084	2	FUD. bullshit laws won't be taken seriously, so they will have no effect.
1	1523080446	11	> FUD. bullshit laws won't be taken seriously, so they will have no effect.Maybe they won't, but this is not FUD. This is the fucked up way things work in Poland.
2	1523098712	4	Kind of regrettful to hear about this because I've alwasys liked Poland for its death metal. I might be wrong but when the "Syrian refugees" were a hot topic Poland did not come along with the bullshit EU was pushing to the eastern european countries. But now with cryptocurrencies they have lost it? I am not amused.

0	1523104052	-1	This is a good thing. It will show more and more people how truly corrupt their governments have become. Once they realize it, they will become part of the underground economy.
