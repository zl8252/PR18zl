0	1523054168	30	I've spread your Bitcoin Cash commercial to some friends and they all agree it is funny and clever. Well done!/u/chaintip
1	1523055245	18	Wow thank you so much!
1	1523054288	14	***u/CollinEnstad has [claimed](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qrelay2fh9hdksgzanqn75kq49xnwe06kqxq384uzv) the `0.1 BCH`| `~  60.46 USD` sent by u/where-is-satoshivia [chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org).***
2	1523055179	10	dayum
2	1523102207	1	wow
1	1523072030	1	What we need to do now is crowd fund a budget for some television spots. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason why spray on hair assaults my eyeballs 47 times a day in the gym, and while I‚Äôm eating Oreos at 10 PM on my couch, but this can‚Äôt do the same./u/collinenstad

1	1523054455	7	Also good!
1	1523078795	1	Lol! Poor guy at the end!
2	1523085069	1	I know that guy at the end. I shaved his head. 
0	1523052772	20	Great video!
0	1523055143	11	Neat!
0	1523056765	7	really like it. you should air that
0	1523058356	14	great voice over work.  I'm impressed overall.  Great job BCF!
1	1523062841	6	Agreed. It reminds me of the game The Stanley Parable 
2	1523064897	8	Same guy ;)
3	1523065450	4	Sweet dude. Get this shit all over the crypto twitter world üåç 
3	1523102291	2	oh really? it was kevin brighting, big fan of stanley parable and didnt notice!
0	1523057739	21	Kudos for making the ad.That said, I'm not sure how the ad will be used but in case it's for mainstream airing with real ad budget, I just wanted to share my two cents.To be honest  i'm not getting the point of the ad in terms of what the message is supposed to be. You could literally switch out "Bitcoin Cash" with "Venmo" or "PayPal" and the ad would still work in my opinion. Shouldn't it focus more on a differentiating factor that's very obvious to anyone watching the ad, for example security, economic sovereignty, low transaction fee, etc.?I say this because I care. Hope it makes sense.
1	1523058696	21	You're right - I think the main difference between those two things are that you can actually see the coins being moved from one wallet to another. We are showing it being used as money rather than a specific app. Another thing is we designed this in a way to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Your average joe doesn't care about security (we throw our info to services like fb all the time), sovereignty ("I have freedom already lol"), low transaction fees ("my credit card is free!" [merchant takes the hit on the tx fee]). Thanks for the feedback though. There are plans to cover those points in other videos. Cheers.
2	1523060835	8	Very well done.u/chaintip
3	1523061042	8	Thank you so much!
3	1523061000	6	***u/CollinEnstad, you've [been sent](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qrelay2tz36fv5qx83wp6ktu6j5zjhfmvqzyhfp924) `0.0099887 BCH`| `~   6.10 USD` by u/jarenfeservia [chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org).***
2	1523067075	2	Thank You for realizing your idea it is very much needed. Average people don't care about technobabble or why their combustion engine gets them from A to B.What people need to know is: Simply use it as Cash.
3	1523071364	4	I know it's become fashionable to use terms like "technobabble", but this is not "technobabble" at all. It's kinda sad that you guys think I'm spewing nerdy nonsense, because I'm not coming from a nerdy technobabble nonsense point of view. It's 100% marketing. Nobody will use Bitcoin if they see it as just another way to pay. There are already tons of alternatives that are completely free and much easier to use.Bitcoin is cool because nobody can take your money away and it's programmable. Period. Every other benefit stems off from those traits. And that's what people who DO understand Bitcoin get excited about. Otherwise I don't even know why you're excited about Bitcoin in the first place if it's just another way to send money like traditional bank system.Just ask yourself honestly--and try to forget for a minute the fact that you benefit from investment if adoption goes up--why would anyone use something like Bitcoin when there are tons of free alternatives that are much easier to use, such as venmo and apple pay?That's not how marketing works. You need to focus on one thing that you're good at and sell the shit out of it. Naive approaches like "simply use as cash" will just lose out, and honestly if the majority of the community thinks this is how you get traction, I think the community needs better marketer.That said, I shared my comment out of pure feedback and meant no criticism, so I'll stop here. I totally appreciate what OP is doing.
4	1523073186	4	I definitely get your point. Bitcoin is cool because of those reasons. But. Most people STILL don't see Bitcoin as money. "Wait I can use bitcoin to pay for a regular thing like a haircut? I thought it was a pyramid scheme?"Different strokes for different audiences. Hopefully we can continue to make more ads that serve these different purposes. 
1	1523058422	10	Good point. IMHO a TV ad showing starving venezuelans or telling people 'poverty will be eliminated by using BCH' doesn't have the same mass appeal as a catchy, humourous ad.
2	1523070447	3	Unfortunately true.
0	1523055243	6	Love it
0	1523063005	5	This is awesome haha
0	1523058717	8	Nice. Kind of looks like he's already shaved though.Btw I'm curious how much BCH the Bitcoin Cash Fund paid for this to be made? (Surely it isn't a secret?) And how would one go about getting the green light to make another one for a similar amount of BCH? There could be many people here right now that are willing to put work into spreading Bitcoin Cash awareness but they don't know if it's worth their time or how they would go about doing it.
1	1523072947	8	Check out the Github, details are on there - the budget is still very low for the production quality as I took somewhat of a volunteer role on this project.The BCF is open to any and all proposals. Check out our discord (won't let me post links, a quick google should suffice)
2	1523108953	2	So it's somewhat of a secret then? You're making the information unnecessarily hard to find, I was looking for direct answers right here in the reddit thread for all to see.Saying something like "yeah I got X BCH for this, here's a link to where you can contact the foundation about a similar project" would land many more interested people than the "google around and maybe you'll find it" type of answer.
3	1523116921	2	Based on the link he responded to you with it was about $2500 since he won‚Äôt come out and say it 
4	1523119056	1	Still extremely cheap - nearly all went to paying my crew at about half their normal rates. And I ate my own rate and the editing rate because... BCH!
5	1523119829	1	Yeah it is cheap. It‚Äôs just weird you avoided coming out and saying that number so hard
6	1523120356	1	Yeah, I mean usually budgets aren't public anyways. Sets a bad precedent for future work. But I get the whole transparency thing with BCF.
3	1523110743	0	If people are REALLY interested in doing a similar project they could find a contact for the BCF extremely easily. This work for you?https://github.com/The-Bitcoin-Cash-Fund/FPR/blob/master/fpr-0007.md.pdf
0	1523065593	4	That's amazing!
0	1523073296	6	Looks great! Well done.
0	1523053874	6	Just saw it. Is that British humor?
1	1523056134	7	Depends if you're British? 
2	1523056330	2	I am not. Is it still British humor though? xD
3	1523056477	19	lol maybe a bit. I'm from the US, but we got Kevan Brighting, the voiceover guy from The Stanley Parable, to do the narration!
4	1523062558	2	Dann i was wondering if that was actually his voice or if it just sounded familiar. Nice work.
0	1523057991	6	Good quality productions wise although it does nothing to highlight the specific benefits of Bitcoin Cash over say any other crypto or even Apple Pay for that matter. 
0	1523059189	3	Is this going to be an ad on YouTube, somewhere else? Do you know yet?
1	1523059461	10	Yes, they're going to be running some ads with it on YouTube
0	1523072730	3	Excellent voiceover, well done
0	1523072743	3	The narrator sounds like the guy from **The Stanley Parable.***Edit:* **[AHH I WAS RIGHT!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8adc59/bitcoin_cash_the_future_of_money_today_a/dwxvojj/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=btc)**
0	1523079196	3	I like it. Something upbeat and positive.
0	1523079482	3	Luddite father haha
1	1523085515	2	Yes! üòä
1	1523103177	1	Well he did have a bitcoin cash wallet on his phone
0	1523088308	3	the kid could pay insted.
1	1523101691	3	Pops got pride
0	1523070333	2	Nicely done!
0	1523102764	2	great video. my only criticisms: no USP, everyone has a phone with a wallet and an app that can handle payments like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Android Pay, PayPal, Square Cash app, wepay, alibaba, many more. what makes bitcoincash different, faster and better?who is this targeting? forgetful people and luddites? it shows the kid paying using the phone instead of the dad does that mean it is too difficult for the dad to understand and use?how many barber shops support BitcoinCash as a payment option? can you name even one?finally, no call to action, like download the bitcoin wallet app at the end. showing the logo with a mario coin sound (copyright?) doesnt really do anything. though this is easy to fix/edit.
0	1523117887	2	Wow well done!!
0	1523084207	1	Very nice! Another good marketing strategy would be to make a small,donation to crypt0 on his Youtube channel every time he does a live stream. Every time he receives a donation he mentions it, so that would drive recognition to BCH. crypt0 is one of the best Youtube influencers for crypto.I would make the donations but sadly he's in a completely different time zone than me so I never catch him,on the live streams....
0	1523093316	1	Bitcoin is a future money prospect - absolutely phenomenal. The commercial is although very funny. Still I like the concept very much.
0	1523099052	1	I like this.But -- it sort of seems like the kid could have just paid using his Bitcoin Cash wallet and had no real reason to give the money to his father first...
1	1523101664	2	Pops got pride
0	1523103156	1	this is a great commercial, and I hate commercials/advertising usually$5 /u/tippr
1	1523103357	2	Thank you so much!!!
1	1523103185	1	u/CollinEnstad, you've received `0.0079178 BCH ($5 USD)`!***[^^How¬†to¬†use](https://np.reddit.com/r/tippr/wiki/index) ^^| [^^What¬†is¬†Bitcoin¬†Cash?](https://learnbitcoin.cash/) ^^| [^^Who¬†accepts¬†it?](https://acceptbitcoin.cash) ^^| ^^Powered ^^by ^^[Rocketr](https://rocketr.net) ^^| ^^r/tippr  ^(Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin should be. Ask about it on r/btc)
0	1523088666	1	So Bitcoin cash is a company? 
1	1523101609	2	No, The Bitcoin Cash Fund receives donations from the community and from sponsors to further the awareness of BCH. They are a non-profit.
2	1523104780	1	I don't know much about crypto but it really looks like a company. anyway
0	1523075950	1	I like that it supports the cause. I think it is a good early effort and my next comments are just my personal ideas/opinions about possibly making future ones even better.I realize it has to be short and to-the-point, but, I think it seems a bit cartoonish and fake. The dad looks like he needs to explode and his child knows that means he has no money. Makes dad's look bad and may make them defensive about the new tech they don't have (rather than making them wish they had it). I think a lot of children that young would not be excited by the opportunity to buy the haircut (so might not get excited by the idea of getting a crypto wallet for their phone). If dad begged or promised  them a reward in return that might make this good for encouraging child adoption. I have used to word child here because I think the kid is a bit young to be right for this sort of advertisement to be most effective at growing adoption. A bit more sophisticated kid would seem less offensive (to adults) in regard to his "being smarter than his dad" and would be more believable in regard to being willing to help the dad out of his bind (without the need to beg or negotiate).It would be great if you could add something amazing to help the video self promote itself on Youtube (shoot for going viral). Shaving is a pretty boring online video topic. Maybe sending money to a real relative that can really use the coins for food (while surviving in a war-torn location?)? Maybe where the local currency is worth less than BCH due to constant, rampant inflation? If we are not fulfilling such use cases yet, maybe find supporters and make that happen and document it. Get national news to report on the international power of crypto to help people in need? Kinda crazy Idea: Have a super hero that is one thousand times faster than banks, more powerful than a corrupt Government and can leap all continents in a single bound.Trying to attract merchants might be a better goal for an advert.. I bet your already working on that. That's where some of the technical advantages of Bitcoin Cash can really shine. Cheaper, faster, ...Saw an advert from something like visa/IOS or visa/? today that showed a young man magically buying stuff by looking at the things he wanted and nodding his head to buy. They are trying to get ahead of Crypto with their magic money apps.. Sadly, blockstream and the core developers have knocked crypto back a couple years and given them a time-advantage they desperately needed to compete with BCH. Luckily, if we get our act together, we should be able to become so well adopted that they will let those fancy apps spend BCH or fiat (user's choice).
0	1523091142	-1	According to the charts Bcash is almost history
1	1523091158	4	Redditor /u/Michiel83 has low karma in this subreddit.
1	1523097514	3	i disagree. both btc and bch are going downward, but we just had a sudden spike for both. have you looked at the charts? :)
2	1523117041	1	If you look at the BCH/BTC chart it‚Äôs at its lowest point in months. That means BCH is losing value more quickly than BTC
3	1523119657	1	Shit I should sell it all now!
4	1523119864	2	Lol I didn‚Äôt say that at all. I just stated a verifiable fact
1	1523103325	1	People have been saying Bitcoin was dead since it started in 2009. I'm betting it's not.
1	1523099486	1	You are welcome to speculate on the Weather, Sports teams, Horse racing and yes, even Bitcoin Cash. However, Bitcoin Cash is not about "the charts" or speculation. Bitcoin Cash is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system as defined in the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf). Bitcoin Cash is designed to become *the* global currency - to "bank the unbanked". In short, it is about merchant adoption which is continuing apace. You should look to "Value" rather than "Price" to make your Bitcoin Cash predictions.Besides, you are a [scammer](https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/why-some-people-call-bitcoin-cash-bcash-this-will-be-shocking-to-new-readers-956558da12fb) in any case and the clever trolldetectr has also identified you as a troll. Downvoted.
0	1523081300	-2	so, ppl can do the same thing with other +1000 coins. whats the point of this?
1	1523082877	6	The point of the commercial is to advertise a product and inform the watcher.A Tide ad has gotten familiar to an American, but one can easily replace Tide with any other laundry detergent.The key is how the advertiser markets it. Their goal is for customers to say, "Oh, that's a Tide ad!" and not "That ad could've easily used any of the other +1000 laundry detergents." This commercial shows a problem people can be all too familiar with (leaving a wallet home), and propose a solution (use Bitcoin Cash as an altenate means of a currency), to inform. The Tide ads I mentioned were to entertain, and political ads are often to persuade voters.To answer your question one more time, the point of the commercial is to inform the watcher that Bitcoin Cash can be used as a currency when one leaves their wallet at home, by showing how convenient it is to use from the tipping jar to paying for a haircut.
2	1523085495	2	Thank you. 
1	1523081314	3	Redditor /u/sumsaph has low karma in this subreddit.
0	1523058057	-9	Sorry for asking this here but I haven't had much luck getting responses elsewhere....Few quick questions, I've been gone for a bit....Did Roger ever sell all his bitcoins for bitcoin cash?Did Roger ever start his own country?If Craig Wright is Satoshi, and believes bitcoin cash to be the real bitcoin, then why is he holding millions of bitcoin?I have so many questions but this is a start....
0	1523071271	-1	Wait couldn't the kid just have regular cash?can we admit the use case is illegal drugs, guns, and services?
1	1523071873	4	nobody uses regular cash for illegal drugs, guns, or services either!
2	1523098186	0	Not online, are you serious? Look it's a fine video, quality wise, but paypal and venmo let you pay with your phone... BCH let's use deposit and withdraw from gambling site and dark markets.
0	1523084704	-1	well if you stupid enough to forget your wallet at home, then you could forget your phone at home as well. then what?
1	1523101626	1	Then you forgot your keys too and can't go anywhere!
0	1523060111	-13	Bitcoin is not the future of money in it's current state.  The creators can make changes to it whenever they want.  It's not secure.  Fix those two things and you'll be getting somewhere.  Right now it's just a bunch of pipe dreams for neck beards who came too late and held too long.
1	1523066354	9	I think you are mistaking this ad for Bitcoin Legacy/Core (or you're a troll [shrugs]). Bitcoin Cash has several "competing" development teams which are all interoperable.As for security, your bitcoin wallet is as secure as you make it. If you keep your private key on your rooted malware-infested phone then that's akin to storing cash on a park bench. If you store your private key in a hardware wallet with memorized seed words, a passphrase, PIN code, and multisig that is stored in a secret safe then that is better security than anyone has ever had access to before in history.
