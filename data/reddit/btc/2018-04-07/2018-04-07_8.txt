It’s because PayPal and traditional processors fees are so high that it isn’t feasible. BCH could open up 50 or 25 cent micro transactions.
1	1523045420	16	Agreed. charging ten cents for something is the same as free to a lot of people. It opens the door to spending money /during/ the game instead of in a store. Ex: Shields Low! Get a shield boost for 5 cents! People might hate that, but there's probably a way to do it right.
2	1523045600	9	That sounds like really shitty pay-to-win. Not a gamer myself though, but I feel like I'd rather just hit the casino at that point
3	1523046078	6	I don't play a lot of phone games, but the ones I've seen are constantly offering power ups for money. My guess is that 99% of people never spend a dime, but that last 1% make it all worthwhile
4	1523057852	2	Power law curve applies
4	1523105900	1	I did work on a decent sized game in the past, and yes, majority of users do not pay and they are there to keep the small amount of regular paying people paying/engaged
3	1523057800	5	Both pay-2-win and pay-2-look-cool are exploding, both are viable business models. Casino too
0	1523038817	30	I think this is awesome and gaming is a huge and growing market that BCH needs to get into for mass adoption.I am sure this can work once you get in touch with investors and provide more proof of your claims in private (or in public).Pinging u/memorydealers
1	1523039381	8	+1 OP (u/GamingForBCH) I understand the motivation but it's unlikely you will go very far while using a fake identity. Private messaging sounds best.Dr Craig Wright can also be PM'ed here: /u/craig_s_wright .
2	1523039565	7	That’s fair. I figured Roger and Dr Wright get spam messages a lot and my chances of getting through would be low.
3	1523043431	4	Try twitter @proffaustus @jimmywinmedia @calvinayre
0	1523043075	10	How about instead of having some arbitrary in game currency, have the game come with a built-in BCH light wallet (with all the usual functionality, export and import seeds, swiping private keys, producing receiving addresses etc; perhaps leaving this "advanced" stuff on a separate screen accessible from the in-game store, with ocasional pop-up tips mentioning the advanced stuff and where to get more info; with all the interactions with the game store automated, the nitty-gritty stuff about getting the store address etc hidden to make the experience comparable with other games with in-game stores), and partner with an exchange to provide an "official" way to buy BCH inside the game? It would probably be a good idea to default to something like 1-of-2 multisig addresses to better deal with newbies losing their private keys and stuff like that; or possibly even 2-of-3, with the third being an automated system running on a different network from the rest of the game servers for security, this third would authenticate requests from the players, and from the company, and enforce any restrictions necessary; but for the players that want to be the sole responsible for the private key, have functionality in the game to trigger or prevent transactions automatically, to still let you have some control at least of how it is used with the game. And it would probably be a good idea to never actually be in posetion of the player's private keys and seeds, perhaps encrypt the private wallet stuff client-side with the player's password, and only ever transmit and store on your machines the salted hash of the password; and store the encrypted stuff on your servers to let players access their wallets in other computers.|ps: But of course  be careful to not fall in the trap of using abusive microtransaction practices, exploiting gambling issues, fucking up the enjoyment and the balance of the game to try to force people to pay to win etc
1	1523043514	14	Having built in wallets is a really interesting idea. You hit one of the big concerns, we definitely don’t want to be in control of anyone’s private keys ever. I think the easier we could make things the more our users would realize how cool and easy to use BCH is. Plus the low fees make PayPal look terrible.
2	1523044101	7	If the game got appealing characters, gadgets etc, maybe you could have a store selling figurines, posters, shirts, and other real physical items, exclusively for BCH, or at a discounted price if bought with BCH?
3	1523044428	7	Definitely a possibility. If we ended up having Bitcoin.com as an investor then it wouldn't be too weird for us to also sell BCH merch.
2	1523045015	4	Btw, while it is important to not have other people's private keys; you also need to keep in mind that people will expect you to be able to recover their money even if it is their fault that they forgot the password, didn't backup their seeds etc; hence the idea of multi-sig, and storing an encrypted backup of the wallets in the servers. Most players, specially early on, will be used to centralized ledgers and such, where the company is responsible for the movements of tokens and is always in control.But it would still be a good idea to give the option for advanced users to be in control and fully responsible fo the security of their own wallets (providing warnings about what risks are involved etc)
2	1523051283	1	yeah, I think it would be best that the user sets a permanent withdrawal address from the game main website.  So, when they request a disbursement, it would go to their hard coded address (to prevent hackers/theives).  2FA required.If you remember, Diablo 3 tried with a real money auction house, but it was short lived for various reasons (through paypal)
3	1523107399	1	You don’t need withdrawal at all. You can have s inside-outside game wallet synchronized.
4	1523112759	2	that is kind of slow/spammy.  Database would work better for a game internal functions.
5	1523112856	1	Yep. But coins are over blockchain, you just need to have a shared key and manage the same wallet from 2 app
2	1523071922	1	I think you could do something very close to this - you create two in game currencies, one of which can only be created initially by paying BCH. Other currency is normal game currency that can be earned in game. Then you can make items in the game available for sale in one or both currencies. You can also exchange the bch currency for the other, at a specified rate. Players can trade with each other as well. It would create a fairly robust in game economy, that creates profit for you, interest in BCH, and a fun and dynamic playing experience.Just my 2 bits...
3	1523107290	2	This is difficult but this is the way. As gold and gems in mobile game, but with the option to buy a 0.10 cents ammount of gem 
0	1523041587	6	That was a great pitch, assuming it's for real. I saw *Ready Player One* recently, and I think that movie shows what a huge impact something like this could have.
1	1523041954	9	It was a great movie and yes I am serious about everything :) I have been wanting to help and I think this is the best way for me to get involved and make a real impact. Working alongside the great minds in the BCH community would be amazing.
0	1523045224	6	Cool idea, it's great that you already have a viable product. I can't help you directly, but I have a couple thoughts1. you'll probably want to be responsible for maintaining and securing wallets for users on your platform, simply from an integration perspective. This is no small consideration, security is hard, because you have to be perfect all the time, doubly so when you're a public target. Getting hacked and losing everyone's funds won't help the cause. Make sure you take the time to get this right, it's a big responsibility.2. Be careful about gambling laws, and child permissions. They can also be complicated. It's easy to accept bch, but if you're imagining something where people can /earn/ bch that they then withdraw to their own private wallets things can get messy.3. This is, at this moment probably not a concern, but if you are successful enough malicious actors could potentially start to move money through your platform for other than game related purposes. Just be careful.That said, I think you're absolutely right about gaming being a great tool to drive adoption, giving people a reason to create a bitcoin wallet is the very first step. I absolutely wish you the best and I want to see you succeed.
1	1523050542	4	Thank you! I hope we can all help BCH succeed.
0	1523039272	9	if this is real.This is amazing!
1	1523039425	8	Thank you! Hopefully we can get upvotes to the front page and get some good discussion going.
2	1523040168	9	i hope you saw this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaQjCvmrz7U&feature=youtu.be&t=11m20smaybe get in contact with Ryan X. as well.colaborate?
3	1523040346	8	I hadn’t seen this yet. Thank you for the link!
2	1523039918	4	Micro in game purchases.Faucet to earn.
0	1523051002	3	I always thought having Crypto for in-game currency and micro-transactions would be a perfect fit.  You could have players earn "currency" in game/auctions similar to an MMO, it would be done on game servers.  The user could withdrawal into BCH directly from the website, of course with a service fee of 10-20% so the website can make money.
1	1523051310	2	I think there is a lot of potential as op codes get added. I really hope to be on the cutting edge of this.
2	1523053858	1	You could do it without OP code also.  Basically have in-game currency which like "gold coins" or whatever, and do everything with in-game currency (micro-transactions, auction house/in-game trading, vendoring/selling items).Then allowing users to withdrawal "gold coins" into BCH both ways.  Think of it like a casino.  You enter the casino, and buy chips with cash that you use to game inside of a casino.  Then, at the end of the day you can cash out your chips for cash (BCH).  For a security model this might be easiest, since a user can hardcode their withdrawal address in case of hacks.  (hacker will not be able to change the withdrawal address).There are many different ways to do it.  Obviously you do not want everything on chain, since a video game has to work smoothly, and a database will perform much better than a blockchain/decentralized currency.  However the blockchain/decentralized part will work great for deposits/withdrawal, because anyone from anywhere in the world would be able to access (regardless of amounts/size).You could setup "Gold Coins" buys with both Paypal and BCH.  So you accept money with both methods, so you don't lose customers.  However, customers can only withdrawal through BCH only.  Actually you would run into legal problems with letting people withdrawal through Paypal, they would probably close your account, so its best to keep Paypal 1 way for acceptance only.
3	1523080558	1	> Then allowing users to withdrawal "gold coins" into BCH both ways. Think of it like a casino. You enter the casino, and buy chips with cash that you use to game inside of a casino.

4	1523112722	1	there isn't really a jurisdiction, and no one would really care.  There are plenty of exchanges that do similar (for example Binance).  As long as you do not allow fiat withdrawal its not really an issue.  Fiat deposit may cause a problem, but this could be worked around.
0	1523056081	3	The main problem, I believe, will be on-ramping users into Bitcoin Cash as they have no BCH, no wallet, no knowledge, etc. Requiring users to have a wallet (so you can be non-custodial) will initially need a massive incentive like 30-50% off everything. Even so, people will need to jump all the hoops and face another problem: how to get Bitcoin Cash. How many of your target audience will open a Coinbase account or buy with credit card at bitcoin.com?So I think it's key that the game itself allows the player to use PayPal or a credit card to buy Bitcoin Cash directly and that "having a wallet" is made as simple as possible. Maybe something like Yours.org has set up is a good compromise. While it still requires a server side to keep a backup, it's non-custodial.
0	1523062873	3	Try to catch Professor Faustus on twitter. He is helpful with even basic stuff and hints you into the right direction if you are not just about to troll him and refuse to read and understand what is out there already. That is why he gained my respect, he is in the picture on what is going on there and even has time for n00b like me in a free moment and is only focused on the progress of bitcoin. I don't care who he claims he is.
0	1523038458	7	This sub is constantly spammed by people by people who use fake accounts. Is there anyway you could provide credentials or identify yourself?
1	1523038735	8	Unfortunately I cannot as that would be too much public information to our users before any kind of deal could be made. I’m sorry you just have to trust me that this is legit.
2	1523057106	2	Message the moderators and work out a way to prove to them. Obviously since you want to talk with Roger he can vet you for the rest of the community.
0	1523038710	2	I'm interested in a simple example in how you will get some of your 10 million gamers helping to drive adoption beyond accepting BCH. Hopefully /u/memorydealers will connect with you.  :-)
1	1523038984	5	I’ve thought about this a good bit actually. We’re a game with micro transactions (cosmetics and such). Not a pay-to-win game! We could switch to having 100% of purchases be with BCH. Simple tutorials on how to setup wallets, etc. Possibly even give out a few cents as a faucet to get adoption going. Of course I would expect our overall microtransaction revenue to go down if we stopped accepting PayPal and other methods but for the sake of adoption it could be worth it.
2	1523039813	13	what seems best for all parties involved to me is to keep the payment system you already have so you don't lose any revenue, but add bitcoinCash option with a nice discount on all purchases. This is better because it gives an incentive to users to go search about it by themselves instead of feeling forced. You can also direct them to some links with good information from the app directly.
3	1523040062	9	Very good point. It is always a delicate balance when making changes and trying to keep a large user base happy. Perhaps offering discounts for BCH purchases are a better option. PayPal takes a flat 30 cents + 3% so I lose over 30% on our $1 micro transactions. With BCH that fee could be a penny which shows how amazing the tech really is.
2	1523051381	4	> Of course I would expect our overall microtransaction revenue to go down if we stopped accepting PayPal and other methods but for the sake of adoption it could be worth it.you can do both, just give better incentives for BCH.
0	1523045651	2	Sounds cool, be sure to update us later!
1	1523047459	2	Of course!
0	1523047278	2	How many of the active users (or total users) are actually paying users?
1	1523047447	8	Around 10% of our users convert to paying.
2	1523054085	2	Very generous of you to be so open with numbers./u/chaintip

0	1523048914	1	You try to message to moderators?
0	1523051417	1	I have a game idea. It is basically a scavenger hunt using bch. I wanted to make riddles that point to hidden online/offline clues to put together a private key. I have already made and thought of riddles. What’s necessary is a way to onboard users, keep them competing fairly, and to provide enough incentive to keep them playing. This has the benefit of not being a gambling game. 
0	1523055733	1	Usually I'm not fond of gambling, especially if targeting children (loot crates for example, make no mistake, *it is gambling*), but if it helps BCH usage... maybe, sure, eh why not? If in small amounts that doesn't really make a difference whether you win or lose. With an enforced account cap of crypto lost per week to make sure nobody ruins their life due to gambling addiction.I've been wondering why there aren't any games where you can wager say 100 bits on you winning, winner takes it all. People not betting can still play and if anyone not betting wins all bets are returned (with the option to bet the same amount on the next round instead).Sure there are gambling laws and all that but maybe crypto doesn't even count like gambling with "real" money? I mean *we* know its real money but does the law? That's how Blizzard or Valve gets away with their gambling for children after all. If there are age problems maybe all you need is to have players prove that they are over 20 or something, if you make it as easy as possible to do I'm sure some would. Several people play tournaments for real money prizes after all, sometimes with participation fees I reckon.
1	1523061429	1	It isn't a gambling game. Sorry if that wasn't clear.
2	1523064114	1	I understood that your current game (or future games) isn't a gambling game in of itself, I meant that if you let people wage on their wins when playing your game that particular aspect of BCH usage might count as gambling (requiring legal advice due to gambling laws). A gambling game inside your non-gambling game.If you don't intend for people to be able to wage on the outcome of their games my comment is irrelevant. You might have meant that your game will just feature the possibility to purchase things such as cosmetics with BCH instead of USD (or other currencies).
0	1523057354	1	What about the gaming tokens like enjin? There is a bunch of them. 
1	1523061539	2	They want to make platform tools for games which is cool. I prefer to make games myself. I've been a gamer my whole life. Playing some Civ 5 right now actually.
0	1523060173	1	Very interested in this. It is an excellent use case and I think gaming is the perfect market for crypto.

0	1523070064	1	Talk to Ryan and the Yours.org guys, they're already working on something like this for people like you.
0	1523073624	1	Would a micro payment engine be useful? Seems that [yours.org](https://www.yours.org/) is going to open theirs. [See video at 11:30](https://www.yours.org/content/the-new-ryan-x-charles-interview-that-should-get-everyone-on-yours-ex-9027352f1296)
0	1523074152	1	You never mentioned what your game is? Will you let us know so we can support it? Or don't you want to for reasons? Either is fine, I would like to investigate though!
1	1523076179	1	If a deal is made we will announce it all I’m sure. Hoping Roger or Craig reach out :)
0	1523084631	1	Looks interesting, what's the game? I'd like to have a play. 
0	1523085444	1	> with the right investors it may be possible to focus on creating games that are more about driving adoption than turning a profitI have a hard time seeing prominent businessmen like Ver oy Ayre accept this line of thinking. Your product that you sell should aim at being profitable; adoption subsidized by anything other than the already existing subsidy in the block rewards isn't healthy.
0	1523085575	1	I applaud the effort and will send you some random thoughts in private about how blockchains might fit into gaming in todays adversial hacker environment.
0	1523087337	1	This is going to be the first use case for ETH it seems. With ethereum games could establish the ownership of a game item too. 
0	1523093914	1	it is clear that this adoption is about to open the way for even bigger deals between bitcoin cash and the gaming industry.
1	1523119645	1	I believe so as well.

0	1523065620	1	Dude, you have an online game with 10 million registered users and you cannot reach out to Roger Ver?!This post is highly suspicious, almost like [tin-foil-hat-on] CSW gang (Roger-CSW-Ayre) is trying hard to show their good side to the community, which is investing into the ecosystem.
1	1523068764	3	I don’t have access to anymore contact info than you do, but yes I will try private messages on here and twitter.

0	1523047499	-13	No it's not the real BTC. Otherwise it would be called Bitcoin.It's just another fork of BTC, another altcoin. U can accept any coin u want, but don't come claiming Bcash is Bitcoin and don't confuse people at your website either.If you send BTC to BCH addresses the BTC is lost forever, fucking moron. 
1	1523056641	2	> If you send BTC to BCH addresses the BTC is lost foreverIf you don't know you should know that it's not lost forever. Firstly it's not possible to send BTC to the new addresses (the software does not recognize the address). Secondly, even if you send to a legacy address 1... then the other person has the keys to that address, in the BTC network. Sending that BTC back (or to Coinbase to sell for BCH) will take between less than half and hour (hardly forever).It's much worse the other way around because Bitcoin Cash users can send to a SegWit address and get screwed.
