And how far we still can go. And how many more people can find it useful. And how much more we can care about the point of it all, and why does it matter.
1	1523096937	7	Everything except the bit about second layers. We have nothing against second layers per se - tippr is very handy, for example. What we don't like is having the first layer crippled to force users into the second. Going off chain should be voluntary.
2	1523098708	4	Exactly!Although I didn't interpret OPs position as if he is against second layers forever, just against second layers now, specially to compensate a crippled first layer, as you say.
0	1523077294	5	Can we request a sticky for this? It seems pretty reasonable at least for most debates. 
0	1523069392	9	The head-burying-sand is deep where they dwell, lol. I think most of the people who claim to not realize Bitcoin-core has been nearly destroyed by it's central controllers are paid liars or those fooled by the army of paid liars. It is so obvious a coin that can't scale can't thrive in the crypto space of the future. They might still fix it with a hard fork to bigger blocks and make it great again. I'm still not sure it would rule them all due to the lack of trust in the centralized development control group.
1	1523076089	6	They would need a lot more than a simple blocksize fix hardfork to effect a U-turn from their technical dead-end mess. Firstly, any hardfork would be contentious and may result in a loss-of-control over its reference codebase (source of much of their power). It may also result in yet another coin with the same unfavourable characteristics AND sporting control over the brand/blog/newsgroup assets. Then there are the investors who bought into the cripple-bitcoin plan who would have something to say about any derailment of the... derailment. Also, RBF, various other code mods and a mountain of technical debt would/should/need to be removed. But most importantly, it would be hard for their lost merchants to return and trust them again with what amounts to another version of... Bitcoin Cash. Existing Bitcoin Cash merchants would be hard to dislodge and re-adopt your "*Bitcoin MKII - a return to a peer-to-peer electronic cash system but this time we mean it*" because a hardfork would be viewed as, and is, a confirmation that the blockstream/core aberration was just that, an aberration, an out of control mess with no future.
2	1523080525	6	Good points. I do think Core-code is controlled by a small group and they can make any change they want without losing control of the codebase so long as the small group of people/corp(s) with commit power are all on board. I could be wrong about that. Of course miners could fail to go along with a change, but, Core-committers seem to have a loyal (or greed-centric) following that will stick with them as long as the coin holds value.
1	1523086869	2	> The head-burying-sand is deep where they dwellEven before the fork I detected potentially destructive hubris like nothing bad could ever happen to Bitcoin, and that made me uneasy. All they talked about was the price and how smart and successful they all were.
2	1523088032	1	Those are big red flags indeed.

0	1523110248	4	OK, so I'll probably get downvoted into oblivion for this, but...I own both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, thank you fork.  I've traded away half of the Bitcoin Cash and almost traded away the rest on multiple occasions even though I know the biggest argument this forum makes (Bitcoin Cash is closer to the whitepaper) is completely true.  Why?I know how Open Source Development happens and the consensus required to change a project.  The Bitcoin Cash people had a legit argument, but failed to achieve consensus on raising the block size because the Core argument had some legitimate points as well.  But, rather, than just forking and taking a new label, a whole lot of time and energy is spent trying to pry the name Bitcoin from the github project that is actually Bitcoin.  To anyone on the outside looking in this comes off as very weak.  Rather than hear about what is better about Bitcoin Cash every conversation degrades into an argument about what is the real Bitcoin and, to anyone technical, the current Github repository for Bitcoin wins.  Keep in mind, this is coming from someone who owns a, not insignificant amount of, Bitcoin Cash.This is further compounded by Roger.  It doesn't do any favors for Bitcoin Cash that the primary spokesman in the western world has zero ability to talk technical and has many quotes in his past that come off as whining about Devs not listening to him.  I've been working in the technology field for 20 years, anyone that tells me to listen to them about a particular technology that can't actually get into the nuts and bolts technical aspects is someone I will instantly tune out.To bring this to a personal level, I always tell people to own their flaws so no one can ever use them against you.  The Bitcoin Cash community does the exact opposite of this and it screams weakness and insecurity to most people.  The day Bitcoin Cash proudly takes up the label of BCash (the altcoin fork of bitcoin to prevent centralization of layer 2) and starts making all of their arguments about why they are more decentralized and secure than the original bitcoin is the day I stop thinking about selling and start thinking about buying.  I still hold some and want it to succeed, so I felt compelled to write this.  Now commence with the down votes.  If it's received badly enough maybe you'll convince me to sell my remaining stash.
0	1523102090	1	Which fork has more hash power behind it? When the fork happened did one of them artificially change the difficulty?
0	1523086004	-8	Well it is the only bitcoin community. This is an altcoin community. There is no problem with big blocks but this is not bitcoin.
1	1523088795	7	Why is that? 
1	1523088084	8	>Well it is the only bitcoin community. This is an altcoin community. There is no problem with big blocks but this is not bitcoin.You might want to educate yourself on bitcoin history.
0	1523089761	-3	Seriously, this comes from a the guy who doesnt even understand the basics:> Nah, read the whitepaper, it says that they're [tx] guaranteed to get included into blocks, doesn't mean it stays in the final block (if it is found to be a double-spend). Transactions getting into blocks and getting into the final ledger are two different things. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8aakbp/comment/dwxrbqwCould anyone be so kind and explain to him that tx' are propagated through the network (not included in "pre blocks" that are handed to miners who make the "final block").
1	1523093892	6	What does this have to do with the original post?
2	1523095488	-2	> The only thing potentially salvageable is your own understanding as to which chain more accurately represents Bitcoin as described in the whitepaper
3	1523095706	3	And?
1	1523116191	0	While I agree with your assessment of technical understanding, I'm not so sure it is relevant to this post. The post isn't really technical.
0	1523063183	-22	Perhaps r/bitcoin would be more receptive to the technical differences of bch if it wasn’t a centralized coin with 2 entities controlling it. Not to mention when you add a fraud into the picture (CW), doesn’t bode well for starting any sort of civil discussion about actual technology, goals and so forth.
1	1523068419	16	While your "2 entities" statement is of course fake news, it still is better compared to a single entity (Blockstream).
2	1523082444	5	So true Blockstream aka AXA aka Bilderberg completely controls bitcoin by now!
3	1523087837	-2	I'm concerned that you might not realize how ridiculous you sound.
4	1523090128	4	Oh you are right Blockstream are so kind and inocent and only want the best for bitcoin segwit!
1	1523078604	6	How do you believe they are controlling it? What do they do with this control? And how is it different then the core version of Bitcoin?
1	1523064053	7	BTC (which is nothing like the bitcoin most of us invest in and learned about, the bitcoin in the whitepaper) was corrupted and changed. It appears to be controlled almost completely by blockstream and co.read the FAQ here, stop repeating long debunked lies. 
1	1523066917	4	who are the 2 entities? 
2	1523068083	-13	Jihan and Ver. 
3	1523072438	11	well fuck me.Interestingly enough, both did more for bitcoin than you in 10 lifetimes. 
3	1523069629	8	Your definition of "control" would be? I'm thinking it must be something like 'whatever blockstream says is control'.
4	1523070837	-4	Control to them = voluntary monopoly.All statists arguments are fundamentally "voluntary monopolies are bad so we must have an involuntary monopoly called the state to prevent them from occuring".Insanity
5	1523072946	6	BCH is not controlled by 2 people and does not have a "voluntary monopoly". The lead developer for ABC (A. S.) might be someone you could argue has a lot of control over BCH. Jihan and Ver have little or no "control" over BCH. 
6	1523076880	2	You need to reread what i said because im not disagreeing with you. 'Them' = core/blockstream. Clearly the propaganda has gotten so bad its hard to tell who is pushing what.Read my profile first before you start telling me about how BCH is the real bitcoin. Trust me, i know.If i run a business on my street selling hamburgers and im the only person i have a voluntary monopoly. This is not a bad thing.If i start putting a gun to the head of anyone that starts to try to compete with me, then i have a monopoly.Which is why core doesnt like BCH. Its competition.
7	1523080081	3	I understood you were not supporting Core's false narrative and did not mean to be offensive. I just don't think BCH is controlled by 2 people, and, I don't think it is any kind of "monopoly". Did not mean to give ya a hard time though.
8	1523081763	2	Open source developers are hardly a business so i'd agree that monopoly isnt an accurate word also
7	1523077660	2	BCH developers have a voluntary monopoly which is very different to a monopoly.Similar to a business with a voluntary monopoly, they have no control over preventing another dev team competing with them.The moment a dev team starts initiating force to prevent competition, then they are trying to force a monopoly (bitcoin core).Id make the case that Bitcoin core initiated force by  removing gavin's access, hiring sockpuppets and doing major protocol changes like segwit via soft fork. Im sure there's too many egregious things to list.
6	1523080423	0	Well ver does control /r/btc, bitcoin.com, bitcoin wallet, bitcoin conferences, big mining pool...
7	1523080996	0	When your lies are obvious, the rest of what you say (that might even be true) loses credibility. I thought they taught that in shill/troll school. The word "control" has a meaning that seems to be escaping the Ver haters that actually believe in this sort of fake news justification strategy.
8	1523081335	1	dafuq
8	1523115580	1	That was a lot of words. I'm surprised you didn't have a logical argument in there somewhere
3	1523075176	4	What part of the protocol have they coded?
4	1523079884	3	Lol coding isn’t the only thing to Bitcoin. You can’t code your way to world adoption 🤭
5	1523114927	1	That is very true.That's the biggest factor for me to believe that BCH has a better chance of significant adoption than BTC.
3	1523088137	1	Aliens...
1	1523063795	5	Fake news
