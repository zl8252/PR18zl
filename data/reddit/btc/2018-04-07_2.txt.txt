0	1523062171	21	A theory i posted on other thread:1. The article mentions that belgium ministry was robbed by replacing iban number2. The stolen cash was sent to X company in poland3. The cash was then transfered to C company in poland. (article says that prosecutors found connection to C company, was it a transfer of money?)It looks like the thief, setup a company in Poland then tried to convert stolen fiat funds to bitcoin using bitfinex. When depositing to bitfinex he got "crypto sp zoo" company account number where he sent funds.It appears that polish prosecutors seized ALL of funds of company X and C, instead of ONLY funds that were stolen.But how you explain narco connections? Well it's mentioned only once in article, but the panama guy setting up hundreds of shell companies abroad might have settup'd one for the wrong people - that's why he might be connected to narcos.However few parts of this article suggest it might be way more serious and might negate mentioned scenario.
0	1523049135	22	One week ago Polish bitfinex users interrogated by Polish police - https://forum.bitcoin.pl/viewtopic.php?f=79&t=28309&p=472711#p472711Google translate is poor - A billion PLN 270 million taken over in March by the CBŚP prosecutor's office is most likely the money belonging to Colombian drug cartels - according to informer tvp.info. It is known that the money was on the accounts of two companies from the vicinity of Pruszków, owned by a Canadian-born Panamanian descent and a Colombian with Panama citizenship. One of these companies was a shareholder of an online cryptocurrency exchange office. Millions of such operations were to flow through a small cooperative bank in Lodz.The tvp.info portal reached the details of the investigation, which enabled record-breaking security of the mafia property. Everything began with the construction of the Belgian embassy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs elected the contractor and had to transfer money to the company's account. Then the scammers appeared in the game, who impersonated the company and sent the Belgians the account number of the company they controlled. Oblivious to fraud, employees of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have shed over 400,000 criminals. euro.When the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs realized that he had been the victim of a scam, local services and Interpol took care of it. It turned out that the account used by the fraudsters belongs to the company M. registered in the vicinity of Pruszków. According to tvp.info, its president is a Canadian Panamanian descent.While checking the connections of this company, investigators came across another company - C. At its head stood a man with citizenship of Colombia and Panama. This, in turn, the company was associated with a large online cantor exchange of cryptocurrencies. Both companies had over PLN 270 million deposited on their accounts.A costly mistake of Colombian cartels. Cocaine transport went to the supermarketThe employees of the Lidl warehouse in Zgierz handed out policemen, discovering in a load of bananas from Colombia, nearly 387 kg of pure cocaine. Drugs ...From the findings of the tvp.info portal it appears that both foreigners, who managed the company-pillars for "dirty money", avoided detention. The portal's insiders say they have links to Colombian drug cartels.- We will now carefully examine the financial flows between these entities. We already know that they created a much larger chain of related companies. The scale of financial operations indicates that these bills were to hide money from smuggling cocaine to Europe. The companies were also used for large scale scams. Criminals have hidden their operations, also exchanging money for cryptocurrencies, obliterating traces - says the TVp.info interlocutor.Investigators also reached other companies cooperating with the companies M. and C. As a result, at the beginning of March, the prosecutor's office secured the equivalent of over 9.5 million zlotys in euros and pounds and an additional 20 million dollars as evidence.On Friday, the National Public Prosecutor's Office announced a record-breaking security for the money probably coming from the crime. Investigators from the Lower Silesian Branch Office of the Department for Organized Crime and Corruption of the National Public Prosecutor's Office and the Central Police Investigative Office have discovered two companies that have accumulated PLN 270 billion on their accounts, including in US dollars and British pounds.- Money probably comes from international drug trafficking, as well as giant deception. They were deposited at a branch of one of the banks, on the accounts of two companies registered in Poland - the National Public Prosecutor's Office informed.Investigators determined that both companies did not actually carry out any economic activity. They were created solely to share your bank accounts with international criminal financial operations. - The taking of money from these accounts was possible thanks to the amendment of the March 22, 2017 amendment to the Act on Counteracting Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing - explained Deputy Prosecutor General Beata Marczak.taken from the finex subreddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfinex/comments/8actyg/poland_seized_300_millions_eur_from_bitfinex_bank/> Unfortunately the page is in polish language however, it seems like under the guise of fighting with 'Colombian drug cartels' Poland have seized the money from two bank accounts, where one belongs to Bitfinex.

1	1523049974	4	What does this have to do with Bitfinexed?Don’t follow why that is notable
2	1523051297	15	so their biggest enemy online for years suddenly announces hes gonna release something big and then disappears off the face of the earth deleting all his comments online a few days before it's announced that they've just seized 400 million euros from bitfinex money laundering fund... if that doesnt seem a bit odd to you then I dunno what to say
3	1523065454	10	I hope they didnt kill him
3	1523051469	10	Yeah that is ‘odd’ just was not aware of the contextMore than oddShame he was anonymous and didn’t have some kind of digital dead mans chord
4	1523053006	5	He has a lawyer I believe - Stephen Palley
5	1523055569	8	lots of people asking him what's going on but he's completely silent on it - keep an eye here https://twitter.com/stephendpalley
5	1523053052	2	The canary we need
3	1523079255	-4	> so their biggest enemy online for yearsthat isn't true -- his first appearance was around when they lost their banking relationship in March/April of last year -- so at most he has been around for a little over a year not *years* and that is important because all of his recordings of BFX officials aren't his -- they are public archives that have been there for years and lived through those conversations like myself and others of the trading community -- all BFX'ed does is upload them as his own and doesn't cite his sources but people still think he is some undercover private investigator getting recordings at some private dinner party. He has no insider information what so ever.>Bitfinexed has wiped all his reddit history and disappeared a few days prior to this happening. https://www.reddit.com/user/atlasrand1/comments/He deleted his comments but all his posts are still there: https://www.reddit.com/user/atlasrand1 -- it is much more likely that he is realizing that he is leaking information related to his DOX and is taking additional precautions to make sure he is being more careful. He is also a very paranoid guy that is in a runaway OCD psychosis type condition so I am not sure you need to read too much into it. I have been the longest observer of his behavior dating back to last April -- I still agree on some of his points but he his obsession and need to come up with grander and grander expanding conspiracy theories was too difficult to continue productive conversations with him https://imgur.com/a/Inb1C>disappears off the face of the earthReddit account is still there https://www.reddit.com/user/atlasrand1 -- all his medium posts are still on his blog and his twitter is still active he has just set it so you have to request to follow and see his tweets -- so no not that strange at all.

5	1523087534	8	That guy seems to be a BFX shill. How is it mental illness when it seems like one day he might literally end up with a bullet in his head, and for what? I sent a message to Bitfinexed talking about how Bitfinex hides USDT volume on CMC (you cant see the USDT volume on there) and I thought he should write about it.Maybe I’m on their list now too. 
6	1523088540	0	this was a big news right now.Monitoring right now how it will affect the market which is already in a slump
7	1523088876	6	This guy is a known BFX shill: https://www.reddit.com/r/Tether/comments/83ssyc/comment/dvkz4z0?st=JFP3QH8I&sh=8ad393fbManipulated this thread with an bot giving himself 15 or so upvotes. They don’t want people to know this.
5	1523083639	5	you're responding to a Whalepool guy, someone who literally defends Bitfinex to the death. Whalepool have shares in Bitfinex.
5	1523084611	-4	it was mental illness long before then -- back when I graphed that he was tweeting once every 6 minutes for over a month -- that is not healthy behavior. You can also look at those screen shots I have posted -- for several weeks we spoke privately on telegram because I thought he had brought to light some interesting ideas but you can also see in them that I am warning him that projecting and reaching statements will cost him credibility with the community and ultimately has -- I have watched him go through these changes as he sold all his coins at $1200 and then had to double triple quadruple down mentally to shield his fragile ego. That is why he blogs and tweets so much he needs an outlet to keep his mind churning and away from idle time that he could reflect on the pain of missing out on a near 20x rally.And I am already a step ahead of you because you are going to say but but but BFX'ed sold and was taking the moral high ground and wouldn't want to make profits from the supposed fake rally he knew was coming -- well he didn't think that way back then: https://imgur.com/a/8nocC -- he says if was wrong he would just buy back in some and go to moon and make money

7	1523093045	-1	100% -- you can just watch him fall apart mentally with the frequency of his tweets and the ever stretching conspiracy theories
8	1523105774	1	so how many shares in bitfinex do you own? I think before anyone takes your word on how great bitfinex are, you should at least let them know you profit from bitfinex successare you a bit upset that your original account was suspended?https://www.reddit.com/user/btcvixmust be hard work being paid off to defend scams like Bitfinex. I guess people always have a price to throw away their dignity.

0	1523063037	9	One of the largest and most controversial cryptocurrency exchanges Bitfinex received a big hit in Poland today - PLN 1.3 billion at the Cooperative Bank in Skierniewice was seized by the prosecutor's office . The money is to be linked through the Bitfineks network of companies and the Colombian drug trade.Online investigations linking companies with accounts at the Cooperative Bank in Skierniewice with Bitfineks appeared already last year . Bitfinex is controversial - this stock market has long been suspected of speculating cryptocurrency prices and pumping bubbles. US regulators are also researching the Tether currency created by Bitfinex, which is related to the value of the one-to-one dollar and is used to buy other crypts.On April 6, 2018, Zbigniew Ziobro was successful in taking $ 270 million. associated with fraud, people whose names appeared in Panama Papers and companies that are pillars of the "large foreign cryptocurrency market". The accounts were to be located in a small Polish bank.Unofficial information shows that it is about Bitfinex. The Polish prosecutor's office has not raised any charges yet, and due to the international dimension of the case, the Central Investigation Office cooperates with Europol and Interpol.only tears now
0	1523081618	7	In the past I (and others) noted that Tether could be organized crime using Bitcoin to launder money. This might be confirmation of that. 
0	1523058071	5	rip
0	1523058851	5	Even now defunct Polish bitcoin exchange Bitcurex had bank account in Lodz ... what's up with that city?
1	1523067439	6	They got Lodz of cash, or did anyway.
1	1523060672	3	Probably one of the few crypto-friendly banks is based there?
0	1523061121	14	Can we please upvote this thread to the top op /r/btc? This is important information. Al though nobody knows for sure it's possible that EUR was seized that belongs to Tether/Bitfinex.  I have long suspected that Tether/Bitfinex have been involved with the laundering of money but was never able to find any evidence. Now at least there is evidence that they did banking business with banks have been involved with money laundering.  All kinds of banks of course are involved with this all the time but crypto offers a really nice solution for money laundering.  If you try to sell a large volume of Tethers, the actual exchange rate that you can sell at is about 1/3 USD. Something tells me that Tether has been used for laundering money. dirty USD goes in and 1/3 clean USD comes out. No proof, just a hunch. We will see what happens next. 
1	1523087414	-6	how did you suspect that by watching detective movies?
2	1523100281	7	Hmmm, let's see:Auditors back out midway through an audit for reasons undisclosed.Banks close Bitfinex accounts forcing them offshore.Despite a flood of bad PR, they still never release and financial details of Tether being backed by USD, despite the unwavering insistence that it is.FIAT deposits closed since last year for most regular users, yet somebody is still buying massive amounts of Tether regularly, despite the growing public distrust of the token.It seems so obvious in hindsight, that Tether was probably being bought with black money, traded on the exchanges, and coming out the other side clean.
3	1523105390	-4	devil's advocate:tether always keeps price peg  no well-known crypto figure is worried  all major exchanges trust tether  bitfinex has been in operation non-stop  the largest netherlands bank confirmed they have their account + scrutinized  what is obvious to you and me is probably biased. just making an argument don't start the paid shill stuff.p.s because people do not understand who buys those large amounts of tether, you and me buy it. yes that's correct everytime you sell btc to usdt because your ta analysis told you too (i never do it btw) you buy usdt *if lots of people do it at the same time and current usdt is not available*. the opposite is also true and that's why the burned tokens when the bear market started. try to understand how the system works.
4	1523109141	1	USDT is supposed to be backed by USD, not other crypto as equivalent value in USD. That's why it is immune to supply and demand price discovery. Because it is supposed to represent a real USD reserve.Otherwise it should not have a pegged value and should be like any other token. You can't just print money from thin air.
0	1523076800	3	It seems this would likely drive it underground and perhaps even speed the usage of trading crypto for merchandise in person.  I also wonder if it will create a premium for off exchange coins traded in Poland. Not trying to be the “ this is good for crypto “ guy but if there enough libertarian minded people in possession of off exchange coins, I think this could trigger that sort of rebellion.
1	1523102863	1	Unfortunately there's probably not enough
0	1523082799	4	Does this mean tether is screwed.
1	1523089576	3	BTC-E 2.0
2	1523090136	1	?
3	1523095929	0	Same shit, will be subjected to same fate as BTC-E.
0	1523087974	1	wow
0	1523109359	1	will they give it back? 
1	1523110081	2	As soon as Mr Molina aka mafia front man will show up and answer all inquiries Interpol has for him ;)
0	1523087180	-2	polish government wants to destroy crypto. don't listen to weird bitfinex stories imo (although i cannot be sure)
