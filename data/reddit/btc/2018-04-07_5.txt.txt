0	1523073573	16	Awesome!! Will do! Are you guys planning on having a Korean Bitcoin news platform as well? Lots of anti-BCH rhetoric and misconceptions in the Korean online (and offline) world about Bitcoin Cash. However, I think if there is good news and media about BCH in Korean, Korea can become one of the places where Bitcoin Cash really takes off in every day purchases and transactions. (Not to say the Korean diaspora is one of the largest in the world and Koreans are always having to send money from one country to another.)
1	1523073836	26	Working on that one too!  So far we have Chinese and Spanish in addition to English. 
2	1523073938	9	Yeah!!!!!
2	1523101593	1	Great!
0	1523073270	21	Please share this on your own social media too.
1	1523108442	4	no thanks
1	1523092180	6	Would you like me to go door to door as well ?
2	1523100962	4	In Chinatown, yes.
3	1523110674	1	Is there a Chinatown in China?
2	1523092193	1	Redditor /u/davout-bc has low karma in this subreddit.
1	1523099909	-2	Self promotion on Reddit is against the rules, you need to be banned
1	1523101929	0	This seems borderling MLM now, but I'll do it anyway.
0	1523103886	3	做得好, 比特币现金到月球!
0	1523077181	4	Will bitcion.com have wechat, weibo, QQ accounts?On another note, I think the best way to introduce bitcoin.com is to introduce the bitcoin.com wallet and send them some BCH. However, bitcoin.com wallet seems to not exist in smartphone appstores, android included (someone can correct me about android - it has been a while since I last tried). So maybe you guys can make it easy to download android apk on cn.bitcoin.com for the wallet. That would be really helpful to boost bitcoin.com and BCH.
1	1523086258	1	I have tried to find the wallet in China but needed to go through VPN to use PlayStore. Bitcoin.com used to have the APK available for download but not anymore it seems. The APK would be ideal for China, I guess. 
0	1523101561	2	Thanks, will do!
0	1523106657	1	awesome
0	1523078640	-7	Sure Roger, everyone will do as told and promote your website so you can line your pockets with more cash.
1	1523087282	4	...But the website contains useful information for a vast majority of people (expanding as you see) who may be interested in cryptocurrency, specifically the Bitcoin protocol.
2	1523102369	4	and paid articles that promote ICO scams....
1	1523104221	1	You think that site is making money? :P
2	1523104366	2	That’s literally the only point of roger posting on this sub is to promote his website
3	1523105400	-4	* his fork attempts* his shitcoin
4	1523112415	1	Nah, it’s not his coin. He just promotes it and makes money off people buying it
0	1523087009	-4	but .com is nothing about bitcoin, it's a BCH site, I will tell Chinese just go .org  for sure.
0	1523088810	1	3ks
0	1523090359	-4	I don't need to tell no commies shit!
