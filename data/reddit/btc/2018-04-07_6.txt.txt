1	1523105720	27	Win/Win scenario üèÜ
1	1523110802	13	I believe the bet was that he would *eat* his own dick, was it not? 
2	1523119200	2	Either way it qualifies
1	1523114252	3	That‚Äôs right.
1	1523116581	2	this is the real reason im in crypto 
1	1523117198	1	Why the second case is a wining case? An explanation is needed.
2	1523118350	1	He actually originally said he'd eat it if it wasn't a million by 2020. Most people are very aware that he's a paid shitcoin shill.
1	1523118267	1	I'm pretty sure that's only if bitcoin reaches 100,000 not bitcoin cash.
1	1523118371	1	> McafeeYou're giving free publicity to someone who gets paid for p&d's.
2	1523119876	1	For talking about the guy? Come on, that's just retarded!
1	1523120040	1	Made my day :) thx 
1	1523109465	-8	McAfee is not talking about bcash dude

2	1523109619	8	McAfee thinks Bitcoin equals BTC + BCH  but thinks in less than 3 years BCH will win.https://youtu.be/2uhPnOyBHQs?t=44m40s
2	1523115646	2	Bcash is a Zcash fork. Dude
3	1523117376	1	This is definitely... An Illusion!
3	1523117184	-1	2 shitty project can share one name. Both are shitty forks called bcash 
4	1523119244	1	That what jealous and fearful folks like you call it.  You know that SegwitCoin can't compete.
2	1523109478	6	Redditor /u/bitking74 has low karma in this subreddit.

1	1523110860	-2	BTC != BCH
2	1523113098	10	When we big blockers say "Bitcoin" we always refer to Bitcoin Cash.
3	1523113485	-7	I have noticed. The Roger Ver rage quit video was funny
4	1523118160	2	Ver quit? /sMy apologies in advance to the forum for feeding a troll. This one seems so needy and helpless I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. This will give him something to ponder and to dream of clever ways to rebut. In my defense, it is keeping with the win-win theme of this thread.
2	1523118277	1	Ha you wish...if BCH was BTC, BCH would have a bleak future.  BCH is a better Bitcoin.
3	1523119059	1	Im not debating which may or may not be betterI'm just stating facts
4	1523119787	1	and I absolutely agree with you...BTC != BCH and BCH doesn't want to be BTC...why do you think there was the fork in Nov...  but please understand that I also believe BTC != Bitcoin

0	1523104423	3	Congrats dude!
0	1523108238	3	Congratulations. Welcome onboard.
0	1523107758	5	congrats, a great time to buy right now. not so great for everyone who held some in the last few months when it was above $1000. hopefully it can return that way soon. bullish!
1	1523109634	7	Bought at $3,000... It‚Äôs money I can afford to lose but it hurts a bit. To be fair, I‚Äôm not blaming BCH, everything is sort of dying right now despite massive adoption and other good news. 
2	1523111387	6	Reminds me of 2014, but something tells me the winter wont be as long this time.
3	1523111678	3	What I‚Äôm worried about is people losing interest. Obviously this is market manipulation to some extent. But the issue is, new investors see this as high risk. If the market keeps dropping every time it tries to recover, people will lose interest and start leaving the scene. There‚Äôs only so many people that can leave before cryptos lose relevancy. I doubt that will happen, I still have a lot of hope left, but I also don‚Äôt want to be delusional and make wild claims. I just hope the market recovers before we lose the traction we gained in December so we aren‚Äôt left with an army of bag holders without any newcomers. I do want to state that the gains of 2017 are far from being negated. We‚Äôre still technically in profit. 
4	1523115111	2	Honestly i think there is too much dumb money in crypto now. People spending ‚Ç¨1k and thinkin they will be able to retire in 2 years. When business comes in we will see a completely different attitude, not sure what it ill be, but different
5	1523115211	2	I mean the fact that XVG is holding up at all proves how much dumb money there is. No offense to people who hold XVG of course... Maybe a little. 
4	1523116497	1	Making BCH as much useful as possible which will create real market demand is the only and best way to counter speculative bear sentiment.
5	1523116624	1	Yes, but it feels like all the good news and improvements are being wasted. Like we‚Äôre in a downtrend we can‚Äôt get out of. But all this news about adoption, blocks going up to 32MB in size, BitPay adding BCH as an option etc. would be such a good boost in a bull market, but as it is, all these things are being wasted on deaf ears that only see negativity. There‚Äôs only so much good news before we burn all the ‚Äúboost‚Äù tickets if that makes sense. Edit: I think I should clarify a bit more. My point is that there‚Äôs a lot of advancement going on, but it‚Äôs not being appreciated because of all the negative shit around it. 
6	1523116990	1	You have to let the dust settle out before people starts putting significant money on any of these services. There is no other way around ATM. We are still months away from that. The last bear market lasted for almost 24 months before bottoming out and usage finally picking up again. Hopefully this one won't be that long.
4	1523118262	1	I don't think cryptos will lose relevancy even if they haven't fully broken through to mainstream markets yet- they still fill a need/ serve a purpose for too many.
5	1523118267	1	Redditor /u/BigTomatillo account age is 0 days.
6	1523118894	1	Yep, I'm new!
0	1523109333	2	Welcome, we like new people here :\) 10 bits [u/tippr](https://www.reddit.com/u/tippr) 
0	1523109853	2	Now go spend it and rebuy with fiat!
0	1523115480	2	I'm proud of owning 0.001 BCH 
0	1523116815	2	Damn hope you got in recently. BCH has been taking a pounding like nothing else. I expect it to get worse from here with this talk of hard forks.
0	1523112736	2	I'm sorry for your loss (of value).
0	1523112873	1	Congratulations! I'm making it my personal goal to own 0.1 BCH! I'm only 0.02 away!
0	1523118261	1	It looks like you created another slight uptick in value.
0	1523118328	1	Owning USD in Russia must feels like owning BCH in the USA...
0	1523119106	1	Good stuff. I'm also buying right now, liking the low price.
0	1523114270	1	Congratulations. If you want to increase the chances of making a return on that investment spend a little bit of it (on something you want), and then buy a little bit more BCH every time you do so you still have the same amount.The value of BCH comes from being used. The more people that actually use it, the more valuable the ecosystem becomes. Spending BCH encourages a healthy, non-stagnant community which in turn increases the value of your investment.
0	1523116473	1	it will be a big deal when it's worth 1 mil per BCH =)
0	1523115721	0	Congrats man. Do try to use it and keep buying more
0	1523112381	-1	Congrats! Why BCH and not BTC?
1	1523116135	2	Because [this shit](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-btc.html) happens when BTC gets used, which makes it fucking useless.I don't invest in useless shit
1	1523112819	-10	Probably just uninformed or simply had the thought process of it‚Äôs cheaper to own one bcash than one real bitcoin.Either way dumb
2	1523113880	7	Or OP did the research and saw that BTCs scaling solution has been ineffective when volume is high whereas BCH has no issues handling influxes of transactions.  But you know go on calling others dumb I've heard that's a good method of convincing others of your opinion.
3	1523115078	-2	Bcash's scaling solution is and always will be to have no actual users or transactions so they never need to scale.You can have unlimited block size and it wouldn't make a difference since it has no transactions lmao.There's no need to convince someone that's already made a stupid mistake. Just pointing out the mistake so maybe with a little bit a self responsibility they don't make it in the future.Dead coin is dead
3	1523115902	0	OP was obviously scammed into buying it by mistake /s
0	1523111727	-10	Good for you! Welcome to the most over valued altcoin! Next stop, real Bitcoin! 
1	1523112613	1	Brave in this sub lol     
1	1523115716	1	"Real"
0	1523115160	0	Congrats on your achievement. That was a great price you bought it for. $4500 is ath i believe!!!
0	1523108831	-4	Poland is under Russian control currently. Sucks.
