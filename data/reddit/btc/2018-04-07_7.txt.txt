0	1523060363	302	First of all, I am impressed by how skillfully the CSW trolls managed to steer the conversation toward the selfish mining discussion, which is more nuanced, and away from the _other_ absolutely insane remark where he claimed that making the lightning network work is as difficult as solving discrete logs. That by itself is BS for two reasons: (i) as I mentioned at the conference, even if optimal solutions to the traveling salesman problem are NP-hard, poly-time heuristics work very well most of the time, and (ii) [and this I forgot to mention] lightning network pathfinding is not a traveling salesman problem! It's pathfinding (which can be solved much more simply, eg. [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)). LN is hard to get right and has a bunch of user interface pitfalls and capital efficiency issues, but it is absolutely not true that it's impossible to solve in a way that would stop being impossible if mathematicians discovered tomorrow that P=NP.So let's go back to the original selfish mining paper. Here's the link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0243.pdfLook at the chart at section 4.3. For the lazy, I extracted it for you here: https://i.imgur.com/bzqIFDw.pngThat's the chart that shows the returns to selfish mining, as analyzed by Sirer and Eyal themselves in 2013. Yes, if the attacker's portion of hashpower is small, the selfish mining attempt will have negative value to the attacker and will benefit the honest guys; but the paper already admits this! However, that is only true up to some threshold, where that threshold is much less than 1/2. Even if gamma=0, so if the attacker can _never_ win in races where they publish right after they see a block from a non-attacker, if the attacker has >1/3 hashpower they can selfish-mine profitably. This is true regardless of any facts about network topology.So even if CSW was saying "selfish-mining can cause the attacker to lose money in some cases", that's not saying anything, because it's simply restating what was already stated in the original paper! Now if CSW wants to _challenge_ the result that selfish mining is profitable regardless of network topology if hashpower exceeds 1/3, then I eagerly await the challenge.
1	1523061804	242	To further press the point that this selfish mining nonsense is only the latest thing in a pattern, it's also worth discussing Craig's other blunders. Here's him claiming that the bitcoin secp256k1 curve is pairing-compatible:https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/924242722810195968Here's Andrew Poelstra rebutting him, and myself confirming: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/799xlz/csw_many_wonder_why_secp256k1_was_used_in/And here's his reply to Andrew:https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/924276066222592000> Re comments like: "Can you clarify for us non-supercomputer-inventors how you are doing operations on 10^65-bit numbers? Because there isn't even enough storage space on earth for one of these so it sounds kinda like you're full of shit." This is under 2^256 bits> We do calculations on 8192 bit numbers - in common RSA keys Always a question of q=what operations. It is nice to have people who are experts such as Vitalik say what is impossible... The Patent and IP lawyers love these comments :) PLEASE keep them coming! Pretty Please!Notice how he clearly conflates "2^256 bits" (so much info that the entire universe isn't big enough to hold it) with "256 bits" (probably roughly the entropy of this sentence). This is literally the crypto equivalent of [Verizon math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MShv_74FNWU).Here's his argument in the tweet thread about how Bitcoin is Turing-complete:> This is something that this allows: http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2003/HPL-2003-21.pdf … Still think Bitcoin is not extensible or Turing complete... Boneh-Franklin allows for the creation of cryptographically secure Random Oracles. This is Just the start down the rabbit hole https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_oracle> And... Oracle Machines are Turing complete... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine …  E:y^2 = x^3 +b This is the Boneh-Franklin system - it is also Bitcoin for b = 7I call this the "A implies B and bee implies honey therefore A implies honey" fallacy; just because two things have similar names doesn't mean they are remotely the same thing. An oracle machine "is an entity capable of solving some problem, which for example may be a decision problem or a function problem"; a random oracle is simply a random number generator that stores its own past outputs so it remains consistent. The two concepts are entirely different. And this seems to be the _cornerstone_ of his argument for why bitcoin is already Turing-complete.And oh by the way, the guy seems gleeful about patenting everything. I'm pretty sure the bitcoin cash community is in favor of economic freedom, and patent trolling is the exact opposite of that.....I don't give a damn if the guy is (part of) Satoshi; for all we know, it could even be the case that he actually was part of the Satoshi group, he was just the bizdev guy. But he's _definitely_ not technically competent, shows a level of arrogance far above his actual level of understanding, and makes pie-in-the-sky promises about BTC/BCH's capabilities that are clearly untrue, and only serve to detract from genuine efforts to implement those capabilities if people really want them.
2	1523068358	22	> Verizon mathSad that I know exactly what this is without clicking it again. It hurts.
3	1523109087	3	Just saw for the first time.  My god.
2	1523071837	63	He is a master con man, able to make competent people believe that he is actually more competent then them, just a bit deep and cryptic.  He says vague stuff, or he uses the wrong language ... and the people that give him the benefit of the doubt start thinking about it: Maybe he means this, maybe he means that ... ah yes then it would make sense. And of course the more you belief he is Satoshi or was involved with the creation of Bitcoin the more you will think in this way. On the other side of the spectrum, why would I do an effort in to reading this con man's papers ... I have better things to do with my time!  And so it's kind of an amplified DDOS attack on somebody's time. CSW makes other people do all his thinking and debating for him, so he can keep on conning. He is a master at the craft. All so the investors in nChain keep on investing. nChain then invests all over the BCH spectrum and then of course they have to invite CSW to all these conferences. That's why you will not hear Roger Ver say: "He is Satoshi" or "He is not Satoshi" but "Person A still believes he is Satoshi".  It's always money. Always. I can ask Roger a thousand times to explain why he is doing business with CSW and nChain but he will never answer. The stakes are to high. Apparently in the BCH community there is use for a con man that has indeed fooled some people in to believe he is Satoshi.Then there are the Bitcoin Core hijackers who have proven to be quite effective at manipulation themselves.  They love the fact that CSW is active in the BCH community and is such a controversial figure and probably do whatever they can to make CSW look as legitimate as possible on the sub here just so they can ridicule BCH later. The big problem for 99% of the user space is that we don't have all this knowledge so we are stuck with proxies. People that we trust that we have to believe.  That's how so many of us got bamboozled by people like Greg Maxwell and others. We just could not understand all of it, and then it's easy to fool us. Keep fighting the good fight and never lose your integrity Vitalik. Like Pirate Rick said: When something is wrong, you speak up! And in crypto, well apparently being wright and wrong .... is sustainable ... 
3	1523084067	5	You may be right about the "master con man" thing. Even trying to count on the experts I trust in this space, I still have trouble knowing if he is full of shit or not. He knows what we want to hear and says all kinds of great things we want to believe. Many of them are true. He even has Money to support our cause. I can see why some would let some minor bullshitting and excessive attempts to be the center-of-attention slide since he seems to be a net positive influence day-to-day. If he is bullshitting us about math/code, he does need to try to stop that so as not to make BCH look bad for being associated with his fake claims. But, hell if I can tell if he is conning or legit... so far.  Edit: I don't really care about the I am S. N. claim these days. I'm talking about the current stuff.
2	1523061817	5	**Random oracle**In cryptography, a random oracle is an oracle (a theoretical black box) that responds to every unique query with a (truly) random response chosen uniformly from its output domain. If a query is repeated it responds the same way every time that query is submitted.Stated differently, a random oracle is a mathematical function chosen uniformly at random, that is, a function mapping each possible query to a (fixed) random response from its output domain.Random oracles as a mathematical abstraction were firstly used in rigorous cryptographic proofs in the 1993 publication by Mihir Bellare and Phillip Rogaway (1993).*****Oracle machine**In complexity theory and computability theory, an oracle machine is an abstract machine used to study decision problems. It can be visualized as a Turing machine with a black box, called an oracle, which is able to solve certain decision problems in a single operation. The problem can be of any complexity class. Even undecidable problems, such as the halting problem, can be used.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

2	1523065100	49	Thank you Vitalik for putting in the effort at showing people what a fraud Craig is. I really appreciate the service you are doing.
3	1523090388	7	Agreed!
3	1523080388	-10	His behavior there was a shame.> No bitcoin project ever was corrupted by Craig. Craig is giving away patents for free, is funding startups, is educating people on a lot of things pertaining bitcoin. Craig is contributing. Samson Mow is collecting rent, while silencing dissent and sponsoring people to harass anyone that exposes Blockstream's methods or complains about bitcoin's fees.> > Moreover, you were flat wrong about negative gamma. You were obviously in confrontational mode and used that "definition" to start you rant that doesn't justify a bit of your behavior or conclusion. Imagine someone saying you are a fraud because you didn't understand what Craig meant with negative probability. And seeing that person rubbing shoulders with Samson mow. Saying you are the fraud, not him.https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8aavhc/after_reading_this_post_it_seems_clear_that/dwye2iu/
3	1523080903	-16	You are a destructive infighter, slandering the person that supports and funds more BCH projects than his slanderers ever will.  
4	1523118937	1	Is it destructive infighting to fight against Blockstream? They would also have argued that they funded more Bitcoin development than anyone else, yet clearly their intentions were to cripple Bitcoin. 
2	1523096249	3	About the "Turing complete" thing... what's your opinion on this:https://youtu.be/M6j-11H2O7c 
2	1523068619	9	Exactly! Craig = 2 steps back . I'm sure Craig can understand that math...
2	1523068322	6	This is the mother fuckin Vitalik I'm talking about. That "shut your mouth you lying piece of shit" Vitalik. Who gives a shit about a bear market when VB is in straight beast mode. 
2	1523087552	3	>patent trollingIsn't patent trolling when someone patents something that everyone already knew about or was obvious, like 1-click ordering? If you look at his actual patents they are on things like Turing completeness. You can say he is wrong about that OR he is patenting something we already know, but you cannot coherently say both.You might want to consider where these impulses to overreach come from. They're a good hint you might be getting overemotional.

If you look at his actual patents they are on things like Turing completeness.

You get your hands in any kind of patent you can, the more ambiguous the better, and you launch litigation against anyone you feel there is a remote chance of winning. In most cases you expect the other party to settle in order to avoid expensive court battles.In other words, technobubble patents that are difficult to interpret are a perfect fit if you want to engage in patent trolling. Something that CSW is an expert of. If nChain plans to engage in patent trolling, they trully  have found an excellent chief scientist. Kudos to their HR!
4	1523099265	1	nChain are not patent trolls - according to the standard definition. Neither are they trying to patent 'Bitcoin'. The usefulness and value of the patents however is another matter. 
5	1523100134	1	According to the definition you are right. The haven't engaged in patent trolling yet, but I doubt they have patents yet anyway. The thing is, it is not clear what is nChain's plan of making money if not future patent trolling? In Andrew's O'Hagan "The Satoshi affair", it is stated multiple times that the plan was to sell to Google (or some other major player) *after*  they reveal CSW as Satoshi. 
6	1523104319	2	> I doubt they have patents yet anywayThe certainly have *filed* a lot (publicly available info). But it takes years to get a patent granted. 
3	1523099173	1	This is where you get to demonstrate your credibility, given that you have looked at his patents. 1. Can you link to the patent(s) on Turing completeness?2. Can you link to ANY other CSW patent and explain how it is original and an improvement over the state of the art?
3	1523101982	1	Butthurt is the word, I think.
2	1523076306	2	First of all, the title of this thread is about negative gamma. Your comment that it is BS is bullshit, so you should apologise for that one to start with.This is not my field of expertise so I don't understand everything about the impossibility of the LN network, but from what you say you fundamentally agree that LN is at least almost impossible to get done. I will trust you on your level of certainty, and I guess CSW owes you an apology (because I trust you) for taking LN's impossibility a notch up. I don't think it is a crime though, considering that **on stage you had someone that has been saying for years that big blocks/forks are dangerous and censored anyone who disagreed with him**As for the SM model, it does work on paper indeed. I have not read CSW's papers but I know that his argument boils down to this: SM is BS. It will never happen. The paper you are referring to has deeper fallacies, for example it considers honest miners stupid and incapable of reacting. It also considers the security model of SM impeccable, as if hidden blocks have 0 chances of getting leaked. But again, I will grant you this that **CSW owes you an apology for not admitting that on paper SM is possible**. Yet, on stage you had someone who said **LN can only work with segwit**.I will also trust you about the other CSW twitter blunders. I have no expertise on this topic, I will trust you for argument's sake. So he also owes you an apology for those blunders. Yet again, on stage you had someone who **has hijacked the bitcoin brand, the bitcoin open source project, the bitcoin mission and sacrificed bitcoin adoption for an unproven store of value project.** So yes, Vitalik, it is true that CSW exaggerated when he spoke of LN (although his exaggeration is not so far from the truth), and that he wasn't particularly kind to the authors of the flawed selfish mining paper. He is also guilty for the technical blunders he did on twitter, apparently. He owes all those apologies to you. However, none of that makes him a fraud. Of the people in that conference hall that day that also managed to get on stage, you did not dare to call a fraud the only fraud in the room that has defrauded millions of bitcoin users. Not only that, but you retweeted his tweets admitting that you rubbed shoulders and discussed important matters such as what to do with CSW. The latter, you appear to think, is a bigger threat to bitcoin than the former.Vitalik, you can call me a troll.. or shill.. or whatever you want, but as a matter of fact, that day, you behaved like a coward. 
3	1523077065	42	> The paper you are referring to has deeper fallacies, for example it considers honest miners stupid and incapable of reacting.How would honest miners react? Are you actually suggesting that miners should engage in active strategizing among each other to reject blocks from specific miners that they deem to be unkosher? If so, that seems like a very easy political gateway toward censorship. The default strategy (mining and insta-publishing on the head) should be a Nash equilibrium, full stop, so consensus can proceed forward in an automated way, so that the desired form of coordination (the consensus itself) can happen without opening up avenues for undesired coordination (51% censorship cartels).> Yet, of the 2 people in that conference hall that day you did not dare to call a fraud the only fraud in that room that has defrauded millions of bitcoin users.Samson Mow is not a fraud. Roger Ver is also not a fraud. There's a difference between someone having political views you disagree with, and someone frequently emitting statements that can be proven to be objectively false within a paragraph.
4	1523079923	8	> Samson Mow is not a fraud.Ridiculous. If that guy isn't a fraud, then nobody is a fraud. Claiming 'CSW is a fraud and Samson Mow isn't' is a fraud. 
4	1523077534	5	>How would honest miners react?Set up a bounty for anyone who leaks the hidden blocks.>Samson Mow is not a fraud.Samson Mow, hires armies of shills to silence dissent in rbitcoin and to attack bitcoin cash on Twitter. You are a smart guy, you know how important consensus is for any open source community. Every bitcoin user, business and developer has paid a steep price for that. Samson Mow also **lied** on stage, right in front of you, saying that for Lightning you need Segwit. That alone was sufficient to call him a fraud. Look in the mirror and call yourself a coward, for not having the balls to call out a fraud and trying to compensate by attacking the easiest target in that room that is also the farthest thing from fraud.
5	1523077711	30	> Set up a bounty for anyone who leaks the hidden blocks.That's assuming that the selfish mining cartel is large. My mental model of the selfish mining cartel is that it's basically one pool or at most two.> On top of that, Samson Mow, lied on stage, right in front of you, saying that for Lightning you need Segwit.He did indeed make a false statement, but that seems like an honest misunderstanding; I'm sure that if I said "ah, but bitcoin cash has FT" he would reply with something like "ok, you're right, though the code would need to be reconfigured to work on BCH". And no, Craig's errors are not of this type.
6	1523078834	8	>That's assuming that the selfish mining cartel is large. My mental model of the selfish mining cartel is that it's basically one pool or at most two.33%+ of hashpower cannot be small, if any node is hacked to propagate the hidden blocks then the damage is done. SM would have to start from scratch again lose money for another 48 hours hoping that it doesn't get hacked again supposing that it succesfully finds the leak. Or there could be a human leak. And this is not even the only way. There is a thing in business known as risk management. SMing is full of uncertainties, therefore by definition uncertainty = risk. Which makes it also extremely unlikely from a business point of view. Mining is already too risky on its own due to price fluctuations etc for the mining pool to agree to add more to that uncertainty by engaging in SM. What matters is that Emin's paper takes none of that into consideration hence cannot be used to model real world events.>He did indeed make a false statement, but that seems like an honest misunderstandingA very convenient interpretation. Then how about the army of trolls and shills they hire on Reddit and Twitter? How about the r/bitcoin censorship they all sponsor? How about all the ad hominems they push? >And no, Craig's errors are not of this type.No bitcoin project ever was corrupted by Craig.

7	1523080499	37	> 33%+ of hashpower cannot be small, if any node is hacked to propagate the hidden blocks then the damage is doneYou do realize that mining pooling allows miners to mine a block without having most of the contents themselves, right?> There is a thing in business known as risk management.

Mining is already too risky on its own due to price fluctuations etc for the mining pool to agree to add to that uncertainty by engaging in SM.All of this applies even more so to 51% attacks. And yet we still believe that 51% attacks are a risk. So this argument doesn't actually reduce the extent to which the possibility of selfish mining (as opposed to the impossibility thereof) reduces security.> Then how about the army of trolls and shills they hire on Reddit and Twitter? How about the r/bitcoin censorship they all sponsor? How about all the ad hominems they push?I strongly disapprove of all that stuff. Theymos should be ashamed to call himself a cypherpunk, and I fault the bitcoin core community for not doing more to ostracize him.> is educating people on a lot of things pertaining bitcoinTo be clear, he is _mis-educating_. That's a _negative-value_ contribution.> Moreover, you were flat wrong about negative gamma.You and he are both misusing terms. Gamma is an input to the model, not an output. Craig himself then [tried to clarify](https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/981378961677701120) that by negative gamma he meant negative probability. Well, let's look at what [negative probability is](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_probability). If you read one of the [linked papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1287.pdf), it becomes very clear that negative probability is a mathematical abstraction that can be used in cases where there is the possibility of anti-events:> Taking an event { ui } with ui ∈ Ω, we denote by N+ the number times that events with the same sign as the event ui occur during a sequence of N trials, by N- the number times that events with the opposite to the event ui sign occur during a sequence of N trials, by ni the number of times that the event ui occurs during a sequence of N trials, and by mi the number of times that the event -ui occurs during the same sequence of trials. Let vN(ui) = (ni )/ N+ - (mi )/ N. Then we define the extended frequency probability of theevent ui as p(ui) = lim N→∞ vN(ui)In our case, gamma was the probability that the attacker's block comes in first, as opposed to the honest miner's block coming in first. What does an anti-event in this context even mean? An attacker's block not getting in, and also somehow magically transmuting itself into a second honest block, so as to make the honest chain instantly grow by 2?The article seeks to rescue Craig's claim by turning it into an argument that introducing zero-power nodes has a _negative effect on gamma_, but that's not even aligned with Craig's own effort to rescue his own claim.

8	1523090921	4	Keep fighting the good fight mate. The majority of people agree with, and support you. It's the vocal minority who your replying to here, and not at all indicative of the greater crypto community. 
9	1523098585	-2	Stop pushing a false narrative. You being a Bitcoin Core supporter should be enough to disregard everything you have to say as you're either a paid troll or a victim of propaganda.
8	1523105220	1	> You do realize that mining pooling allows miners to mine a block without having most of the contents themselves, right?I do realise that, but a 30% mining pool involves enough people, nodes, devices to still have a leak risk. At least when there is a bounty/incentive for someone to leak it. So unless we are speaking of a big mining operation in syberia that alone holds 33%+ then, yes the risk of leaks/hacks is non negligible. Moreover, other things the article doesn't consider is the ultimate effect of Selfish mining on coin price. As I said, bitcoin is already volatile on its own, what kind of miner would add even more to that uncertainty by launching an SM attack that could destroy the price? This is also important because when someone selfish mines everybody knows. How does the selfish miner know that the price won't collapse and why would he selfish mine in the first place then?The bottom line is **in the SM article none of the defensive HM strategies were discussed**. >I strongly disapprove of all that stuff. Theymos should be ashamed to call himself a cypherpunk, and I fault the bitcoin core community for not doing more to ostracize him.You know very well the funding for such campaigns comes from Blockstream, Samson Mow is CSO of Blockstream. Any person representing Blockstream is a fraud by definition.>To be clear, he is mis-educating. That's a negative-value contribution.He is educating people on the economy of bitcoin, its network topology and the importance of user experience, to name a few.>You and he are both misusing terms. Gamma is an input to the model, not an output. Craig himself then tried to clarify that by negative gamma he meant negative probability. Well, let's look at what negative probability is. If you read one of the linked papers, it becomes very clear that negative probability is a mathematical abstraction that can be used in cases where there is the possibility of anti-events:We saw the video, in the conference you were at he said:>you have negative gamma..the more sybils you put out there the slower your selfish miner becomes.If gamma with sybils is lower than gamma without sybils then you can say sybils have negative gamma. I have heard this all the time by doctors discussing protection factors in medicine.>In our case, gamma was the probability that the attacker's block comes in first, as opposed to the honest miner's block coming in first. What does an anti-event in this context even mean? An attacker's block not getting in, and also somehow magically transmuting itself into a second honest block, so as to make the honest chain instantly grow by 2?An anti event means that without sybils out of 1000 attempts, the attackers block gets mined first 10 times. With sybils, every 1000 attempts, attackers' block gets mined first only 5 times. Therefore we can say that sybils' gamma is -0.005%. >The article seeks to rescue Craig's claim by turning it into an argument that introducing zero-power nodes has a negative effect on gamma, but that's not even aligned with Craig's own effort to rescue his own claim.It should be clear to you by now that Craig doesn't have to explain anything. Again I'm shocked that you called someone a fraud for saying sybils have negative gamma while gang banging with the only actual fraud in the conference only because there is a mob backing him (Samson Mow).
8	1523081317	6	You are like 50% redpilled. Do you honestly believe that only Theymos is the  snake?? DCG has the same chairman as the FED man... Wake up and smell the coffe!
9	1523109314	3	Had the same thought here. Theymos is definitely not a one man operation. That’s a convenient anonymous scapegoat for the Blockstream/AXA/Core takeover of Bitcoin. Surprised Vitalik doesn’t get this. These guys are heavily orchestrated.

9	1523098738	6	I think Mow is a clown. But what fraud has he committed (i.e. obtaining money through deception)?
7	1523111342	1	There are two ways that Emin's paper could be properly criticized.  One way is that its analysis of the model (HM + SM)  is incorrect, e.g. involves incorrect formulas or calculations.  The second way would be to question the relevance of the model to the actual bitcoin network, for example by showing that honest miners could retaliate or that the resulting network instability would decrease the value of the coin.I've seen no credible arguments, by CSW or otherwise, that the first situation applies.  The second situation may apply,  but this doesn't invalidate Emin's paper in any way.  The paper remains valuable because it showed that behavior of Nakamoto concensus as described in Satoshi's whitepaper was incomplete.My objection to CSW's discussion is that it is poorly organized and poorly written and not worth my time to read it.  If the man had written other papers that  contributed valuable knowledge, or if he had delivered working products or prototypes rather than promises then I might have a different view.

6	1523080187	-2	Lets raid Craig like the WoW days and then roll for the loot he drops.
5	1523096039	1	With miners spying on other pools (by adding a few hashers to that pool) how would the fact that a block has been found remain hidden information. The SM still has to communicate within its pool that a block has been found and that work on the next block needs to start. Spy mining will mean that this information is instantly shared with the honest miners out there. Unless one is one entity instead of a pool this does not work. And if not a pool other miners can not join the effort like the paper says rational miners would do (which I do not find likely)
4	1523107845	1	Your POS plans will [result in oligarchy](https://nchain.com/en/blog/proof-work-relates-theory-firm/), but I guess that is what you want, to be the new oligarch of the world with your centrally planned ETH currency.
3	1523077080	5	The only reason for Craig Wright being on that stage is because he has claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, something which he has not substantiated, that makes him a fraud. He also has not made any meaningful contributions in the crypto currency space and in fact he doesn't seem to have the slightest grasp of the fundamentals of the field. He is a fraud, an idiot and a conman, he should be called out for it every time he shows his face.

2	1523089586	-2	Vitalik:Censorship > propaganda > sockpuppeting > soft fork is fraudulent behavior.You are not standing up at conferences to call out that fraudulent behavior, even though it's far more consequential, and this current spat seems petty in comparison.I love you man and appreciate all your work.  But I want you to know that if you are less interested in a massive, world changing fraud, while passionate about calling out CSW, then your motive is better explained as resentment over this:>it could even be the case that he actually was part of the Satoshi group
3	1523098954	4	He called out the bullshit because craig had literally just given a bullshit talk and Vitalik was in the audience. He's hardly 'passionate' about calling out CSW. We should all call out bullshit and fraud when we see it and then move on quickly to more productive things. 
4	1523100683	-1	Well, he's been in the audience the entire time, and he still refrains from calling out the real fraud in this space.

1	1523087288	5	>if gamma=0, so if the attacker can never win in races where they publish right after they see a block from a non-attacker,Just to pick a small nit: even with gamma=0 the selfish miner wins these races with a probability of alpha: in the Eyal-Sirer procedure the attackers still mine on their own block when in the race condition, and they only abandon it once the honest miners get one block ahead. (I only realized this today when I was re-reading the paper.)
2	1523088910	10	Right, I agree. When I say "races where they publish right after they see a block from a non-attacker", I'm specifically referring to situations where the attacker uses a strategy of revealing when the honest chain catches up exactly.
1	1523088176	14	I watch the full Craig Wright presentation at Deconomy and was shocked by the path finding vs salesman problem mixin and the the fact that the salesman problem is only seen through the angle of NP-hard solution. Salesman problem is clearly NP-hard from a mathetical point of view, but from an engineer standpoint, nearly every comme salesman problem type as an acceptable polynomial time solution with very acceptable even if not optimal solution... This two facts are trivial for everybody with minimal mathematical or engineering knowledge. Thanks Vitalik to denounce surch intelectual boiled.
1	1523088948	7	> It's pathfinding. LN is hard to get right and has a bunch of user interface pitfalls and capital efficiency issues, but it is absolutely not true that it's impossible to solve in a way that would stop being impossible if mathematicians discovered tomorrow that P=NP.It is correct to say that even NP -hard problems have optimizations, they are intractable in worst scenario cases. 3-SAT has a bunch of algorithms to speed up, but not known polynomial-time solver.Keeping apart the discussion about NP, the LN design makes it so that it grows exponentially in complexity with each linear addition of nodes if we don't want to simply find a path, but we want to find the cheapest path, and/or the path that has enough funds for a series of n payments, and/or the path with best liveliness ratio. I'd risk to say that it falls into the category of "longest path problem".
2	1523089520	14	Still a pathfinding problem. And once again, if it takes exponential computing power to find the best path, but linear computing power to just find _a_ path, then it's totally okay to just take that path provided the fees are within reasonable bounds.
3	1523091318	4	You can argue that testing only two fundamental parameters would at most make it 2-SAT, which is P, not NP.But adding to the already very know problems of scale (too many coins for world wide usage), and the inherent potential of loss of funds, there is no possibility, apparently, to really have a comprehensive and rich state information of big chunks of the network, unless it has very centralized hubs.I'm still far more inclined to fast-pre-consensus-->incentive-based-hard-consensus approach.
3	1523091062	4	It seems like Dijkstra's Algorithm should be suitable, and that's `O(e + v log v)`. So the claim that it's np-complete is just outright false anyway.
1	1523097805	4	Hi Vitalik, I have a question, if I may, about your comment re: the unimportance of network topology. But first, let me say thanks for dropping into r/btc and taking the time to provide such a clear and thorough explanation. All of us are the better for it, and it's been much appreciated.If I understand CSW correctly, he wants to suggest that network topology *is* crucial to the profitability of SM. Namely, that if mining nodes form a near-complete graph, then by the time SM "listener" nodes detect a new HM block, this block will already have propagated to the entire network, thereby beating the SM broadcast. Hence, in Ittay and Emin's first scenario, where honest nodes nullify the SM's lead by successfully finding a block on the public branch, there will in-fact be no "toss-up" as assumed between SM and HM's blocks. Because the SM block always reaches miners second.*If* the above is true, then it would also seem to undermine the strategy pursued by SM in scenario 2. The paper suggests that once the SM pool has a lead of two blocks, it now publishes one block from its private branch for every block publicly found block. This would lead us back to scenario 1, with the caveat that if SM loses the toss-up, it has another hidden block ready to broadcast. But if, due to network topology, there really is no toss-up between SM and HM blocks, then the SM strategy would only work if the SM pool publishes a longer chain. However, as the paper correctly notes, it would be an abnormality for SM's to have a longer chain, "[s]ince the selfish pool is a minority, its lead will, with high probability, eventually reduce to a single block." Hence, by pursuing strategy 2 without a possible fallback to strategy 1, SM pool gambles all its block rewards on the probability of finding two blocks in the time that HMs find 1.So, my question: Is CSW simply *wrong* about miners forming a near-complete graph? Or is he wrong to assume this network topology would lead to full HM block propagation? Or is there something else wrong with this argument?Thanks for indulging my long question.
2	1523101780	12	Let us suppose that gamma = 0, so if the attacker publishes right after an honest miner, everyone sees the honest miner's block first and favors it. The selfish miners pursue the following strategy:1. Mine a block, and hide it.2. Wait until either you or the honest miners mine a block. If it's the honest miners, give up and go to step 1. If it's you, go to step 3.3. You are now 2 blocks ahead. Keep mining until the honest guys catch up to the point where you're only 1 block ahead. At that point, publish.If at any point you get to step 3, you're guaranteed to win (except in the very occasional case where honest miners make one block right after the other and you don't have time to react), and the only question is, how much do you win (in any case, you can orphan at least one of the attacker's blocks). You lose 1-p of the time in step 2. The math says that if you have >1/3 hashpower, on net you win.
2	1523106561	4	Adding to/rephrasing Vitalik's answer --> Hence, in Ittay and Emin's first scenario, where honest nodes nullify the SM's lead by successfully finding a block on the public branch, there will in-fact be no "toss-up" as assumed between SM and HM's blocks. Because the SM block always reaches miners second.This situation is covered by setting the Eyal-Sirer paper's parameter gamma to 0. I agree with CSW that this situation is probably realistic; in the Eyal-Sirer paper section 6 they may be overstating the ease of reaching large gamma. But still the general model (sections 1-5) does not depend on section 6.So in other words we can go ahead and plug gamma=0 into the model, in which case we see the selfish mining strategy *still* has an advantage if hashpower is more than 1/3. However that is quite a high bar to reach, which probably explains why nobody has tried it.> The paper suggests that once the SM pool has a lead of two blocks, it now publishes one block from its private branch for every block publicly found block.Not quite --- if the SM pool advantage is at 2 then decreases to 1, they publish everything, in which case they win guaranteed. The only time they have a race is when they have only gotten 1 block advantage so far, and the HM then catch up. During the race one of two things can happen (simplifying for gamma=0):* the SM mine on their own block and get a second one, which they publish, thus winning the race. (probability=alpha)* the HM mine on the HM block and get a second one. Once the SM see this, they abandon their block. (probability = 1-alpha)Either way, once the race is over, the selfish miner now starts from scratch.Note the paper also provides the probabilities that, at a randomly chosen time, the strategy is in a given state. For alpha = 1/3, for example:* 52.9% of the time in neutral mode where SM is mining on the HM chain.* 17.6% of the time with a 1 block advantage.* 11.8% of the time in race mode (had 1 block advantage but HM caught up).* 17.6% of the time with a 2-or-more block advantage.
1	1523098235	2	Thank for that post vitalik but stay away from the bogs they have nothing good in mind
1	1523107076	2	 dijkstra algorithm only works with a stable network, it does not work if the valuations of the network change over time, which is exactly the case with lightning because every pathfinding research locks fund at each node, until it either reaches success and actually send the funds or reaches failure and unlocks them for someone else. This makes the problem from P to NP hard.Anyway I really enjoyed seeing you answer in this sub
1	1523091532	5	Good to see this fraud getting properly called out.
1	1523098031	2	Thanks for taking the time. Even though it might annoy you to spend your time on CSW related things I think it's not wasted.
1	1523087095	4	As author of the OP article, I somewhat agree the idea that LN routing is NP hard in the strong sense felt like an unfair overreach by Craig, though to call it "insane" is an overreach as well. Politics is the mindkiller, folks. Not everything is black and white. The scaling debate has been nothing if not the ultimate demonstration that people who are very wrong on some things can also be right about other things.
2	1523099801	4	'Overreach'? Really?He tends to do that quite a lot. I guess he means to be technically knowledgeable and tell the truth, but sometimes accidentally 'overreaches' into nonsense and outright lies. 
2	1523114113	1	The unfair overreach is either the result of ignorance, carelessness or dishonesty.  Ignorance can be excused by a humble apology. Occasional carelessness can be excused by an admission of error.  Dishonesty can not be excused.A cryptographer would not be ignorant, knowing the difference between worst case cost and expected cost.  Perhaps CSW has apologized for his mistakes, but if so I've not seen these.  I've reached the point where I no longer take the man seriously as a potential contributor.  He strikes me as a likely detractor, either as a useful idiot or controlled opposition. He is occasionally a source of amusement when I find myself in a cynical mood.

It's a [vehicle routing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem) which is a generalization of TSP. To find *a* path it's indeed enough to repeatedly find the cheapest path for the smallest available capacity at any route, but that's very far from optimal in the general case.
2	1523104453	1	**Vehicle routing problem**The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem which asks "What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers?". It generalises the well-known travelling salesman problem (TSP). It first appeared in a paper by George Dantzig and John Ramser in 1959, in which first algorithmic approach was written and was applied to petrol deliveries. Often, the context is that of delivering goods located at a central depot to customers who have placed orders for such goods.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Dijkstra's algorithm is (where V is set of vertices and E is set of edges) O(|V|^2). The optimal version is: O(|E|+|V|log|V|).This doesn't scale for micro transactions. Nothing linear-or-slower will. You've basically just confirmed that LN will not work as advertised.
0	1523032924	122	I agree.I remember the time Craig first used the phrase "mining is a near complete graph" and I, who am not a topology student, thought "that's a complete non sequitur, he's spouting bullshit."But I held my tongue, and kept reading, and lots of people were claiming Craig was just sputtering meaningless words.  But then someone (/u/forkiusmaximus I think) explained what the phrase meant, and since I'm also not a complete idiot as regards topology, the light bulb went off, and I had a giant AHA moment.If anyone here had known to use the phrase "near complete graph" in 2014 a tremendous amount of bullshit could have been cut down at the source, in fact, history might have been very different.____Edit: hijacking my own post.Check this out.**From what I can find, we're apparently roasting CSW over something he never even said!**He said:> the effect of this attempt to increase gamma (γ) is actually negative"The **effect** is negative."**Not** "gamma is negative."Seriously SMH./u/forkiusmaximus
1	1523042172	6	Can you elaborate on what a 'near complete graph' is? Does the word 'near' have a special meaning which I'm unaware of?I'm not super well versed in topology, but the network is nowhere near a complete graph in a mathematical sense?
2	1523043479	16	The mining network is very near to being all-to-all, i.e., a complete graph. 
3	1523044021	3	How would that work physically?To be a complete graph, every node needs to share an edge with every other node. That seems impossible given the design of TCP/IP (or how the internet routes as a whole)
4	1523045051	14	Every miner peers with almost every other miner, rejecting connections from peers that don't produce blocks.
5	1523045802	3	>Every miner peers with almost every other miner, rejecting connections from peers that don't produce blocks.This is an empirical statement, do we have evidence of this? The incentives of Bitcoin may mean--and I'm thus far agnostic about this--that Bitcoin converges towards this topology, but whether it's actually there yet is another matter.u/ForkiusMaximus
6	1523051866	15	The incentives all but force this topology. You as a miner (solo miner or pool; not a pool hasher) would never want to rely on other miners to "relay" your blocks to miners. The speed hit would be a huge waste of money (orphan costs). Likewise you would never want any delay or censorship risk in downloading a new block from another miner (wasted work). I have asked miners about their networking and there are network mapping methods to be released, but it's a lot like asking where the empirical evidence is for a $100 minimum wage increasing unemployment is, or for the idea that rent on an apartment wouldn't be $1 million per square meter if not for rent controls.It would be absurd for miners to do anything other than connect in an essentially all-to-all fashion. Networking is a totally negligible cost for them at this point anyway.
7	1523053430	4	> Networking is a totally negligible cost for them at this point anyway.I think this in particular has been one of the key things signalling that the network is out of infancy. The cost of bandwidth more than sufficient  to accomplish all-to-all topology is far lower in relative terms than the cost of hash power.
7	1523054778	4	Thanks, I'm convinced.
7	1523114976	1	Miners have limited resources and can not connect to every potential mining node.  In addition they must connect to nodes that supply traffic and they must connect (indirectly) to exchanges so they can sell coins, etc...Unless the physical topology (e.g. fiber optic stands) is point to point they won't be able to send their blocks in parallel, so they will have to prioritize sending,  going after the largest competing miners before going to little players who seldom find a block.  This works because the number of miners is small enough compared to the cost of connections. 
6	1523054422	7	I can confirm from direct personal experience, yes, the largest mining pools almost always directly peer with eachother as much as they possibly can.  This is a big portion of how the fibre network that Matt Corallo made works, from the little bit of reading I've done - Shoving key blockdata between key miners as fast as possible without validating it.  (I may have the specifics wrong but that seems to be the concept).That doesn't mean they reject connections from peers that don't produce blocks, but they certainly don't use many such connections, and none of those get onto the fibre network afaik.Most mining pools are also running multiple bitcoin nodes in geographically distributed locations that peer both internally and externally.  I'm not sure if the software has advanced to the point where mining pools pull real time latest block data(just headers, not full block data) from multiple nodes in parallel, skipping validation, but I would be surprised if it hadn't reached that point yet.This matches the incentives.  Honest miners absolutely must directly peer to every large miner they possibly can.  The losses from not doing so are subtle, immediate, and difficult enough to track down *without* shitty peering, nevermind with shitty peering thrown in.  Any possible cartel-like gains made from excluding miners is indirect, delayed, and difficult to formulate, not to mention politically dangerous and likely to cause a shitstorm if caught, so I'd be surprised if any miners even seriously consider not peering for as much of a direct benefit as possible./u/jessquit /u/ForkiusMaximus 
7	1523054785	3	Thanks!
5	1523061806	2	> rejecting connections from peers that don't produce blocksFrom where do they get their transactions?
6	1523092509	1	Pedantic
7	1523115477	1	This is actually not pedantic, because presently the majority of bandwidth used by bitcoin nodes is protocol overhead involving the gossiping of INV messages that announce availability of transactions.  This networking impacts the propagation of blocks as well, either directly by queuing or indirectly by reducing the effectiveness of compact blocks or thin blocks.
8	1523117845	1	No I mean that it's pedantic to interpret what I said as "maintains no connection to the nonmining world."
4	1523051123	7	Nearly each pair of miners share an edge on the Bitcoin network. That is, there are no intermediary Bitcoin nodes between them. There may be many hops one the Internet itself, but not on the Bitcoin overlay network. This is important because, for example, there is no room for UASF "nodes" to slow down or block propagation of blocks among miners, as well as what was explained in the article.
4	1523046996	5	watch craig's talk at deconomy, he goes over the whole thing.
4	1523044959	9	Read the article man. It states that the important mining nodes all have a direct connection to each other.
5	1523046770	1	I read it and the math stuff just didn't make sense to me. Given that:1) miners do establish consensus by virtue of hash power and 2) that they generally peer with other minersIt would seem to imply that the author is redefining the completeness of the network graph based on weighted edges(by hash power) instead of the number of edges? That all seems to make sense, but at the very least it seems disingenuous to be so fast and loose with well established terminology. Especially since a major theme of the article relates to a lack of intellectual curiosity. 
6	1523049526	6	um no it's not redefining what completeness means, it's just limiting which nodes are considered part of the network that we're asking about its completeness, specifically limiting it to considering the nodes that _actually fucking do the thing the network does_ which is pretty reasonable really
4	1523048149	2	> That seems impossible given the design of TCP/IP What part of that seems impossible?
2	1523042421	6	The mining network is not a complete graph, but it's extremely close to that topology.  That's what's meant here.
3	1523044475	0	How close? Even using NAT traversal techniques like STUN and ICE, a computer is not capable of maintaining the *millions* of connections required to be complete. Also, come to thing of it,  this is absolutely bullshit seeing as bitcoind has a maxpeers parameter (which I believe defaults to 8?)
4	1523044592	5	There are not millions of mining pools and unpooled miners. More like dozens.There aren't even millions of nonmining nodes, more like 5000-10000 at any given time. But nonmining nodes are not part of the mining graph.Miners and pools highly customize their software.Miners and pools have their own ultrafast relay network, too.

I do wonder if CSW's math-speak is bullshit like many people say, or, just hard for us relative noobs to understand. VB being wrong about this issue does not mean he is wrong about CSW being a fraud on more than just the one controversial issue (S.N. - an issue that does not really matter much). The other issues are more likely to matter and smart people should know by now if he is speaking good math or fake math.
2	1523116377	1	It's bullshit,  but not total bullshit.  There is some truth buried in with false claims.  Like Greg Maxwell he uses slippery language, which enables him to fool many people by intimidating potential critics.In some fields, like medicine, academia and government, it is customary to use titles such as Dr.  However, this is not the general case in computing.  In computing generally my experience that people who flaunt this title are often arrogant assholes.  Just saying...
1	1523080109	2	Even if the "effect is negative" how does that prove SM wrong if SM still works at 0 gamma. 
0	1523035580	60	Yes. You are missing that1/ Math tells us gamma cannot possibly be negative (that would require someone putting negative hashrate on the network, which makes zero sense).2/ Physics tells us that gamma cannot even be zero (That would require faster than light communication and infallible hardware).3/ That even with gamma = 0 (which we established is impossible) selfish mining still works.Sorry, nothing in this blog post shows vitalik wrong. At best it demonstrate that the author doesn't understand the math behind selfish mining.
1	1523036998	7	I think you may have misunderstood the article. It was saying that csw likely didn't mean "negative" gamma as in a negative number, but in a different sense of the word "negative".
2	1523038489	29	Indeed, if you redefine gamma AND redefined what negative means, then craig is right.However, "negative gamma" only contains two words, and, as a result, having to redefine two to be right is not exactly a stellar performance.And even though the article claim that would make it right, it still doesn't, but we don't even need to get there, because that thing is a fractal of errors. Getting to them all is a gigantic waste of time. One could qualify this as a DoS attack on the scientific community in the crypto space.
3	1523039645	4	there is gamma and a **factor's gamma**. You are confusing the 2 things. So what is the gamma of 2 sybil nodes? it is the difference between the gamma with 2 sybil nodes and without 2 sybil nodes. If this delta is negative then the gamma of 2 sybil nodes is negative. You don't have to redefine gamma. You are confusing the terminology.
4	1523047542	0	Technobabble.
3	1523038774	5	I don't think its redefining the term negative.  "Negative" is used quite often in the English language in a non-mathematical sense, I know you are a French speaker so maybe its understandable your perspective.
3	1523041294	1	>However, "negative gamma" only contains two wordsPlease show me where these words were used.  I can't find it.

1	1523047726	6	I'm in full agreement with you until this part.  > nothing in this blog post shows vitalik wrong.You didn't read the blog post.  It's not arguing any of those points you made.  Instead, it's highlighting a misunderstanding of poorly chosen language.  
2	1523059839	11	You know what the real problem is? CSW harassed people with wild claims and name calling. Why do you need to say that SM paper is a cancer? WTF?!Don't you think that attacking like this backfires eventually?Skimming over CSW papers, I saw: poor formatting, no LaTeX, equations missing, weak citations, lack of proper definition of terms, non standard usage of notation, not very good flow of ideas, overall confusing or incoherent presentation, many typos and misspelling.
3	1523069480	0	In case SM is wrong then it would be a cancer!Because people could rely on a bad theory to push unnecessary changes on Bitcoin, like BS with layer 2... Then Bitcoin change from origin roadmap.
4	1523070975	0	This name calling is good for a Pub Brawl, not science.I get that overselling SM is bad, but then the "cancer" would be a hypothetical dishonest usage of the paper, not the investigations in the paper. There is an huge difference.Relativity made possible atomic bombs, would you cal Relativity a cancer? Or the usage of the tech?
1	1523036962	5	>1/ Math tells us gamma cannot possibly be negative (that would require someone putting negative hashrate on the network, which makes zero sense).Makes perfect sense to me. To me this merely implies the counterproductive application of hashpower.
2	1523039259	9	Not really, because in this case gamma (the % of honest miners choosing the mine on top of the selfish miner's block) would be zero.And in a more general sense, a counterproductive application of hash power entails 0 blocks mined, not negative blocks. If you want to talk about a negative *financial outcome*, then this makes sense, but in math you need to define all the variables you are using beforehand. If we want to rewrite the thing from the perspective of *revenue/losses*, then it makes sense to define a variable for that and say it takes negative values, because one actually loses money failing to have a mined block accepted.But that's not the perspective of the SM article.
3	1523041543	5	>And in a more general sense, a counterproductive application of hash power entails 0 blocks mined, not negative blocks. If it means losing a block you already found, no, that's a negative block.
4	1523059537	3	That would be a separate thing from "negative gamma". One cannot just go ahead and redefine terms until what they say suit reality. 2+3 = 7 if we redefine 2 as 4!
4	1523041821	1	This is actually 0 successful blocks, but negative financial position because of the resources spent.you might find the block but don't publish it, for instance. Just think about how this is exactly the same situation of the SM just turning off their ASICs, from the blocks perspective. From the financial perspective of course is different.
5	1523042081	5	>This is actually 0 successful blocks, but negative financial position because of the resources spent.I disagree. A quantity of hashpower was exerted with the direct result that a valid block was discarded.  That's equivalent to mining an antiblock.
6	1523043219	2	Ok, but this can't make gamma negative, you need to build another consistent model with a different variable to account for negative outcomes.It makes no sense to say "I mined -1 block" if the question is how many blocks were added to the blockchain.You could, for instance, account for the chance of having your block rolled back, etc. All I'm saying is that you can't cherry pick a variable well defined in an article and say it can be negative if the variable is defined only for positive real numbers.
7	1523043670	5	>Ok, but this can't make gamma negativeIt is in every way equivalent.>It makes no sense to say "I mined -1 block" if the question is how many blocks were added to the blockchain.From the point of view of the SM it very much is "-1 block"The attacker expends extra hashpower with the effect that he loses a block he already had if he had done nothing.If you build a model that doesn't account for that, your model is bogus.
8	1523045571	7	I understand where you are coming from, but I think you need to think a bit more about the issue at hand. The issue is: there is a paper with a construction/model, the meaning of gamma is well defined as a ratio of *positive* real numbers, so the ratio itself cannot be negative.Now, if you go for another model and employ another notion, you can't just to come back to the first model and say "hey, your gamma is negative here and here", because, by definition, what you are doing is using *another* model where you allow *your gamma*, in *your* model to be negative.The correct way of doing things, the *rigorous one*, is to say: "hey, *my* model reflects better the situation because of such and such and here I have a gamma that can be negative". That gamma in your model will be sharing only a *name* with the gamma in the other construction, because they will be *different mathematical objects*.
9	1523046109	5	I think this is horribly pedantic. Another way of saying it is, "if I use the given model, gamma must be negative. Since it can't be, the model is wrong. QED." which is what Craig was saying. And I'm starting to think he was right.It's a speech at a conference not a IEEE paper FFS
2	1523038223	6	Unproductive use of hashrate will increase gamma, not decrease it.
3	1523038778	12	Not unproductive. Counterproductive.Also.I just found out that the quote we're all lambasting Craig over is>> the effect of this attempt to increase gamma (γ) is actually negativeUnless there's some other quote, Craig doesn't appear to have even said that gamma itself would be negative.
4	1523041404	2	Hi Jessquit, What exactly do you mean by counterproductive hashrate? Can you define it for me? What aspect about hashrate can be counter productive for the network?This is my current understanding:using the dictionary's definition of counterproductive: having the opposite of the desired effect. Our desired effect: To mine a block.opposite of the desired effect: to not mine a block. From what i currently understand about mining/hashing , you can do 2 things* hash and try to solve a block (results in normal mining).* just waste your hash / do nothing with it (results in unproductive hashrate). It would seem to me that by definition counterproductive hashrate and unproductive hashrate are an equivalent. But you stated that they are different so can you explain to me how my hashing would slow down everyone else's hashing (since this is required for a negative gamma)? I don't see how you can hash and instead of helping to solve a block, slow everyone else down in solving a block. Thank you-Griffith
5	1523041900	3	>Hi Jessquit, >>What exactly do you mean by counterproductive hashrate? It means you apply hashpower and end up losing a block you already mined.
6	1523042563	2	OK thank you. How is this different from unproductive hashrate? can you provide an example of counterproductive vs unproductive hashrate? ( sorry if i seem argumentative, i dont mean to. i am just trying to understand.)Thanks-Griffith
7	1523043156	5	>OK thank you. How is this different from unproductive hashrate? Unproductive hash is what everyone is doing when they don't find a block.  If you're mining and you don't get a block, then you weren't productive. If you're mining, and by your very mining you LOSE a block, that's counterproductive. It is precisely equivalent to mining an antiblock.
4	1523039307	0	He implied it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/dwkw2f3/):> No, Gamma is not zero... just the wrong way around.
5	1523040235	4	Yeah, still not seeing where he said gamma was negative.I'm starting to realize this entire witch hunt is yet another example of someone taking something which apparently *wasn't even said* and twisting it into an attack.
6	1523040858	3	> Yeah, still not seeing where he said gamma was negative.I'm not sure what the "wrong way around" could mean about 0. Do you think he meant it was closer to 1?> I'm starting to realize this entire witch hunt is yet another example of someone taking something which apparently wasn't even said and twisting it into an attack.You're welcome to take the tack of Craig being a simply misunderstood genius who happens to be unfairly attacked and maligned because he's a "threat" (or something). But consider the alternative: everyone is constantly coming up with apologetics for his mistakes *and* his clear fraudulence (seriously, click on [only this](https://i.imgur.com/hAbPhW3.png) link). Nostradamus required fewer interpretations than Craig. Is that more likely the sign of someone brilliant, or a fraud? You know, because Satoshi was known for his imprecision :)Edit: >  apparently wasn't even said and twisting it into an attack.It was said [here](https://youtu.be/RpWt2RKTTjQ?t=290). > ..things like Selfish Mining, where they talk about gamma.

5	1523040346	1	he said "the **wrong** way around" not "the other way around"and I honestly don't understand what he means by that because I cannot see the comment he is replying to.
6	1523040384	1	So is it closer to 1 or closer to -1?
7	1523040532	0	find the comment he was answering to then we can talk.
8	1523040642	1	You know there's a "parent" link for each comment so you can see the context?Anyway, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/dwkujx5/) it is.
9	1523041125	2	I don't know what he had in mind in that reddit comment. Probably he wrote gamma 0 meaning the effect on gamma is negative for sybil nodes.In the presentation he clearly stated **the effect** on gamma is negative. 
2	1523038195	-3	> To me this merely implies the counterproductive application of hashpower.That still wouldn't change gamma, and is not even the subject of the post. There is no coherent way to rescue this 'negative gamma' notion. The central point of the post:> The selfish mining pool would be foolish to throw in an extra hop and listen through that necessarily slower and less direct connection. > In that way, the effect of this attempt to increase gamma (γ) is actually negative; it would hurt the SM and help the HM, the opposite of the intended result.Is wrong. The SMs wouldn't necessarily listen to HMs blocks (or publish their own) through the sybilled nodes. The point is that they're trying to sybill their way *between* honest miners, not between themselves and the honest miners. Even if that *fails completely*, they will not be hurt, and gamma could go no less than 0. 
3	1523038616	6	>> In that way, the effect of this attempt to increase gamma (γ) is actually negative; it would hurt the SM and help the HM, the opposite of the intended result.Wow, thanks for that. I hadn't read the exact quote. It completely validates Craig. Reread the words.> the **effect** ... is actually negativeI can't see where Craig ever said that gamma itself would be negative.Unless you have a better quote, then you've completely validated Craig, and invalidating all the attacks against him re: this quote.
4	1523039855	6	Is that the real quote?? Such a drama for nothing in the end?? It would deserve its own post if true.
5	1523042951	1	[Here](https://youtu.be/RpWt2RKTTjQ?t=290). > ..things like Selfish Mining, where they talk about gamma. You actually have a **negative gamma**. The more sybills you put out there...That was at the conference where Vitalik made his comments.
6	1523043605	3	Thanks! So it's not that then.After hearing the arguments I believe it's pretty obvious he is using negative gamma as they do in other fields (I remember he was talking about epidemiology months ago) to refer to negative effects, although it seems in mathematics they don't talk like that.
6	1523044673	2	Ah that puts Craig in an even more favorable light. Vitalik implied that Craig had said the value of gamma is negative, which would have been weirder phrasing.
7	1523044836	1	What do you make of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/dwkw2f3/), then?> No, Gamma is not zero... just the wrong way around.
8	1523045703	5	What I make of it is that you desperately want discredit Craig and will use any means to do it, regardless of what he's saying, and in the process you discredit yourself.
9	1523050466	1	I don't think that's fair at all. The straightforward interpretation of what Craig says in both quotes leads to the conclusion that Craig was confused about what gamma even means in the context of SM. I do believe in interpreting people generously when they've misspoken and trying to find a manner in which they  make sense, but surely you can agree that even if you're particularly generously disposed towards Craig, honest well-meaning people can interpret what CSW has said as /u/contrarian__ and I have.
8	1523081690	1	Makes sense to me as a figure of speech. What's bizarre is that after seeing an interpretation that not only makes sense but actually enhances our understanding of the attack in a way no one ever mentioned before, we still argue about ways it could be interpreted to make Craig look insane. That just says to me people are grasping at straws to prove a conclusion they already reached rather than being curious about what else someone could contribute to their understanding.
9	1523100158	1	If you’ve seen any of my replies, I’d been assuming gamma is zero from the start of this selfish mining debacle.

3	1523043424	1	Is that quote *the* mention of negative gamma in CSW article? Or there is another explicit one?

5	1523046457	1	Although I'm fully with you that CSW writing and presentation is very confusing, the first written mention is talking about the negative *effect* of adding more hops, but in the presentation he said "negative gamma". One could interpret his babble as, again, talking about the negative *effect*. This is bad anyway.What misses the point in CSW presentation really is that CSW is attacking the wrong part of SM article. You can pretty much skip the gamma and go directly to the FSM (the markov process) and see that that is actually a strategy that will succeed irrespective to the value of gamma.ps: BTW, I think the problem of the SM article is really not putting in the system the effect of other miners also withholding blocks. So the article is not wrong, but incomplete and so the conclusions of the article are unwarranted, namely: bitcoin consensus doesn't work.
6	1523048391	1	> ps: BTW, I think the problem of the SM article is really not putting in the system the effect of other miners also withholding blocks. So the article is not wrong, but incomplete and so the conclusions of the article are unwarranted, namely: bitcoin consensus doesn't work.Do you have a post elaborating on this point or can you elaborate?
7	1523050521	2	SM is a strategy of withholding blocks, if others also employ the strategy, what will happen is that all pools will have the same share as before but in the form of a greater occurrence of two blocks in a row.
8	1523050692	1	Hm yeah I had the same thought when I read the paper. I need to think about this more in terms of how it would affect the strategy.I will say though, even if this is accurate, so long as the pool selfish mining is able to do so surreptitiously, the other pools will not be able to react in this way. In a world where honest mining is the norm secretly selfish mining does represent a way to game the system for quite some time before others can react.
6	1523048950	1	> BTW, I think the problem of the SM article is really not putting in the system the effect of other miners also withholding blocks.From what I figure, if there is more than one SM pool, only the one with the largest hash rate - SM^max - will be able to meaningfully contribute. Each SM is working on their own private branch and once they release only the longest will survive. If the honest miners switch to SM strategy such that HM% < SM^(max)%, the SMs will largely neutralize each other and SM^max can effectively act as 51%.
7	1523050096	1	> If the honest miners switch to SM strategy such that HM% < SMmax%, the SMs will largely neutralize each other and SMmax can effectively act as 51%.This is a very loose statement, you need to consider the hash rate of everybody and calculate the probability space.No pool can effectively attack as ''51%'' because having > 50% is a *guaranteed* way to win the block race, even if all the remaining pools join up to mine as one entity with ''49%'' hash power. If you do not actually have > 50%, other pools can reorg and join up to beat you.
8	1523051518	1	As long as HM% < SM^(max)%, the majority SM is certain to win every block _eventually_, much like 51% - this is what I meant by "effectively act as 51%".> other pools can reorg and join up to beat you.Yes, if the conditions change such that HM% > SM^(max)% this no longer applies. If the other miners collude to steal the title of SM^max, it still applies, but the beneficiary changes.
9	1523051934	1	The beneficiary is always changing, this is why SM does not entail a snow ball to majority.
6	1523046799	1	I mostly or completely agree with all this. 
7	1523047259	1	And just one more thing, even if CSW IS a fraud and writes babble, I was actually pretty concerned how the rest of the crypto community addressed it. Vitalik talking with sansung mow to "do something about CSW"? Wtf is this: A counter strike clan full of masturbatory pricks? Wtf, seriously. This intended gang bang is even worse than having a guy talking shit, because the guy talking shit will receive bad feedback and will look bad, whereas the gang bang is propaganda per definition.
1	1523039671	2	"1/ Math tells us gamma cannot possibly be negative (that would require someone putting negative hashrate on the network, which makes zero sense)."Employing SM causes more orphaned blocks, no?Two Scenarios:  1) All honest miners add 144 blocks to the longest chain per day.  2) Honest miners plus some SM miners add only 140 blocks per dayUsing same network, same hardware, same timeframe but less blocks are added to the chain.  Is that not an effective decrease in hashrate over what they would have added had they all been honest?
1	1523039526	0	every strategy has positive or negative gamma depending on how much they increase or decrease gamma. if you apply 10 methods at once then the final gamma is equal to the sum of their individual contributions to gamma. if any of those methods decreases gamma, then in the sum equation its gamma is represented by a negative value hence it has negative gamma. Can you see the light now?
1	1523107570	1	1/ Physics can turn absolute temperature negative in laser system and real mining activity can make gamma negative:https://www.yours.org/content/craig-wright-s--negative-gamma--can-be-real-4915d24a0140Math does not mean much if it stay in an ivory tower without feedback from real world.  2/  Superluminal communication is not required to make gamma=0. First-seen rule in mining is enough for that in a complete graph network.3/ When gamma=0, Selfish Mining barely "works" only for 1/3 hashing power. Taking into account block rate fluctuation, honest node reaction and other real life factors will render Selfish Mining completely meaningless. "works" with 1/3 hashing power here means selfish miners barely keep the same market share but still lose more blocks as orphans. 4/ Selfish Mining has zero evidence from real world so far (self-serving "simulations" do not count).Please take time to read the paper carefully before giving answers although we know you are busy coding.      
2	1523109029	1	> 2/ Superluminal communication is not required to make gamma=0. First-seen rule in mining is enough for that in a complete graph network.If you truly think what you are writing is true, then I suggest you write a paper about it and build a prototype, because that's Turing award worthy.
3	1523114140	1	Care to elaborate? You mean network communication requires reversal of causality principle? I fail to see much difference between first-seen rule practice and multi-way conference where answer comes after question. Why to need Turing to do that? Thx

6	1523107464	2	Public speaking flub.  Yawn.  When I realized too late this entire kerfluffle was over one (1) thing he said one (1) time I realized it was nothing but a cheap smear piece, no different from the way [this](https://youtu.be/EpGH02DtIws) was used to attack Obama ad nauseum. It's really a pathetic attack.I would love to see Craig debunked, really, but his presentation that this comes from, which I hadn't watched until deadalnix posted this link, is actually extremely good, and yes, he said one thing one time that isn't technically correct if you take it literally.
7	1523107723	1	> I would love to see Craig debunkedI'll find some links for you. 
8	1523108965	1	Ok great. I don't follow every controversy because in my experience they ALL turn out like this: someone gets into a fit of pedantism over the way he said something. Fair warning: Giving me a hundred of those sorts of links will do you negative good. If you want to make a case, you're going to have to do better than that, because that would be making MY case imo.
4	1523056889	2	You can be as generous as you want but even the effect isn't negative. Even that extremely generous interpretation of this man whom we know doesn't understand math, is wrong.Also I thought you were done with posts about CSW?
5	1523092420	1	>Also I thought you were done with posts about CSW?Then you were projecting because that isn't what I said whatsoever
6	1523096724	1	I'm sorry, I must have misunderstood your post.But you don't care that there isn't even anything like a negative effect on gamma and that even this extremely generous interpretation of CSW is wrong?
7	1523097913	1	I haven't seen anything that convinces me; in fact, from what I gather, the Sirer model is incomplete because it does not account for the counterproductive application of hashpower.What's the best argument you've got?
8	1523098804	1	There are 2 possibilities:1. You have just 1 node that listens and as soon as it sees a block from HM, it publishes the block from SM.2. You still have that 1 node, but now you also have other nodes that do the same.Since #2 include #1, #2 can't possibly be worse than #1. So how do those extra nodes produce a negative effect?It could only be a negative effect if those other nodes would have to communicate back to the first node before publishing the SM block **and** that first node stops doing what it was already doing. That's the only way you would get this detrimental extra hop that the post is talking about. But that's not at all what the SM paper suggests.Am I missing something? 
8	1523099373	1	And what do you mean by counter productive application of hashpower?
9	1523099584	1	I mean that if you've already found a block and now you exert hashpower in an attack, and your attack causes you to lose the block you found, then you didn't find "zero blocks" you found "negative one block."If the model doesn't account for this, it's incorrect.

These sort of faux pas are impossible to avoid.If he later said> the effect of this attempt to increase gamma (γ) is actually negativeThen I'm sticking with that.You're skewering someone over a trip of the tongue, like Republicans did to Barack Obama when he said"57 states" as though the editor of the Harvard Law Review and a former US senator doesn't know the number of US states.

4	1523066229	1	It doesn't matter if there is a negative effect on gamma because SM still works at 0
5	1523066673	1	It matters. For example, if there are 2 selfish mining pools in the idealised scenario, one SM1 that uses sybils and one SM2 that doesn't use sybils, gamma SM2>SM1 
6	1523067638	1	Why would 2 selfish mining pools be an idealized scenario, The idea is to get more miners to join your selfish mining pool. It seems to me that 1 larger SM pool would be better. 
7	1523067739	1	Regardless, SM works at 0, so CSW still didn't prove SM wrong even if something does have a "Negative effect" on gamma 
8	1523067886	1	what do you mean SM works at 0?
9	1523070715	1	0 gamma
0	1523032939	46	It cleared things up for me. A well-written article dissecting the probable underlying confusion.  Craig's communication skills do sometimes need some assisted interpretation.  
1	1523044804	27	Best I can tell what's being attacked is one phrase he said in a live speech.Barack Obama once said there were 57 states and people had a field day with this as if Barack Obama didn't know there are 50 states.  In reality of course Obama knows how many states there are and people attacking him for a flub just looked lame.Same deal. This is a massive attack on a tongueflub.
2	1523101725	1	LOL, like Craig once accidentally stumbled over his words and now everyone is being really unfair. You have long been a voice of reason on this sub. I guess you must not be part of one of nChain's recent 'investments'. 
3	1523102182	1	>  sub. I guess you must not be part of one of nChain's recent 'investments'. That is correct. I am nobody's "investment."
4	1523105153	1	Fair enough. I'm just in disbelief that you think Craig is being attacked for "one phrase he said in a live speech". 
5	1523106390	1	But he *did* apparently only say this once in his speech. Elsewhere he said it correctly (the effect is negative).
6	1523107080	1	I'm not talking about the the single 'negative gamma' statement, as if that's the only one error in his talk that everyone is getting hung up on and blowing out of proportion. Do you think that slip-up is the full extent of the errors in Craig's arguments against the SM approach (as written in his paper)? Do you think Craig is right about SM?
7	1523108043	2	>I'm not talking about the the single 'negative gamma' statement,Yes, but I was, so you're changing the topic.  But the original point stands. A thousand people are attacking the shit out of a guy for saying one thing incorrectly one time, when it was a simple and totally understandable public speaking flub.Thing is, I've seen this before, where Craig was excoriated as an idiot for saying things that sounded absurd, when in reality he was correct and it was that his detractors who simply didn't follow, or were trying to distort the entire point, or (like here) where he misspoke in public and they tried to make it much, much more than it really was.I don't know if Craig is right about SM. I don't know if Sirer is right. I don't have the expertise to prove or disprove either, and more to the point, I'm not sure either of them do. It's turned into a big dick contest.But I *can* see a bullshit public pile-on over nothing at all when I spot one.  And when you see that, it usually means the guy getting piled on is right.
2	1523116508	1	If it were only a on time flub, most of us, including most likely VB, would have given him the benefit of the doubt.
3	1523117983	1	Dude, making a one or two word error in a live presentation when you're going a mile a minute is simply not a thing.The more of these that I look into, the more I realize: they're almost always like this.
4	1523118991	1	The problem is his written work as just as poorly structured, reasoned or worded.  At the very least the man needs a good filter, and that's being charitable.  I can't recall a single nugget of useful knowledge that I didn't already know that I learned as a result of watching his videos and reading his posts and papers.
1	1523052282	5	> Craig's communication skills do sometimes need some assisted interpretation.  Just like the Bitcoin white paper. /s
1	1523036463	-13	> Craig's communication skills do sometimes need some assisted interpretation.My god what a weasel words. Craig is a lying bully who needs to polish his knob in public on pretty much every occasion he can find. It is so bad now that his bitcoin knowledge and patent trolling 'for the good' have been completely overshadowed by his toxicity.
2	1523044629	2	Preach.I laughed recently reading someone's observation that CSW is Satoshi because he is finally bringing majority of Bitcoin community back together in calling him out for charlatan he is ;)
2	1523043342	-2	Despite your comment being brigaded by downvotes, you are correct. 
3	1523048543	7	if people voted things up and down based on whether they were relevant to the conversation instead of whether they think they're "correct" then reddit would be a good place for productive conversations
3	1523043827	17	I downvoted because I think this his comment is useless in this context. This topic is for discussing something specific, do we really need another rehash of general CSW hate on here? There are a million and one topics for that already. This guy just picked the top post in this thread and replied to it with a non sequitur.
4	1523046845	3	Hah... Craig's history is the CONTEXT. Like, what, CSW made "one mistake" and Vitalik jumped on that?! The CSW has been lying for years now and we are supposed to ignore that and consider what happened in isolation? Funny...
5	1523063823	2	I had to wad thru so many comments to find the most reasonable one. CSW has been caught lying before, and BIG time! Why would anyone trust anything this guy says is beyond me.Thanks bud!
3	1523053632	2	Water is wet is also a correct statement.  Can I get some upvotes?
4	1523069025	1	I will upvote facts. Have an upvote.
1	1523035224	-14	He may want to just stop communicating altogether. Fine if he wants to contribute, but do it anonymously. Let what he says stand on their own merit, stop trying to be a public figure because that's never going to work out for him.
2	1523036242	19	Let the first perfect individual throw the first stone.If the community's response to the slightest criticism or smear campaign from a competitor is to hide, we might as well pack up and go.
3	1523038630	4	I don't agree. He made a choice to call himself Satoshi, that's far removed from perfect. And he obviously didn't expect the expected result. But this isn't about tact. And I'm not thinking about criticism or smear campaigns from the outside, but about his relationship to the community. He can do a lot more good contributing anonymously. This is obviously up to him, no stones being thrown here.
4	1523039011	5	That is not correct. He was doxxed. Tact and stuff, yes. Choice, no.
5	1523039037	5	Doxxed? First I've heard of this.
6	1523039630	4	Then you have not been reading on this story a lot.It's on record. Check archive.org. Twitter posts by Dox_SN tagging CSW old twitter and also MADinMelburne. Did you think he would get the ATO to raid his home himself? Could be, but not plausible to me, especially when considering a ton of other stuff which is known from that time. Also a coincidence he started talking to Core earlier that year showing his results for larger blocks? There is a lot that can be unearthed about 2015/2016 if you go digging. He was caught completley of guard with that. He was left with two options. He chose number 3, thus 2016 shitshow.
7	1523048544	4	You know, Dorian Nakamoto also got Doxxed but he didn't invite Gavin to a private key signing session with a promise to have a public signing shortly afterwards that never materialized.
7	1523042277	6	> Twitter posts by Dox_SNDo you have an URL?
8	1523042599	1	http://archive.is/ANRW1This is the one I found through google now. Seen a different actual twitter archive... not sure it was this one.
9	1523048696	3	That's pretty weak. 
7	1523040090	4	That's right I haven't. Does it change the current situation though? Why do this to himself if not for a greedy attempt on making himself a public figure? He had multiple options, right?Also, he should be voicing any unreasonable action taken against him. If he's in an unfair position, speak the truth. Educate the masses.
8	1523041713	8	No it doesn't change the current situation. I just wanted to post if for perspective. I think many would not want you to know (maybe even CSW also), but I think it is quite an important part of the story.He sure isn't always right, but he does have some things to tell which are aspects people have forgotten for too long. He believes the incentives work fine in Bitcoin, and that is what I believe too. He also believes it can scale on chain and that this method has many advantages. So do I.I hate all the mudslinging on all sides. But at the core, the topics which are discussed are very interesting if one can see past all the ad-hominem and shit.
9	1523043546	5	He does bring things to the table. So can I and I'm anonymous. I'm not meaning a passive aggressive statement with that btw. It's an option here and there's nothing wrong with it.
9	1523064349	2	Simple and the only indisputable fact: The dude got caught lying trying to impersonate Satoshi. What more does anyone want to know to stop trusting this dude?
4	1523043584	-1	You and everyone at the bottom of [this pyramid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem#/media/File%3AGraham's_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement-en.svg)

2	1523035481	21	There was once a time many years ago, when Craig needed Dave to write on his behalf, in the simplest terms, because people wouldn’t of understood him. Craig admitted this himself. I still believe that is the optimal approach. He should focus on what he does best, the cryptography, and allow others in his team like Jimmy to translate / explain these complex concepts for everyday people. This will help avoid confusion and will minimise noise created on social media.
3	1523038756	4	Yeah that could be good.
2	1523043455	1	You may want him to stop communicating, or you may want other people to shut him up for you.But in the real world you just need to ignore his communications or if he's saying something that affects you clarify the misunderstanding.This [adhominous attacking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem#/media/File%3AGraham's_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement-en.svg) is problematic for bitcoin.

0	1523034015	50	Probably, at the very least Vitalik was too quick to criticize. 
1	1523037071	58	Vitalik wasn't asking a question. He was using the question as an opportunity to call Craig a fraud.
2	1523046292	16	He even prefaced it with "i'm in a hyper confrontational mood today".  Vitalik isn't perfect.  He's a very quirky intelligent young man, though one look at him and you can tell he'snot perfect.  
3	1523046428	9	Really, I didn't hear that part of the exchange. That is pretty great, haha. Of course. He isn't perfect, nor is csw, nor Roger, nor Charlie Lee, nor even Satoshi. But together we can learn and grow.
4	1523047275	4	> [But together we can learn and grow.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghvgSTHksfw)  I'm not sure exactly why but now i've got the chorus to this blasting in my head.  Thanks for that.

5	1523061853	2	Under appreciated comment of the day
2	1523047756	10	Lost a lot of respect for him.It's not the time or place for Vitalik to make such a statement. Seemed pretty off-the-cuff and not thought out either.
3	1523048883	10	Yeah, not the time and place at all, it's one thing to confront CSW but it's just _bizarre_ to confront him in the Q&A section of a panel he _was not on_. :/
3	1523082139	1	Yes thats how I feel. I thought he had some insight but it seems Vitalik is just a Jerk!
3	1523096782	1	I thought his statement was of very poor taste. Craig could have countered with why a child pornography endorser who couldn't even finish college was allowed to be there. That would have been of poor taste too. Anyway, let's rejoice that all this stuff is discussed here and that there's no censorship
2	1523037691	3	[deleted]
3	1523037814	11	Nope! I was just saying that his question did not come from a place of intellectual curiosity as it should have
2	1523080982	1	Especially if by that you mean "call a spade a spade", since he's definitely a fraud.
2	1523039843	-10	For good reason , CSW is a proven fraud and Roger is bamboozled

1	1523037134	3	Yes, VB didn't take enough time to understand what CSW was trying to say using strange wording, designed to make you think outside of the box, rather than react at face value.
2	1523041174	28	Why is it the burden of the listener to decode Craig's strange language? This sounds like an excuse for the simple fact that Craig is either a poor public speaker or likes to be cute with his words which is not appreciated by his peers and is interpreted as pretentious.
3	1523071105	6	Thank God I’m not the only person who thinks this.There’s a protocol for publishing mathematical and scientific research. It exists primarily to facilitate peer review of one’s work.People who deviate from this protocol yet insist that their work be taken seriously are known as _cranks_.
3	1523046484	8	I said it in my own reply to this post too.  In the technical world, the onus is on the communicator to use proper terminology.  If for instance, i started talking about javascript and calling every event listener a thread, i'd be entirely wrong.  Though someone could come along and defend me and say "he didn't actualy mean threads.  He used the strange wording to get you thinking outside of the box, designed to make you think of an event listener as if it was a thread".  I'd still be wrong even if whatever the hell i was trying to get across was grokked by at least one person.  
4	1523050446	7	I completely agree the onus is on the speaker to make themselves clear if they want people to listen. If someone speaks unclearly at times they can't expect to be listened to on those points except by the curious, but attacking or censoring them is unwarranted.
5	1523050878	7	Unwarranted completely.   The word censorship keeps getting thrown around in this topic.  This isn't censorship.  Not inviting someone to have the stage isn't censoring them.   It really dilutes all claims of real censorship when hyperbole takes over the conversation.  
5	1523066309	4	Pretty much what /u/ScionoicS said. And I think "attacks" on CSW are very moderate considering his actions over past few years. He has lied (or "been misunderstood"?) ever since coming onto the scene. He says one thing... then few months later... oh, it's not really what he meant... it's this other thing.Same for censoring. "Not inviting CSW to speak in conference" is nowhere near to "Theymos overtakes all BTC communication channels". Let's be realistic here.
4	1523049248	0	It's more like if you were talking about green threads, and a person heard you who had never heard of green threads before, so instead of asking what you're talking about they shouted in an unrelated Q&A session for someone else about what a fraud you are for not understanding how threads work.
5	1523049404	2	Are you suggesting that Vitalik has never heard of green threads before?  Have you seen his tshirts?  They're super green.  Dude is spoolin green threads all day.  
6	1523065906	1	And to think I actually was seriously responding to /u/mungojellyShould've saw obvious troll.
3	1523041870	3	Why is it the burden of Craig to tippytoe around someone who gets easily triggered and has outbursts, like using valuable question time for a debate panel that did not include Craig?  We can both make someone out to be the victim of undue work.
4	1523042883	9	Sure, I'm not defending what VB said either as that kind of public discourse is entirely unprofessional and in poor taste, which is a reminder that while VB is talented he is also young and inexperienced in business and lacks people skills. My respect for the kid went down a bit, he needs to work on that. Craig is also arrogant to me and doesn't make sense sometimes. Craig shouldn't worry about walking on eggshells, but that isn't how I interpret this at all. CSW laid out his questions poorly and got a poor response in return, and VB (who apparently didn't like CSW already for whatever reason) lashed out with ad hominem which was bad on his part too. As it stands, what I see are two somewhat arrogant people who are poor interpersonal communicators having a public hissy fit that makes all of this look illegitimate. Regardless of personal opinion, both of them are making an ass out of all of us as investors with this kind of childishness. 
5	1523043158	3	Sure I think no one claims Craig is a great presenter, even him. Add to that that it was on stage and he was tripping over his words a fair amount  anyway.
4	1523048065	3	Because the burden is on the communicator to make your communications clear. 
4	1523046536	6	Because technical language has long been defined and must be strictly adhered too.  The technical world has no room for literally to mean figuratively.  
5	1523067996	1	you can't really be involved in technical conversations and really think that's how technical language works?? idk maybe there are more developed fields where that's true somehow, but certainly in computer science every term is used a zillion different ways... there's far fewer words than concepts
3	1523049120	1	It's not that the whole burden is on the listener but there's various ways you could respond to not understanding something. You could say, "I don't personally understand the things CSW says," for instance. It's rude and bizarre to respond to something technical you don't understand by assuming that the person saying it is just _utterly bullshitting_, that's outside the bounds of normal technical discourse. Lots of people say things that are hard to understand for various reasons, but I've never before in my life seen someone stand up at a technical conference and yell at someone else that they think they're a fraud because they didn't understand how they were using a variable.
4	1523052080	2	Indeed, which makes me think VB already didn't like CSW for some reason to be so callous in public about it. Not being a very articulated or prepared speaker in once instance at a conference isn't enough to just hard-denounce someone as a fraud. Vitalik himself isn't exactly a great public speaker either.
5	1523055033	2	he's not trying to hide his contempt at all, no wonder since he's hanging out with people who are happy to make vindictive hashtags collectively hating on him
4	1523076297	2	I agree.  It is called rudeness, unprofessionalism, and immaturity.  It is astounding how many posters here are excusing such lowbrow conduct.
5	1523106140	1	FFS. Have you ever heard Craig speak?
4	1523106209	1	This is hardly an isolated error. Are you not aware of ANY context here?
3	1523042702	1	Public speaking and conveying ideas are difficult in general. You get one chance to say something on the fly.Also, challenging people to think of something in a new and different way requires a shock to the old accepted way of thinking.
4	1523044061	5	I would agree, this is why rhetoric is regarded as an art form by many. The trouble is CSW isn't good the persuasive arts, his language was somewhat incomprehensible that only inspired confusion more than anything. And that is ok, none of us are gifted at everything, but in that maybe CSW should re-evaluate his place in all of this. 
1	1523070260	1	perhaps too eager to criticize. he didn't care about reasons, he just wanted to criticize, revealing his petty and egoistic pesona. kind of pathetic, but doesn't matter because I've always had a bad impression of Vitalik
1	1523035609	1	It wasn't just criticism if his solution was to censor.
2	1523046677	5	Disagreement is not censorship.   Deleting all forms of disagreement though.....
3	1523048710	0	Vitalik advocated Dr. Wright to be thrown out from a conference because he made a technical statement others interpreted as wrong. This is scientific censorship.
4	1523048889	1	Thrown out?  No bud.  You're being a drama queen here.  Hyperbole shouldn't be the basis of your arguments.  Vitalik asked why is he invited to speak.  IE, given the stage.  Childish sure.  Censorship, or "scientific censorship" whatever that means, it is not.  
5	1523049899	1	Tomato tomatoe, you're nitpicking. The effect is the same. If you don't know what scientific censorship is I'd suggest a history book on Western Civilization after the advent of the Catholic Church.
6	1523050654	1	This isn't the spanish inquisition.  Not even comparable.  I'm really not nitpicking.  You're building your entire point off of hyperboles.  That's just silly.  I'm telling you right now, it's echo chamber thinking.  It doesn't look as good as you think it does, outside of the echo chamber.  
0	1523033191	25	I'd like to see a Vitalik vs Dr. Wright debate.
1	1523039723	8	Debate what?
2	1523049666	5	PoW vs PoS
2	1523063472	4	Gal Gadot vs Beyonce
2	1523041584	5	Anything they want to debate about.
1	1523039664	3	Here is the full 'Samson Mow vs Roger Ver' debate at Deconomy 2018 that Vitalik's question is at around 46:00[https://youtu.be/vY3hp5gnvR](https://youtu.be/vY3hp5gnvR4)
1	1523037173	2	Someone who is fully behind BCH would be better. I like Vitalik and respect him a lot but he sees Bitcoin as a sort of adversary.  I wouldn't want to invite him in to divide things further.
2	1523041229	2	Dr. Wright is fully behind BCH and I'd like to see him school Vitalik in a public debate.
3	1523041987	2	I mean, besides Vitalik.  Since, it makes little sense to quibble outside of BCH community.
3	1523043993	2	Vitalik would likely win on a technicality as it appears he did in this case.
3	1523045300	2	If you just want to see Vitalik get schooled its not much of a debate. I would love an intelligent discussion between the two instead of needless bickering
0	1523035148	35	You are trying too hard to save CSW. I can use /u/ForkiusMaximus approach and write article saying that:1. /u/vbuterin just pointed out this as the latest in series of blunders by CSW2. we can say that for practical purposes "gamma can be negative"... but KNOWLEDGEABLE person (especially the one claiming to be Satoshi), would never allow herself such blunder but would be able to effortlessly present idea using proper terminologyAt this point, we may as well hire lawyers (and sock puppers, right? /j) to argue our points because we are not looking at things objectively, but are just trying to push our agenda and beliefs.CSW did all this to himself. Even at that conference - what does he use to open his talk? Profanities and "oh, I forgot how many PhDs I have". Like wtf dude? People give you stage and instead of providing value you keep providing bullshit.We have so many other DESERVING people in community, that are doing so many greater things. Give them a platform. Talk about them Roger. Save THEM. Not this liar who has been over-promising and under-delivering ever since that infamous interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DCAC1j2HTY For all I care Dave Kleinman may have been Satoshi and Craig may have worked with him. But CSW has spewed enough lies and hurt those who got involved with, that the least he could do is deliver one of his first promises - stop fucking things up and just go away.
1	1523046276	2	Not supporting one argument or the other here... but CSW said multiple people were involved, not just a single indavidual. There is evidence Satoshi was multiple people. Multiple email addresses, contradicting stances and different manors of speaking within the same conversations spread over time on forums etc etc. Why on earth do you think Satoshi must be a single person and perfect?
2	1523046636	2	Nothing is absolute. Taking that into account, I can admit that CSW provided some truth... and some lies... in like 1:100 ratio.Kinda same like his not_bullshit vs bullshit ratio. He said he doesn't want fame, money, all that good stuff. Fine - let him openly tell the truth he claims to know - instead of attention whoring and wasting people's time... all while getting insulted when others openly call him out on his bullshit.
3	1523058912	1	Agreed, nothing is absolute. He definitely says stupid things and acts in a foolish manor. I think he really does want the fame, though. I think he over extends the truth a lot but he really does understand Bitcoin and how it works, perhaps even through a different perspective given the vastly different age and background compared to typical devs working in the crypto space. He knew about things in Bitcoin that were there from launch like Wolfram 110 rules - the basis for BCH's approach to achieving light weight touring complete functionality. No one today knows what that is and its quite old, yet potentially more efficient than currently used methods.I thought this was a very interesting read. This is supposed to be compiled emails between the "Satoshi Members" as they developed the project. Person number (2), they way they speak and the way he wants to be a part of the cypher punk crowd really seems like it matches CSW's personality as a show off, fame chasing, ego driven etc. [Link](http://vu.hn/bitcoin%20origins.html#they-no-longer-listen-to-me) Thats just what I think though. From this context, individual (1) really seems to have put Bitcoin together from various technolgies, if in fact these emails are legit. In my opinion, CSW was a messenger between other anonymous parties when designing Bitcoin as well as contributing a lot himself. Definitely not the sole person to bring us this technology.
4	1523065721	2	I've read that. Guy that wrote it should be /u/scronty from what I remember.I don't have problem with that narrative. I have problem with Craig's attention whoring, arrogance and lack of expertise. Even if what is written there is 100% true - then Kleiman actually done the work allowing /u/gavinandresen and crew to take it home. Now CSW comes out of dark - wanting recognition, fame, adoration and **patents**. "I am Satoshi". Please. Sit home, spend money, have fun. Do what good you can do. But don't go to conferences, taking spotlight from good work other people are doing while trying to sell false theories hoping someone will buy them.
1	1523045017	2	>KNOWLEDGEABLE person (especially the one claiming to be Satoshi), would never allow herself such blunder but would be able to effortlessly present idea using proper terminologySome optimize for understanding on their own and not for explaining to others. Intellectuals who derive their self-worth from the praise and status afforded to them by their peers may have a hard time accepting this.
2	1523047919	2	I could swallow that... if CSW wasn't holding public speeches and attention whoring.  Considering he is holding public speeches (and attention whoring ;), while actively trying to maximize his personal economic gain through patents and private company - it is quite OBVIOUS that he DOES need to derive his self-worth from praise and status afforded to him by his peers.It's just that he is lacking in technical competence; requiring hand holding + interpreter whenever he dares to venture just a little bit deeper into crypto waters. Or swim vest + lifeguard. Whatever you prefer as metaphor.
1	1523036209	4	> we can say that for practical purposes "gamma can be negative"... but KNOWLEDGEABLE person (especially the one claiming to be Satoshi), would never allow herself such blunder but would be able to effortlessly present idea using proper terminologyNo True ScotsmanBeing something of a polymath myself, I assure you that being a polymath means you often grasp many things for which you lack the precise technical language.Experts in specific fields are masters of their domains but often can't think outside them. The "turf defending" that often goes on between experts and polymaths often devolves into "you don't know our secret code so you're not welcome here."Edit: turns out this was something he said in a live speech with no notes. You try doing that in front of a hundred or so rabid haters and see if you don't stop on your own tongue a few times. I've been there and done it, and I'm an outstanding public speaker.

But when you get into area of five... ten... 20+ mistakes in span of just few years... and almost every reputable expert from the field you claim expertise is calling you out... something is VERY wrong. CSW hasn't produced SINGLE valuable technical paper... let alone practical implementation of an idea... that was positively peer-reviewed. All he has "successfully" done so far in my book is related to pushing and advertising his own personal brand.

0	1523079764	4	Yes you are missing a lot.1) First CSW did in fact say "negative gamma" here: https://youtu.be/RpWt2RKTTjQ?t=4m49s2) Yes CSW does go on to say that "...the more sybils you put out there, the slower your selfish miner becomes"So clearly statement 1) is false and non-sensical and people are correct to call CSW out for that, however, the post on Yours which OP links to, tries to correct/dismiss statement 1) and focuses on statement 2). He also calls people intellectually "uncurious" for focusing on statement 1).  So let us focus as the article would like us to, on statement 2. The argument being posited by Zangelbert Bingledack is that this Sybil network (as described in the original selfish mining paper) would act as an insulating layer for the selfish miner and would slow down their hearing of blocks being found by other miners.Now I admit that is somewhat novel. I mean the purpose of the sybil network is to insulate honest miners from other honest miners, **not to insulate the selfish miner from honest miners**. So indeed if this sybil network is having an unintended effect that is something we should look at.However, there are a few flaws with this argument.* Deploying a sybil network does not also mean: cutting off direct connections from selfish miner to honest miners. Indeed it would be fairly silly to do this and nothing suggests the SM paper intends this.* Maintaining 1 network connection from selfish miner to each known honest miner (as well as deploying a sybil network to disrupt their other connections) is enough to completely dismiss the arguments of CSW and Zangelbert Bingledack here. In other words the selfish miner themselves can be part of the sybil network.* Even if selfish miner did cut themselves off behind their own sybil network, what does this do? Now this is the interesting part. How do network delays augmented by additional hops imposed by a poorly designed sybil network affect the ability of selfish miner to succeed? Sadly the article does not explore this in any detail. * The selfish mining paper argues that even with gamma=0 (no it cannot be negative), a selfish miner with > 1/3 of the network hash power can earn more than their fair share (1/3) of blocks over time. Now I will admit that the selfish mining paper does not focus a lot on network delays and transmission (except to hope that it increases gamma if sybil network is used). There may be something there to explore. If we assume the existence of this insulating sybil network affecting selfish miner hearing of honest blocks, how does that make things worse for them? We need to do the calculations though, or run appropriate simulations. Not just say "negative gamma".
0	1523053188	20	Roger, you should really think long and hard whether you want to push anti-science or actual science. This is becoming ridiculous. People respond to wacky ideas of CsW, and you all interpret it as attacking him personally. The irony here is that Bitcoin is supposed to be trustless, but you are all putting people far ahead of science/data/reason. It's absurd. You are all acting like monkeys. Even if you have to trust people because you don't understand yourself. LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE HERE! Aumary, Emin, Vitalik, Peter, Rick.....just to name a few. If your thought leader Craig Wrong says something, and a lot of people need to interpret and twist what he says for it to make sense, THEN THAT IS A CULT!! Can you let go of your beliefs, not only seek to validate yourself, and your ego, and try to see the truth here? You, and so many with you, are invested into the idea that he is Satoshi. You are not looking at evidence, or what he says objectively. No you are looking at everything through the lens of him being what he says he is. You are invested into that belief. Well, wake up. Be more scientific, please. 
1	1523064882	3	Can't upvote this enough.
1	1523056433	1	Wow. This is the first time I've upvoted anything from you. Congratulations.
1	1523113475	1	Well said.Technical discussions aside if CWS is lying about his computer science prowess then I  am more interested in what drives his behaviour.Is he a deluded narcissist ?Is he a paid actor employed to "disrupt, degrade and destroy" ?What the hell is going on here?
0	1523032478	28	You read that correctly, u/MemoryDealers. This is exactly why the phrase do your own research (DOYR) IS APPLICABLE TO ALL THINGS IN LIFE not just investing. Great article IMO.
1	1523044993	6	I wonder if Vitalik will issue an apology.
2	1523049714	0	ha
2	1523049883	-1	That fucker just hungry he needs to eat a Snickers and chill the fuck out.
1	1523036682	-16	Horrible apologetic article...Do you really believe a man with a wheelbarrow full of degrees cannot present a simple argument coherently? Who are you kidding?
2	1523037235	17	My undergrad Systems Analysis prof had a PhD from an American university and he could barely speak English. I have no idea what he submitted, but his tests were almost incomprehensible. But, he clearly understood what he was teaching.  You don't have to be a great writer, it turns out, to get degrees in certain fields.
3	1523041230	1	Many of my STEM (particularly math) profs/TA's (decades ago) didnt speak english well and I had a heck of a time figuring out certain things. Didnt help that my calculus aptitude sucked...But that was more of a *can the person speak your language* issue. Not quite the same here...
4	1523041864	7	Actually it may be.Apparently, what Craig said was:> the effect of this attempt to increase gamma (γ) is actually negativeYou seem to have a solid handle on English grammar. Did Craig actually claim that gamma was negative?
5	1523042308	1	Not disagreeing with you. It would appear your/he right. Just saying the issue of speaking English is different than maybe not explaining something to others so that they understand due to just maybe different/unusual way of explaining...
2	1523038669	6	Communication is a skill. It must be learned and practiced.
2	1523039109	12	>Do you really believe a man with a wheelbarrow full of degrees cannot present a simple argument coherently?Yes big time.
3	1523043243	3	I'd actually argue that those with wheelbarrows of degrees are the worst at making cogent arguments.Simple does not come to them naturally.
2	1523039173	4	Have you met and talked to a few STEM professors? Many, if not most of them, are quite hard to follow. 
3	1523040349	-1	Not for students of their fields. 
2	1523040273	2	Having a science degree doesn't imbue you with immediate talent for public speaking, rhetoric, or writing. As a compsci major myself right now I can confirm that writing and speaking requirements are pretty minimal. Communication is its own field for a reason. I have seen tons of developers and academics in this space prove that you can be a talented in your field and still be an idiot and a poor orrator.
3	1523041466	1	AGREED! In fact from my experience, I would say (generally-lots of exceptions) that STEM people are BELOW ave. as speakers... But like many/most things can be improved if one tries!
0	1523034944	20	Whether one or the other was right, trying to ridicule a person in public is something I dislike. Vitalik feels protected by the people around him just like bullies at school. I don't know why there is so much rudeness in the crypto space, maybe many can't handle the euphoria and can't control the ego that comes from making big bucks.
1	1523039633	12	Vitalik has been uncharacteristically hostile the past few weeks.His is a very talented mind to be sure, but he is also very young and doesn't strike me as one with a lot of interpersonal experience. His reactions to CSW and now TRON developers is where you can definitely see the kid in him come out. I am not sure if the pressure is getting to him or what. I have noticed over the years that there are many really talented coders and engineers in this space that are absolutely heinous when it comes to business and communication, some like Greg Maxwell on the other end as narcissistic bullies that use their social intelligence to manipulate others. Being good at code doesn't mean you're a good person or a good businessman.It is important we don't put people on a pedestal, just their work if it is worthy of praise. 
2	1523041779	11	I think it’s because recently Bitcoin Cash started moving forward with more OP codes, which is exactly what Vitalik wanted bitcoin to do from the beginning so he could build ethereum inside bitcoin. They refused and he made his own blockchain and now BCH could be eyeing to make ethereum obsolete, too. 
3	1523042607	10	He benefited personally tremendously by Bitcoin not letting him build ETH on top. He's probably blessed from a personal financial prospective. 
3	1523043424	3	Perhaps, at least BCH having its opcodes enabled and on-chain scaling does open the door for something like Ethereum (or a tailored version of ETH itself) to be built for Cash as VB originally intended. ETH is custom built for what it does however, I don't see why BCH's strengths and ETH's strengths cannot compliment each other. BCH managed by ETH smart contracts sounds pretty awesome to me, and BCH opcodes should help such interconnection. This is why my coffers are stuffed with both ETH and BCH regardless, why bet on one winning horse when you can bet on two. 
4	1523102801	2	I'm not sure if they already removed it but in Ethereum's documentation it said ETH is not intended to be money or a currency. I see ETH as a concert ticket but not as money.
1	1523039664	12	Vitalik was standing up against somebody who has attempted to take creddit for somebody else's work. Intelectual theft should not be accepted in the community, and if you take credit for work without providing adiquate proof or even worst, provide fraudulent proof, you should be shunned from the community. 
1	1523041672	0	Think it goes back to the fact that (in general-lots of exceptions) STEM people are below ave. in speaking/charisma. They can do better even if not innate, but takes concerted effort!
0	1523034815	13	There seems to be a difference in definitions, Vitalik is defining gamma as [the ratio of honest miners that choose to mine on the pool's block](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/981082253949202432?s=19)Whereas this article seems to define it as the impact of a miners adding virtual nodes to support an attack.This is a very big difference. In fact it seems like the article agrees on the definition of gamma, but then talks about the impact of adding nodes as failing to help aid an attack and then concludes that this is a negative gamma, however, this doesn't seem correct.You have two factors here: gamma (essentially the percent of nodes that are dishonest) this is by definition non-negative. And another factor, how much of an impact that changing 1% of the nodes from honest to dishonest matters. It appears that in our current situation, this factor is negative due to the direct connections of the major players.In short, gamma cannot be negative, Vitalik isn't wrong here, however, the impact of adding more dishonest nodes can be negative in certain situations (like with major players having direct connections). So, if this is what Craig is getting at then he's not wrong, and perhaps Vitalik's comment, although correct, is a bit short-sighted.Please, let me know if I am mis-representing this. I'm by no means an expert, and I'd love to discuss further
1	1523041071	8	>In short, gamma cannot be negative, Vitalik isn't wrong here, however, the impact of adding more dishonest nodes can be negative in certain situations (like with major players having direct connections). So, if this is what Craig is getting at then he's not wrong, and perhaps Vitalik's comment, although correct, is a bit short-sighted.From what I can find, Craig said> the effect of this attempt to increase gamma (γ) is actually negative"The effect is negative."Not "gamma is negative."Now ask yourself, what's really going on here.
2	1523042549	2	Right, so basically what I was trying to say. Gamma itself is not negative, however in some cases it's impact can be. IE neither is wrong, if what you say is correct, then Craig seemmed to have said what he meant, and Vitalik misheard (intentionally or not), and made a correct statement regarding gamma, and did not talk about the *impact* of gamma, but incorrectly implied that Craig was referring to gamma itself.
3	1523044271	0	[This](https://youtu.be/RpWt2RKTTjQ?t=290) was from the event itself where Vitalik made his comments:> ..things like Selfish Mining, where they talk about gamma. You actually have a **negative gamma**. The more sybills you put out there...
4	1523045202	5	Yes, he said it, later clarifying> the effect of this attempt to increase gamma (γ) is actually negativePlease move along. Nothing to see here but a tempest in a teapot.
2	1523076119	1	At his Deconomy presentation Craig said: "...you actually have a negative gamma". You can hear it for yourself here: https://youtu.be/RpWt2RKTTjQ?t=4m49sNow he does go on to say "...the more sybils you put out there, the slower your selfish miner becomes". Indicating he thinks the effect of sybils will be bad for the selfish miner. He should have just said that and not his "negative gamma" comment.He clearly used "negative gamma" and that is a mistake.
3	1523092727	1	Holy shit have your ever given a technical presentation in front of a large quasi hostile audience!?
4	1523106896	1	 Yes people make mistakes and misspeak sometimes, that is generally ok if admitted to or at least not doubled down on. Above you denied he made the "negative gamma" comment, I showed counter evidence, so maybe a "yeah you are right, he did misspeak about negative gamma, but..." response is appropriate. Now did he really mean to say: "the effect of attempting a sybil network will have a negative impact on the selfish miners because it acts as an insulating layer, affecting how fast they hear about blocks". ? Maybe he meant that. I don't know.Other issues with his talk:He ranted on a bit about "near complete network" without providing any evidence. I mean at least describe how you gathered the data a bit. He also made some comments about LN, and those comments would have been fine if he didn't deviate into techno babble about np-hard problems and solving the discrete log problem. He showed a graph and appeared to simulate tx propagation across the LN network, without saying how that was gathered or what the actual time was (was it supposed to be real-time simulation?). I couldn't see the entire slide in the video but he didn't speak of the details. Tx propagation speed in LN could be a legitimate issue but only when comparing it to something like 0-conf , bip70 type transactions in Bitcoin Cash (which he touched on but not as it relates to that LN picture). That is probably where he intends to go with this. He talked about how we don't need to run nodes as users. This in many cases is true, specifically as he brought up when spending coins. You don't care if that tx confirms. But the merchant does. So wouldn't the merchant want to run a full node? He dodges that.I mean the guy needs some coaching or a speech writer. I'm available :)

"yeah you are right, he did misspeak about negative gamma, but..." I got the quote from one of the people leading the attack, so I assumed it was accurate.>He talked about how we don't need to run nodes as users.

6	1523109179	1	>Real Satoshi already explained that ;-)To some extent yes. There are really 4 cases, merchant can run full node or spv wallet and take 0-conf or not.SPV wallet:* Accept 0-conf* Wait for tx to confirmFull node:* accept 0-conf* wait for tx to confirmFor a large sale, what do you do? 
7	1523109655	1	http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/238/Satoshi envisioned payment processors, not "every merchant runs a node"
8	1523113483	1	Yes, but certainly for merchants that do a lot of business in bitcoin it might make sense. Amazon (if they took bitcoin), Exchanges, other online sellers.The comment you linked to was for vending machines, so yeah those don't really need a node of their own necessarily.
9	1523117692	1	I'm quite sure if CSW were here he'd say he would expect Amazon to not only run a node, but to mine.In the video he said he expected Coinbase to be participating in the graph - ie a miner.
1	1523034937	5	>Vitalik is defining gamma as the ratio of honest miners that choose to mine on the pool's blockso negative gamma then means that the activity in question has no positive impact in increasing the odds of HM mining on pool's chain, and it actually decreases the probability. >it's by definition non-negative.No probability is by definition "non negative". No offense to Vitalik but that's nonsense.In medicine for example we use negative probability for protection factors. In other words, when you consider risk factors such smoking, they are a risk factor because it increases your chances of contracting cardiovascular diseases. But if you measure the impact "jogging" has in increasing your cardiovascular risk, you find out that it actually decreases it hence the probability becomes negative.

But if you measure the impact "jogging" has in increasing your cardiovascular risk, you find out that it actually decreases it hence the probability becomes negativeIt makes my blood boil that you'll confuse factors (which can be negative; a _change_ in probability) with probability itself. _Change_ in probability can be negative, probability itself cannot. You don't suddenly get to own negative kidneys just because you can subtract 1 kidney from 2 kidneys and the sign on that subtraction has a negative sign.I'm not sure which field of medicine you're in, but this makes my blood boil as a biologist.  
3	1523037966	3	Cool down your blood. The probability itself is a ratio and cannot be negative. The probability of any event E, isolated, is only positive. But when you consider the impact an external factor F has on the occurrence of event E, you say F has positive E if it increases the odds of E and negative E if it decreases the chances of E occurring. It is used all the time in clinical studies. Makes sense that it is used in other fields too. Only a narrow minded idiot would say but E cannot be negative. E cannot, but F's E can be negative if it decreases it.
4	1523039511	6	In your example "F's E" is _by definition_ not E. That you chose to do that shorthand does not mean it suddenly becomes an actual probability.Redefining things and arbitrarily broaden scopes to make them valid would seem like a good strategy in debates, but it only serves to obfuscate temporarily from competent people and lure incompetent people into skipping your mistakes. 
5	1523041195	1	Which is a good reason to go back to the source of this controversy:> the effect of this attempt to increase gamma (γ) is actually negativeI think we're all fighting over something that was never said.
3	1523038032	1	FWIW in quantum mechanics, there does exist the concept of negative probability.Perhaps it doesn't have explanatory power in your field but it could in others.
2	1523035292	7	>No probability is by definition "non negative". No offense to Vitalik but that's nonsense.What's the ratio of apples you own to apples that exist in the world. Can you explain a situation where that ratio can be negative?
3	1523037365	4	Not all ratios are as simple as the one you described. Those that involve more complex mathematics, such as a company's P/E ratio, can be negative. 
4	1523037574	6	I am by no means saying that all raitios are non-negative.I am just saying that **some** ratios are non-negative due to how they are defined.In the case of gamma, if it really is the ratio of honest miners over the pool of all miners, both the numerator and denominator have to be positive integers, which has to be non-negative.
5	1523038181	2	I understand that completely, but the point I think the author was attempting to make was that a ratio decreasing can also be viewed as a *negative action on a positive ratio*. In other words if you took two ratios \(both positive\) at two different points in time, then wanted to find the difference in outcome over time the result could be negative. Not saying this is a great way of describing it, or that him putting words in CSW's mouth is the right approach to anything, just trying to elaborate on the author's intent.
6	1523038535	4	True, however, that would then be the velocity of gamma, or the dirivative of gamma, which is not gamma itself.
7	1523038709	2	You are absolutely right. It's really just a matter of saying it properly which was kinda the point the author was trying to make. That sometimes properly describing something can be more difficult than it appears, and humans have a tendency to leave out details that can be important. Who knows if this is what CSW meant, but it is a possible interpretation. 
8	1523045315	2	I think it's more important to realize that we're picking on something someone said one time while giving a public speech without notes, which he later clarified.
8	1523039269	1	Agreed, it seems that a number of other commenters had this same thought. What should I add to my post to be more clear?This is what I have currently which I thought covers part of it>In short, gamma cannot be negative, Vitalik isn't wrong here, however, the impact of adding more dishonest nodes can be negative in certain situations (like with major players having direct connections). So, if this is what Craig is getting at then he's not wrong, and perhaps Vitalik's comment, although correct, is a bit short-sighted.
5	1523037883	1	Please search for "interpretations of negative probabilities" by physics professor Matt Burgin.
6	1523038361	8	I think there is a misunderstanding of my use of "by definition" it appears you are treating the phrase as me saying "by definition of probabilities, probabilities cannot be negative" which is, as you point out, obviously incorrect.I intend the phrase to mean "by definition *of the components, which are each independently non-negative, and therefore the ratio must be non-negative*"
7	1523044287	1	If I expend hashpower *with the direct result of losing a block that I already previously won*, how many blocks did I win as a result of that hashpower expenditure:A. 1 blockB. 0 blocksC. -1 blocksFrom the point of view of the miner performing the attack, the answer is clearly C.I think the model is wrong. The components are not necessarily non negative./u/deadalnix

You're comment implies (correct me if I'm wrong here) that at one point in time we are 100 units away from the center and if we begin to move towards the center, thus decreasing our distance, we then have a negative distance. This is not the case. Simply because a probability can decrease, doesn't mean that it is negative.

3	1523036930	1	>What's the ratio of apples you own to apples that exist in the world. Can you explain a situation where that ratio can be negative?The ratio for the average person is X.If I tell you I'm from Africa then my probability to own X apples is negative.If I'm from New York it is positive. 
4	1523038378	3	That changed the scenario. He asked about the ratio of apples owned by a person to the apples that exist in the world, and you changed it by defining a ratio, and then describing anything below it as negative.
5	1523039086	1	he said:> What's the ratio of apples you own to apples that exist in the world.that's not a probability, but a ratio. A probability question from that statement would be what are the chances of a random apple in the world being yours? (geekmonk's)?If the average person owns X apples, then the chances of a random apple being mine "geekmonk's" are X/the total number of apples in the world. Say, 0.0001. So APP(for random person) = 0.0001.Now we are discussing how to increase P for a specific person. Possible scenarios:1) let's pick a guy from a poor country 2) let's pick a guy from a rich country3) let's pick a vegetarianSince for people from poor countries APP<0.0001 then "poor country" has negative APP because its contribution to APP is negative.So if I tell you I'm live in a 3rd world country & I'm vegetarian, when you calculate my APP you sum:APP+dAPP(3rd) + dAPP(veg)dAPP(3rd) will be negativedAPP(1st) would be positiveHence Sigma dAPPs would be higher if there were no negative dAPP factors.
3	1523037499	1	Easy. I owe four apples to Dave.
4	1523038301	2	That relies on the assumption that debt is negative ownership. I don't know if that's a reasonable assumption. That person still clearly owns 0 apples, but also -4 by that definition, so you would need to specify which one you're talking about.Even given that possibility though, a negative value still doesn't make sense even in the original Selfish Mining context because the original context isn't about ownership. It's a percentage of people you're able to get to do something. And that is a value that has no meaning as a negative number.
4	1523037791	2	I was referring to the current state, ie who currently owns the physical apples.Regardless, but if that doesn't satisfy you, how about this, the ratio of black t-shirts to blue t-shirts that exist. You cannot have a negative number of either, so the ratio has to be positive.
5	1523038491	2	I don't mean to be pedantic, and I do understand the point you're trying to make, but I think I helped you understand the application of negative probability, and you sidestepped it.Negative t-shirts are more than the absence of tshirts. They are "anti-tshirts" in the same way that an apple debt is a "negative apple" and in the same way that *mining counterproductively is equvalent to negative application of hashpower.*

0	1523033040	24	> Indeed, it is not a matter of a negative value for the coefficient gamma (γ) but a reversal of sign in terms of the benefit gamma is purported to bring to the selfish mining pool. I was expecting some crazy technobabble explanation on how a gamma value can go negative.  Instead you present this simple and reasonable comment that completely clears it up and makes Vitalik look like a rabid dog?  Well played.
1	1523035705	22	What you quote is very much technobabble.
2	1523037727	13	It's not technobabble, make an effort to understand. >In medicine for example we use negative probability for protection factors. In other words, when you consider risk factors such smoking, they are a risk factor because it increases your chances of contracting cardiovascular diseases. But if you measure the impact "jogging" has in increasing your cardiovascular risk, you find out that it actually decreases it hence the probability becomes negative.When you consider the impact of any activity X on the probability of Event E, if such activity decreases the probability of event E then you say that for such activity E is negative. Because if E on its own has a chance of occurring e times, and when you add activity X you get less outcomes than e, (e-k). Hence X's E is -k.If for a selfish mining pool that does not resort to strategy X the chance of winning over HM in a propagation race is 0.5. But when you add strategy X trying to maximise the odds the chances of winning go down to 0.3, then you say X has a negative gamma of -0.2.
2	1523067526	4	How are we defining "technobabble" here? Is it just a statement about a technical issue that's wordier or less clearly phrased than it could be? Because if so, then most of what CSW says on technical matters would qualify.But that's not my impression of the usage. My impression is that "technobabble" is a much bigger insult--akin to saying the person is just making shit up, spouting nonsense, like a writer for Star Trek creating lines for Geordi to explain why the warp drive won't start.So let's be clear about what we're accusing Wright of: is it being a BSer who spouts a bunch of nonsense in an attempt to bamboozle people into believing he has any idea what he's talking about (what Vitalik's comment seemed to imply), or are we just saying he's not great at communicating his ideas? If the latter, I think even CSW himself would likely agree. There's a world of difference between these two.

The equivalent would be if someone spouted bullshit claims about geography for half an hour and said all kinds of things, including "Tokyo is in America"; If you tried to demonstrate that I was bullshitting by picking out that particular point, some guy like the author of the post you're quoting could still turn up and say, "This listener is presumptuous and intellectually uncurious, because there are many people in America who love Tokyo, and Tokyo is in their hearts, so by extension Tokyo is in America", or "There is a Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, he must be referring to that".

The difference between a loose mesh structure and a complete graph means the difference between a Sybil attack hurting the network or just hurting the attacker. **It means the difference between a 0-confirmation transaction being viable after tens of seconds or tenths of seconds.** It means the difference between being able to partition the network by knocking out just a few nodes and not being able to partition the network even if you knock out all but a few nodes. Indeed, it means the difference between bigger blocks making Bitcoin easier to attack and **bigger blocks - even at the gigabyte and terabyte level - making Bitcoin harder to attack. Bitcoin Cash is the only blockchain that embraces the full implications of the all-to-all network topology driven by mining incentives, which when properly understood enable on-chain scaling at least 6 orders of magnitude greater than is conventionally thought possible, with superior decentralization, robustness, and security to boot.**

0	1523050665	2	You're missing this context, https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/02/craig-wright-bitcoin-founder-satoshi-nakamoto-claim> Wright, who was named as the cryptocurrency’s founder by two separate media investigations in December, made the admission in a blog post on Monday, *providing what he says is technical proof of his claim*.I suspect that, because you have been subject to a relentless campaign of smears and attacks, you may not be correctly interpreting the experience as it applies to others. VB pointing out who he thinks the bad-actors in this space are is a good thing. Failure to speak up is what allowed disasters like Blockstream or the DAO to happen. 
0	1523059962	2	Erm, question on the article.> Given the all-to-all topology, you can see that any zero-hashpower virtual nodes ("spy nodes") the selfish mining pool places near the honest mining nodes do nothing to alert the selfish miner any faster of any blocks the honest miner releases. is an assumption that breaks in the real world - the topology isn't all-to-all, that's precisely the point of spy nodes.

1	1523040009	3	Makes perfect sense. The total gamma for a selfish miner is the sum of the contributions to gamma by all the precautions he has taken. if any precaution has a negative effect on gamma then for that precaution gamma is negative. 
0	1523050976	2	Roger, How can you have "Negative" Miners working on the block. Is our community going to be anti-science? Please refer all your math questions to qualified individuals and not CSW. Deadalnix seems willing to engage you. Also, could you please speak out against CSW talking at technical conferences, It is embarrassing. 
0	1523034936	2	Vitalik was so out of line on this.
0	1523034967	1	If time between HM to all other miners is X and time between SM node to other miners is Y, even if Bitcoin is a near complete graph as assumed here (I would assert it is not) and X is faster, gamma is still 0 because X is the minimum I would think. 
0	1523035927	1	I don't disagree that CSW has been correct in most of what he has said. In fact, he is not only right, so is everyone in this situation. One day, the SM thing will have to be addressed, as we get more 3rd party mining companies that may even be competing against cryptocurrency. Today, however, is not that day. The miners we have are the HM that CSW speaks of. Consensus only comes with compromises. We have to decide what we need for BCH, today, before we work on tomorrow.CSW is making the first step and I appreciate him tweeting about it today. Silence is not an admission of defeat, but a show of strength for the entire community.
1	1523041235	1	SM will never happen, it is too uncertain. Uncertainty = riskSM is not a low risk event for the one who does it, as Emin tries to make it look on paper.Uncertainty:1) what will happen to the coin price?2) how will HM react?3) will I be blacklisted?No miner after investing millions in equipment wants to take such risk. Simple risk management.
2	1523042140	1	Agreed, 100%, we are not talking about today's miners. There is no way they would. It is the miners of tomorrow. After Visa/mc, banks and govs lose to btc they can easily buy out equipment or even mining pools from honest miners that want a way out. Those SMs could easily destroy bitcoin, at that point, and own the hardware to run their centralized digital currency replacement. This again, is not an issue NOW, and these groups will try every other, cheaper conceivable way, but as a conspiracy theorist, I see this one as the only one that might succeed. That is why ONE DAY we need to add some double spend proofs or work on some way for HM to react, better? Nobody seems to have a solution. So why all the debate? I'd rather trust humanity, now.
3	1523042526	3	yes, for example when I heard that russia is investing heavily in mining the first thing that came to my mind was a 51% attack. SM attack would require even less hashpower. I think this deserves more closure in the future but for now it's nothing to worry about. Also, if bitcoin as a network keeps growing it might become too expensive even for governments/banks to do any attack on the network. 
0	1523038310	1	We need to set up live debates more in the crypto community.
0	1523038915	1	Gamma is a ratio of the honest miners mining on top of the selfish miner block, lets say a/b. If both a and b are positive integers, there is no way that the fraction a/b can be negative.The yours article talking about the fact that the selfish miner doing the sybil will have a negative outcome as a result. This is ok to say if we read it as the same as saying that his rate of success will actually diminish, this is intuitively clear from a linguistics point of view, but it's not ok to say the actual variable gamma will be negative.

0	1523046183	-1	Craig is calling it negative gamma when he means something entirely different.  That's where the confusion comes in.   Vitalik is right to criticize him for it.  If he's not speaking with technical accuracy, he is speaking technobabble.  This post is basically just breaking down what Craig could've meant by negative gamma and justifies it because he knows what craig means.  Here in lies the problem.  Technical topics have no room for poor phrasing.   Craig is also to proud to correct himself at any point afterwards either.  Instead he doubles down on confusing terminology like "negative gamma".  That might make sense to people outside of academia, but to those who are educated on the matters the terminology he is using is confusing the discussion.  I think with technical topics most of all, the onus is on the communicator to get their ideas across accurately instead of creating a climate of doublespeak.  Literally HAS to mean literally in the technical world.  It can't mean figuratively or else progress grinds to a halt.  Metaphors and allegories have no place in technical texts.  
1	1523050256	3	what? he didn't say "i'm sorry, i don't quite understand what you meant by _negative gamma_ since that doesn't seem possible to me" he _called him names_ in the Q&A section of a _panel he wasn't even on_ :/
2	1523050711	2	I agree that VB could've been more polite and found a better avenue for it.   I'm not sure how that disregards my points though.
3	1523054944	1	uh well specifically it contradicts this point of yours> Vitalik is right to criticize him for it.which seems to imply that his criticism was somehow measured or appropriate
4	1523058024	1	Saying he could've criticized him better doesn't contradict that point.   The timing wasn't the best.  Nuance.  It's neat.  The world isn't black or white.  
1	1523050492	1	>  Craig is also to proud to correct himself at any point afterwards either.Like when he deleted the blog post where he claims to be Satoshi. That was proud.
2	1523050912	1	Has he ever made it unequivocally clear that he is not Satoshi since then?  Or is he just trying to sweep that under the rug?
0	1523051415	-1	Yes you're right, Vitalik just made a fool out of himself. It does not help when you have a fan base cheering no matter what you say.
0	1523054243	0	Where is the paper where Craig (supposedly) said gamma was negative? It's not linked from the linked Yours post, as far as I can tell.> The selfish mining pool would be foolish to throw in an extra hop and listen through that *necessarily* slower and less direct connection.This is misguided. The selfish mining paper doesn't suggest listening through an extra hop. Each extra node would already possess the hidden block and would by itself be able to publish it as soon as it sees another block. There is no extra hop involved. More nodes can't have a negative effect on gamma as they don't change any other node's ability to publish the hidden block as soon as it see a new block.
