0	1523149047	104	Except the majority of the posts removed are shadow removed, meaning they don't show up as [removed], they don't show at all. Only the user who posted the comment sees the comment.
1	1523150216	26	And people using ceddit.com [like for example](https://www.ceddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ajtxs/craig_s_wrights_mother_warns_about_the/)
2	1523152241	-51	This post was auto removed for providing a link to /r/BTC. Honestly the mods probably agree, Craig is not Satoshi. If anything it’s been [Roger Ver](https://i.redd.it/4ldo01roplsz.jpg) and /r/BTC allowing Craig to be taken seriously. Edit: I got rid of the word “platform” because it made a couple BCH supporters alarms go off. My post has never said anything about trying to prevent Craig from speaking.
3	1523154252	51	**EDIT**: Troll /u/Spartacus_Nakamoto edited his post. He originally questioned "Why r/btc gives csw a platform". He edited it to make it seem like he isn't a troll, after I called him out.But he's still a troll, just a slimy troll who edits his posts deceptively. ***Thank you for a great example of a non-sequitur argument. With a dash of statist censorship and censorship thrown in. You seem to be arguing, "Why is that bad person allowed to speak? Shut. It. Down. DEPLATFORM!" But nobody's buying it. Go troll somewhere else. Free speech means even lying, bad, no good people like you and CSW are allowed to speak. Sorry, but EVERYONE gets a platform, even people you don't like.I'm personally not a fan of CSW, but to silence or deplatform someone? That's fascism. Go back to your safe space.
4	1523169116	14	You.  I like your hostility.  Not everyone can be angry and coherent at the same time.
4	1523157441	5	I think he meant that this sub legitimizes CSW by supporting him.  Roger and other mods constantly defend CSW in this sub.  That's great that he's allowed to participate here without censorship but you can't ignore the fact that he has a lot of support here, from regular folks and especially the mods.

4	1523155298	-2	>You seem to be arguing, "Why is that bad person allowed to speak? Shut. It. Down. DEPLATFORM!"I never said Craig shouldn’t be allowed to speak. I’m saying if you’re listening to him you are probably retarded. Cheers.
5	1523181979	7	> I never said Craig shouldn’t be allowed to speak.Then why did you edit your reply above, removing the part about "allowing CSW a platform on r/btc" ??That was sneaky!
6	1523196066	-3	Again, never said he shouldn’t be aloud to speak. I said many on /r/btc have been dumb enough to listen to him. Subtle difference. Edit: changed allowed to aloud to see if anyone will ignore my point and focus on my grammar.
7	1523196998	1	"allowed." learn English please 
4	1523155469	-10	If everyone gets a platform, how come they ban record numbers of users in this sub every single day?
3	1523171014	4	> This post was auto removed for providing a link to /r/BTC. And you don't find it odd that you can't create a hyperlink on the internet to an uncensored forum? And... doing so is cause for removal!And... they have an automated system to remove multiple keywords! I find that odd, you don't?

0	1523152336	22	okay this shit is funny, i hate most of the meme shit on here but you've done well OP
0	1523149401	18	Banned Me for making a comment about everyone being stuck driving 10 year old Lamborghinis
1	1523153864	8	I mean, those are still pretty expensive.
2	1523162921	5	Imagine the maintenance
3	1523166495	2	The more modern lambos actually aren't terrible; they're reasonably reliable (especially for an audi ;) ). Most people who own one barely drive it so the maintenance really isn't too bad. 
3	1523179109	2	I'll take the jiffy lube special please
0	1523158350	6	Comedy gold.
0	1523159251	5	Haha
0	1523177353	2	can someone link the video that this meme is from?
0	1523150871	3	Haha
0	1523176854	1	Lately that place is overrun by trolls and the mods don't do shit about it, guess you all hurt their feelings
0	1523193486	1	what is this meme?
0	1523203996	1	Its important you mention censorship since this sub bans and censors more people than any crypto sub I've ever been in. Keep circle jerking the hypocricy though.
0	1523204830	1	Yeah... That was a bad one.

1	1523209536	1	A general crypto with low fees is more likely to take this role
0	1523161126	-1	Don't make this a meme sub
1	1523200306	2	There's room for everything. Except censorship.
1	1523190782	2	Please find something actually worthwhile to complain about. Thanks.
0	1523150691	0	is an interesting cryptocurrency the detail is that all your new information in most cases is in English
1	1523159085	0	I've often wondered how much info I have been missing out on due to not knowing many languages.
2	1523169536	4	bro i feel like you responded to nonsense 
3	1523195079	1	Could be. I was presuming a major language barrier and the essence was lost in translation.But maybe it was nonsense.
0	1523155875	-4	Who benefits? What is potential, vs, what is obvious? I'm not familiar enough to even fathom an answer. Anyone? 
1	1523169583	4	bot.....?
0	1523159067	-9	Here would be downvote censoring. I never had a post getting positive score actually. 
1	1523159082	16	Redditor /u/yogibreakdance has low karma in this subreddit.
1	1523164850	14	Downvoting is not censoring.  It's how reddit works.
2	1523166985	-5	Reddit also works by allowing mods to remove comments. Your logic doesn't check out here.
3	1523172252	8	You are describing how censorship works. These moderation practices don't cope with a community that stands for a permissionless and censorship-resistant participation. Your point is hypocritical.
4	1523188683	0	> You are describing how censorship worksYes I am. Also, I'm describing how Reddit works.Also Reddit doesn't show posts (automatically) below a certain downvote threshold. This is another form of censorship, and both are part of how Reddit works.This is true, whether it not it's working your idealogicall beliefs about what Reddit stands for.
5	1523188924	3	You must admit that posts don't get removed and anyone can display that information if necessary at any given time.One can also select to display those "hidden messages" explicit. Choose to order posts by 'controversial' and those posts will show on top.Sure the space on a computer screen is limited. One can't display all messages at once.
6	1523199392	1	Sure. In the same way one can't visit creddit.com.
1	1523190900	2	Your entire mentality is twisted and weird dude. You’re complaining that you haven’t had a positive vote count in a place where you constantly say shit that people disagree with? Do you not understand how life works?  Try going outside sometime and see how that plays out in the real world. Say something that people don’t like. See if you get positive reactions. Do you live in a basement with the door locked all day?
2	1523191897	1	Same goes when you visit the main sub, try to pump alts, then get deleted 
1	1523177934	0	Have ya tried not being a dick? :)
0	1523167584	-1	hahahahahah
