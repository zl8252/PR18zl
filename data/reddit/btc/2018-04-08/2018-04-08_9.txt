1	1523130639	13	He's probably having an awesome [space bag party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkDBlWsHblI) right now.
2	1523151777	3	the fuck
1	1523146450	5	To buck Chuck, no doubt. Inside a cardboard box on the side of a road. Hopefully, that is.
1	1523169688	2	baux wine.
1	1523178561	1	Drinking grape juice.
0	1523125704	54	At some point he's going to have to start advocating to reduce the blocksize lol
1	1523125844	35	he leaves that part to his lacky, /u/Luke-Jr
2	1523132925	26	u/luke-jr when are you going to decrease the blocksize limit? We're getting upset over here that we can't drink champaign.
3	1523167738	9	>u/luke-jr when are you going to decrease the blocksize limit? Isn't now actually the perfect time to reduce block size? After all fees are getting periously low.  It would be an easy, low risk soft fork; and is consistent with the goal of increased Segwit adoption and security through a strong feeling market.
4	1523168484	7	Luke, as you can see from concerns like this about the death  of the fee market,  r/BTC is behind you if you want to decrease the blocksize limit. We'll even spin up a node army to show our support. Just give notice.
3	1523173360	1	Well it's up to the miners to do it, it's a configurable parameter.
4	1523174210	3	Core officially including a 300 kb blocksize limit in their reference client would make miners significantly more likely to adopt such a change. All the bullying tactics and subterfuge that have been used so successfully up until now to force miners to do Core's bidding can be continued. Maybe try the Segwit2x trick again. Tell the miners to run the new code with the 300 kb limit temporarily as additional protection against spam on the condition that in a few months they'll code up a new update to Core that includes 2 MB blocks. Then once they get what they want they just don't give people the 2MB blocks and no one has anymore bargaining chips to upset the status quo.
5	1523180593	1	Nice blogpost
3	1523150826	-9	u/luke-jr how come you don't have any teeth? Is brushing teeth punishable by eternal torment in hell or something? ROFL loony toons
4	1523155574	14	Let us not resort to personal attacks, but focus on cryptocurrency's liberating potential.
5	1523159315	3	Wait till you've had one of these crazies wrong you, they're actually psychopaths and this one is no different from the others (although others tend to take personal hygiene into consideration on a day-to-day basis). They take the literal meaning of 'jesus forgiving all sins' and as a consequence feel no guilt or remorse for any action they do. 
5	1523183897	1	Here here
5	1523158273	0	Have you seen the state of those men though? I think we have time for both. 
4	1523151093	-3	Proof of gum disease. New consensus mechanism.
1	1523148192	5	Yeah, if demand for Bitcoin tx is only half of what is used to be then there really is not reason to use Lightning Network. So how does Bitcoin Core fix this? Well they lower the blocksize. Then the demand is full again! Or at least it will look like it is. Fees go up again and then people need the Lightning Network again.Eventually it will take them about 10 years but I think they can decentralize the shit out of Bitcoin until the code allows for one tx per block.  Luckily by that time nobody will give a shit about Bitcoin Core anymore because it's batshit insane and then the Core developers have all the room in the blocks themselves for that one tx per 10 minutes. It will go something like this:*Luke Dashjr: Oh, it' my turn. I have just send you a  tx!* Greg Maxwell: Oh wait ... wait ... wait ... wait  .... yes I got 36 confirmations. Your tx is almost secure now Luke-jr. Wait .... wait .... wait ... yes 100 confirmations. We are half way there! Ah ..... 200 confirmations. I got your tx, Luke. I really got it. Man this technology is so ground breaking revolutionary, .... euh Luke are you still there?*Luke Dashjr: Grhmgfggf, huh what? Oh sorry, I think I fell asleep. Yeah Greg, this stuff is an amazing science experiment. So much good data and nice code puzzles. And then to imagine that the plebs almost got their hands on this technology. While it's obsiouly waaaaaaay to early for that. It's only been 10 years since we rewrote the white paper!*Greg Maxwell: Way to early indeed, my catholic friend. I can't believe this stuff really works. So awesome. Just a moment and I going to grab the champagne to celebrate this tx of yours. *Luke Dashjr:  Did you buy it with Bitcoin? Hahahaha*Greg Maxwell: Hahahah, good one. No of course not. Who buys stuff with Bitcoin?  Hey what is that smell? GODDAMMIT MY MONERO GPU MINERS ARE ON FIRE!!!!! [JIHAN-WU!!!!!!!](https://youtu.be/ME_dcgEiCl4?t=51)
2	1523151227	-2	Luke: no no, that's the smell of my gums. Nothing to see here.
0	1523130329	31	He's feeling the paign
0	1523125903	14	somebody over there in N Corea needs to start celebrating fee volatility.
0	1523127926	21	I thought Greg had graduated from Bitcoin and moved on in his career.
1	1523129861	33	BTC done. Time to ruin Monero. 
2	1523131684	19	Just like he tried to do to Wikipedia.
1	1523149452	5	He has a good sixth sense for detecting a sinking ships. Just like Charlie Lee. 
1	1523151788	6	It's time for him to find the next big open project that people are passionate about for idealistic reasons, so he can infiltrate it and make their lives a living hell.Possibly something to do with VR or life extension at this point? His formula might not be so easy anymore, because there are other Core fuckfaces that are beating him to punch at scamming other idealistic communities.
0	1523130288	7	Living the high life after his $24k "shampain" pump and dump.  Remember he got paid in BTC all those years at Blockstream.  You bet he waited for the fruits of the "fee market".  Now the rest of the "store of value" holders have something worth 25% as much.  Go store of value ;-)

0	1523135949	6	He should lower the block size as Loonie Luke advised.
0	1523128540	10	u/champaignr toast "Blocking the Stream"
1	1523128545	15	*A handsome bot appears wearing a Blockstream t-shirt and a red hat that says #NOTX. He uncorks a suspicious looking bottle of sparkling wine with a label that says "Dom Perignon Champaign" written in crayon. He pours cryptorebel and H0dl each a glass of champaign and hands it to them.*Monsieur u/cryptorebel et monsieur u/H0dl, a toast if you will, to "Blocking the Stream".*Glasses clink* 
0	1523133088	5	Claiming that this was his plan all along. It's always champaign time when you're a narcissistic sociopath.
0	1523131583	8	Who cares?
0	1523128769	6	Soon Maxwell will be the guy with the [champaign cup hat on the sidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3hug5g/maxwell_likens_the_bitcoin_xt_crew_to_a_guy/), irrelevent, as the real Bitcoin-BCH goes on to bring economic freedom world wide.

1	1523154669	1	Probably just switched to his sockpuppet accounts instead.
2	1523156759	1	I think his goal was champaign and the GTFO.
0	1523138981	2	From popping to pooping ...
0	1523155689	2	samson was proud of low fees in the last interview. Blockstream is kinda confusing
0	1523175587	2	> So if Greg was popping champaign at $55 fees in December, what's he doing now with fees at $0.20?maybe he wasnt?
1	1523175609	1	Redditor /u/slashfromgunsnroses has low karma in this subreddit.
0	1523126566	6	Probably indifferent, while thinking "that was interesting, people were willing to pay fees higher than the block reward, showing that this system *can* eventually become self sustaining once the block rewards cease".
1	1523128431	8	That was never a concern with global adoption and just sub-cent fees, according to [one analysis](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html). Maybe Satoshi was right?
0	1523145566	3	Heâ€™s crying into his wine glass and drinking the tears 
0	1523128698	2	Preparing the noose?
0	1523147862	1	Cider? 
0	1523158343	1	Hopefully that psychopath is dying of a terminal illness. 
0	1523145160	-5	Was he celebrating $55 fees? Read the full post..Greg writes "Personally, I'm pulling out the champaign that market behaviour isindeed producing activity levels that can pay for security withoutinflation, and also producing fee paying backlogs needed to stabilizeconsensus progress as the subsidy declines.I'd also personally prefer to pay lower fees-- current levels evenchallenge my old comparison with wire transfer costs-- but we shouldlook most strongly at difficult to forge market signals rather thanjust claims-- segwit usage gives us a pretty good indicator since mostusers would get a 50-70% fee reduction without even considering thesecond order effects from increased capacity.As Jameson Lopp notes, more can be done for education though-- perhapsthat market signal isn't efficient yet. But we should get it there.But even independently of segwit we can also look at other inefficienttransaction styles: uncompressed keys, unconfirmed chaining instead ofsend many batching, fee overpayment, etc... and the message there issimilar.I've also seen some evidence that a portion of the current high ratecongestion is contrived traffic. To the extent that it's true therealso should be some relief there soon as the funding for that runsout, in addition to expected traffic patterns, difficulty changes,etc."End Quote.Keep in mind at this point, the date in which Greg made this post no one knew the mempool congestion was going to last as long as it did. Its also worthwhile noting that Greg thought much of that congestion was caused by bad actors and the high fees would soon put a stop to that.
1	1523152947	10	TLDR he saw $55 fees and said "This is actually a good thing you guys because reasons." When he should have said "Holy fuck this is a massive failure. We should have done more to remediate this situation. Here's what we need to do to make sure this never happens again." That he opted for the former approach rather than the latter approach is disastrous because it guarantees more such fee events. We are mocking him for what he said because he deserves to be mocked.
2	1523153445	-2	Gregs comments were taking out of context, the thread where he made those comments needs to be read in full.  The spin doctors in this space love to take 'snippets' of what people say and turn them around and use them to their advantage, its what dishonest and malicious people do.
3	1523153667	6	Please tell me you are kidding. This is all short hand for the fact that Greg wants high fees on the BTC network. 
3	1523154054	4	I have read the thread in full multiple times. My TLDR stands. Greg was explaining how high fees are actually a good thing because when the block reward subsidy goes away we will need people to pay at least that high of fees to do on-chain transactions. His interpretation of December's fee event was:1. This proves my idea to make on-chain transactions super expensive and permanently congested can work.2. The market doesn't really mind paying such high fees obviously. If they did more people would use Segwit.3. The traffic is fake anyway.Nowhere in here did he acknowledge what a failure it was for Bitcoin Core to have allowed the fees to go this high. Tech companies employ people with pagers and have them work round the clock to make sure that there are no availability drops as severe as what we saw in December. Any representative from say Google who commented something like "It was actually a good thing that Google was down for a month because \*insert convoluted doublethink\*. We will be taking no steps to prevent this from happening again." Would likely be fired immediately. If only Bitcoin could have fired Greg years ago.
4	1523173188	2	Indeed. To quote an exchange between Gavin and Greg 2 years ago:Gavin:> Apparently, in spite of ample evidence, you STILL don't agree that the biggest thing to worry about right now is transactions becoming unreliable and vulnerable to nuisance spam attacks, users becoming disgusted, and innovators deciding to stay away from a dysfunctional project that can't even agree to a simple capacity increase.> > Or, in other words, I believe those very short-term problems are critical-- utxo growth is NOT a critical problem right now.[Greg](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3vxv92/peter_wuille_deer_caught_in_the_headlights/cxxfqsj/):> That none of those doomy outcomes that you and mike predicted, even after tremendous spam attacks started.> > And no, I don't think that transaction fees mattering is a failing-- it's success! This is specifically the design of the system, and all sorts of broken corner cases go away when there is a real transaction fee backlog. 
4	1523154778	2	Thats not what I interpreted from the conversation, but you have your opinion and I have mine.
3	1523158825	0	I agree with you, but I think that people are justified in painting the guy in a negative light.  He has done far more harm to bitcoin than good, and people are justifiably attacking him.  They may be misplacing the attack points to focus on stupid soundbites which may or may not be applicable, but I don't blame anyone by him.  Still I agree with you, this is stupid.  
4	1523159586	2	But what harm has he done.. I don't see it. Sure he is outspoken, can be arrogant but he is also a brilliant guy.
5	1523168881	3	I think his arrogance blinded him to the fact that what he was pushing was reducing the significance of free markets in bitcoin.  He put his own beliefs above everything else despite some pretty clear indications that he was wrong.   What we have now is a system in which the market has no control over what capacity the system can handle.  It is obvious that a balance between the interests of miners and the interests of the small players should have been sought out, and that a non-human guideline should have been followed.  Ideas were floated which would have automatically increased block sizes according to some schedule which would have been outside of the influence of any human.  There were many other ideas as well.  But Greg championed a single idea which he believed in above all.  And he refused to compromise.  His brilliance carries with it the power to do incredibly bad things if his ego drives him, and that is what has happened. 
6	1523178585	1	I think it's fair to say that Greg was/is outspoken, assertive and sometimes pigheaded. But changes to the Bitcoin protocol did not rest solely on the whims of Greg, so I think his influence is often overstated.  I truly believe that Greg's intentions has always been to help make a better Bitcoin. I have read most of his posts and whilst some of them have made me cringe from time to time, overall he makes sense and I think had the right idea about scaling and creating a fee market.  However, I now believe a moderate block size increase is needed, but nothing too radical. The power you speak of was never really there, and to blame Greg for 1MB blocks and whatever else is unfair and inaccurate
5	1523163104	2	He is probably the biggest reason BTC still has a 1MB blocksize limit.
6	1523179588	1	He was always in favour of keeping the block size small enough to create a fee market, but also said that limit will need to be increased at some point.  But Greg was not the reason why 1MB was retained.
7	1523183709	1	>but also said that limit will need to be increased at some point.Find me one quote where Greg has ever said this. I've seen only quotes where he has said he doesn't think the blocksize limit needs to be increased ever from 1 MB.
8	1523187115	1	Greg said "Perhaps the proper maximum size isn't 1MB but some other value which is also modest and still preserves decentralization"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=140233.0If you have the time its worthwhile to read that thread from start to finish, there are some very interesting viewpoints and many of them come from some well known core devs
1	1523153524	1	facepalm
0	1523134858	-7	Probably writing code
1	1523142527	4	Yeah, probably writing code to destroy some other open source project, for sure.
2	1523144469	-12	Alright, I'm drunk and normally I try to treat you bch folks with kids gloves to hopefully convince some of you just how misled you've been... But seriously. Maxwell writes good solid code. If you ever EVER actually did anything in this crypto world you would know that. All you sons of bitches can keep fucking posting and talking and doing fucking nothing and he'll keep writing shit to help us all.Fuck you guys for the blockstream propaganda. They mean well and are doing their fucking best for this world. There's no evidence otherwise
3	1523152683	3	You could assemble a team of the greatest coders in the world and if they were forced to adhere to Bitcoin Core's road-map they would be hamstrung into producing a subpar product.
3	1523152436	1	Ooooooooookay Greg.https://i.imgur.com/lftkunA.jpg
3	1523153561	1	Keep drinking loser. 
0	1523144493	-9	This whole Greg Maxwell popping champers nonsense is ridiculous, his comments were taken out of context and then used to attack Greg. He also said he would personally like to see much lower fees, what he was celebrating was market forces working, thats all. 
1	1523151464	1	"Shut up 1 Meg Greg" - Peter Griffen
2	1523153752	3	Well, Greg's comments are out of context, but our friend here is missing the even bigger picture that fuck face Greg did this all on purpose when his only job was to steadily raise the block size.
