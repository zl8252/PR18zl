0	1523126944	87	With LN, BTC and LTC are restarting merchant adoption from 0. All these years getting adoption are being thrown out the door for Blockstream's potential gains. It is fucking disgusting what is happening. 
1	1523127275	32	I agree. It's hard not to support something when you get 15x gains in one year. And it's not surprising. When there's money involved, there's economic incentive to take it over. Game theory 101.Blockstream did a great job at advertising their best intentions and it worked. When you have money to throw around to push an agenda, you're going to be able to convince the masses. A centralized marketing initiative is usually going to beat out a decentralized marketing initiative until the latter gets enough support.I hope Bitcoin Cash remains vigilant and continues their progress. Otherwise, it's no different than a bank and this experiment has failed.
2	1523127457	8	Absolutly. 
2	1523174378	1	Game theory??
3	1523199003	1	Everything boils down to game theory and psychology lol
1	1523147109	6	I've never seen it so simply put. Wow. 
1	1523132284	11	>With LN, BTC and LTC are restarting merchant adoption from 0. All these years getting adoption are being thrown out the door for Blockstream's potential gains. >It is fucking disgusting what is happening. Suddenly it makes sense why the weight calculation has been designed that way.. it enormously favor sidechain tx (typically large multisig tx)..How awesome it is to have a discount directly written in the protocol to access your products!!But not only.. I have read blockstream will reactivate op_code in their proprietary sidechain..Fuck.. it is just like they have taylored bitcoin protocol to fit their business case..Kinda impressive I would say..I am soooo glad we fork back to the original experiment..
1	1523139279	5	> With LN, BTC and LTC are restarting merchant adoption from 0.Never thought about that in this way, but I agree.
1	1523136259	3	Why do you seem to think that transactions will be done exclusively on LN by merchants and their customers suddenly ("adoption from 0")? All the merchants currently accepting Bitcoin (through third parties or not) will still be able to use on-chain settlement as long as they find it useful. Merchants which could benefit from supporting LN payments/invoices in addition of direct Bitcoin payments won't be too hard to convince if the benefits of the system outweigh the setup costs. Their customers will demand it too, to minimize their fees. The binary perspective some people display in this sub is really weird sometimes.
2	1523136382	13	Because I have seen what fees look like during high activity on BTC (late 2017) and no way in hell is that a reasonable way to pay for shit. Even current fees are pretty high for small purchases. 
3	1523138045	2	Still doesn't make merchant adoption start "from 0" as you claim, that is what I was criticizing. We both agree that high fees will make merchants wary of accepting Bitcoin, this is why a solution that preserves the current level of decentralization, preserves the current possibility of on-chain settlement (at a cost ruled by a free fee market) and incentivizes the move of a part of the transactions progressively off-chain is currently being implemented. Whether this will work is obviously to be determined, but it does not invalidates the adoption Bitcoin already achieved over the years, this is why your statement is confusing to me.The funny thing is that few months ago, before Bitpay had decided to support BCH, I could have claimed that Bitcoin Cash was "starting adoption from 0" to try to make it sound bad and it would have been a more accurate statement than yours... so I really do not understand why you are making this statement about Bitcoin's adoption now.
4	1523139954	14	Because LN is pushed as the holy grail to make BTC usable. It is NOT very usable in its current state and is only "cheap" to tranact with due to low tx volume. When the bottleneck gets hit next time, high fees again. In a sense BTC gave up on all usecases for small and medium sized commerce and now we are waiting for LN to take over that and bring low fees and usability. LN has only a handful of merchants currently and is not user friendly. This is why it feels like its starting from scratch. BCH would have been in the same boat if the plan was to wait on a magical L2 solution when it forked. For merchants to accept BCH was/is much easier than to accept LN. Also many service providers were there before the fork and decided to implement BCH to facilitate some business that was lost due to BTC fees and unreliability. 
5	1523142943	3	> Because LN is pushed as the holy grail to make BTC usable.That's what I meant by binary perspective, it can apply to both subs apparently if this is what you feel is the general sentiment of LN supporters.People who claim that LN will be the only way to make BTC usable are delusional. It is a way to alleviate the pressure on the network caused by small and numerous transactions which do not really have to rely on instant on-chain settlement (but still could if necessary, for example if one of the party seems dishonest) and can be settled at a later time to take advantage of lower fees. LN also facilitates other features such as atomic swaps for example, even if it helped only in this area it would mean a lot for the whole cryptocurrencies ecosystem. Based on this, hating on it makes no sense technologically, as much as praising it as a be-all and end-all solution to scaling.I hold the exact same opinion on people who believe block size will never be increased on Bitcoin, excluding this possibility is so limiting. It makes no sense and when doing it will not imply massive long term trade offs for decentralization, it will be possible to achieve it if people do not entrench themselves in such absolutists positions ("I want TB/unlimited blocksize" / "Blocksize should never be upgraded or should be lowered"). If nobody calls out people making these claims it will be become harder and harder to get social consensus on this issue when necessary. Sorry if I went a bit on a tangent but I felt like this was kinda related as I keep seeing people with such absolute/extreme views on both sides of the debate and this wasn't specifically pointing at you.
6	1523165510	3	> hating on it makes no sense technologically, as much as praising it as a be-all and end-all solution to scaling.You still don't get it. Nobody hates LN. We hate being *forced* to transact on LN. because of that ridiculous bullshit limit of less than a half million txs per day. 
0	1523129718	25	Charlie Lee also did the same scam on Litecoin as the HK agreement, and the phony New York Agreement where they promised a blocksize increase if they got segwit, but then once segwit was implemented they went back on their word.  [Here is proof Charlie Lee went back on his word after segwit was implemented, and decided he would not support blocksize increase on LTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7iqoa4/reminder_charlie_lee_broke_his_agreement_with/).
1	1523129979	10	Yeah realize he's also just trying to make Bitcoin dependent on Litecoin because that's the only way it will create value.His whole purpose of creating it was so bitcoin can focus on larger transactions and litecoin can be smaller. When fees weren't an issue then and they shouldn't be now. Who knows, by 2140, there will likely be a better way to incentivize miners. There doesn't need to be two coins. 
2	1523130125	6	Yeah I used to support Litecoin, and it had a chance to support blocksize increases and on-chain scaling and it could have been an important currency.  But instead Charlie Lee ruined it. And what really annoys me even more is then he dumped all his coins after he ruined the chain with segwit. Now I think it has no chance to catch up to the main Bitcoin ledger, this is why BCH already has higher market cap.  I think BCH is more powerful as a cash currency because [of the power of the ledger](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68jja0/dont_forget_money_and_bitcoin_are_just_a_ledger/dgyysp0/).
2	1523178186	2	Looks like the LTC community finally brought down Charlie from the pedestal now that it costs too much to them.
1	1523145381	-1	The agreement was specifically worded for a reason. Even if Charlie went 100&#37; for a hard fork, none of the other Litecoin Core developers would agree with him.
2	1523145517	5	Well look at all of that market cap on BCH, you could have captured it on Litecoin, but you spit in the communities face and threw it all away, and now LTC will never be anything important.
0	1523141689	11	Hi, I'm a mod on r/Litecoin. This comment is not going to be replying to your post directly. However, I did take a look at your post and it seems to have been removed by automod. I've approved the post now.I'm not sure what caused automod to remove your post.
1	1523142708	3	Me either!
2	1523143262	5	So I think it might be because you account is very new \(less than a day old right\)? Automod is configured to require posts for manual approval for new accounts as most very new accounts tend to be spam posts.
3	1523147024	4	Yeah was just surprised because most subs inform you when your post is removed and why.
0	1523133966	8	Awesome, logical post. A lot of your same thought process is what brought me to BCH.I don’t think you’ll be censored in this subreddit, this is no where near some of the shitposts I’ve seen fly here.
0	1523127039	33	Good post.  Btw, malleability was never really a "bug" and Segwit doesn't even really "fix" it since you dont have to use Segwit.  BCH is doing fine with no segwit, no LN, no mal fix, just good ol Bitcoin ;)
1	1523127583	15	I agree. I used to bash Ver and Jihan like the rest of them. You see some of the videos of Ver's temperament, and see some past examples of him using his power for bad (the one case that's thrown around where he threatened to dox someone for not giving him back bitcoin).But who cares? No one is perfect. Everyone has skeletons in their closet, but most people easily cast judgment on others because it makes them feel better. I'm no longer concerned about being right. I'm concerned about the truth.
2	1523140424	8	> I agree. I used to bash Ver and Jihan like the rest of them.You might read the following very interesting guide, which I posted here yesterday:https://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htmIt' called "The Gentleperson's Guide to Forum Spies", or how government bodies are controlling / disharming activists in among others social media. After reading this, it seems clear to me that Roger is being set up by TPTB as a de-facto leader so that he can be thrown down from his fabricated leader position and by his failure also associate that failure to Bitcoin Cash.Some of the points in the article read like a textbook description of our resident trolls.So, yes, you most likely have been manipulated to bash Roger (and others).
2	1523131363	6	...and in the case of Ver doxing, that was entirely because the other one decided to be a deuce about it. Not particularly smart when Ver did him a favor by lending him some money back when he was in a hard place.
3	1523131837	6	Yeah, people don't see the whole picture though.
2	1523178265	1	Only communities outside of bch post and talk about Ver and Jihan, they get all their publicity in the alt subs...
1	1523132191	3	> no mal fixBitcoin Cash does fix 3rd party malleability though? 
2	1523132392	4	partially
2	1523141682	4	https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7hqt7k/transaction_malleability_reference_post/
3	1523141806	3	Good post and the top comment is also great.
2	1523179585	2	3rd party malleability was fixed in November.There's a proposal to fix it entirely on the slate, possibly for the November fork.
0	1523126214	15	I liked it very much. Thank you for sharing your discoveries. I hope you continue to do so. u/tippr $.42
1	1523126584	17	Thanks. My main purpose for investing in cryptocurrency is for people that can't afford the banking system or have unstable currencies. Bitcoin Core and Litecoin have lost sight of that in my mind. Unfortunately, most people don't know or don't care about the differences, so Bitcoin Core will still dominate the market for a while.I just find it ironic that most people stated increasing block size was kicking the rock down the road, yet are the first to remind you LN is still in early development. When something is wrong with a system, you release patches to fix it and THEN think about long term solutions. LN was rushed. The fact I can't post this on /r/Bitcoin or /r/Litecoin says something.I don't care about ICO's. I think blockchain has some interesting business use cases, but that isn't why I invest either. 
2	1523182256	2	Exactly.You can argue about scalability all day long - but if there are problems with on-chain scaling it's not at 8MB blocks, or 32MB blocks, it's way further down the line.  So you would expect the logical thing for core to have done is increase the blocksize a small amount for now, until LN / layer 2 solutions were ready.  It's hard to understand why they would jeopardise adoption/growth by risking the system grinding to a halt before their scaling solution was ready.

0	1523131895	5	Great post..If I Have to make a comment on “running your full node to be 100% sure you don’t follow the wrong chain or rely on trust”Well segwit taught us that you can build upgrades in a way that “cheap” old nodes into thinking the follow the proper chain (because they cannot see the whole set of data).How crazy is that? Specially coming from a community that keep saying you have to run your own nodes to be 100% trustless... IMO this is crazy, it is just another form of central banking.. whatever the central bankers do my nodes has to accept because even if I disagree the upgrade will be made in a way that my node cannot detect...W T fucking F!!Ps: make it a yours.org post quality content get rewards.
1	1523132096	5	Not really interested in getting rewards. Not why I made the post. I plan on doing some analytical work in the future to build my machine learning portfolio.  When I do a deeper dive and start doing actual analyses that take time, I'll post on sites where people can donate to my efforts. I don't want people donating based on my opinion.
2	1523132747	3	I can relate.though your.org is an interesting project, you might be interested to look at it.
3	1523132952	3	I remember it from Litecoin. When it first launched, Ryan announced he was switching to Litecoin because Bitcoin fees were too high. Then I remember it having a rough launch and then never hearing about it again. Glad Bitcoin Cash picked up the reins.
1	1523165004	2	Can you help me understand your point about segwit? Thanks 
2	1523180181	2	Segwit upgrade should have break consensus and be an HF.The way segwit was implemented as a SF was by « hiding data » to old node that would otherwise reject the chain.Those old nodes end following a chain they cannot verify/see all rules.Running a node is supposed to be the only way to fully audit the chain without trust.With the segwit trick you break that..
0	1523135782	7	If you stepped back, did your own research, and stepped forward thinking differently then you are an exceptional person. One thing is saying DYOR, but it takes a lot of effort to actually do it👏.Although I'm a late joiner of rbtc, I guess most users here can easily agree with what you wrote and have always thought that way. The danger is creating another bubble (also called echo chamber) but contrarians, people that feel comfortable thinking differently, ate very aware of that phenomenon.
1	1523136153	4	Right. Another reason I haven't used Yours.org. Since it only accepts bitcoin cash right now, it naturally draws in people that support bitcoin cash. Although it's decentralized, it's still has bias.The hardest part is standing up for your beliefs and constantly reevaluating your beliefs. It takes time and effort. It's much easier to google a counter argument and link to it as evidence than you're right rather than figuring out why they think differently in the first place.
0	1523140893	5	> Why does one have to be like gold and why does one have to be like silver?I never quite understood the *silver to Bitcoin's gold* thing. As physical currencies, silver makes sense. Very small amounts of gold are impractical as coins. Hence, silver coins are useful for smaller purchases as they are still big enough to handle at lower values.  Bitcoin is virtual and highly divisible. You can just as easily deal with 0.00001 BTC as with 1 BTC.  There is no reason to use a lower-value coin when fractions get very small. The only reason Litecoin got more popular was  the congestion of Bitcoin that resulted in ever higher fees.  And at the time, Litecoin was the closest thing next to Bitcoin.
0	1523144644	5	We don’t censor here, dude. I know it can sure seem like it after encountering this behavior on all these other subs. Welcome. You at last found a place to discuss freely.
1	1523147523	1	Yeah, they ended up accepting my post. Just didn't get a flag saying why it wasn't accepted and took a litecoin mod to see this post and manually accept it. 
0	1523131547	10	I hear you. I got into BTC around 2015 by a little and started to educate myself about it and followed what happened. I was totally in chock the moment the Blockstream guys and proment core figures refused the 2X part of the Segwit2x compromise. It seemed so incredibly stupid to me, that I just decided to flat out support the BCH fork when it came into fruition.
0	1523136269	5	Thanks for the post. Litecoin was my first "alt"coin, and I thought it was superior to BTC due to the faster block times. Then it became pretty clear that the community was going in the same path as BTC for scaling via LN.If you extrapolate to the future... If LN perfectly succeeds, block time will be quite irrelevant. Also, dealing with multiple currencies is slightly annoying, so wouldn't people just trend toward one of the two? Odds are against LTC in that case. Thus, it seems that the development path for LTC is *likely irrelevancy if all goes to plan*. Why would someone accept a less commonly used crypto if the transaction method is identical to that of a more commonly used one?
1	1523137073	6	That's why they are pushing the narrative of silver to gold and telling people bitcoin will always have higher fees than litecoin so bitcoin will be used for larger transactions and litecoin will be used for every day purchases. Bitcoin Cash proved you can be both. We won't really know until use picks back up again.
0	1523136598	5	> I took a few months off of social media and spent time reading about the technology to create own opinions rather than relying on others to tell me what's correct. .Did you really just take a picture of your bookcase? lol
1	1523136773	6	Lol yup! Want to prove I did research!
0	1523133535	7	An interesting thing about /r/Litecoin is that my post was removed without notifying me. I had to go into the "new posts" to see if my post was visible, which it wasn't. Probably due to the lack of an auto_mod script, but still don't see anything where I broke the rules. 
0	1523140152	2	tl;dr - the Litecoin sub became an echo chamber much like its "father".So I guess I have no use for LTC now, much like BTC. All that's left for me besides BCH now is ETH, I hope.
1	1523188421	1	ETH community is even worse. They worship Vitalik like their god. They should rename to it cryptoreligion
0	1523127565	3	Good post but I have to ask, how were you an active member of r/litecoin when your reddit account is only 6 days old? Did you use another account? What happened to it?
1	1523127929	14	I mentioned in the post I created a new account to remain pseudonymous. I was active using my original reddit account which contained my last name. Someone disagreed with me, doxxed me, and so I deleted that account. Used that one from 2010 - mid 2017.Then I had another account for a few months that I posted on and deleted it when I decided to take a 3 month haitus from social media to do some research. It's crazy how dependent you can get on getting fake internet points. You start aligning your views with others so you will get more points. That's why most of top reddit content are reposts and inside jokes. You have to parse through a lot of shit in order to find something notable. 
2	1523137583	6	The mechanism blockstream and rbitcoin use to keep users faithful is tribalism. This is why they focus their attacks by using the term bcash, (a ecurrency version of using the N word basically), and they focus on making people like Ver as villains out to get you. It's easy and effective, when you have no other technical way to fight the competition.
0	1523131104	2	" It (the blocksize limit) was added in 2010 to prevent people from taking advantage of low fees and spamming blocks to store data." This isn't true. There is a fee that is based on age of coin and size of the transaction in bytes. The fee was enough to stop spam. Instead of spam fighting, the limit stoped someone creating a block so large that the network would stall while it attempted to process the block. Poisonously large blocks likely would be comprised of spam transactions but the point of the blocksize limit was not a spam-fighting measure. The fee structure could stop spam. But could not stop a poisonous large block. Please, everyone, stop spreading that the blocksize limit was spam prevention. 
1	1523131709	3	http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/543/
1	1523131431	3	Isn't "creating a block so large that the network would stall" the same thing as spam prevention? Creating a ton of transactions that are lower than the fee limit threshold at the time and thus a DDOS attack is spam.
2	1523132034	2	Well, it's not necessarily a DDoS attack as it is a DoS attack as it is not needed to be the fist d distributed. I don't think all DoS prevention measures are spam prevention. I would be OK with saying it was a DoS prevention measure. I also strongly feel like Spam isn't a thing in bitcoin. If you wait for your coins to age and/or a miner is willing to accept the fee you include, it's a valid transaction and not spam. I enjoyed reading your post, even though I have a nitpic.
3	1523132641	1	Yeah I guess I was using Spam too generally. I consider anything other than its intended purpose as Spam. Much like people use the word "hacked" too generally now lol.
0	1523132395	1	Well, what else to expect from Leecoin.
0	1523138166	1	Here is where I am in this debate:https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=16D5e6-6Vkc
0	1523139344	1	Thanks for the great post! Do you think Litecoin will have a solid use case since the foundation is working on many atomic swaps or do you think since it's a fork of Bitcoin most coins will shortly thereafter be available for swap with Bitcoin?I think people don't understand what Blockstream is doing to Bitcoin, their agenda is clearly to insert themselves as a central authority who's looking to get people on subscription plans for their services on Bitcoin.
0	1523140352	1	So let me guess: you sold your ltc for bch, right? Yes or no.
1	1523142531	4	Correct. And actually use bch
2	1523175000	1	What a surprise. I would have never suspected.
3	1523198980	1	Cool!
0	1523147644	1	I’m waiting the next bull to sell my Monero too.
0	1523148316	1	>be held responsible for that reckless behaviorthe entire point of crypto is to have a system that is mechanically perfect and doesn't require any pesky human values like trust or responsibility. So it makes sense the people in this community don't have [any] moral standards. 
1	1523148716	1	Yeah I understand the use of foundations to fund developers, but they haven't been very successful yet.
0	1523151596	1	I’m very surprised this post has so few upvotes so far. Well done and clearly articulated. Thank you.
1	1523151667	2	Got the opposite response on Litecoin once they manually accepted it. Got accused of a bch troll cause I posted here. Now I know what it felt like when I called you guys trolls lol. 
2	1523152402	2	The most important words in your post are “cognitive dissonance.” It’s a powerful drug.
0	1523158539	1	Shrem, Lee... The next Charlie I am seeing in crypto I don't care who they are even if Satoshi Nakamoto himself turns out to be some guy somewhere called Charlie.... I would never trust a Charlie in crypto. If ever I run a website and sell goods for crypto - if the customers name is Charlie I will reject their order.Charlies should have no place in crypto. If your name is Charlie I am not sorry - you should be sorry, so go blame your parents or blame Shrem The Dash Thief or Lee the serial scammer.
1	1523158857	1	Guessing you had an Uncle Charlie?
0	1523168057	1	thanks for sharing this, i agree with all points. 
0	1523177685	1	This is a fantastic post, crypto communities mirror very closely the same dynamic you see with rivalry between nations...  Very few BTC maximalists woke up to the facts, like how the LN will hurt the BTC price because the utility will be identical so there'll be no pro to holding BTC instead of LTC.PS if BTC needs a "silver" version, doesn't it need the digital [palladium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium) to it too?
0	1523188286	1	This conversation is very enlightening. I got interested in crypto back in the summer of 2017 and wasn't part of the civil war between the big blockers and small blockers. I am still trying to make an independent and informed opinion regarding available scaling solutions. As of now, I think the block size increase was the best option available as an interim solution. Buterin recently suggested a 4MB block size with the implementation of Ghost protocol (haven't researched this option yet).Anyway, the more I dig the more I am getting suspicious about BTC core dev and the LN.Thanks everyone for contributing to my crypto education :-)
0	1523139658	1	r/BTC is an open and welcoming community....well, at least until someone at Reddit becomes a Blockstream fan and turns off this sub.  As a private company, Reddit can do whatever they fuck they want...whenever they want.
0	1523141703	1	downvoted, I don't believe this sub is the place for your plea to LTC community. If you don't like the community, vote with your wallet.

1	1523125262	5	Reading things out of context can lead to misunderstanding the overall message. That was the arguments for smaller blocks and I used to believe that. I'm admitting I was wrong.
2	1523125932	1	[deleted]
3	1523126103	5	That was a common argument for smaller blocks that I once believed. Other arguments can be found here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_size_limit_controversyMy belief stemmed from the idea that full (non mining) nodes are necessary for the Bitcoin economy.
3	1523126325	4	The paragraphs in bold are quotes and myths that he is questioning.
4	1523127000	5	I realize how it can be misread, so adjusted the formatting a bit.
