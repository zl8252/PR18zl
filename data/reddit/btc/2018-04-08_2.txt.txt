0	1523160978	101	Again? I'm sure the suspension was well-justified and not at all a result of abuse of their easily exploited reporting system. /s
1	1523168333	28	He should have learned his lesson the first time and blocked all the trolls.  If he gets his account back, hopefully he’ll start blocking the trolls.
2	1523177585	9	I think he should do that. Of course, the trolls will then come and whine about @Bitcoin being a hypocrite and engaging in censorship to block their "wise, sophisticated tweets" (e.g. bcash bcash bcash), when it's just spam. And who believes spam should be protected speech?
3	1523190771	3	Let them whine.  A platform like twitter preventing someone from posting due to his views is censorship...  An individual blocking people that he chooses is not censorship.
3	1523193222	3	I do, I believe "spam" is protected  speech.
4	1523193558	3	Yes of course, you can freely spam...  and I can freely block you...  that is my right...
1	1523167219	48	Twitter taking the same bullshit path as Facebook and the rest of the biased Western police state controlled media.
1	1523164897	25	I guess bch isn't bitcoin lol
2	1523167387	20	This is getting downvoted but I thought it was funny.BTC = proof of censorship"And you shall know it by its trail of victims"
2	1523186095	-2	Said only you and your Eglin Air Force Base buddies.
1	1523179757	-8	Yeah I’m sure *wink wink*
2	1523179770	7	Redditor /u/iMoJoX has low karma in this subreddit.
3	1523183760	1	True, I’m proud of it :*
0	1523163006	79	Censorship is their only weapon
1	1523169541	30	Censorship and abusing people by misleading them into a false belief (Cult very much?)
2	1523183848	10	Their two main weapons are censorship, abusing people by misleading them into a false belief and ruthless efficiency... wait, I'll come in again.
3	1523185780	4	When I came here I didn’t expect some kind of Spanish Inquisition. 
4	1523186870	4	Nobody expects the spanish inquisition!
2	1523169643	-15	pretty much. Roger bought the account and just posts bullshit over and over. This is why there is a massive divide between bch and btc. Roger single handley created it.
3	1523170667	32	What proof do you have Roger Ver bought the account?What proof do you have that the account 'posts bullshit over and over' ?What proof do you have that Roger, alone, created the divide between BTC and BCH ?
4	1523178289	-1	He is adamant for it to be Bitcoin Cash: Satoshi's vision, not even wanting "bcash" slang to be used. If someone is so concerned with correctness...Why isn't the twitter handle @BitcoinCash then? Why use @bitcoin?
5	1523178935	20	Because he used to be pro-BTC back when he registered the handle.Then, like every other person in this sub, we realized BTC had been hijacked and created a fork, BCH, to continue the original direction of bitcoin.He still owns @bitcoin after that event, so he's using it to express that viewpoint.How is that so hard to understand? It's the same reason Bitcoin.com is pro-BCH too.
6	1523179410	-2	Okay... But I would like to draw you to the point I was trying to make with an analogy:It's like Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs splitting with Apple. But instead, Wozniak goes and starts Apple Cash because he has a different vision for where the company should go and thinks Jobs is incorrect. But, Wozniak just happened to control the @apple twitter handle and the apple.com domain. He uses them as his community outreach for Apple Cash. But his company is actually registered and brands their products and software as Apple Cash. Wouldn't that be a bit confusing? Your social media brands itself as your competitor. 
7	1523188691	4	The guy who owns @Bitcoin can say on there whatever he wants.If Apple was taken over by a malicious group of people who kicked out the original developers, a lot of people might say that it's not Apple anymore and the owner of @Apple might not accept it either.
7	1523181229	19	No, it isn't like that at all. Bitcoin, the decentralized currency, is not at all analogous to Apple, the centralized traditional brand.That you *think* of Bitcoin the protocol as being the same as a company brand, something owned by shareholders and controlled by majority stakes, only goes to show how much learning about Bitcoin you need to do.
8	1523182257	2	I could have used an analogy of an Oak tree evolving and creating Oak Cash. The actual subject of my analogy is irrelevant, it's how the two subjects of it interplay with each other that matter and I'm trying to explain. I think you missed the point I'm trying to make here.
9	1523182480	13	No, I see your point. Your point is Bitcoin is like a company and a brand, so someone doing something different with the same set of idea is abusing that company's ownership of their brand. If your point *isn't* that, you didn't actually have a point.Incidentally, the Oak tree analogy is pretty awful too.
8	1523190656	1	Let me guess. You have learned so much about bitcoin that you think that bitcoin is a collection of hardforks right?
7	1523192788	2	"brands" "products"I don't think you understand decentralization.
5	1523185982	9	>Why isn't the twitter handle @BitcoinCash then? Why use @bitcoin?Because BCH is, in fact, bitcoin. http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf
6	1523186206	3	It's a forked path taken last August as the two opposing ideologies could not co-exist any longer. Since they both originated from the same womb, determining which one "is bitcoin" at the most basic level is a question that will never be solved IMO. This is not a question that can be solved unequivocally like "1+1=2" can be. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.I think they are both here to stay for as long as cryptocurrencies are relevant. 
7	1523189742	5	Bitcoin has a definition. Bitcoin is cash. Make it not cash and it is no longer bitcoin. See, 1+1=2.
8	1523190748	1	Longest chain is Bitcoin.
9	1523191969	1	Most work chain you mean.
5	1523184590	3	If the name was @WatchPornHere or @BestFoodsinAmerica and it talked about cryptocurrency or science then the account is evil and a fraud? I see it happening with @Bitcoin but not other topics and accounts.
6	1523184792	4	Read the rest of the comment train in this thread, I don't understand what you're trying to say.
7	1523184943	4	I did. 
3	1523174751	12	always accusing your opponent of the very thing you are doing. 
4	1523176820	-11	it's not an accusation. It's clear as fucking day.If Roger hadn't started this whole fucking 'bch is the real bitcoin' bullshit, both camps wouldn't be where they are at today.
5	1523177182	19	If this is so clear as day to you, who would you say bought the "theymos" Reddit, BitcoinTalk, Bitcoin.org, and Bitcoin Wiki accounts?
6	1523185863	3	CIA
6	1523178604	-3	The rightful owners.
7	1523178985	15	No one owns bitcoin, you don't fucking get it.
8	1523181584	4	but I do. apples are not oranges. bch is not bitcoin.
9	1523185921	6	I suggest you read this: http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf.
7	1523179606	3	Well, they must've [bought it back](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6yl6p1/utheymos_used_to_be_a_big_blocker_what_happened/) at some point, then.
7	1523181987	3	It's very interesting that you use the plural sense of "owner" in your reply.
8	1523182187	2	Not really. Your tinfoil hat just fell off is all
9	1523182590	3	Freudian slips are embarrassing, I know.  e: grammar
5	1523185842	6	He didn't start it. People who believe in bitcoin have been saying it since August 1, 2017. I have.
5	1523177336	4	Follow the money and you will see how wrong you are. https://youtu.be/6oowBF70HxM?t=15s
3	1523179678	4	Looks like you have no proof. All your posts and comments can be discarded as bullshit.
1	1523170418	6	Right, that puppet Mow they put up against Roger didnt turn out so well... Doh!
1	1523185301	3	[U mad tho?](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vxbpowo9368/VDwqL1l6oeI/AAAAAAAAeys/Jtxp7RpEgbg/s1600/U%2Bmad%2Btho.jpg)
1	1523195605	2	Removing cancer content is another one. Sorry buddy. 
2	1523195886	2	Good thing you have smart benevolent people who can detect cancer for you so that you don't have to have your brain exposed to it.
0	1523165336	30	I'm surprised Twitter continues to tolerate this blatant flaunting of their rules. 
1	1523183589	29	You might have missed the part where the Twitter CEO invested in lightening. Oh snap.
2	1523206831	0	Yeah that probably plays a part in what is happening. But so does the fact that a Bitcoin Cash supporter is using the @Bitcoin Twitter to bash Bitcoin and promote Bitcoin Cash. If you read the Twitter rules you'll see they have rules against doing that. 
1	1523183818	23	Twitter CEO invested in Lightning. - That's a pretty relevant fact for the censorship on Twitter.
2	1523206913	-2	More relevant then the fact that somebody is using the @Bitcoin Twitter to bash Bitcoin and promote a competitor?
0	1523184777	8	Coming from the same company that owns Square, the company that owns Bitcoin and Lightning Labs... Who would hace thought?Bitcoin Cash' branding problem is the elephant in the living room.
0	1523177300	13	Not surprising at all, considering how many trolls kept reporting that account to Twitter because of "deception". Wouldn't be surprised if they made multiple accounts to do so, seeing the dirty games they play. Some of them even had the guts to share screenshots of them reporting @Bitcoin to Twitter. Fools.
1	1523179030	-1	Bcash is using the @Bitcoin account to smear BTC, and you're talking about *them* playing dirty games?
2	1523189174	13	Blockstream is using the name Bitcoin to ruin a revolutionary project. Disgusting.
2	1523185962	22	The Account was named Bitcoin and not BTC. BCH is Bitcoin but not BTC.
3	1523201023	1	BCH is Bitcoin lol? I need some of whatever you’re smoking. 
4	1523201260	1	Yes BCH is Bitcoin, the electronic peer to peer cash. BCH is not BTC tho.
3	1523186112	-6	BCH is bcash and is as much Bitcoin as Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, Superbitcoin, Bitcoin Silver and all the other shitforks of Bitcoin are Bitcoin.
3	1523194650	1	Check this out: https://www.yours.org/content/bitcoin-cash-is-the-better-bitcoin-5a6d53231862Bitcoin Cash is the Better Bitcoin!
3	1523191330	-8	See, only in your delusional mind does that make sense. To everyone else outside this bubble bcash looks likeca scam coin that tries to sell itself as bitcoin. Now you might have *the opinion* that bcash is bitcoin, but any rational person does not see it like that.
4	1523191460	8	Do you know how forks for open source software work? Do you know why there are multiple Linux distributions and Debian Linux doesn't call Ubuntu Linux a scam because it's a fork of Debian?
5	1523191932	-7	Oh, we're dealing with an expert lolThis is a moronic argument. Bitcoin is the network and protocol - its a set of consensus rules. The clients you want to use are not compatible with the bitcoin network. You have your own network.If you really want to stay with that shitty analogy bcash is like branding android as linux.Bonus question: how many total bitcoin are in circulation right now?
6	1523195503	3	> Bitcoin is the network and protocol - its a set of consensus rules.This does not say if the BTC network or the BCH network is Bitcoin.> The clients you want to use are not compatible with the bitcoin network.This presupposes that "bitcoin network" means "BTC network" so it does not prove anything.
7	1523196506	1	So you agree that there is only one bitcoin?
8	1523197479	3	"Bitcoin" in my opinion means the original experiment. If I would have to assign the name to one of the variations that exist, I would assign it to BCH, which is the one that tries to pursue that experiment.
9	1523200783	2	That didnt answer my question

0	1523178776	2	Damn the Core trolls!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEKB7pi1mbc
0	1523178383	1	Why someone should have bitcoin account. It must be decentralized not centralized 
1	1523181225	13	why should you be allowed to use the reddit username strogan5? someone else wants to use it, they'll let you know they want to claim it in 5 years time and I expect you give it to them
1	1523182157	7	With that logic, shouldn't the Twitter profile @Linux (yes, it exists) be decentralized, because it's open-source? I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you; on the contrary. Just wondering what your thoughts on that are.
2	1523184526	3	I don’t see any decentralized words in Linux white paper and Example isn’t an argument.
3	1523192915	2	> I don’t see any decentralized words in Linux white paperLinux doesn't have a whitepaper, and even if it did, why would decentralization need to be explicitly mentioned in order to exist? The open source model encourages decentralization, because it allows users to modify software to fit their needs and redistribute it to others.
1	1523195784	1	Indeed r/bitcoin shouldn't be r/theymos. The mass bans of the 2014/2015 community would have been avoided.
1	1523179021	1	Blame twitter.
0	1523177848	-3	Fraud account got suspended? Good news. 
1	1523178662	34	The North Coreans celebrate censorship. Surprise.
2	1523187253	-6	cool meme, parrot
1	1523182652	11	New account with -4 karma. Obviously not a paid troll
1	1523188649	2	Fraud how exactly?
0	1523183662	2	Seems justified to me, if you have a 'branded' twitter account it should reflect your brand not someone else's or that of another communities.
1	1523184379	17	Bitcoin is not trademarked.    Nobody owns Bitcoin. Everyone can use the therm Bitcoin as they want.    and if someone is the first to claim this name on twitter, so be it.    nobody has the right to deny that from him.    Same goes for Bitcoin Cash or any other crypto that is not owned by 1 one entity.    Bitcoin is permissionless, you seem to forget that.
2	1523191714	4	Apparently twitter has that right. 
3	1523193173	3	of course they have. they have the right to ban everyone whenever they want. after all, its a privately owned website and they dont have to answer to anyone for that.    Same for a Club or Restaurant. They can deny anyone entrance, without giving reasons for that.    But SHOULD they? No, because thats bad practice.    
4	1523195875	3	Wrong again. Your point is valid but Twitter is a publicly held company trading under the symbol $TWTR. @bitcoin was misleading people about the “real” bitcoin. Twitter took action to protect is users from bad information. 
5	1523196338	2	@bitcoin was not misleading people, but it seems you are mislead if you cant figure out what Bitcoin is.    twitter Inc. is a company that can do whatever they want with its database as long as it doesnt violate any laws.    
6	1523196664	1	Twitter seems to disagree. Bitcoin (BTC) is not bitcoin cash (BCH). @BITCOIN (not @bitcoinCASH) was telling twitter users BCH was the “real bitcoin”. Seems misleading to me.now SHOO* (shoes are for feet). troll
2	1523186011	2	The name Bitcoin is a brand, it's not registered brand name, but it is a brand nonetheless. Just because someone can use that brand in anyway they want, it doesn't mean they should. Why would someone that promotes Bitcoin Cash want to create confusion, especially for newcomers, by using a twitter account touting the brand name 'Bitcoin' to rubbish Bitcoin and promote BCH.The crypto space is largely unregulated and 'we' are the custodians, we should therefore behave in ways which reflect good practise and be responsible with the 'power' we have.  I think Roger has abused and flaunted these tenets way too much. In this case he uses the Bitcoin twitter account as an anti-Bitcoin and pro-BCH propaganda channel. So, I applaud twitter for this action.  
3	1523192928	4	> it's not registered brand name, but it is a brand nonetheless. This brand you speak of, who does it belong to? You clearly don't understand decentralization.
4	1523206627	1	You clearly don't have a handle on the subject at hand, it has nothing to do with decentralisation 
1	1523183931	10	But it's no one's brand. 
1	1523185985	4	The Account was named Bitcoin and not BTC. BCH is Bitcoin but not BTC.
2	1523187236	4	BTC is bitcoinBCH is bitcoin cashsaying bch is bitcoin is the very reason the account was suspended.
3	1523189435	2	Ah yes trademark infringment OMEGA FUCKING LULThe account was suspended because of 100 million reports from no life coreans
4	1523189814	4	Yes, I agree. A large amount of people were upset over what happened with that account. And their voices were heard. 
0	1523195767	1	Looks like he's back, but only showing 9 followers currently.
0	1523169873	-9	Eat this roger.
1	1523169883	16	Redditor /u/Blorgsteam has low karma in this subreddit.
2	1523189621	1	No kidding!
0	1523164974	-23	Good. I hope he gets permanently banned.
1	1523167478	33	Of course you do. You support BTC (Bitcoin Core), and thus you have no interest whatsoever in values like "censorship-resistance" or "permissionlessness."
2	1523175476	5	Bitch please, @Bitcoin has nothing to do with Bitcoin Cash.
2	1523179202	-1	*You* have no interest in any of this. All you want is for bcash to pump and crash btc and the entire market (which is linked to btc) in the process so you can make money.
3	1523179398	10	My post history clearly refutes that
2	1523175000	1	You realize the name of this subreddit is BTC, right? 
3	1523185583	3	oldmanwrigley. There is a history why it's r/btc. Read: https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/
3	1523175897	17	This subreddit was created way before any fork was created or even thought of. The reason was due to the purge that moderators commited on people with differentiating oppinions in r/bitcoin among other forums that started 2014/2015. The exiles (some were proponents of bigger blocks) went ahead and started r/btc. But of course you could not know any of this since you arrived to this space less than 6 months ago as does probably 85% of your friends over at r/bitcoin. 
3	1523175520	-8	Which is a Bitcoin Cash subreddit and not Bitcoin
4	1523176100	11	Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin
5	1523177851	6	keep telling yourself that
5	1523178609	-8	Then what’s Bitcoin Cash?
6	1523180026	7	The better Bitcoin
7	1523180384	4	Haha 🤣, so good it has to drop the Bitcoin Cash name
8	1523190357	3	The Cash is there to remind people what the whitepaper described:Bitcoin: A peer to peer electronic CASH systemhttps://bitcoincash.org/bitcoin.pdf
9	1523190674	1	Stop reaching, it’s all a bunch of bollocks.
4	1523201357	2	I didn’t realize how bad it actually was over here. Like. Oh my god it’s just really, really sad. 
5	1523204200	1	It is quite sad, they have to constantly reaffirm with each other that Bcash is the future, never mind that they’re putting their blind faith into the guy(Roger Ver) who told people who had holdings with MtGox that everything was okay and that their money was safe. Welp, what happened to MtGox?
3	1523190315	0	/r/btc is for discussion of Bitcoin/r/Bitcoin is for discussion of BTCModerator teams should swap.
2	1523168230	2	How do you rationalise it being used as a propaganda account? Just because it's "on your side"? 
3	1523168836	13	No, because I have a decent memory and recall most of the nicknames posting.When I get tired I block.
4	1523176077	1	What? How is that related to my comment?I'm genuinely asking how he rationalises propaganda when he implies to hold "censorship-resistance" and "permissionlessness" as values.You can support Bitcoin Cash and not agree with aspects of it you know. Anything that questions that gets downvoted of course though.
5	1523176377	10	Believe it or not, your msg came to my inbox so I replied. We got "redditted".Still, daily users know the trolls and their lines, including the concern trolling.
3	1523176950	2	Personally I don't support censorship."Propaganda" or whatever is just another excuse that authoritarians used to justify their censorship goals.
2	1523181429	-3	Bcash (BCH) is a centralized scam, a fake Bitcoin created by Roger and Bitmain. This is a BTC sub.If you want to cheer for your Bcash shitcoin, go to r/Bitcoincash or r/BCH.

3	1523190049	1	How about you just go back to r/bitcoin. That would solve this problem for you. And for us.
1	1523168076	10	I hope you find a life, begging on the streets is more dignifying than your job.
1	1523179444	9	This endless stream of heckling, sock puppet accounts created by fearful, [Dragon's Den](https://cointelegraph.com/news/secret-bitcoin-troll-army-pushes-for-segwit-adoption-emin-gun-sirer) BTC trolls only crystallizes how big a threat they consider BCH to be to them. How many other cryptos have earned such an extensive, continuing smear campaign built around a deceptive and inaccurate nickname? Many cryptos using "Bitcoin" in their name existed before Bitcoin Cash, and all the others are still allowed to exist without essentially any comment from this peanut gallery.
2	1523187333	0	Name the many coins that marketed themselves as the real bitcoin.
3	1523195532	1	Only the one that follows [the definition of the term](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin). Why is BTC marketing itself as "Bitcoin"?
4	1523196222	3	lol, wut? BTC is bitcoin, bitcoin is BTC. Not a hard concept to grasp. BCH hard forked off because bitmain didn't want to lose its asic advantage when it was apparent that segwit would end their fun. And they then try to bullshit everyone that is was because of "Satoshi's true vision" or similar crap. I see you swallowed the propaganda.As I thought, you can't back up your bullshit. I am done with you.
5	1523196710	1	If you don't defend your claims, you're simply [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting).  [Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8aok6d/twitter_has_suspended_bitcoin_account_for/dx0cnak/) I explain exactly why I claim BCH is far more Bitcoin than BTC. BTC no longer even aspires to be "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", the actual *title* of the original [white paper](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin). Please argue the point, or GTFO with your vacuous claim.
6	1523198952	2	Well, the claim is pointless, because bitcoin is whatever the consensus decides it is. And the consensus decided on segwit. So tell your bitmain nonsense narrative to someone else.BCH nodes runs different software than bitcoin nodes, therefore, it is not bitcoin. 
7	1523200125	1	The exact truth is that consensus was fooled into accepting SegWit2x, and the 2x never materialized **so the SegWit activation is illegitimate**. Now this illegitimate store-of-value, oh-God-I-hope-Lightning-Network-works block chain is still trying to claim the "Bitcoin" title, when in virtually every respect BCH is closer to the white paper and continues to follow Nakamoto consensus, making it the current crypto that by the most criteria should be able to claim the name.
8	1523202054	2	Segwit2x was never accepted. It reached something like 45% consensus.Segwit was accepted. It reached 100% consensus.Spouting lies is not helping your cause. Bitcoin is whatever the consensus says it is. And consensus says segwit is bitcoin.
6	1523196719	1	**Gaslighting**Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
