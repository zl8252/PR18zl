Submission title: The @Bitcoin account has been suspended (again) by @TwitterSupport only because Core trolls constantly submit fake reports about it. @Jack why do you guys keep letting this happen? Instead of suspending all the fake scammer accounts you suspend the real ones. WTF.

0	1523197619	35	Waiit so Twitter closed the account, then some random Turkish guy registered with @Bitcoin before everyone else?
1	1523203904	10	Yes! It's ***fucking unreasonable*** and should be reverted. I'm at a loss of words for how terrible this is. The guy had the @Bitcoin account since 2012, and only thing he did "wrong" was tweeting about bitcoin cash being bitcoin.
2	1523206592	5	It is against Twitter ToS to sell an account.
3	1523208608	2	The new @Bitcoin account was just suspended.~~The guy offered to sell it for 5 ETH. https://i.imgur.com/lKtn9XS.png~~**Edit:** That comment wasn't made by @Bitcoin, it was @Blitcoin.
4	1523209530	2	That account is called @blitcoin. It's a scam.
5	1523210017	1	Oh shit you are right. I didn't check properly. Thank you man!
3	1523210929	2	Their TOS is whatever Jack Dorsey says it is
3	1523207221	-1	You think this was an account trade?
2	1523204741	-4	I allready wrote to Twitter Support! If they don´t revert I quit my account!
3	1523204899	7	Now this is a real boycott I can stand behind.
4	1523205426	-2	Twitter is nothing without community/user. Also Reddit. I´m sure the Twitter Story will go to the News. Take @Bitcoin account away from Roger and give it to a Turkey guy. If Twitter don´t revers this there is no reason for me to follow this anymore and stay with Twitter.
5	1523207171	3	Roger didn't own @Bitcoin, it was owned by a guy who's been around since 2012. But yeah even if Roger did own the account it would obviously not be fair to delete.
6	1523207360	3	Thank you for the information. I guessed it was owned by Roger or someone related to him because if he was smart enough to save Bitcoin.com for him he would take the Twitter handle too. But I wasn´t sure. 
6	1523209490	1	> it was owned by a guy who's been around since 20122009, actually. 
5	1523206162	3	How do you know Roger is behind @Bitcoin?
6	1523206546	1	In the end it doesn´t matter who is behind @Bitcoin. Fakt is: it was toke away without an resonable proof because Bitcoin is open source.
6	1523210095	0	He doesn't, he is just trying to spread a rumor
2	1523208446	-1	That sounds like a scam.
3	1523208700	0	What?
1	1523208531	1	it looks like https://twitter.com/bitcoin is suspended again since a few minutes.
2	1523208885	1	I don't understand how that guy managed to register with a banned account's id lol
3	1523209537	1	This don´t looks good for twitter also. Don´t looks like an reliable Company to me.
3	1523209048	0	This is a real good question. But if we ever get an answer? Don´t think so. "There is something shady going on" like someone stated.
1	1523205471	-14	Today is a good day as bcash loses one of its primary propoganda platforms. Thats what happens when you play bcash as BTC.
2	1523211038	1	You have understood absolutely nothing. Move along now little incompetent troll.
0	1523197879	17	So it’s back but when I try to follow I get “you have been blocked by this user”. Something going on. Odd. 
1	1523198037	14	Something odd is indeed happening https://twitter.com/davidshares/status/982985639149948929?s=21 
2	1523201224	14	WHAT!! @Bitcoin got deleted and someone new registered it! This is absolutely unreasonable what in the actual fuck!!!
3	1523202521	9	It's only a matter of time until someone decides to take rbtc away from us.BTC is censored and permissioned.
4	1523203427	11	We've got to have an escape plan written in the sidebar for if that happens. So that all r/btc readers know to expect it and know where to go if it happens./u/BitcoinXio
0	1523195186	7	When I look at https://twitter.com/bitcoin I see "This account's Tweets are protected.". I don't see anything about it being suspended. Or is that what it means?
1	1523195277	1	You have to switch to the browser. The Twitter app won’t show it. 
2	1523196022	5	That is what the browser shows.
3	1523196044	-2	Redditor /u/r2doesinc has low karma in this subreddit.
4	1523196225	9	I see it in browser. And my karma is not low,
5	1523201904	3	I'm not sure this bot is actually that useful. It can be pretty annoying...
6	1523203422	-3	It's useful, but not perfect.
0	1523193466	19	Because Twitter owns Square, investors in Lightning Labs and Blockstream supporters.Bitcoin Cash has a serious branding problem nobody wants to address.
1	1523206622	6	Don't forget the Bilderbergs!
1	1523194314	14	I called the CEO of Bitcoin Cash and he said he'll take care of the branding problem right away.He also told me that BTC has a serious branding problem - it's still pretending to be cash and not a collectible. This is clearly visible by domains such as bitcoin.org putting up a whitepaper which says 'Bitcoin: peer to peer electronic _cash_ system' while it's long been turned into a settlement system with Lightning Network as 'cash' on top. But Lightning is an entirely separate system (which doesn't work very well yet).So why are BTC users still supporting the branding of BTC as 'cash'?
2	1523201566	3	To destroy Bitcoin Cash' reputation and credibility, obviously.
3	1523202132	4	That's so lol. What credibility? And you cannot destroy something which does not exist.Unless you mean credibility from known proven scammers? Yeah, totally credible.
1	1523200919	5	LOLIt's actually because /u/theymos bribed Twitter. See, he even [admitted to it and provided proof](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8aojsg/twitter_finally_suspended_the_compromised_bitcoin/dx0b004/)! 
2	1523201601	1	A joke that may very well be the truth. And they do have a track record of making what they're really doing into jokes, like the banning joke on April 1st.
3	1523202188	3	.....smoke some more spice, feel the trance, unleash the thousand fold thought.
4	1523203814	2	ad hominem but no response to the central point ^
5	1523206514	2	If the "central point" is a conspiracy theory, it does not deserve to be debated. It does deserve to be mocked.Stupid is as stupid does, and I want no part of that stupid. You clearly do, and thats OK! Go shitpost about chemtrails, how flat the earth is or whatever other gullible shit you lap up like koolaid. I'll continue to use facts to base my position on, instead of wild speculation fueled by identity politics.Just don't be disappointed when I mock you for being a flat earther. Your mom will still love you.
6	1523208165	-1	Thanks for proving my point, by giving another response of 100% ad hominem and 0% refuting the central point. 
2	1523202634	-2	Don't have the bribe people you're already in bed with.
3	1523204188	4	You guys are fucking hilarious. Never change.
4	1523204408	0	Who is Theymos? Have you met him? What's he like after a few beers? What's on his rap sheet? Does he give you the finger if you yell bcore bcore bcore at him like an imbecile troll?
0	1523197082	9	someone has now hacked the bitcoin account or taken it over? https://twitter.com/bitcoin
0	1523197315	23	slush, Charlie Lee, Adam Back, Wladimir, Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd all actively pushed their followers to report and have this account banned. A user that registered a username on a website long before many of these idiots were around. They wanted that username.How is that cypherpunk? One major social platform they had zero control over and using toxic smear campaigns and bots they got their own way. again!how anyone can see Bitcoin BTC and Blockstream being good for anything at this point is fucking way beyond me
1	1523197799	6	> n BTC and Blockstream being good for anything at this point is fucking way beyond methey nobodies, reporting to authority to get their way. we are about decentralization where there is no central authority that can do this. dont worry our priorities are straight and we will prevail because of this. DO NOT APPEAL TO AUTHORITY FOR ANYTHING.
1	1523204792	3	> slush, Charlie Lee, Adam Back, Wladimir, Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd all actively pushed their followers to report and have this account bannedCan you provide evidence that *each* of those individuals engaged in the behavior of which you're accusing them?
2	1523206200	0	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/982879415532011520https://twitter.com/slushcz/status/982969279262883840https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/982918758930026496https://twitter.com/orionwl/status/982912083338645504https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/971770606797570054just look through their tweets and nullc reddit history. Wasn't only them, but it was them also.
3	1523208329	5	Epic fail. Out of all those tweets, **zero** "actively pushed their followers to report and have this account banned". I'll give you that Peter did say that *he* reported the account, but the tweet you provided was *after it had already been banned*.Slush in fact said he *did not support the censorship*.Holy shit you're trying *really* hard to push an agenda here, aren't you?
3	1523208142	2	There's only one mention of reporting by Peter in your links.
1	1523209640	1	None of them have ever been a "cypherpunk".
1	1523210339	-6	Bitcoin cash is not bitcoin. Its Bcash. Using a twitter handle to promote anything else is false advertising.Quote from twitter:"We reserve the right to suspend accounts or take other appropriate action when someone’s brand or trademark, including business name and/or logo, is used in a manner that may mislead or confuse others about your brand affiliation."
2	1523210411	2	I actually wanted the username /u/ElephantGlue, I think because of the fact you registered it first doesn't matter. It's a scam that you get to keep it because you registered it first.give it to me
0	1523191119	18	Please retweet this or share it or send your own tweets to Twitter Support and Jack to help get back the @Bitcoin account. 
1	1523195790	12	Twitter accounts that repeatedly participate in mass-flagging attacks should be permanently banned. 
2	1523199435	2	Lol what are you saying 
3	1523203806	6	That there should be consequences if one attempts to abuse Twitter's community standards enforcement mechanisms
4	1523203864	5	Oh you mean the accounts that do the flagging gotcha
1	1523193673	4	Retweeted.  This is ridiculous.  This is like suspending Internet Explorer for impersonating Netscape in 1998.  Even if you think it sucks, it's not an "impersonation."
2	1523211279	1	At this point, it's pretty much a phishing attempt. @bitcoin has nothing to do with the actual bitcoin and is promoting a different alt. That, to me, is an attempted fraud.
2	1523206410	0	Except it is.  I’m agnostic in the BTC/BCH conflict, but this Twitter account was straight up deliberately misleading and made all of BCH look scammy.
1	1523196051	-8	Do you have actual information or are you speculating as to the reason for the suspension?
2	1523202712	6	Occam's razor. Four years on nonstop social attacks from small block bankcoin supporters didn't just stop today.
0	1523197778	7	This looks like signs of despair.  Can BTC maintain such high valuation for so long without having utility?
1	1523205390	4	You sound like the black knight.https://youtu.be/zKhEw7nD9C4
2	1523206358	0	No, I'm just a good salesman.
3	1523208945	3	But more seriously, bch just lost a very valuable resource.And suggesting that btc must be getting desperate really comes off as putting on a brave face. Irrationally so.It might get it back, but even so it’ll be less valuable because it can not continue exactly like before. 
0	1523196998	9	This CEMENTS my decision to be part of BCH and not BTC. 
1	1523197902	9	? How? Lol. @Bitcoin was promoting itself as "Bitcoin", aka, the first cryptocurrency, while actually linking and talking about Bitcoin Cash, a fork of the first cryptocurrency.That is not misleading and disingenuous to you? No, I'm not saying BTC is better than BCH, I'm saying BTC=\=BCH. I think we can agree on that.
2	1523202899	6	BTC is promoting itself as "[Bitcoin: a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)" when in reality **it's a settlement token for non-P2P routed payment networks like Lightning,** while using social attacks like [this one.](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/z/dl8v4lp)That is not misleading and disingenuous to *you?*
3	1523203531	5	Sure, I can understand your issue with it, definitely.Let's take your stance: Bitcoin is a misguided/lying community. Cool.Bitcoin Cash is not, and an honest community, cool.So Bitcoin is not Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash is better, more honest, more useful.So Bitcoin Cash should not try to be as disingenuous as Bitcoin.And ergo, should not tie itself to such a bad name, a la @Bitcoin, for two reasons.One, Bitcoin Cash is better than Bitcoin. We don't want someone thinking Bitcoin Cash is slow and non cash like, like Bitcoin is.Two, Bitcoin is not Bitcoin Cash, and we don't want someone to see the @Bitcoin tag, and praise/buy Bitcoin, when they mean to do so for Bitcoin Cash (or @BitcoinCash?)Any thoughts?
4	1523203832	1	>Sure, I can understand your issue with it, definitely.>>Let's take your stance: Bitcoin is a misguided/lying community. Cool.Right, so, full stop.  rbitcoin should have been renamed to rblockstreamcoin two years ago when they bought off the mods and turned it into a commercial marketing forum for their business.If you agree that individuals who happen to own online spaces that are not themselves registered trademarks should be able to voice their opinions as they see fit, as Theymos does with rbitcoin, then @bitcoin should be able to say whatever the fuck he wants.If you don't agree that @bitcoin should have that right, then you should agree that Theymos and Co should have had their rights stripped back in 2015 at the latest.
5	1523204189	1	You know how Democrats that got into trouble during the whole sexual harassment scandal resign, but Republicans didn't, and argued hard against them? Let's be a bit more graceful and responsible than our opposition.
6	1523204492	6	Fuck that. Read Clauswitz.
7	1523204582	1	I do not know what you're referring to, can you expand?
8	1523205253	6	https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1946/1946-h/1946-h.htm>Kind-hearted people might of course think there was some ingenious way to disarm or defeat the enemy without too much bloodshed, and might imagine this is the true goal of the art of war.Pleasant as it sounds, it is a fallacy that must be exposed: War is such a dangerous business that mistakes that come from kindness are the very worstI've been following this war since before it formally started, and in my *strong* opinion almost all of the mistakes of the large block / Original Bitcoin community can be traced to this very paragraph.
5	1523204101	1	I agree Theymos and co are an issue, let's not be as bad as him with this.
6	1523210762	1	You are saying speaking your mind is on par with censorship?
3	1523211094	1	Lol.. Its called deflecting.. ohh but they did it first! With an article written by a bcash supporter. No clout.
2	1523198185	6	BCH shares the same ledger as BTC, both are Bitcoin. 
3	1523205083	6	Good, then I’m going to create my own fork and I’m going to be rich. Want to buy some of my bitcoin?
4	1523205572	-2	No, because your fork has no community or developers behind it.
3	1523206001	2	>BCH shares the same ledger as BTCNot since BCH forked away on August 1st, 2017. Before that there *was* no BCH, so of course they were the same. After that, they are completely separate so obviously *not* the same.
2	1523197981	-4	btc = not a bitcoin - BCH = Bitcoin not confusing.
3	1523204705	2	That’s just like your opinion man.
3	1523202900	5	No my guy. You seem to have an agenda but let's be real.Non shorthand, we have "Bitcoin", and "Bitcoin Cash". Which is a better currency, I do not care. BCH can be a better currency, that's fine, or even better in every way, worth more than BTC.But "Bitcoin" is closer to @Bitcoin than "Bitcoin Cash" is."Bitcoin" is "a Bitcoin" because "Bitcoin".equals("Bitcoin");You can not say Bitcoin isn't Bitcoin.We're not saying BTC is a superior currency, we're saying Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are two different things, and if they're not, why the fork.
4	1523203118	-3	BTC chain needs to find a new name. Bcore sounds good. Bcore no longer resembles bitcoin.BCH is bitcoin and that is why we will win this war. BTC is the attack. BCH is the answer. the only thing left to determine is when we flip you do we go back to BTC or stay as BCH? does it matter?no what matters is that BCH gets shit done and gives economic freedom to the world.Nothing more to be said, "My Guy"
5	1523204002	5	20 years later:BCH chain needs to find a new name. Bitcoin Cash sounds good. Bitcoin Cash no longer resembles bitcoin.DOGE is bitcoin and that is why we will win this war. BCH is the attack. DOGE is the answer. the only thing left to determine is when we flip you do we go back to BCH or stay as DOGE? does it matter?no what matters is that DOGE gets shit done and gives economic freedom to the world.Nothing more to be said, "My dude"I hope you saw my point. Names are names. Don't try to take another name, yours is fine.Bitcoin changed, it's now digital gold, and an index of crypto. Do you want BCH to be that? Or to be better?
6	1523204285	2	Bitcoin has not changed it is alive and well - BCH
7	1523204668	2	Right, see? Signed Bitcoin Cash.And that's fine, I don't think it matters what the name of the best crypto is. But BitcoinCash is as much Bitcoin as LitecoinCash is Litecoin.
8	1523206493	0	Its okay, I know you are scared of being obsolete, so I will stop scaring you. :)
9	1523208815	1	P R O J E C T I N GPlease let's refrain from being condescending. I'm sure we're both pleasant and reasonable adults enjoying a Sunday.

6	1523209774	0	Lurk the Subreddit of a coin you hate? Anyone with half a brain has made the move. The Sheepl will come soon.
5	1523211279	1	Don't even bother.. they whine censorship yet are the first mother fuckers to ban someone here for opposing their views.. BCH is nothing more then a shitty attempt to ride off the success of the btc name..  it's puzzling how ver was able to round up so many people whom have no morals. Like seriously how the fuck can you stand behind ver and bcash as it openly scams new people into believing it's bitcoin? It's either the biggest troll fest in history or these supporters really are convinced with a fat paycheck to keep rolling with their hanus views. You guys just don't get it.. soon you won't be relevant anymore and bch will be nothing more then a bad joke that happened back In the day. Everyone here regardless of their pride knows as well as I do bch is not Bitcoin.. I often asked myself why the drama? Ohh for nothing more then personal gain.. you have all these free coins bcash gave you so why not? All the while I'd be willing to bet 90% of you still have major holdings in the real Bitcoin..

6	1523201012	3	How can you? bitcoin is meant to be p2p CASH - stated in the white paper. 
2	1523207913	-1	You know BTC has a hard fork in its history, right?That makes both BTC and BCH "forks" of the first cryptocurrency......

0	1523207941	1	This is why net neutrality was repealed and the oversight of the Internet moved to the FTC from the FCC.  Twitter operates in public and they are disabling accounts for political reasons.  This is discrimination and Twitter is looking at a major class action lawsuit.

1	1523194113	8	Last time this happened enough people complained to Twitter/Jack to get the account reinstated. It may work again but this might keep happening in the future. Ultimately we should find decentralized alternatives to places like Twitter and Reddit.

0	1523196771	7	Really?**The BCH community is asking Twitter to allow the @Bitcoin account to promote BCH and trash Bitcoin?**This is how you think your coin will win adoption and support?When will you realize, this is why your coin is in the toilet and is losing more value everyday to Bitcoin? And this is why this community is the butt of jokes across crypto. Your support for impersonation and fraud is hurting BCH.

1	1523197923	4	99% of coins lose to btc in value when bitcoin is bear, and they lose some more when btc bulls, but when btc summits then other coins catch up by making HUGE gains. thats the market right now and not an indication of adoption. 
2	1523198734	6	BCH is that 1% exception. Toxic. And the community doesn't seem to want to change that.The data is clear: https://hitbtc.com/chart/BCHBTC
3	1523200568	6	when you take one sample of the entire trading period... yeah i guess it looks bad. but the full picture is fine.
0	1523205780	1	Yeah, this is unfortunate.  However, this wouldn't have happened if bcore was not seriously losing ground under their feet.They are experiencing exponential decay.  Coincidence after Roger completely dick slapping Samson in the debate?  No.  Bcore is like a psycho ex-girlfriend stalking your social media.  They've already lost.
0	1523209062	1	 Do you see how ridiculous that sounds?
0	1523210111	1	Cuz jack invests in LN
0	1523211276	1	It kind of amazes me that we still use Twitter  there are already decentralised alternatives like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) but people still insist on using censored and filled with ads Twitter
0	1523194674	2	> The @Bitcoin account has been suspended (again) by @TwitterSupport Uhm, Twitter's TOS says:> You may not buy or sell Twitter usernames.Twitter may simply have come to the same conclusion as many others...
1	1523196195	10	I would like to see the evidence with which that conclusion is reached.
2	1523198684	5	> I would like to see the evidence with which that conclusion is reached.I do, too :)
3	1523198880	2	If you do not have evidence, why do you specifically mention that rule among all the terms that an account can violate?
4	1523199230	-1	> If you do not have evidence, why do you specifically mention that rule among all the terms that an account can violate?If it is true that the accout violated the TOS of Twitter, a purchase of Roger or someone related to bitcoin.com seems to me the most likely reason. It would explain why the account from a certain time on was basically a bitcoin.com promotion channel.
5	1523199485	1	> If it is true that the accout violated the TOS of TwitterThis is the point of the whole discussion, clearly there were a lot of reports but no evidence.> a purchase of Roger or someone related to bitcoin.com seems to me the most likely reason. It would explain why the account from a certain time on was basically a bitcoin.com promotion channel.Fair enough.
1	1523195422	11	Do you have proof it was bought? 
2	1523198602	2	> Do you have proof it was bought? No, I'd be curious to see it, though. It seems Twitter found the account fishy and recycled it so it could be reclaimed by somebody new?
3	1523202477	2	Is that less fishy?Seems more fishy than not.
4	1523202664	4	> Is that less fishy? Seems more fishy than not.Yes, I'd also have expected some kind of quarantine...
2	1523205395	2	I love the selective calling for proof in this subreddit.Make the claim that Twitter deleted the @Bitcoin account because of Square's investment in Blockstream and Lightning Labs, no proof required!Make the claim that it *looks* like the @Bitcoin account may have been bought due to a complete 180° from promoting Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash, **omg sho me teh prooves!!!**
3	1523205893	0	I never made that claim. I asked for proof the Twitter account was bought. Take your sensationalist arguements elsewhere.The user behind @bitcoin is entitled to their own opinion and may have just decided that Bitcoin Cash was the better option.
1	1523195918	7	the conclusion that the account has never changed and is following Bitcoin: a peer to peer **cash** and a bunch of fools are eating propaganda and maliciously reporting the account?yeah, many came to that conclusion too
2	1523198660	0	> the conclusion that the account has never changedNo, obviously Twitter came to the conclusion that the account violated their TOS and gave it free to be claimed freely.
1	1523203306	0	It's much better to just censor the account, because it might compete with the censorship resistant money Core is trying to build. We need centralized authorities to protect us from this dangerous level of centralization.

0	1523204803	-2	That's because Bitcoin Cash is NOT Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash may be "better" than Bitcoin, it may end up being more successful than Bitcoin, maybe. But it's not Bitcoin, that is called false advertising, and it was punished, that's all.
0	1523209070	0	Personal convictions and support and believing and everything aside, this was someway expected because of the stupid (in my opinion) pushing of the mantra: "Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin".Whenever the sentence can be shareable ideologically, the Bitcoin Cash is not the Bitcoin and it will never be, not we that name at least, and for someone that isn't involved into all this, using the name of a product (no matter what it is) to promote something else can be seen as a scam attempt. I'm not saying this is the intentions, I'm talking about of how this is perceived from outside this world.Imagine someone forking from the Bitcoin (or the BCH), someway removing all the commits of the last year and claiming to be the real Bitcoin, and using a twitter account named "Bitcoin" to promote that coin... how you call him? The legit owner of the Bitcoin "brand" (account) or a scammer?This is what happened here, instead of promoting the Bitcoin Cash for what it is: a coin competing with other crypto-currencies to be the best, someone continued with this absurd campaign that confused everyone: not just name, but the logo, the "branding"... I find it naive and childish.
0	1523201626	-5	You all realize that selling of a Twitter account is against Twitter’s TOS? Thus @bitcoin was violating the terms of service they agreed to. They should have been shut down a long time ago. 
1	1523204313	0	I keep reading this. What evidence is there that the account was sold? (Serious)
0	1523202057	-3	Everyone let’s report @lighning. Two can play at this game
0	1523204889	-4	HAHAHAHAHAHAH REKT HARD. LOLOL

0	1523202755	-7	Bcash is pointless now. Bcashers are worse than Scientologists. If the only way bcash can stay relevant is by shit talking bitcoin then you know you have no product. Its beyond pathetic.
1	1523205120	0	That's the only utility bcore has, talking shit on bcash. Bcash is the better bitcoin, you'll be welcomed back into the fold some day.
0	1523206618	-5	jajajjajajaa, suck it roger, i hope you didnt pay much for that twitter username :))) today twitter banned bcash, tomorrow maybe binance bans bitmain cash??? :))sell your bcashes before its too late, i heard its still worth 0,000000009 bitcoin, for now :))**also, when will reddit ban this r/btc, rogers scam sub too?
