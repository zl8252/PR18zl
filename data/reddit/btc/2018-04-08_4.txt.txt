1	1523189674	14	/r/litecoin is a ghost town and always has been.
1	1523189804	3	Why does it need posts? I thought it's a copycat of btc anyway...
1	1523211060	2	They're human, I used to be one of them. I was wrong and BCH is better. The community has proved that over the past 8 months. Litecoin has maybe 2 or 3 people that actually do things for the community. I'd try to get people to help me with products cause I didn't have time to do the full thing, but no one would volunteer. So I started donating to Litecoin Foundation. Then they donated $50k to Litepay without doing any due diligence and then blamed the community for not looking into it. That was the final straw for me. I'll still trade it to make money, but they will no longer get my support, time, or donations. I'm currently cramming a bunch of predictive modeling and analytic studying. Once I get comfortable parsing through API and data mining, I intend on doing a deep dive of the various crypto subreddits. I will make all my code open source so people can test the results themselves.

0	1523203268	5	I like both coins
0	1523187950	13	http://flappening.watch/Litecoin don’t need no Reddit

1	1523186807	-20	I don't think anyone cares enough in litecoin to create a bunch of email accounts, considering the **litecoin community uses twitter** instead of reddit.Keep in mind this is r/BTC, not "r/BCH", who knows what people think r/btc is about. I suspect most people think it's about "bitcoin" but it's actually about a fork of bitcoin that has a confusing name.If you got a lot of subscribers on r/bitcoincash or r/bch, that'd be nice.. In fact r/btc should be shut down.**What this toxic r/btc community doesn't realize is that all you do is bring down the entire crypto market.**  You do not help BCH by stealing the BTC name, reddit, domain, and trying to take the @bitcoin twitter handle. You make the entire crypto space look like a joke towards investors. Especially when large investors look at bitcoin.com's Rover Ver ranting on stage bashing bitcoin. That will only freak people out on the entire space, not just BCH, not just BTC, not just LTC, all of it. Remember when you make bitcoin look unstable you destroy the entire market.
2	1523188134	24	[This community, and indeed Bitcoin Cash itself, would not exist but for this.](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/z/dl8v4lp)You and yours have only yourselves to blame.
2	1523188258	14	If one man and one subreddit can bring down the entire crypto market, then it has no possibility of becoming a dominant world currency.
2	1523193845	3	lol ok dawg
2	1523197667	2	Haha, it's been proven false so many times.
2	1523198232	2	Wel said, exactly how I feel about it too, and I think the r/btc guys don't take in consideration that there are many BITCOIN holders like me who dislike BCH and are subscribed here because they want to follow the bullshit that happens here. Not all the subscribers are BCH supporters! 
3	1523198248	5	Redditor /u/Michiel83 has low karma in this subreddit.
3	1523210405	1	Same could be said for BTC.
0	1523194525	5	That sub is about a specific coin, this sub is not: here we talk about crypto-currencies in general.If you want to compare it with other similar sub, it should be compared with other alt-coins  subs: /r/ethereum /r/ripple /r/bch ...and so on.However it has never been crowded that much... so who cares.
0	1523189750	2	Mazal Tov!
0	1523208199	1	We need to be getting active in r/cryptocurrency. This subreddit is not the best place to spread bch to new folks for many reasons. Mainly because the name is r/btc. This is a great sub in which to share info and build morale but it is not the place to sow the seeds for the next crop of bitcoiners...that field is r/cryptocurrency.
0	1523210463	1	I got banned from there. Seems like an easy way to lower the subscription
0	1523201882	1	Litecoin just a copy and paste of Bitcoin Core.  No USP.  At least Bitcoin Cash its own updates and Hardforks.  This is like the Bitcoin I knew in 2013.
0	1523207065	1	So you want every other coin to fail so yours can rise? The mentality of this sub is disgusting, Bitcoin Cash is a scamcoin, litecoin & bitcoin will always be superior. Twitter already shutdown your scam account, only a matter of time before this sub shuts down for fraud. :)

1	1523207385	1	By the way, I don’t care about the other coins but it’s interesting to see that Bitcoin Cash development is outperforming coins that have been there since the beginning.
