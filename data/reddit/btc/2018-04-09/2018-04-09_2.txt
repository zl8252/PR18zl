0	1523277743	41	the old @bitcoin doesn't exist, what you see on mobile is cache
1	1523291729	10	When in doubt, blame it on blockstream. /s
2	1523296680	0	That's actually pretty good advice.
0	1523278030	55	It looks like the account now says it is being operated by a Russian: >"My name is Andrei from Moscow Russia 🇷🇺 Меня зовут Андрей и я из Москвы, Россия!"
1	1523280466	20	Thanks, Twitter. /s
1	1523284393	12	Seemed to be a Turkish person previously... very strange.
0	1523281487	15	wtf is going on there
0	1523281101	42	Report the account as hacked to twitter.
1	1523286796	7	Done
1	1523284592	8	Can’t. When I try to report I get an error. 
0	1523280688	19	I seriously dont understand how they are doing what they are doing with that account. I followed it yesterday when it was public, and now today when i went to look at it im not following anymore. Wtf is going on? How can one user force another to unfollow them? I realize you can be blocked, but that just hides tweets. Also, as another user so astutely pointed out yesterday, the "@bitcoin" acct that [Ver was seeing on his end](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8apt24/bitcoin_twitter_account_is_back_online_but_all_of/dx0j7pr/) was actually the user "[@Bitcoinsbsh7](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8apt24/bitcoin_twitter_account_is_back_online_but_all_of/dx0n2e7/)"; so one account was actively masking another account, but only when being viewed by one user, Roger Ver. Now, it seems that account's information "Bitcoinsbsh7" is being used to mask the @Bitcoin handle for me too, but they've changed [their bio and profile pic.](https://imgur.com/YpNVjdy) 
1	1523287590	8	The old account was apparently suspended/deleted. Somebody snapped it up when the name became free.
2	1523288288	12	> name became free.This isn't supposed to be possible.At least I thought that's what twitter rules state.
3	1523288450	19	it isn't possible. Unless you know, of course, the owner of Twitter invests millions of dollars in your shady fucking company a few weeks prior to this happening
4	1523294076	4	We don't know how much money Jack invested. He was part of a group of 11 that invested a total of $2.5M. He is worth over $3B, and has invested in many startups, most of which were larger investments and more significant startups (like Intercom and Kickstarter) - does he have a history of "stealing" related Twitter accounts for those investments?
5	1523296424	3	people love to downvote things that are true & rational here
3	1523288378	3	I am just surprised that twitter figured out that blocks were ineffective to private browsers.
4	1523288650	4	I wanna know what the 540+ tweets are...
2	1523289801	1	Has to of been hacked. A suspended / deleted name cannot be reused. They must of renamed the real @bitcoin to @bitcoi or something, and then made a new account in place of @bitcoin.
2	1523287909	2	Yes I know. What I'm talking about is far more complex than "Hey why did @Bitcoin change?"
1	1523291962	5	The events seems to be:* @Bitcoin account got suspended* The @Bitcoin handle was transferred the account @Bitcoinsbsh7* The @Bitcoin handle was transferred to a newly registered account, tweeting in Turkish* The new account got suspended* The @Bitcoin handle was transferred back to the account @Bitcoinsbsh7 again.
2	1523296018	1	Who is transferring it though? Sysadmin at twitter?
0	1523290583	7	What I particularly don't understand is how this account can be "Joined February 2013". It means they perhaps reverted to some previous owner/email?
1	1523296782	2	You can change your Twitter handle. Someone that was already registered since 2013 changed their handle to @Bitcoin.
2	1523297656	1	Ah, yes. Thanks. 
0	1523278679	7	Oh joy, they have a database now.
0	1523281234	3	Merhaba. 
0	1523296483	1	super weird
0	1523292633	0	Time to stop using Twitter
0	1523291809	-4	@bcash is still available
