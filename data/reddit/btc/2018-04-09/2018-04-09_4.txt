0	1523250518	33	This has been kind of a tricky one for me, too, because I'm already a math geek and it just doesn't make any sense at all.But the math checks out. The sims work, and yes, *on paper*, it's possible to execute. But there are a load of caveats and the most interesting one is the overhead.The question isn't just "is it possible" but "is it economically rational". That is to say, can you make more money from the same investment by doing that rather than honest mining?The answer is no, and it's because of overhead. You see, as Emin so ineloquently states, > The key insight behind the selfish mining strategy is to force the honest miners into performing wasted computationsand, as you've pointed out previously, a selfish miner would necessarily have to also perform wasted computations in order to do this. It's all in the paper, and we agree that this is the case.But even for the "optimal" hashpower of 38%, which can net an actual 43% of the chain control when selfish mining is employed, about 9% of the total blocks produced by the selfish miner are wasted. In other words, the amount of hashpower used to generate that 43% is *greater* than what would be required to get 38% of the honest blocks. Yes, on paper it's "more" - but it's also "less". All the models like to generate "until the honest chain is X height" but I ran my simulation differently: I generated X blocks and got a result height for that same hashpower that *could* generate X honest blocks. So yes, selfish mining can give you a *larger share of* the blocks, but it's still going to give you *less for the same investment*.Besides all that; it hurts the honest miners more than the selfish miner, but it hurts users and applications the most by destroying the reliability of 1 confirmation with all those reorgs (about 20% of blocks).
1	1523251015	10	> But even for the "optimal" hashpower of 38%, which can net an actual 43% of the chain control when selfish mining is employed, about 9% of the total blocks produced by the selfish miner are wasted.They're only wasted temporarily before the difficulty re-adjusts to a lower difficulty based on all the orphaning and everyone ends up proportionally with the number of blocks they would have been rewarded (though for the SM this is now for 43% hash power instead of the actual 38% hash power).
2	1523251219	5	No, in order to maintain the 43% share, the strategy must be employed continuously and blocks must be wasted. If you ease up and start mining normally, the honest miners aren't being orphaned anymore and you lose the edge. Difficulty affects everyone.
3	1523251422	8	What's your point? It doesn't matter that blocks get wasted if you are rewarded a greater percent of blocks for pursuing the strategy. 
4	1523251660	7	The point is a greater percent of the blocks when 25% of the total blocks produced are being orphaned is still less *blocks* than the number of honest blocks that same hashpower can produce without selfish-mining-forced orphanage afflicting the network. The revenue for selfish mining is not attractive. Driving the difficulty down doesn't help; you still have to waste the hashpower to maintain the edge - more hashpower than is needed to get the same number of blocks honestly.
5	1523251926	6	If 25% of the blocks produced are being orphaned then effectively the network has 25% percent less hash power (as far as the DAA is concerned). The difficulty will adjust down so that enough blocks are being found such that we can continue to lose 25% of the blocks due to SM orphaning, but we now have enough blocks that don't get orphaned that we're finding a block every 10 minutes. Doesn't matter that the SM needs to keep pursuing this strategy to maintain his edge.
6	1523253024	8	As far as the DAA is concerned, yes, but as far as the miner is concerned, the hashpower is still being consumed and wasted! The effective difficulty of selfish mining is higher than the actual difficulty (which is why the DAA would adjust downward, and this effective difficulty penalizes honest miners more). All those orphaned blocks represent wasted hashpower, because every one is a perfectly valid block that didn't get confirmed on account of using the selfish mining strategy. If you compare apples-to-apples, over time, you will see that the DAA (either BTC or BCH) will not adjust enough to yield more blocks than what *would have been honestly mined with the same proportion of hashpower*. The number of blocks confirmed by selfish mining never exceeds the number of blocks that potentially would have been mined honestly with the same share of the network. The waste always exceeds the gain.
7	1523253836	6	Remember that what really matters in the end is revenue. The SM gets a disproportionate share of blocks but that in and of itself is not valuable. You have to also consider the total number of blocks discovered to determine if the SM strategy is +EV in terms of revenue.Another way of thinking about it is that after difficulty adjusts downward each block found requires less hash power than before, and by an amount that offsets the total increase in hash power wasted on orphaned blocks (by SM and HM).
8	1523277745	4	> Remember that what really matters in the end is revenue.Precisely. This is why I compare *what was earned* versus *what could have been earned with the same hashpower* in my sims. The initial hashpower consumed is capable of producing more than you could earn over time by continuously selfish mining. It works *on paper* but in reality the stars have to align for months at a time before the selfish miner actually gets a profit.
8	1523296660	1	No profit matters.
9	1523297938	1	You're correct of course. I was assuming that hardware costs are sunk and electricity costs are fixed and using revenue as a proxy for profit. But yeah, profit is what really matters.
7	1523254505	3	So the orphan rate for the SM is much smaller than the orphan rate for HMs, so as difficulty adjusts the SM converges towards profitability. As a toy example we'll imagine it being immediately profitable on difficulty adjustment. I.e. imagine a 50% orphan rate for HMs (way too high but bear with me) and a 10% orphan rate for SMs. First time around maybe SM with 33.4% of the hashpower gets 334 of 1000 blocks, of which 33.4 are wasted. Difficulty adjusts for a global orphan rate of 36.64%, next time around there's 1578 blocks during the same time period, SM gets 527.052 of the blocks after the DA, 52.7052 of them get orphaned, but the figure still immediately makes up for the 33.4 blocks it had to waste and then some. 
8	1523277633	2	These numbers aren't realistic. They don't align with my sim at all. By the time the DA hits, the SM has already burned out 25% more hashpower than he would have to get the same number of blocks. Making back that lost effort while continuing to burn hashpower never turns out profitable *compared to what would have been earned honestly*.
9	1523295323	1	Publish a paper on this then, because you'll have disproven the math of the paper, which even Geekmonk now says is accurate.Hint: your sim is probably wrong.
7	1523256318	2	The blocks wasted earlier can be compensated later, it is unclear to me when will the total blocks by SM exceed the number he would've mined if he's 100% honest. 4032 blocks? 6048 blocks? We have people building sims to account for that, let's see if anything comes out of that.
8	1523277524	1	My sims never broke even. The initial cost doesn't get made up, it's just a black hole of blocks that gets bigger as you keep selfishly mining.
9	1523281601	1	Can you share those sims? Because, as you [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8a0t74/mea_culpa_there_was_a_mistake_in_my_last_proof/dwx0xhn/?context=3):> Please share your simulation code. If you don't have any, I will assume you are blowing smoke.
8	1523256785	1	u/contrarian__ wrote a simulation that showed profitability in a day on the BCH chain due to the faster DAA. I think it took 2 months on BTC?
9	1523283622	2	[Here](https://repl.it/repls/SpringgreenGenerousDecagon) it is. The time it takes to become profitable is sensitive to alpha, but generally for alpha > 0.4, it's profitable within about a day on BCH.
7	1523257091	2	Hi, any chance you can explain how the selfish miner waste hash power? I cannot understand how, once the selfish miner has the longest chain an publish it, it get rewards for all his work. I am wrong? Am I missing something?Thks?
8	1523268367	3	The selfish miner can lose blocks when he/she/it never had more than 1 block lead.
8	1523277477	1	Selfish Mining strategies do *not* always publish the longest chain they have. Sometimes they hide it and release it in stages later to get other miners to waste their effort. Sometimes they wait until the last second to push it to the network. Sometimes they hide a block and simply get outhashed, wasting that power.
9	1523279492	2	Thanks,Seem indeed like a rather impractical and risky (loss of block rewards) way to attack the network.
7	1523284683	1	Excellent analysis.
6	1523256420	2	If the difficulty gets adjusted downward due to what the Selfish Miner is doing then you just reversed the problem.  Now honest mining at the new lower difficulty is that much more profitable.  So you slightly change the problem, but when you account for the increased profits to honest mining at the lowered difficulty then you still get no gain for the SM.  You can't keep comparing the Selfish Miner to the Honest Miner before the Selfish Miner started his shenanigans.  Take everything into account and compare the profits.  If you drastically lower difficulty then honest mining becomes drastically more profitable.  Bitcoin is a lever.  Push one side down, the other goes up.  That's what makes it work, how it balances incentives.  I feel like almost everyone in crypto (and apparently a lot of this sub) has forgotten that it is through incentives that Bitcoin set itself apart.  That is the only thing new that Bitcoin brought that previous "cryptos" from years past were lacking.
7	1523257798	2	My understanding is this:When SM begins concealing blocks they mine a disproportionately high percentage of blocks relative to their hash rate. Block concealing causes both SM and HM to orphan more blocks. Consequently, the effective overall hash rate drops.Blocks take longer than 10 minutes to mine on average and aggregate revenue (HM + SM) is reduced accordingly. The SM now has a larger piece of a smaller pie.Then the DA kicks in and difficulty adjusts down. Block discovery time is restored to its normative rate (6 blocks per hour) which means aggregate revenue returns to its expected value.At this point hash rate, expected block time and aggregate revenue are unchanged relative to before SM started. The SM has a larger piece of an equivalently-sized pie.The system displays the following changes:1) The SM mines a disproportionately high number of blocks.2) The SM receives disproportionately high revenue.3) The difficulty rate is lower.4) Network security is reduced, because work spent on orphaned blocks (by HM and SM) is wasted from a security POV.
8	1523258052	3	Of course, the real question is whether it could ever be rational to SM in practice. That will depend on factors outside of the scope of the SM paper such as how the HM and other actors in the system respond when they believe SM is being employed.But to answer that we need to first understand the basic mechanics of the strategy.
7	1523256890	1	>If the difficulty gets adjusted downward due to what the Selfish Miner is doing then you just reversed the problem. Now honest mining at the new lower difficulty is that much more profitable. It is not because the honest miners are having a greater than normal amount of their blocks orphaned both before and after the difficulty adjustment. See my [toy example](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8avoa3/psa_i_have_been_down_the_sm_rabbit_hole_for_weeks/dx239za/) here.
7	1523285248	1	> If you drastically lower difficulty then honest mining becomes drastically more profitableYes, intuition indicates this, but the selfish mining attack nerfs this effect by forcing the honest miners to orphan a greater percentage of their blocks than the selfish miner. It's only a nerf, though; honest miners that stupidly stick with it will only see slightly decreased revenues. Honest miners that respond to the attack by ceasing mining activity yield more hashpower to the selfish miner, causing him to approach the 51% threshold and forcing him to either stop mining selfishly or risk being a central point of failure.The model only works if you assume that 100% of honest miners will continue mining in the adverse condition of high orphanage for a long period of time. I find this highly unlikely, to say the least. As you say: Bitcoin is a lever.
6	1523253227	1	My math is rusty but I believe this is correct. The SM first locks in a higher than expected share of blocks mined. This results in a temporary loss in revenue (for all miners). But then difficulty adjusts downward and revenue increases.

0	1523252859	10	I was very critical of earlier material you posted on this topic so I'd be remiss not to say kudos for this. And thanks too because you motivated me to reread the paper more carefully than I had done in the past.
0	1523248497	21	Thank you for admitting the math checks out. Any article or tweet that purports to tell you that a peer-reviewed scientific paper that has been around for 5 years and has been cited over 400 times has an elementary math error should be regarded skeptically.>the price of the coin would probably be affected, so no miner has an incentive to be selfish or their revenue would collapse;This is true only if the attack is detected. How easily the attack could be detected is up for debate. Moreover, if we didn't even know about the attack--if the paper had never been published--then this would be completely untrue. So rhetoric that the SM paper is a cancer seems uncalled for and anti-science. >In the SM paper possible reactions of HM are not considered. Since it is extremely easy for other miners to see when a pool is mining selfishly, it is very likely that in real world honest miners will take measures against selfish miners;Have these solutions been included in the code? There's a difference between the proposition that rationally miners *should* be running code that has feature x and miners *are* running code that has feature x. I think we can all agree that BTC miners *should* have run code with bigger blocks years ago rationally, but they aren't. If the rhetoric from camp 2 is that the [selfish-mining paper is pseudo-scientific nonsense that can't happen](https://www.yours.org/content/the-cancer-in-bitcoin-e75381d0fd75) so nothing needs to be done, then your suggestion that miners will be running code that can react to SM is inherently less likely.
1	1523287729	2	I also wonder how the the assumptions change as Bitcoin Cash changes.For instance, does SM remain impractical in the real world as Bitcoin Cash moves toward all nodes except miners being SPV?
2	1523296044	0	They don't
3	1523296137	1	Ok, can you prove that? 
4	1523296772	1	Not formally but if you consider the discussion that's been had so far, 0 hash power nodes have been shown to only get in the way of the mining network as far as SM is concerned, not provide a benefit to it.
1	1523256531	4	Another thing: >Since it is extremely easy for other miners to see when a pool is mining selfishlyIs absolutely, insanely nonsense, unless mining turns into a permissioned operation. Public pools are necessarily visible (they advertise their presence on the blockchain!), and they probably won't pull this strategy for fear of chaos/miner flee anyway. But anonymous, giant-farm mining is an entirely different story. And no, you cannot censor them - unless you choose to make mining permissioned. Disrupting connections don't work, since blocks can be easily propagated via relaying, and the benefits exceeds the additional orphan risk a lot. 
2	1523261942	6	> Disrupting connections don't work, since blocks can be easily propagated via relayingI'm not entirely sure this holds up if mining is viewed as a small world network.
3	1523262589	4	Relaying increases latency slightly and decreases profits slightly, which is lethal in an equilibrium over the long term. But in the short term, since the benefits are so significant it vastly outweighs the propagation penalty.And in any case, the small world network is incomplete ("near-complete") at best and theoretical babble at worst. There's only incentives for it, but no evidence in real measurements (might be impossible to obtain anyway, unless all miners volunteer their node data) has been put forth. 
0	1523256197	14	Very well said.The equations in the paper may check out, but there are obviously variables missing, which is the problem.This is the equivalent of the entrepeneur that plans his business off a P&L sheet and doesn't do a SWAT analysis. On paper his business will be profitable, the math on the P&L checks out, but he's trying to sell a product that there is no market for. The business will fail, even though the math said it would be profitable. Because there were other variables that were not considered.For the SM math to be absolutely complete, the probabilities of possible outcomes from the act of selfish mining also need to be calculated, including how the market would react.And **profit needs to be properly defined**. There's no point mining all the blocks if the the reward doesn't cover the electricity bill due to market reaction to the act of mining selfishly. This is a pretty major variable to skip over, considering that profit is the goal and motivation to mine selfishly.I'm pretty amazed that all these super intelligent people have all missed this major point. The argument should not be about the result of the formula, when the formula is incomplete. It's flawed from the start.
1	1523258900	10	>And profit needs to be properly defined. There's no point mining all the blocks if the value dropped to zero due to market reaction to the act of mining selfishly. This is a pretty major variable to skip over, considering that profit is the goal and motivation to mine selfishly.Precisely.I got in a debate re this topic two days ago in which an obviously educated engineer started to take issue with my notion that, if you owe someone four dollars, that means you have "negative four dollars". He argued that was bullshit, that dollars are real things and you cannot *possibly* be in possession of fewer than zero.I'm sure he thinks he made a *stellar* point but anyone who's taken first semester accounting will point out that his "model" of how money works will leave him destitute in the real world *every* time by failing to properly model debt.  Even though "the math checks out."
2	1523259286	4	There is a baseline, being the cost to mine the block. If the reward doesn't cover that, then there is no point mining the block.Where is that in the math?
0	1523263502	5	You are so right. I have deliberately refrained from engaging in this for the exact reasons you present. Thank you for being a voice against this toxicity. 
0	1523256051	13	TL;DR: Selfish mining "works" as long as we presume a broken model that isn't actually indicative of reality because **it leaves out the incentive system that is the actual heart and soul of Nakamoto Consensus.**For example, this is the @jessquit formula for finding the volume of a sphere:V = 500By this formula you will find that all spheres have a volume of 500, regardless of the actual size of the sphere and the units were talking about. The size of all spheres is 500.There is no *math* error being made. V is 500. That's an extremely straightforward equation. "The math checks out." Therefore I must be correct.As long as you don't care whether or not the math you're using actually models reality, you can prove anything.
1	1523282289	4	An alternative TL;DR: https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jan_L._A._van_de_Snepscheut> In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.Great post by the way.
1	1523291732	2	Great post. This is incidentally how a lot of theories are pushed which are bunkum in the world today. Unfortunately people who have no real education in _thinking_ think that as long as the math checks out it's all good.
0	1523252485	5	> I think both camps can agree that while SM is possible on paper, it is safe, at least for now, to not consider it as a real world scenario.I disagree with that conclusion. Considering the complexity of the material. Considering the misunderstandings and mistakes that were made. Better conclusion would be:**We should consider it as a real world scenario.** Keep our eyes out. Keep thinking up variations of the attack vector. Make tests to confirm what does and doesn't work. Be vigilant.The attacker may not even be using math. They might simply try a whole bunch of seemingly logical approaches in an A/B test manner. See what works. See if it increases their profits. They might already have succeeded?If some attacker is running a successful model today that is undetectable. What do you think their response would be if people are addressing the issue?If we can improve the integrity of the protocol without sacrificing the utility of Bitcoin. It deserves our serious consideration.
1	1523258411	1	If an attacker wants to attempt an unprofitable attack, then why do we need to worry? Since it's unprofitable, it can't be sustainable.
2	1523262297	4	Because it's just "best practice" to always worry about security and integrity of the system. Always assume the worst.  Same reason you want people to worry about the security and integrity of OSX, Linux and Windows. Even the best time-tested robust code deserves to be reevaluated from time to time. That's how you ensure quality. The empirical proof that this whole debacle has provided is this:There is big misunderstanding surrounding SM. The material is complicated. So complicated it even takes great minds like Vitalik to come and chime in. With this level of uncertainty we are not in a position to make any conclusions with confidence. SM deserves our consideration. Now, if somebody proposes a solution to SM that might constrain/compromise/complicate Bitcoin and its utility in certain other ways. That's a good time to be highly critical of that solution. And rigorously discuss the costs/benefits.
3	1523265652	5	>Because it's just "best practice" to always worry about security and integrity of the system. Always assume the worst.  This overlooks the fact that an attacker willing to lose money to harm the system even at a risk to coin value isn't a "selfish miner" trying to earn a greater than expected profit, **he's a network attacker trying to harm the entire system.**First off, this would itself be a repudiation of the SM paper, which presents SM as a way to earn better-than-expected returns on hashpower.More importantly, *Bitcoin has no defense whatsoever against a heavy-hashpower dishonest miner willing to attack the network at a loss in the first place*. Such a miner would be much better served mining empty blocks.
4	1523267629	4	> This overlooks the fact that an attacker willing to lose money to harm the system even at a risk to coin value isn't a "selfish miner" trying to earn a greater than expected profit, he's a network attacker trying to harm the entire system.No, I'm not overlooking/discarding anything. My primary concern would be that an attacker achieves better-than-expected returns (covertly). But I think there's a whole range of variations and combinations that might benefit the attacker in different ways. I'm open to anything. My point is: The effort should always be towards proving the system is insecure. Not towards proving the system is safe. The latter doesn't make sense. Stop it. 
5	1523269630	4	The effort should be towards finding truth. That's what I'm doing. If one must ignore the incentive system to make the case, then nothing has been demonstrated.
6	1523271999	3	There's finding your truth. Then there's promoting your truth. geekmonk is not in a position to do that. To decide what "both camps can agree upon". You can find the truth. But nobody is in a position to **make conclusions** and call for other people to discard their concerns. What you should be doing is try to demonstrate how SM *can* work. Make the tests. And see them fail. That's how you add empirical evidence that SM theory is impossible: "We tested X and it failed". You guys are trying to disprove a super complicated theory even before it's fully explored and tested.I don't understand why anybody - with good intentions - would be motivated to prove that something is impossible.
7	1523273776	3	Proving a negative doesn't work like that.SM is the extraordinary claim, since it doesn't appear to be borne out in reality after nine years of mining. We should require the extraordinary evidence of **it.**Moreover, it's trivial to point at that paper, observe clearly that it makes no attempt to model the effect of hurtful behavior on the incentive system, and recognize that it therefore proves almost nothing, even if it's right about everything else. Which is why the SM paper never held any weight to begin with in my opinion.
8	1523278555	3	It's just how it is. The status quo being that we have a system - as it is - and some group of people who shared some mathematical theory about it years ago.This discussion isn't adding value to the status quo. Unless you come up with something tangible, stop making a fuss over it.
2	1523291497	2	It is profitable? The entire thread talks about how it's profitable.
3	1523292013	1	It's only "profitable" (and then, just barely more profitable than HM, and then only for certain miners under certain circumstances) if you presume that there are **no** repercussions from selfish mining.
4	1523293150	1	> if you presume that there are no repercussions from selfish mining.I've never seen a detailed, well written strategy to counter the selfish mining. People talk about Honest Miner's reaction, but not in a structured way. If you mean to say it can not be profitable due to HM reaction, then you need to show how HM can definitively identify the selfish miner (assuming SM is anonymous) and present definitive counter strategies.All I see from Camp 2 is waving their hands saying "economic incentives! hm can react!" et al, but never a paper detailing how the hm would find out about it and react to it properly.Note that I'm not saying SM strategy is a threat. Even though theoretically possible, miners are not some adventure seeking teens. Just the possibility of the coin going down in value is not gonna be worth it for them to try it on a big cryptocurrency like BTC or BCH imo.
5	1523293770	1	>  miners are not some adventure seeking teens. Just the possibility of the coin going down in value is not gonna be worth it for them to try it on a big cryptocurrency like BTC or BCH imo.Now why is this so obvious to you?  Honest question.
0	1523252084	5	*yawn* i have no idea why people get so worked up about this topic
1	1523254102	13	Yeah, it seems to be an academic pissing contest rather than a credible attack vector. Classic divide and conquer techniques. Beware of anyone trying to splinter BCH into two camps over some hot-button issue. The same tactic was already used to destroy BTC. 
2	1523254588	4	> Yeah, it seems to be an academic pissing contest rather than a credible attack vector. Whoever said developers had big egos should spend some time in academia.Trouble starts with titles such as "Chief Scientist"
1	1523256144	1	Because it can be used to attack people and working projects.
2	1523256768	1	same as it could past 9 years.  No big deal really
1	1523268044	1	The only economical reason I can come up with is that there's a group already benefiting from SM somehow. They have something to lose.
0	1523252699	2	> 1) Camp 2 trying to discredit the maths in Camp 1's reference paper. This is wrong imo, the model is rock solid as of today.> 3) Trolls of Camp 1 attacking trolls of Camp 2 and vice versa. These debates are personal, superficial and irrelevant. An early warning signal that the discussion is getting toxic and is time to quit is when they start referring to each other with the names of the respective figureheads ("Craig", "Emin").Yeah but these are not really distinct categories.  Dismissing the theoretical model behind SM is pretty much just trolling.It seems hard to say for sure how practical it is until there's a sustained market crash that actually threatens to put miners out of business (say, lasting longer than one generation of ASICs).  There could conceivably be a rational SM attack at that time despite there not being a rational 51% attack (or both, or neither).

Emotionally I'd love to see a vocal Big blocker to be Satoshi, have a strong leader in the Bitcoin space sharing my opinions on bigger blocks, use-full money, on-chain scaling. That would be awesome. But alas. This is not about discussion events or personalities, this is about false ideas bringing us farther away from truth/reason and science. As does this weird SM witch-hunt. So I'm pro science, anti bullshit and cults around personalities. But go ahead, pretend it is the other way around. 
4	1523268440	8	I agree 100% he's a bullshitter.However if he is correct about mining being a nearly fully connected graph, then that's one of the most important things most of us will have ever learned about Bitcoin, with profound implications across the board.What's more - even though I think Craig acts like an ass and a buffoon, and isn't a very good public speaker, and moreover, I just don't like the cut of his jib - I think his argument that mining is fully connected is an argument that has actual merit.
5	1523272245	4	> However if he is correct about mining being a nearly fully connected graph, then that's one of the most important things most of us will have ever learned about Bitcoin, with profound implications across the board.I always assumed Bitcoin worked like that. Orphan's cost money, so why would any miner connect through random nodes? Not sure what the discovery here is.It also pertains to the centralisation of the network. Although you still can't ever get 20 ms propagation of blocks. That's still absurd. 
6	1523274043	2	> you still can't ever get 20 ms propagation of blocksPlease show me the quote where anyone said that you could get global block propagation to all miners in 20 ms.

8	1523278650	2	Yeah turns out nobody said what you suggest they said. That article makes a slew of assumptions about what the author *presumes was intended*, then attacks those assumptions.That's called a strawman.Why don't you find the quote that backs up the claim you made?Look man, if he made the claim you say was made, find it, so that I can agree with you please.
9	1523279778	2	It clearly shows CsW's remark. 20ms zero conf verification. That implies 20ms communication is possible at all on a global scale. So that makes no sense regardless of how you look at it. 
3	1523276035	1	> Dave and HalDave who? I **really** hope you’re not referring to Kleiman. 
4	1523278922	1	Why is that, was he the one that actually figured out Satoshi's error?  I thought that error was discovered later.
5	1523281218	1	No, I'm objecting to the seeming general acceptance of Kleiman as an 'early bitcoiner'. There is not a *shred* of evidence, apart from fake Craig-documents that Kleiman had *absolutely anything* to do with bitcoin, let alone had a hand in its inception. As far as I can tell, Craig's just using his dead friend as convenient cover for his ridiculous story, which, if true, is utterly abhorrent. I'm open to evidence, though, if you can find any.Also, the 'longest' chain thing is not the only error in the whitepaper. [Here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02867.pdf) is a paper discussing Satoshi's simplified (slightly wrong) math used to calculate the probabilities of a certain attack in chapter 11. I have my suspicions that this is what Craig is trying to talk about in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/dwkodky/) technobabble. 
3	1523263993	-1	It wasn't obvious to anyone, even the authors of the paper who called in "counter-intuitive".  Probably because it only works in peoples heads, not in the real world.
2	1523260626	7	He gets the big picture and the economics better than any of the boffins he argues with, if you ask me. That's the thing ,CSW understands the real world. He may mess up some details but he spots the fallacies a mile away that some of the boffins miss. The boffins use their models but their models don't reflect the real world.BTW I don't mean all boffins there are plenty of boffins here who get both.This is what happened with Bitcoin too. Smart people had long before worked most of it out. Satoshi saw the big picture. He saw what would make it work in the real world. The economic incentives
3	1523261534	3	Weird, I haven't seen CsW say anything new or smart. He parrots, and he says things which do not make sense. Seriously. I haven't met anyone who understand Bitcoin AND thinks highly of CsW. I mean the creator of Bitcoin Cash doesn't think very highly of him. Maybe you don't understand the arguments, but at least pause to think who despises CsW and who doesn't. 
4	1523263824	1	M'eh... if you really had something worth saying you would have avoided the thinly veiled ad homs. 
5	1523264285	2	Do you even know what an ad hominem is? I give you a hint: It's the opposite of attacking someones arguments and what someone says, especially if that's the problem in the first place. 💁🏻‍♂️

0	1523246831	5	How do you know SM has never happened? 
1	1523248394	6	There would be many orphaned blocks, it it was successful.
2	1523249433	6	this is why it's easy to detect /u/zectro
3	1523249662	3	Maybe. [This was discussed in 2014 by Ittay and Emin](http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/01/15/detecting-selfish-mining/):>Number of abandoned (orphaned) blocks is a strong indicator of selfish mining activity. The entire idea behind selfish mining is for the selfish pool to outcompete the work of the honest pool. And this will leave behind a series of discarded blocks, where either the honest guy's work was wasted, or the miner took a slight risk and failed. Since every block race will leave such detritus behind in its wake, one could just count the number of such abandoned blocks to see if the rate is stable over time. A rise in the rate would indicate that a selfish mining pool is operating in the network.>The problem with this approach is that abandoned blocks are pruned inside the Bitcoin network, so it is very difficult to get a definitive count. A measurement tool that connects to the network from just one or a few vantage points may very well miss abandoned blocks, and it may erroneously give the impression that everything is fine when there are fierce battles being fought out inside the network. I am not sure how well blockchain.info is connected, but no web service can be everywhere at once to detect every single orphan, so I take its count of orphans with a large grain of salt.
4	1523258579	2	>>The problem with this approach is that abandoned blocks are pruned inside the Bitcoin network, so it is very difficult to get a definitive count. ... if you have no hashpower.  If you have hashpower, then you are "inside the network" and party to the "battles" playing out.Ittay / Sirer inadvertently make a point here regarding the small-world nature of mining and the difficulty trying to participate, even as an observer, as a nonmining node.
5	1523259301	1	What point are you getting at here?
6	1523259564	2	Miners have ultrafast connections to one another over Corrallo's FIBRE network and others. If you aren't playing ball, you can't get into the field to watch the game.
7	1523259628	1	Okay. I'm just trying to figure out how this relates to the SM. I guess this is the ongoing discussion of the proper value of gamma.
8	1523260286	3	Craig's (and I hate to even say his name because of the auto-bias effect) presentation discussed ways that small-world mining changes fundamental assumptions about the way the network works. His gamma comment was in that context.Small-world / fully-connected has really been at the root of many of Craig's arguments (since he showed up on my radar anyway), and while I find many things objectionable about Craig, in this regard I remain of the opinion that he has an *extremely* important point that many people are missing in their attempts to discredit him, at their own risk.That's why I prefer to take the position that he's already discredited but this point still bears deep investigation.
9	1523263020	1	I'm not sure what to make about Craig's claim that there's no way to increase gamma with 0 hash power Sybil nodes. I suspect it's untrue--and this might in part be bias against the source as you say--but it may be true. What I know from reading the selfish mining paper though, is that adding these nodes can never hurt the selfish miner; and they can be completely removed without really altering any aspect of the paper. It was a minor aside in the paper that has been blown up into a giant straw-man of the paper as far as I can tell. When the paper was released in 2013 FIBRE wasn't even a thing. Maybe with that pre-FIBRE network topology what Emin and Itay said made sense, but now it doesn't. We should move on because it's unimportant. In the SM algorithm, when the SM's private chain was one block ahead of the public chain but the public chain just found a new block, the approach is to immediately broadcast the private chain to other miners in the hopes that one of them will see the SM's chain before the public chain and mine on that. Are you really convinced that there is no way for the SM to ever win the race against any HM? That would mean gamma would be 0, no honest miners are mining the SMs equal-length chain. I'm not so sure about that, but Craig may well be right that gamma is very small indeed, but I can't fathom he's right that gamma is negative. Can you explain that to me?

0	1523263251	1	The nicest part is seeing people like you go from Camp 2.0 to camp 1.6. It still rounds to 2 but at least it's possible to have meaningful discussions between Camp 1.2 and Camp 1.8 and you're in that range.I still see people from Camp 2.0 insisting the protocol is perfect because (hand waving) economic incentives. I agree that there are economic incentives in place but my take is that any improvement that reduces this potential exploits can only exacerbate the economic incentives and not mess with them. That is the case, in my opinion, of weak blocks. What's your opinion about weak blocks?
1	1523276582	1	Peter's presentation in SV made a lot of sense, at least for me. All I know on weak blocks is from that presentation. I wouldn't mind reading a good piece on weak blocks, link me one if you got anything.
2	1523277850	1	I don't have a good reference other than [the paper](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/resources/subchains.pdf) itself. All other sources are spread through reddit, foruns, etc and, sometimes, mixed with all the rage of the scaling debate.
0	1523273692	1	>Camp 2 There is the second camp, led by CSW who dismisses selfish mining as a real world possibility and has gone so far as to call it the cancer of bitcoin. The main reasons why SM is unlikely in practice are:1. the price of the coin would probably be affected, so no miner has an incentive to be selfish or their revenue would collapse;I would phrase this differently:There are three factors that could affects price:1. Short term decrease in block time2. Long and short term decrease in total hashpower3. The SM eating into other miners' margins possibly driving them out of businessSo the immediate question is: how do we model those factors?The answer is: we can't, we just don't know how those factors will affect the price and anybody who tells you that they can properly model the affects to the price are full of shit.So, as an owner of a multi-billion dollar mining operation would you risk your entire business on something that could increase your profits or destroy them and you can't assign a probability one way or the other? I think the answer is clear: you wont.
0	1523281857	1	Solid post, far too few like this these days. 
0	1523282206	1	I followed this only superficially because I don't get the math behind it. Given that you did take the time to investigate it, could you answer a couple of questions for me?1 - What's wrong with a miner getting 43% of the blocks with 38% of hash power? What is the consequence of this? 2 - How does this affect the users? Something wrong if Selfish Miners start appearing on the network from the user's point of view?3 - What happens if every miner is doing SM?
1	1523283805	1	1 - this proves that in the SM model selfish miners make more than their fair share. In other words, selfish mining strategy works because even though you have only 38% of the toral hashpower, you claim 43% of the blocks, when you would claim only 38% of the blocks if you followed the protocol. 2 - Likely no effecg to a slightly negative effect. If SM starts appearing then some transactions would become unreliable, 1 confirmation wouldn't be enough. Even 2 wouldn't be enough if selfish miners issued their blocks with different transactions. If selfish miners include the same transactions as HMs then users wouldn't notice any difference as far as I understand.3 - By definition there can only be 3 selfish mining pools at most, in that case everyone would lose money because for sm to make money there must be at least one HM pool
2	1523284744	1	> In other words, selfish mining strategy works because even though you have only 38% of the toral hashpower, you claim 43% of the blocks, when you would claim only 38% of the blocks if you followed the protocol.Let's be precise: they'd claim 43% of **the blocks that end up on the chain**, not 43% of all 'solved blocks'. The strategy only works because you orphan the HM blocks disproportionately more than the SM blocks. > Even 2 wouldn't be enough if selfish miners issued their blocks with different transactionsEven 10 wouldn't be enough, since large chain-reorgs would happen on the regular. Using your alpha of 0.38, **40 block** re-orgs would occur about once a month.
3	1523285274	1	>let's be precise: they would claim 43% of the blocks that end up on chainBecause of the DAA this can be ignored since after 48h the usual 6 blocks per hour will be added on chai and sm will claim 43% of that instead of 38%. So in the end it would be the same as claiming 43% of blocks with 38% hashpower by following the protocol in the previous difficulty. As long the model in the paper holds (markov chain) this remains true **on paper**.If SM includes the same transactions as HM in its blocks then it is my understanding that users wouldn't see any difference.
4	1523285523	1	> So in the end it would be the same as claiming 43% of blocks with 38% hashpower by following the protocol in the previous difficultyThey'd still only claim 38% of all the 'solved blocks' though in the new difficulty. The point is that we should be clear that it's *always* 43% of the blocks *on the chain* that the SM gets.> If SM includes the same transactions as HM in its blocks then it is my understanding that users wouldn't see any difference.Correct, but SM also introduces the chance for the selfish miners to make enormous double-spends themselves, potentially dozens of confirmations deep. 
5	1523285783	1	you are missing the point, re read what I have written.
6	1523285952	1	I obviously understand your point, since it's why I've been saying selfish mining works on paper (and you'd been denying!) but I'm saying you should be *clearer* about precisely what you mean. 
7	1523286342	1	No you don't get my point. It makes no sense to say "the number of blocks that end up on chain" it doesn't change a thing other than making it unprofitable for SM if the new level of difficulty were permanent. What matters is thatIn difficulty D SM has 38% of hashpower, and claims 38% of the 6 blocks published on chain every hour. In difficulty D' SM has 38% of hashpower, and claims 43% of the 6 blocks that are published on chain every hour. This is the whole poin. SM doesn't care that actually 10 blocks are mined every hour in D' and only 6 make it on chain because if he switches to following the protocol to claim those blocks then the system goes back to D and he goes back to claiming 38% of the 6 blocks  published every hour. This is what happens **on paper** supposing bitcoin is markov chain, that HM doesn't react and the coin price doesn't change.
8	1523286734	1	> It makes no sense to say "the number of blocks that end up on chain" it doesn't change a thing other than making it unprofitably for SM if the new level of difficulty were permanentI think you mean old level of difficulty. > In difficulty D SM has 38% of hashpower, and claim s 38% of the 6 blocks published on chain every hour.No, **fewer** than 6 blocks will be published **on chain** in an hour, but SM will still claim 43% of them. If you're counting 'totally solved', rather than "end up on chain", then this is correct, but your next sentence would be wrong.You're either using "on chain" inconsistently, or "published" inconsistently. 
9	1523286999	1	you still don't get what I'm saying. I never said more than 6 will be published on chain, I actually stressed out thay exactly 6 will be published on chain. And if we ignore the DA transition period, for the same hashpower SM claim + blocks by being selfish. You said let's point out "of the blocks published on chain" I said this is irrelevant, even though in D' SM would claim an even bigger absolute amount of blocks by being honest, that's still irrelevant because that state of the blockchain is not stable. The only thing SM cares of is the amount of the 6 blocks per hour published on chain that he claims.
0	1523287534	1	Hypothetical: Could conditions change if the mining difficulty were in steady decline, or even flat? As competition in the mining space is quite high and expanding is the focus of miners, adding more equipment to gain position. But once the difficulty curve eventually bends, perhaps from a halvening, we could see miners begin to centralize as smaller miners turn off equipment. Those remaining miners will then be looking for any means to optimize their throughput and margins. Could this create win-at-all-costs survival mentality? When left with no other option besides shutting down, they have the hashing volume and decide to SM as an exit strategy. I expect there will be indicators that will have the network on alert should these conditions present, so any such event will be routed around. But to this point in time we've really only seen optimistic/growth forces on the network's mining and haven't yet experienced the effects of pessimistic/decline.
0	1523295407	1	What about people that would engage in SM not for profit, but to disrupt.  Maybe that's not a good enough reason to justify the cost now, but in the future if much of the economy depends on it, then a group that wants to damage the world (such as terrorists) might be motivated to perform such an attack as the drop in value would be a profit to them.
0	1523296593	1	Under ideal circumstances "more than fare share" while making the pie smaller, yes. So not profitable. Besides all the mud slinging on all sides, one point raised is quite important. If you have hashrate x, at given difficulty you can never expect to find more blocks with your equipment. No matter what strategy you apply.

0	1523280937	1	Just to make sure you get that right, CSW's claim is that the math in the SM are wrong. See:https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/983216135087841280
1	1523281884	2	In the tweet he says>it is not a markov system at allIf you can prove that it is not a markov system then the math in paper collapses. As I said in the OP **as of today** the paper and its model stand. I can't speak of the future.
1	1523282664	1	My best guess is that Craig read [this article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/how-satoshi-messed-his-math-and-how-these-academics-just-fixed-it/) and is basing his technobabble on it.
2	1523294600	1	not technobabble, if you know what markov is then  you know the system stops being a markov chain from the moment HM realizes someone is selfish mining and starts taking precautions. The probability to the next state is not independent of previous states and cannot be calculated anymore. But there is no mathematical proof of non markov yet. So the model remains valid.
0	1523251529	0	As a Bitcoin Maximalist, Core, I can tell you there are many reasons to dislike EGS, but the selfish mining paper is not one of those reasons, and it's a bit ridiculous for you to insinuate that it would be.
0	1523262791	-1	Twitter nuked the @Bitcoin account, and here we have Craig Wright causing more infighting. This is a desperate attempt for him to take back his bogus claims, in the midst self-serving manner possible.Let's destroy some of these dumb arguments:1. The effect on coin price, if any, doesn't matter if the attacker is out to Detroit the coin, and has another coin with the same PoW to mine on.2. The measures against selfish mining are unspecified, and would presumably take the form of, either, Eyal and Sister's well-reasonef suggestions or some broken idea from CSW. Overall, the way Craig conducted this argument had been despicable. All of his tactics mirror Greg. BCH is not healthy until it manages to cut out three embarrassment known as Craig the conman, where the con is that he knows anything at all about the technical aspects of Bitcoin.
