1	1523254353	-12	True. I made my account because I was paid to. Obviously its impossible for someone on the *other side* of the debate to be passionate or hold a strong opinion otherwise.
2	1523257665	14	> True. I made my account because I was paid to. Obviously its impossible for someone on the *other side* of the debate to be passionate or hold a strong opinion otherwise.Well I have yet to hear an argument for small blocker that wasn’t FUD or appeal to authority.So yes I believe small blocker have no argument, why the censorship otherwise?
3	1523260003	-10	>Well I have yet to hear an argument for small blocker that wasn’t FUD or appeal to authority.So you're saying block propagation times are not affected by blocksize and that increased blocksizes don't favor larger mining pools. Or you're saying you had no idea about that issue. Either way that's embarrassingly ignorant. Again, either way that's an argument that isn't FUD or any appeal to authority. Now what?Edit: I'm for increasing the blocksize in Bitcoin, btw. I'm not for increasing it as the *only* solution because a smaller end blocksize is preferable.

5	1523288703	1	Did you in one comment say that all arguments against larger blocks are either FUD or an appeal to authority and then in the very next one cite Luke-jr as stating that compact blocks solve the latency issue as your reasoning?lol
6	1523294419	1	On purpose:)I thought other would notice,
5	1523263653	-9	>Yes, even luke-jr admitted with compacts block this is not an issue.Please show me where he states latency is no longer an issue thanks to compact blocks or Graphene....because neither of these have any affect on latency and its this which causes most of the issues with large block propagation. i.e block propagation with large blocks **remains** an issue in spite of these two developments.>The block relay scheme appears to misunderstand the objective; it focuses exclusively on bandwidth and talks about things like a 4x reduction -- but this is a reduction from 20,000 bytes to 5000 bytes-- a savings which seldom matters at all. But the goals for block relay should be to minimize latency and adding increased potential for round trips or massively increased cpu computation (as is the case here) doesn't achieve that goal. So again an argument that doesn't relate to FUD or an appeal to authority can still be found.P.S I upvoted your post for the useful information. I don't want to argue just to discuss.

The node just reconstruct the block form his mempool.Disconnecting the verification time form the number of tx (therefore the blocksize can increase without increasing verification time).>P.S I upvoted your post for the useful information.

8	1523270390	1	Well I am on a phone,I don’t keep track on all crazy thing luke-jr say.I whish I did for that one though, but good luck finding the comment againwas at least a year ago.
7	1523266567	-1	This is now beyond my level of understanding. Had I seen the links you provided and no rebuttal from someone who I know knows what they are talking about I would be as convinced as yourself. However the quote I provided was from Greg Maxwell and if he did said anything that was untrue it would be called out immediately as a means to discredit his technical ability, many people would jump at the chance, as it was not done one can assume what he was saying is almost certainly correct.If there has been a debate on this between him and another respected member of the community where he was proven wrong that would also suffice. Not just a random poster on r/btc, unless it turns out I'm speaking to a well known and established academic right now.
8	1523270230	3	>This is now beyond my level of understanding. To put it simply, latency came from time it take to propagate a block + the time it take to verify a block.This could be used by a dishonest miner, by building a specific block very large and very difficult to verify.That way the dishonest get a headstart by mining on top of his block while the rest of the network stay idle and can’t mine until the block is fully verifiedThis advantage increased the large mining operations you have therefore increasing centralisation.What graphene/Xthin/compact block does it to create a list of tx instead of sending the whole block.The miner just use the list to reconstruct the block from the list they have without needing to download the block (because nodes already have the transactions)The results is the latency time has become:* time to download the “list” (now only a fraction of the total block size* time to reconstruct the block (negligible)* time to verify tx (disappeared, tx was already verified by the node)Now latency is nearly no more affected by the blocksize.>Had I seen the links you provided and no rebuttal from someone who I know knows what they are talking about I would be as convinced as yourself. I am not sure what rebutal you are looking for?The link show graphene and how far block propagation optimisation can go.>However the quote I provided was from Greg Maxwell and if he did said anything that was untrue it would be called out immediately as a means to discredit his technical ability, many people would jump at the chance, as it was not done one can assume what he was saying is almost certainly correct.I am sorry but you are making yet another appeals to authority here.Gmax has been quote lying many times (like when it argue with me that 4MB WU was equal to 4MB under previous rules)Can you provide the link of your quote so I can understand what critic he makes.Saying that savings bandwidth is missing the point is a rather extraordinary statement.Coming from him I fully expect yet another FUD statment.>If there has been a debate on this between him and another respected member of the community where he was proven wrong that would also suffice. Not just a random poster on r/btc, unless it turns out I'm speaking to a well known and established academic right now.Do you realize you are making huge appeal to authority again.Bitcoin is open source, you can do you research yourself.And also remember Bitcoin as 10min block time.. there has been no orphan blocks for months.. clearly latency **is not** a problem.
9	1523271212	1	>Do you realize you are making huge appeal to authority again.I'm not trying to convince anyone at this point, merely explaining my own rationale. But I do see your point. Your explanation makes sense to me, but you might find this interesting:-https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7b42ze/unullc_greg_maxwell_about_graphene_any_counter/No one could counter it, some were agreeing with Greg reluctantly and then it was mysteriously deleted. I'm inclined to believe what he is saying.>I read this paper a couple months ago when it showed up on arxiv, my commentary at the time:Might have been good work if it got good advice about system requirements; but it seems it didn't.It has two main parts; a block relay scheme and a restructuring of the p2p network.The block relay scheme appears to misunderstand the objective; it focuses exclusively on bandwidth and talks about things like a 4x reduction -- but this is a reduction from 20,000 bytes to 5000 bytes-- a savings which seldom matters at all. But the goals for block relay should be to minimize latency and adding increased potential for round trips or massively increased cpu computation (as is the case here) doesn't achieve that goal. Moreover, in settings where statefulness is acceptable (E.g. in our blocksat relay) and a difference of a few thousands bytes might matter other schemes can already transmit blocks in a few hundred bytes on average (template differencing, in particular-- my older code for it which has to treat all segwit txn as a template miss codes current blocks to a mean size of 686 bytes per block, not including the coinbase txn), much smaller than the approach in the paper-- and without any consensus changes to Bitcoin.It's not shock the kind of set reconciliation suggested there was previously suggested (second section) and implemented; and found to be a lot slower in practice due to overheads.What a lot of people miss about this and compact blocks and what not, is that they at most save the system from sending transaction data twice-- once at block time, once earlier. So further tweaking here or there, which might still be helpful, still doesn't make much difference in overall bandwidth usage, because once the duplication is largely gone the usage is due to other factors. So people going on saying that this allows 10x larger blocks or whatever are just confused-- it doesn't allow 10x larger blocks any more than compact blocks allowed 50x larger blocks. If this scheme were infinity fold more efficient than compact blocks it would still only save at most half the bandwidth of the original p2p protocol (similar to what CB saves), and in practice a lot less because other overheads dominate. And because of reconstruction overheads in practice what it would allow for (even given its required hardfork to reorder txn) might actually be somewhat less large.The second part is the restructuring of the P2P network. They suggest replacing the p2p flooding mesh with a miner rooted minimum spanning tree after observing that that the flooding mesh wastes a lot of bandwidth. But a minimum spanning tree has a minimum cut of one: a single broken node can shadow the entire network. Moreover when deciding on the spanning tree a node could falsely claim to be connected directly to everyone in order to be placed near the root. So while this topology would be optimal in a world that had no dishonesty or need for fault tolerance, it doesn't really apply to Bitcoin. It isn't like people looked at this problem before and were unaware that you could build a duplication free distribution topology-- the duplication is essential for security and robustness, not a bug. The question of more efficient distribution in a world with broken and malicious peers in an identityless network is a very interesting one-- even just formalizing the problem statement in a useful way is an interesting question; the question of doing it in a world with perfect flawless honest parts isn't-- it's a solved problem with a well known set of viable solutions.**Edit: In fact someone did critique it, Nullc responded, and the guy agreed with him. So....what I was saying all along remains true.**
2	1523279519	1	Why do you care so much?Competition is good. And crypto is not zero sum. There can be more than one successful coin.

0	1523239079	21	Social attacks from any and all angles (like tinfoil hat level). I don't think it has intensified to misery level yet. Or maybe I haven't been here for years.It might seem repetitive for regulars to keep reposting useful links (correcting misinformation) but I found that to be tremendously helpful in the beginning. There are new users arriving here every day who have no idea why the drama and relentless trolling exists. (The stickied FAQ is a start but it takes a load of time and motivation to sort the lies from facts, and opinions.)

0	1523251825	0	I'm real and anti BCH. I come here to correct false statements and misleading posts in a sub that should really represent bitcoin and not bcash since this confuses a lot of people new to this space. I also want to point out the inevitable down votes I'm going to get and the irony regarding this sub 'allowing' me to post, yet censoring my comments with down votes when I haven't made any false claims or irrational statements.
1	1523257844	8	Downvoted for use of bcash.
1	1523265213	3	So on rBitcoin they don't downvote?
1	1523253107	12	I personally have no issues with "real anti-bch" people posting on this sub, I actually think it's important. One of the biggest issues with r/bitcoin is that it's an echo chamber that doesn't allow debate on certain subjects. I'm interested in both btc and bch and ideally I want a place where all discussion is allowed about all the controversies in bitcoin and it's derivatives. Sure this is a very, very bias community, but it's easy enough to find comments against the grain, and some are very useful. I just often sort by controversial here. Considering there's no alternative it's not too bad.What I do have an issue with, though, is your statement on calling downvoting censorship. It makes 0 sense. How an entire community can believe and echo something as silly and foolish as that is beyond me. And it just points to your own bias. WTF do you expect people to do? Upvote things they don't agree with? Surely you can't be that silly. But I guess it's a convenient way of attempting to take away the one moral advantage this thread has over r/bitcoin.
2	1523253931	-2	Oh, you weren't aware of what happens to posts with negative karma in contrast to ones with positive karma? All I'm saying is that Bch forked from btc. Why am I downvoted ( and yes, censored ) for posting positive comments about BTC?In fact, my first experience in this r/btc was being excited to share something BTC related, and instantly got about 5 downvoted and told to 'go to that other sub'. A lot of people like you claim that this sub provides open discussion, but using the BTC name to stifle and ridicule BTC developments is disingenuous and in poor taste.
3	1523266337	3	censor (verb)1. To examine (material) and remove parts considered harmful or improper for publication or transmission:bowdlerize, expurgate, screen.2. To keep from being published or transmitted:ban, black out, hush (up), stifle, suppress.I’m reminded a bit of the “help, help! I’m being repressed!” guy from Monty Python. You aren’t being censored, dude - you are posting an unpopular opinion and being downvoted. 
3	1523254444	3	For my thoughts on negative vs positive karma, read my previous comment again. I don't personally think it's in poor taste to criticise BTC devs, although it obviously goes too far, esp here. The point is you can't criticise on the actual BTC thread, so again, what do you expect people to do? And we should be criticising them. No matter your opinion on segwit, bigblocks or 2nd layers, when btc transactions slowed to a halt down and the cost skyrocketed last year the damage to all of crypto re momentum and growth must have been in the billions. That was something everyone predicted and is a direct result of shockingly bad development and planning. If that doesn't deserve some criticism I don't know what does.
2	1523253223	-12	So you're saying you like big blocks but not the criminal fuckheads in charge over here?

3	1523253331	2	Haha. Something like that, although I wouldn't go that far. And big = big enough to not damage growth for no good reason.
1	1523291887	1	>  in a sub that should really represent bitcoin and not bcash since this confuses a lot of people new to this space. It confuses no one and your concern trolling is getting you nowhere. You guys need to come up with a new tactic soon.Also, this sub was created before bitcoin cash as a way of voiding censorship. If you want to control what people can talk about in a sub you go make your own. Leave us alone to talk about what we want to talk about. You are not the boss here.>going to get and the irony regarding this sub 'allowing' me to post, yet censoring my comments Yawn, another old line that needs updating. You are comparing the community speaking out against you to a dictator disappearing you and preventing you from ever speaking again. Completely different.
2	1523294678	1	Cry about it more. Bcash is dying and this sub is going to become more and more anti Bcash as it happens.Its just hilarious you guys are clinging to r/btc as a way to hold onto the last vestige of hope you have for BCH.Well, that and bitcoin.com I guess.
3	1523297081	1	The only one crying about anything is you. Why not go spend some time on a sub that actually aligns with something you are interested in?>Its just hilarious you guys are clinging to r/btc as a way to hold onto the last vestige of hope you have for BCH.We've been here before bitcoin cash was a thing and we will stay here. You confuse "clinging to /r/btc" (what does that even mean?)with doing what we've always been doing. The only thing that has changed is the trolls like yourself.You are like one of those Japanese guys who thought the war was still going on into the 60s. There is no war, it's only in your mind.
0	1523284754	1	I think we're seeing an interesting example of why there's so much evil in the world. It works - at least in the short run. Passive, peaceful behavior isn't effective resistance to lies, propaganda, violence, censorship, corruption, and these kind of tactics. We're probably doomed to be in the minority, if only because we're playing by a much more restrictive set of rules. As they say, "Nature abhors a power vacuum."
0	1523288394	1	It still strikes me as stunningly ironic that all this BCH fanboyism happens on r/btc.Why can't you just be happy posting on r/bch?Reddit should kick you all for posting in the wrong forums.

0	1523255910	-7	If Core shills are getting that desperate it can mean only one thing; they too have now realized Bcash is winning because it is true to Craig Wright's vision.
1	1523256996	3	One problem I have is the name...it’s literally btc being held by a group that is anti-btc.  It is extremely fortunate that the mods do allow pro-btc content here or it would actually be objectively worse than what you would expect pro-btc guys to do.  I understand that it is being kept because of name recognition, but what would you say if the /bch subreddit was held by anti bch people, and bch becomes popular enough that people come to reddit looking for information about BCH and, understandably, go to /bch only to become extremely confused when presented with a community that is trying to explain that ‘not BCH’ is better?Moderation and control of /bitcoin seems arguable and justifiably more contentious, but when the trading names are literally BTC and BCH, complaining that pro BTC comments in /btc are trolls seems ridiculous.
2	1523257997	7	>One problem I have is the name...it’s literally btc being held by a group that is anti-btc. We are not anti BTC.BTC is simply a different project now.I personally don’t care what Bitcoin core does as long as we have recovered Bitcoin characteristics.
3	1523259160	-1	Right, if BCH is the ‘real’ bitcoin, then it would make sense to discuss all its benefits in /bitcoin and /bch...it makes zero sense for anyone pro-bch to spend a significant amount of time or control /btc, unless they want to capitalize on the /btc name to drive adoption of /bch.  The only valid reason for anti-BTC people to moderate or control /btc is because of its traffic they want to redirect, and they don’t like the censorship of other people controlling it, and if they don’t censor the other direction, that fine, but it’s like chewy guys going on /ford and complaining that pro-ford guys are a bunch of FORD trolls.  First of all, being pro-something doesn’t automatically make you a something-troll...and second, why would you waste so much time on a /ford subreddit when you have all kinds of positive Chevy stuff to say over at /chevy.

Only bitcoin sub with free speech.So obviously it became the place to talk about Bitcoin Cash because it aims to restore bitcoin characteristics.
