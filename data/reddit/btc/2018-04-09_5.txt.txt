1	1523224103	3	Very cool! =)
2	1523238307	2	Thank you for visualizing the idea first! :)
1	1523219450	2	>hope I didn't totally leave out the important bitcould that be SoV holding a chest of Gold drowning in the rising tide as if his live depended on it?  
2	1523224081	3	Haha dang dude, that's **exactly** what I suggested xD I'm sure someone could modify this image if they really wanted to make that point =)
3	1523238495	2	I think it's the thought that counts. ;-) 
1	1523278855	2	I love you!! Your art is fantastic!
2	1523284275	1	I'll take that as, you love the art? ;) <3
0	1523227299	3	exquisite.
1	1523229238	2	You are generous with your adjectives. I just hope it gets the point across.
0	1523242974	2	I just to take a look at this with f.lux on full blast (1200k temperature), and it looks really cool! The sea becomes a convincing sea-green and matches the logo. Not that you should have drawn it that way or anything, but I recommend checking it out, it's pretty rad =)(I'd screenshot it, but the screenshot ignores the f.lux effect xP)
1	1523284212	1	Cool! I had to look up what f.lux was. I should probably use it (or limit my screentime, lol).
0	1523279739	2	I sent you a tip of 0.00031404 BCH ($0.20 USD) with [BCH Tips](/r/bchtips)!
1	1523284091	1	Thank you! :)
0	1523231235	2	If  they don’t have fiat then there’s basicly no way they could ever get any sort of crypto unless hey can somehow mine it for free..I don’t understand where ur coming from or what ur trying to say
1	1523233337	3	To get started, I believe there are a couple of "faucets" for BCH, via Cointext https://cointext.io/cointext-faucet-not-working/or Bitcoin.comhttps://free.bitcoin.com/but you'd need a smartphone and downloaded wallet for that one, I'd guess.(edit: Cointext is working on features to onboard people with ZERO balance, as the faucet was paused to deal with abuse-of-faucet issues.)You can earn BCH on Yours.org by creating and/or curating content. One-click micropayments and tipping. But requires internet.
1	1523237905	3	fiat isn't the only product available for sale for cryptopeople sell various things not just fiat and mining hashit _is money_ you can _use it to buy and sell things_
2	1523243441	1	If u life in the third world and don’t have access to internet u can’t use bitcoin. If you don’t even have the fiat to own a phone or pay for it it’s pretty much impossible. and much of the third world just uses US dollars as an unofficial currency so they have no real need for crypto. It’s wishful thinking that requires jumping through too many hopes..but now since about half of the world has pretty much banned crypto and it’s going to be as worthless as the fiat number on the computer it represents that doesn’t matter. If there is a future it’s with bitcoin cash but literaly almost all the value of bitcoin. Cash comes from bitcoin except for maybe a dollar or two so when the flawed bitcoin crashes everyone will give up on crypto and it will be worthless. I don’t know why I haven’t sold my bitcoin..I guess I’m either too lazy or holding onto some deluded sense of hope
3	1523246800	2	Well,  if we live long enough, we'll get to see how this bitcoin experiment unfolds, even in part. How exciting! And scary! ;)p.s. In some dual first-third world countries (like South Africa) cell phones, albeit not top-of-the-line-smartphones, are used by most people. They may not have a desktop computer or laptop or tablet but they will have a phone. I have never seen so many ads for cell phone plans as in S.A. and that was almost a decade ago (see: Vodacom). http://www.vodacom.com/
0	1523230160	2	Pretty hard to get btc if u don’t have a bank
1	1523230949	3	Only if you want to cash out to fiat? The unbanked were not enabled to participate in a global financial ecosystem despite web 2.0. Some of these people can now use "dumb"/non-smart phones to "get" BCH and use as electronic cash. Who knows what web 3.0 will become or bring to humanity?
1	1523241466	3	It will be easier for those people to use the internet to work and get paid in BCH. Now they are their own bank. 
0	1523227589	1	Hang on, this pics looks like $BCH doest have a boat. 
1	1523227943	7	The underlying meaning here is that Bitcoin Cash gives economic freedom to everyone, hence why BCH is represented as the tide lifting the boats. Whether you're making $2/day or you're working on a billion dollar startup, BCH is for you.
0	1523264461	1	Why is the BTC logo green? 
1	1523283572	2	It's a tilted and green for Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Please see the FAQs of this sub as it has a weird history: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5wwznc/please_read_our_frequently_asked_questions_faq/Edit for clarity?: Bitcoin Cash, the branch of the major Bitcoin fork which occured on August 1, 2017 that is supported by many early adopters of bitcoin, carries on as the upgraded, unthrottled version of Bitcoin that most resembles a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Years ago, any enthusiastic supporters of Bitcoin who dared to suggest that it was time to increase the block size limit, or discuss ideas contrary to the views of the r / bitcoin moderators, were banned/exiled from r / bitcoin and ended up here in r/btc (long before BCH was "born").
