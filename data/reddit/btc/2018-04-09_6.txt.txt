1	1523230832	7	A small stained glass piece I made, a link to the btc one is [here. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/815od5/i_made_a_btc_thing_for_my_web_store/?st=JFRG9V1L&sh=702023cd) 
2	1523247425	2	Was is a subconscious thing that the BTC one is less transparent than the bitcoin cash?
3	1523274799	3	It was 100% unintended but I see what you’re getting at lol. 
4	1523286757	1	I like that Neo one too! Lol, you pretty much have an endless amount of products to make if you start working your way through coinmarketcap 
5	1523287057	2	Thank you! Honestly that’s a large part of my motivation to make the cryptos, endless supply of relatively easy pieces to create and it gives me something quick to do in between my larger projects
