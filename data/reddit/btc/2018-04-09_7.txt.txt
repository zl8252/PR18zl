0	1523211464	43	Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is a Bitcoin Core backer with significant investments for which the failure of BCH would be a positive. Twitter is not an agnostic platform and has proving more and more to be firmly in certain rich pockets and backs defined agendas. 
1	1523216344	22	Tl;Dr Jack Dorsey, who censors and manipulates political content, people, and news he doesn't like, is a tyrannical unscrupulous ideologue.
1	1523218593	12	BCH is honey badger, doesn't matter!
1	1523239330	5	I’m on your side y’all but there is no indication that @jack has any knowledge of this incident so far. This has happened before.Twitter Support is a huge department within the company and it’s possible they are the only ones involved.  Juuuuuuuuuuust sayin’. 
2	1523252203	-3	Are you personally in contact with him> prove that he doesn't . 
3	1523252253	3	Go back to school. 
3	1523282052	0	Prove that he does. If Twitter is so bad let’s see Ver stop using it. 
0	1523211721	22	Because some people have an irrational and uncontrollable hate for Bitcoin as Cash.
1	1523242110	6	If they sold all their BCH and have everything riding on BTC then I could see why they might attack BCH so much. They have everything riding on BTC's success. This may explain his behavior as one possibility.
0	1523230429	7	It seems like the account was closed for some reason, then picked up almost immediately by some guy in Turkey.  That account was closed and now it's been taken over again and made private.  I have no idea what caused the original transfer of ownership.  I guess it could have been Twitter themselves, a hacker, or maybe whoever controlled @bitcoin actually sold it.  Who knows.  The biggest problem I see with the whole situation is that a pseudonymous account like @bitcoin where the owner doesn't publicly associate the account with a real\-life personal identity is vulnerable to being taken over and/or sold without the public knowing what happened or why.
0	1523210898	14	It's all about the money?
1	1523262471	-5	It's more about not letting a conartist buy a twitter account just so he can push bcash propaganda with it.
2	1523262865	5	'bcash' is the propagandahttps://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/why-some-people-call-bitcoin-cash-bcash-this-will-be-shocking-to-new-readers-956558da12fb
3	1523263109	-7	It's an article written by a pro-bcash individual who clearly supports Roger Ver's fraud of claiming Bcash is Bitcoin when he had a livestream sissy fit. The timeline isn't a coincidence: http://prntscr.com/j2sadz
2	1523262481	5	Redditor /u/BcashScam has low karma in this subreddit.
0	1523213670	4	Mucho plata. 
0	1523226308	4	It's Saudi owners (prince bin talal) probably don't like Bitcoin BCH very much

0	1523228705	-18	because it was held by a scammer
0	1523232600	-14	Because the owner of the acount was either renting out the acount or sold It, to someone that was hired by Bitcoincash.since of the likes and posts were echo.ing Roger Ver's Twitter acount.Who also screamed : freedom of speech , when the acount got suspended..
