1	1523279506	10	This seems to be the only reasonable path.  Which is why people have argued the lightning network will naturally develope central hubs (i.e. banks)
2	1523286741	7	> will naturally develope central hubs It already has even in the "public beta" release.
2	1523291832	2	It is operating exactly as it's intended to. (I believe this was planned by large banking industries)
1	1523280792	4	this
1	1523290799	1	but still tho you have to consider that the barrier of entry to having a well funded channel is alot wider than a regular payment network. I think there is a need for lightning but it is not as immidiate as painted by Blockstream. They're just afraid of the miners.
1	1523291351	1	There are even problems with it when you're using as a intermediate well funnded channel 
1	1523294537	1	Why wouldn't? Why do I need another new "bank" instead of the old bank. Isn't this all about to remove this structure from tx chain?
0	1523273630	24	There's no requirement that you have to let others route through you, in this case however the channel between A-B is reduced, but the channel between A-C is increased. Saying you can't pay for groceries would be an assumption there doesn't exist some other route A-C-...-B
1	1523273778	47	Making it that much more inevitable that a few huge hubs with tons of liquidity - ie banks - have all the transactions, thus centralizing to the hilt and giving total insight into money movements. Just like the banks have today. But I'm sure that's all just a big coincidence, and nothing Blockstream planned out in advance.
2	1523274052	5	I'm not disagreeing with you about the topology of Lightning trending towards hub centralization but to say banks are in the best spot to provide that liquidity I don't know if I agree with that. Miners and early adopters of Bitcoin are in the best spot to be those high liquidity hubs given the high amount of coins they likely have accumulated throughout the years.
3	1523280353	16	> Miners and early adopters of Bitcoin are in the best spot to be those high liquidity hubsIt's not *who* the banks are that are the problem. It's that there *will be* banks.
4	1523282569	4	Absolutely this.
4	1523284872	4	I still don't really understand why banks would be so bad if they "held" (in a non-custodial manner) their clients physical cash, couldn't touch it, and their clients could instantly force the banks to settle at any point hey wanted. Oh and the bank couldn't prevent the client for sending that cash where ever they want. How is that bad? I think when people discuss Centralization they need to realize it really is a completely different definition to centralization than most people think. Centralization in the common sense = losing trust, privacy, etc. This isn't the case with LN. The only form of centralization occurring here is an OPTIONAL dependency.
5	1523287559	2	Traditional banking has optional dependency too.If you don't like a bank you can close your account (channel) and go to another bank (hub).Bitcoin was literally designed to eliminate the need for this. Why reintroduce it unnecessarily?> their clients could instantly force the banks to settle at any point hey wanted.Not instant. There's a waiting period.> Oh and the bank couldn't prevent the client for sending that cash where ever they want. Sure they can. If I have an LN node I can enforce anything I want with regard to who gets to connect to me, who can perform routing, and to whom they may route. Are you suggesting that LN is closed source and cannot be customized?If I were to run an LN hub, I would be collecting AML/KYC on everyone, because that regulation is only a matter of time: you're *literally* a money transmitter.
6	1523287984	1	I guess I just don't consider it an unnecessary feature, yet. I'm an options person so I just follow all the options out there and will use the one I consider superior. In the mean time I think competition is a good thing. Life would be dandy in a perfect world where there was no contention and the best solution was always the first but for now I hold a fair amount of skepticism towards all approaches. Eventually I'll pick one and use it, I just haven't came to a conclusion yet like many others have. 
6	1523296214	1	I would assume I would get a paycheck from my work (1 channel), I would have a channel with my landlord, 1 with my power company, my phone company, my internet provider, netflix, amazon, PSN, Nintendo, Steam, my local coffee shop, the restaurant I go for lunch 3 days a week, some decentralized youtube (yet to be developed plz god come faster), one with spotify, one with hulu, and one with all my closest friends that I eat and drink with on a regular basis thats alot of triangles.
5	1523287931	1	Except the LN nodes can deny service to users they do not want to use their services. What if there was only one LN node which everyone else connected to, would that not be a problem?What if there were 10 major LN nodes based in the US, and the US Gov decided they must implement KYC rules before allowing people to open channels with them?Also, large LN nodes require hot wallets - they could be a target for hacking/dos/extortion. 
6	1523288202	1	Those would be problems. Problems that would make people switch to alternative solutions perhaps. They are greatly hypothetical though IMO, but regardless I'm keeping a close eye on the sidelines for now. I mean if we are speaking of greatly hypothetical situations, to be fair, what if the blockchain gets so big only a few people actually bother to store the entire chain and then they get corrupted?
3	1523274460	25	So? The point of peer-to-peer electronic cash isn't to turn miners and holders into the banks of tomorrow, so that we're all having to use their permissioned, centralized routing network.
4	1523283435	3	To be fair, I thought the idea since day 1 WAS that miners are meant to (generally) be in control of the network in a similar was as federal banks/reserves had a degree of control over fiat, except that mining could be decentralized and done by anyone (whether financially profitable or not)I see LN as an approach to implementing a discrete form of POS that well-connected nodes can financially benefit from (not a bad concept imo, as it incentivizes running a node with more powerful hardware and bandwidth)
5	1523283794	13	Miners ARE in control to a degree but they are not performing the banklike intermediary functions of payment routing or liquidity provisioning.Miners on the blockchain are disintermediated. Hubs on LN are middlemen. Bitcoin was designed to disintermediate middlemen. LN is designed to reinsert them.
6	1523287285	3	When describing bitcoin to non-technical people, I usually describe miners as the auditors of bitcoin. It's their job to review transactions for validity (by checking signatures and such), then to "certify" them by putting them in a block and signing it - much like a traditional auditor might sign their audit report for a company.
7	1523287379	2	That's a great term. I prefer "notary": They witness blocks and attest to their validity.
5	1523285903	3	Ln promotes winner take all dynamics that will progressively centralize the network. Mining does not have a strong winner take all incentive so it's likely to remain decentralized.
6	1523286228	3	That's true to only an extent. There will be a preference towards local (faster) routing nodes, so the bank of China likely won't be routing transactions made within Africa or south America.Afaik, most POS distribution methods are naturally centralizing because only the people with coins can generate new coins, and control how they distribute them to non-holders
7	1523287999	1	>That's true to only an extent. There will be a preference towards local (faster) routing nodesFaster may not always be closer geographically. Check out: http://www.cloudping.info/Although it hung for a few seconds at China, probably because of the GFC.It's still less than half a second to anywhere in the world. (Excluding China, even though it says China's ping is lower then some others.)>so the bank of China likely won't be routing transactions made within Africa or south America.Only because of the Great Firewall of China.
5	1523287379	1	>  I thought the idea since day 1 WAS that miners are meant to (generally) be in control of the network in a similar was as federal banks/reserves had a degree of control over fiat,I don't think that comparison is reasonable because:> except that mining could be decentralized and done by anyone (whether financially profitable or not)If the miners do anything that is not agreed with, the PoW can be changed and they can be left behind. Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything really, it's very democratic.If the banks do anything that is not agreed with, what are you going to do about it? What can the 99% who don't agree with the Fed's policy changes do? I'll give you a hint, it requires a lot of violence.This also explains the difference between BTC and BCH.BTC is like pure democracy, 51% mob rule, no standards, just whatever the (controlled like sheep) majority wants.BCH is more like a constitutional republic, we have a document (the white paper) and supporting material (Satoshi's vision) for how the network should run.
3	1523274598	6	>  Miners and early adopters of Bitcoin are in the best spot to be those high liquidity hubs given the high amount of coins they likely have accumulated throughout the years.Agreed, but it doesn't change the fact that LN doesn't make sense on a one-to-one basis. It's anti peer-to-peer, not only from a technical perspective, but also from an economic one. As an early adopter, or miner you will also not mind regulation. It's just good business after all.
3	1523287578	1	It doesn't matter what the existing banks will do. We're inevitably creating new ones. Guaranteed KYC scenario too.
1	1523278685	8	LN nodes advertise connectivity through the topology distribution part of the routing algorithm.  If this does not reflect the actual availability of working paths then payments will fail to route.  This can possibly be fixed by providing more detail in the topology distribution, but doing so will add to the bandwidth, storage, and processing cost of the LN network.  A full solution requires updating the global topology to all nodes on every change of every channel state, which can happen on every transaction, every node up/down event or every change in node policy regarding use of its capital by third parties.  This makes a large scale distributed solution to LN scaling unlikely.  More likely, the cost of routing in the LN will exceed the cost of mining node operation in the bitcoin network in topologies that aren't highly centralized.  It is the responsibility of those promoting the LN to quantify these trade offs.  For several years, u/jstolfi and others have asked for this analysis but it has not been forthcoming. 
2	1523283213	6	In the current conception of the LN, the state of a channel is known only to the two end nodes.  This seems to be a definitive decision, because LN fans demand "privacy" above all.  The devs even took time to implement onion-style obfuscation of multi-hop  payments, before filling more import holes in the software.Thus, any node who needs a multi-hop payment can only find a path in the basic graph (where only the original funding of the channels is known) and try to send the payment through it.  If the path fails because some channel did not have enough remaining funding, presumably the sender gets that information.  Then he can remove that channel from the graph and try again.  Naturally no one can tell how many paths are being tried before the payment succeds; not how often the whole process fails. In fact,no one can tell whether the network is being used at all.However, this [explorer](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/) shows that hundreds of nodes have 0 (zero) channels.  (You must zoom out a lot to see them, as a faint halo of "dark matter" surrounding the connected component.)  Those must be volunteers who tried joining the LN, used it for a little, then lost interest and closed their channels to get back their coins.
3	1523286517	3	>However, this explorer shows that hundreds of nodes have 0 (zero) channels.Zero **public** channels.>Those must be volunteers who tried joining the LN, used it for a little, then lost interest and closed their channels to get back their coins.Or nodes with solely private channels. For instance Eclair Android creates all channels as private (since they are send-only and cannot be routed through, as of now).
4	1523288167	1	>  they are send-onlyYou mean, they are unidirectional?
5	1523289015	1	Unidirectional doesn't convey which direction. Eclair mobile only offers HTLCs, it does not accept them. As such there is no reason to advertise the channel.
6	1523290167	1	I see.   So those nodes can in principle send LN payments to anyone, but can receive only from their immediate partner, is that right?
7	1523291092	3	No. As of right now, they can only send to anyone. This is an imposed limitation because Watchtowers don't exist yet. If you only send payments through a channel you don't have to worry about the other node cheating, since every new state is more favorable than prior states.Receiving a payment from your channel partner and remote node has the same security model.
8	1523291670	1	Thanks!
3	1523296216	2	> Naturally no one can tell how many paths are being tried before the payment succedsA few weeks ago I downloaded the raw data which, as you said, tells you the initial funding of the channel and not how the capacity is distributed. To try to find a route from one node to another you can create a list of "candidate routes" which you'd then need to go through and try each one to see if it's actual usable given the capacity distribution. But even there we can at least figure out the probability of finding a candidate route (knowning that the actual probability will be less).Using the data I calculated the probability of finding a candidate route from a  node with at least $20 capacity to any other node on the network with an open channel with that capacity.For a $20 payment the route failure rate was 75%.For a $100 payment the route failure rate was 99%.(And again this is the failure rate of finding at least one "candidate route". It will be higher when searching for usable routes).
4	1523298076	1	Interesting, thanks!Does the raw data tell how much funding was provided in each direction?  That explorer apparently only shows the sum of the two funds.  The sum is all that matters if and when the channel has been "warmed", but the individual terms matter to determine the average net flow.  For instance, it seems that most of the newest "fringe" nodes cannot ever receive more than the net payment that they have already made, because by default channels have 0 funding in the direction from old to new node.  
5	1523298167	1	> Does the raw data tell how much funding was provided in each direction?no only opening capacity
1	1523284729	3	>There's no requirement that you have to let others route through youTrue, but it's *fundamental* to the belief that LN will somehow avoid collapsing into a centralized payment routing network.
1	1523287123	1	>Saying you can't pay for groceries would be an assumption there doesn't exist some other route A-C-...-BYou could also rebalance your own channels by sending a payment the reverse direction, from your AC channel to your AB channel.
0	1523277493	34	The more I read about LN...the more I see it is a load of hot garbage!
1	1523278970	8	Name check out 
2	1523280164	1	LN is rubbish lol. 10btc liquidity on it. What a joke haha
1	1523291148	1	Yes, but we need to know if it is enough to fool most of the people. 
1	1523287840	1	Cos such niche tech is argued for as a silver bullet
0	1523273106	18	Pat will have increased your value in the channel between you and Pat, at the expense of your value between you and the grocery shop.This breaks fungibility as coins in different channels have different utility. (if Pat then goes offline, you can use the channel between you and pat, making the money stored in that channel objectively less useful than money stored in a channel with higher availability.)
1	1523285000	2	Also, what's the incentive for pat to stay online and allow you to close your lightning channel to release the funds when he has $0 left in the channel? I surely must be missing something.
2	1523287415	2	It is better to wait and hope the other party screws up their backups and posts an old state, so you can do a ounish transaction and take all their funds. If you have no costs associated with waiting, and a chance of economic gain, you might just want to wait.Not only that, you also always want the other party to close your channel at the end of life, since they would then be paying the mainchain closing fees.
3	1523287736	1	Wait, what? The fees aren't even symmetrical?Is this LN a joke that went too far?
4	1523288130	2	the one that submits an open or closing transaction is the one that pays. If the other party is ever so inclined they could of course help out, but remember that channel closure is your defensive mechanism against unresponsive or malicious peers.For channel opens you could also refuse to open unless the other party pitches in with fees, but that is not a something you can demand on closure.Furthermore, the fees on the mainnet at the time of closing is unknowable **during channel opening**, so opening a channel is a risk assessment itself.
5	1523297129	1	>	channel closure is your defensive mechanismIf you don't close the channel you can't spend your money. It's expected to close channels very frequently because of this. The only other pattern that would work is a centralized pseudo-bank pattern which bitcoin used to be against.
0	1523272174	25	It is right. Pat depleted your AB channel. You can now pay only through your channel with Pat (AC), IF she happens to have some other channels open, and funded.
1	1523273349	10	Couldn't she also decide to put a very high fee?
2	1523273702	36	What shall we call this, a channel-depletion forced-path fee attack?
3	1523279921	5	I like the sound of cabbage attack!
3	1523274354	5	😂
1	1523277591	7	If Pat uses your channel, it's probably because Pat other channel is not [well] connected to the grocery.
1	1523278352	3	But, what if Pat is a man?
2	1523281889	3	It's time for androgyny.
3	1523286067	1	 ¯\\\_(ツ)[_/¯](http://i.imgur.com/e6e42fH.png)
2	1523285669	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXbqsPhWJQI can't be the only one who thought of this...
1	1523280841	4	lolwhat? If you are assuming you have a channel with the grocery store so that Pat can route throught it, your channel balance with Pat doesn't matter at all if you want to pay the grocery store, because you have a direct connection to the store (C hasn't in your example) and don't route through the channel with Pat to pay the store. Also your channel balance doesn't disappear because someone uses you as an hop.
2	1523285383	2	If someone uses you as a hop aren't those funds timelocked for a period?
2	1523284528	3	In this scenario, Pat is paying the grocery store through you before you attempt to pay the grocery store. Therefore your grocery store channel balance does indeed go to zero (or whatever), and your Pat channel balance goes up from zero to what was removed from the grocery store channel.
3	1523285499	1	And your claim is that you cannot use the "Pat channel balance" you got from Pat to pay the grocery store? Why does the "Pat channel balance" turn unidirectional?
4	1523289112	1	because pat does not have a connection to the store.think of channels as ropes with balls ln them. you can push the balls to the other end of the rope, but if you want a ball to go to the grocery store and you dont have a direct rope there, you ciuld oush a ball on a rope you have and ask the other end to push one of their balls to the grocery store.
2	1523288964	1	> Also your channel balance doesn't disappear because someone uses you as an hop.actually, it does.
0	1523279902	7	LN concept of channels is the stupidest and most ridiculous scaling proposal ever. How the hell can anyone believe that this nonsense will solve any problems? At best I see it usable for recurring payments... but even then it would be prone to attacks and centralisation. Really terrible tech. As Trump would put it: "LN is terrible. SAD".
0	1523285415	6	Technically yes, but in reality, few if any individuals will have open payment channels that they let others route through.  They'll have a channel open with their "bank", and the grocery store will have a channel with their other "bank", and your "bank" and the grocery store "bank" will have a channel between them.  So how it would work is you'd deposit money into your "bank", and then the amount you could spend at the grocery store would be equivalent to whatever amount you kept open in your "account" with your "bank".I hope you see now how this new revolutionary peer to peer technology will disrupt the financial system and allow individuals to transact without any 3rd parties.
1	1523294392	1	bank=blockstream
0	1523279403	14	You're missing the point where you, Pat, and the grocery store, as well as everyone else, actually route all your transactions through one or two giant centralized hubs, who, incidentally, have little use for miners.See? No problems at all.
1	1523285919	3	Or because now that you run a channel where you facilitate the movement of funds you must be licensed and obey KYC/AML.
0	1523274095	14	I don't think that scenario will happen. Very unlikely that people will be routing payments on mobile devices since they wont be online 24/7. Only way that would happen is if they have a heavyweight server grinding away at home and they link their mobile app to it. Which I think is mostly how they expect people to use it but which seems like a pipe dream to me.
1	1523289310	1	I always expected people to sell SPV like services, and even custodial services, rather than users running their own full nodes.
1	1523275787	0	They have lightning mobile node now.But they took it from the app store already with a fishy excuse .......
2	1523280269	8	My understanding of Eclair in LN mode is that it's a special case channel that's send-only. This also makes it impossible to route other transactions through it.  Really, it acts like a pre-paid gift card, rather than an actual wallet or node.
0	1523274355	14	Welcome to the world of overly complicated engineering solutions, and the inevitable *unintended** side effects they produce._* Only assuming stupidity instead of malice._
0	1523272323	21	\#nothingtoseehere \#pleasemovealong
1	1523277690	6	It's only the beginning of the story, think about the deep subtle problems that will rise over time when one of the nodes goes offline and have to wait for channel closure!  LN will be really one of the first networks that DDOS actually put funds at risk to be stolen!
2	1523278057	7	At least there is the slightest chance funds can only be stolen if someone is **already** trying to rob you when using 0-conf which worked just fine until core decided to change everythingthen they replace it with something you need **multiple people including yourself to keep constant watch over or you will loose all your funds when the internet sneezes** no person trying to rob you neededseriously, if any **actual** core people see this, how can you honestly think this is in any way better?edit: misspoke what I was thinking of in relation to the attacker most likely loosing money in an double spend attempt
3	1523285235	2	Explain how can you get double the money??- Trans #1 input A -> merchant- Trans #2 input A -> hacker.input A can only be spent once, Trans #1 or Trans #2 will be in the blockchain. If #1 is confirmed, the merchant is paid, if trans #2 is confirmed, the hacker managed to do a "double spend" and he recover the funds.
4	1523285601	2	You right, I did not think it all the way through, I will correct it.but even with that correction there is still no potential loss of money after 5 maybe 10 seconds when using 0-conf/instant transactionsbut you could loose your entire channel of money that is always sitting online at any time if you are not watching it with LN **even if you are not even making transactions at the time**, who would want to risk that?
5	1523287880	2	There is always a risk in every context, for instance you could be connected to only fake nodes (sibil attack) but it's all about probability.0-confirmation is pretty safe for a small transaction. I would not buy a house on that but surely anything under $500. The LN problems are real, the consequence can be ugly... I predict massive flaw and big money lost. While I predict stuff, I predict a major flow involving a "hub". I heard that if a node crash and didn't have a backup, it can problematic. At least when BU nodes crashed... no money was at risk!
6	1523288278	1	> 0-confirmation is pretty safe for a small transaction. I would not buy a house on that but surely anything under $500.could not agree more,  which means Bitcoin was already more than good enough for years for every day transactions and significantly safer than credit card with months or risksheck there is even risk to Bitcoin overall, nothing is set in stone
2	1523283290	5	The ongoing risk with LN remains the very complexity that is now built into the system.It increases the risks of using the network because either some part of it ends up breaking or one of the major players in the network either departs unexpectedly (potentially killing a lot of channels at once) or becomes a bad actor. Currently the only incentive built into the LN protocol (as far as I know) is the penalty for attempting fraud.The beautiful simplicity of Bitcoin has been a major strength as it allowed everyone to have a hand in network security, and there were, consequently, very few (zero?) weak points that would lead to catastrophic failure. LN is going to have weak points we haven't even seen yet because the more complex it gets the harder it is to predict all implications of the system.Rather than attempting a slow but steady approach scaling it really feels like they're counting on a all-or-nothing switch flip that has the *potential* to create a functioning, speedy network that everyone uses but also carries the potential downside of crippling BTC's ability to scale at all (i.e nobody trusts/uses LN and the onchain fees are exorbitant).I am still rather mindblown that they turned down *any* true blocksize increase as offered over the years. 
0	1523281208	4	As I understand it-  Yes this is technically possible.  However it's also unlikely.  First- if you are going to pay $100 for groceries as a one-shot deal, you wouldn't open a channel to your grocer because that would mean two blockchain transactions (one to open the channel, one to settle/close the channel) for you to buy groceries.  More likely you would have a channel open with your bank, and perhaps a few payment hubs, and they would have channels open with your grocer.  Your grocery payment would then route through the bank and to the grocer that way.  If you are, for example, a restaurant and you buy tons of groceries all the time, you might start a channel with the grocer and fund it with a few thousand bucks.  Then each time you make a purchase, you use your private channel with them to pay for it.  This is a much more likely use of a private (not available for public routing) channel or a channel directly from buyer to seller.  Other than ongoing relationships like this, I would expect direct buyer-seller channels to be somewhat rare.  
0	1523285519	3	How are you paying at checkout? The LN doesn’t have SPV at this point and you need to be running a node to make payments.Hold on, let me open up my laptop real quick, do you guys have WiFi? 
1	1523293370	1	The Eclair android app uses Electrum.
1	1523293641	1	Aren't our smartphones always online and turned on anyway?
0	1523286172	3	Why are we even talking about channels?Bitcoin as peer to peer cash allows everyone to send money anywhere they want and now suddenly we are discussing this “innovative” solution of doing an extra step and paying fees to transfer money. What a ridiculous world this is. Bch for everyone ✌️
0	1523280287	4	I'm sorry but this shit sounds overly complicated and extremely pointless. I will just go on the grocery store website and pay by debit card.
1	1523282709	2	>pay by debit card.Gross. Why not just support a different crypto than BTC? Supporting banks is the worst option imo.
2	1523288135	2	> Supporting banks is the worst option imo.If only we had a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.....
0	1523276329	2	Payment channels to bitpay coinbase ect would make way more sense than the over complicated lightning network... As you would not need fraud protection i guess it would be more secure as well.Maybe BCH can get something working with bitpay. It would be a very good stepping stone, until merchants want to actually hold crypto.edit:payment channels allow instant confirmations, for zero-conf bitpay needs to wait- 10-20 seconds to check for double-spend attempts.  Instant confirmations would be required for POS terminals. 
1	1523279322	2	No POS terminal is instant now.  Not in the US, anyway.  I would say that on average it is 20 seconds of confirmation time, using the chip.  For large purchases, it is easily 30 seconds.So I am less inclined to think that we need payment channels, even for POS type things.  Maybe for a soda or a coffee, but there  I am not sure the cost of double spending is worth trying.
1	1523289476	2	but with payment channels, bitpay cannot secure conversion rates as they cannot move the funds to perforn the exchange jntil the channel is closed?
0	1523281310	2	That reminds me of rippling on the Ripple network. Literally where the name of the ledger comes from, yet felt like a huge anti feature each time it triggered. 
0	1523290771	2	It's correct. However you can choose if the channel may be used for routing or not. 
0	1523280600	3	I think you are wrongtl:dr in form of a picture:https://gyazo.com/844f5e7ec96fa1163c3c49f02863cf69In the example Pat (C) sends money to you and then you (A) send money to the grocery store (B). Obviously, your balance doesn't change at all, otherwise you would have paid for (C), meaning you would have lost your money. If someone uses your channel for payment, you don't lose your money.More realistic scenario: You send 100$ to the store, then Pat wants to route through your channel one second later but fails because the balance is too low, so he'd probably obtain and error and have to find another route._____________edit: counter arguments here and on twitter claim that you cannot use the money you got from Pat to pay the store in the second transaction in the picture, because it is in the "wrong channel". I'm not an expert, can't judge it that's true, maybe you have to elaborate that point further.

If someone uses your channel for payment, you don't lose your money.I don't think the scenario outlined claims anyone loses money.  I think it's saying that payment channels are constrained by the amount they were funded with.  You end up with the money from Pat (net zero effect) but you can no longer use your $100 channel with the store because it's depleted.
2	1523286320	1	Why can't you use the money from pat to pay the store in the second transaction?
3	1523286746	3	Because the channel was opened with $100 (in BTC).  All the channel can do is move the balance from one side to the other (and back).  It can be settled and/or topped up I think but that requires another on chain transaction.
3	1523289912	1	You can, but only to Pat or routed theough Pat to destinations Pat has a connection with. We assume here that Pat routed through you because he/she didnt habe a channel with the store. The time between pat depleting your channel and you realizing you cant pay may also be embarrasingly short: for example, Pat couls actually be your well-meaning friend that is just ahead of you in the line at the store.
2	1523289779	1	money with pat has different encumberment, breaking the fungibility aspect of bitcoin.when the fungibility property is broken, the money is subjectively valued differently.you end with the same amount of promised tokens, but you cannot use them equally and settling the promisory notds on-chain to redeem the tokens in a fungible form will incur a main layer fee that you cannot predict at the time Pat open their channel to you.
1	1523285847	1	As a transaction is made through your node the funds are time locked in the channels for x minutes until the transaction is confirmed?
2	1523286148	3	What confirmation? I thought LN was instant.
1	1523291757	1	This example is correct - If you opened the LN channel prior to when you needed it, Pat (C) could have flipped your $100 balance the wrong way before you go to use it.Sticking up for LN slightly (Disclaimer: Not a LN fan), this *may* not be a problem as payments could still route backwards through Pat potentially, though at a higher fee.If not, LN proponents would simply point out that you can open a new LN channel to the same destination onchain.  (Not wasteful at all!)LN defenders would also point out this also doesn't represent an attack vector, or at least not much of one - during the process of opening a new LN channel, you can initiate a payment during the opening step, so Pat (C) can't prevent you from making your payment to the grocery store, though you may have to pay an onchain fee.In reality, this is a simplification of a problem that LN may have at large scale - attackers (or even normal use!) may cause channel flows to be consistently unbalanced because the flow of money is not random, and doesn't become circuitous until LN reaches very very large scales.
1	1523294864	1	In a simple but extreme case, assume that you have two channels open:A ($100) <-> B ($0). This is your channel with the Grocery store.A ($0) <-> C ($100). This is your channel with Pat.A total of $100 are committed to each channel. The "state" of your channel with the Grocery store is such that would you close it now, you would receive $100 and the Grocery store would receive $0. Likewise, would you close your channel with Pat, you'd receive $0 and Pat would receive $100.Now Pat routes $100 through you to the Grocery store.First off you update your channel with the Grocery store, moving the $100 from your end to the Grocery store´s end.Then Pat updates your channel with him, moving the $100 from his end to your end.Thus the state of the two channels now looks like this:A ($0) <-> B ($100)A ($100) <-> C ($0)As you can see, the Grocery store has received $100, you still have the same amount of money, and Pat has sent $100. That is, Pat has routed a payment of $100 to the grocery store through you.However, now your channel with the Grocery store is in a state where there is no money on your end. If you were to close the channel now, all $100 would be entitled to the Grocery store and $0 to you. Thus you can't use this channel to send any further payments to the Grocery store, and therein lies the problem described in this thread.

0	1523286753	1	lol not possible of course unless you give C your private key
0	1523278523	-4	Lightning network is cool. It is fast, really low fees and will really take off. Also BCH is not bitcoin - it's a scam.
1	1523278541	11	Redditor /u/thesws has low karma in this subreddit.
1	1523280319	9	LN is rubbish. It doesnt work. It won't work at scale without centralisation. It's a total failure. It has 10btc liquidity  since no one wants to touch this sh... You were brainwashed.
1	1523283176	6	Breathing is cool. It keeps you alive and you're not paying for it. Will you pay every single time you bring that fresh air to your lungs?

0	1523290546	0	LN is such a mess it made me completely stop focusing on BTC and rejoice that I have BCH which is so amazing!! We won!
0	1523292890	0	How about you configure your node in such a way that it does not route payments, retard? 
1	1523296460	1	How about everyone does that.  What happens then?
