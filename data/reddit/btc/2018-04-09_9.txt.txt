2	1523269552	4	Generally: getting to see BCH people I only know through the internet; the energy and vibe of so many people building BCH or on BCH; meeting smart and interesting people from all over the planet.  Tokyo was fun too.  I had no interest in visiting Japan before but it turned out I really liked it.Hard to pick a favorite part or specific talk.  All of the ones I saw (mostly mid morning through to mid afternoons) taught me, inspired me or gave me stuff to think about.
