0	1523304396	46	If you're not following [@Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/Bitcoin/) on Twitter yet, you know what to do! 
1	1523308850	25	Well, I was following @Bitcoin, but apparently Twitter decided I'm not any more.I'm following @Bitcoin again as of 3 seconds ago.  Interestingly enough @Bitcoin was still a member of all my same twitter lists as before even though my following had been canceled.
2	1523317904	3	Same here
1	1523309729	14	Good point.Also, why is @jack such a blatant liar? His profile has a pinned tweet that states:> We’re committing Twitter to help increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable towards progress.Yeah, right, about that... So what will be their "public accountability" after this censorship?
2	1523318751	4	he also refused to ban ISIS accounts a few years ago under pressure and came out and said "we wont ban anyone because we believe in freedom of speech"
3	1523371065	1	I thought that was because law enforcement was tracking them through twitter and asked them not to ban them. 
2	1523326938	4	Is this your first time encountering newspeak or something? None of those words mean what they used to mean. He is saying "We will use any means available to us to push globalist propaganda."
3	1523371140	1	Why are you in favor of a global currency if you hate globalists? Isn’t that counter intuitive?

1	1523321932	2	hey hey Bitcore is also bitcoin's baby. 
0	1523311071	2	love calling out twitter CEO. conflicts of interest need to be highlighted
0	1523306971	7	Great news, thanks for posting!
0	1523307044	5	Don't forget to troll [@TheNextWeb](https://twitter.com/TheNextWeb/status/983300009469841408) a bit ;)
1	1523317883	1	Done Sir.
0	1523307232	6	Terminacore is back 
0	1523306865	3	Is this the same Bitcoin account? Because I was following the old one and now I need to follow it again?
1	1523307126	4	It's a good question, how would they go about proving it? 
2	1523311309	3	In other thread someone mentioned that it has the same ID (you can only see it through the API). So it's all good, it seems.
0	1523308238	4	The blocktogether list is great. I highly recommend it!
0	1523306063	6	Ha ha ha plenty of Bitcoin Core fanboys getting seizures now.
1	1523320441	3	...but muh Segwit! muh LN! Noooo! Boycott Twitter! (we can hope)
0	1523317089	2	Hell yeah
0	1523332858	2	Glad you got your account back!
0	1523339444	2	Hi u/muyuu. We are back. The celebration of the censors and their soulmates in your 'forum' didn't age well. https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8axt9r/tnw_on_twitter_twitter_takes_away_bitcoin_from/
1	1523366534	1	u/muyuu please update your post since the account has been restored to the owner.
0	1523319506	2	Bitcoin Cash is effectively Bitcoin!
0	1523308692	4	RIP Core
0	1523308299	2	they will be rallying the troops as we speak
1	1523317930	3	Lol, they say no one cares. But the brigading is real.
0	1523322489	1	God I was hoping he was gonna make an Arnold joke and he didn't disappoint.
0	1523350448	1	I'm all right, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack.
0	1523371856	1	I'm glad he got it back
0	1523354590	1	Can you verify this u/memorydealer ?
1	1523370494	1	Yep. Just give the signal "satoshi's vision" when the coast is clear.
