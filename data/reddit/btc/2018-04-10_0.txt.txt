1	1523324419	20	Were all banned 
2	1523325183	31	Yep I was banned for my username, obviously. 
3	1523325847	12	[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7c5v9p/comment/dpnfrqk) one of my favourite bans.
4	1523326634	8	LOL, the whole thread is hilarious!
0	1523320365	60	oh the irony....
1	1523327573	49	OP is talking about censorship but can't even mention r/BTC in the title :)
2	1523329301	28	Things are getting to rediculous levels of stupidity.  
2	1523349841	11	Used to be one of the keywords (/btc/ and r/btc) that would autohide your comments making them look fine to you but invisible the others, maybe still is? (Pointing it out got me permabanned over a year back.) 
1	1523335643	9	And...> **Projection**: The attribution of one's own attitudes, feelings, or suppositions to others, thought in psychoanalytic theory to be an unconscious defense against anxiety or guilt.
0	1523334506	15	Something to think about, "moderating" that sub has to be close to a fulltime job, someone comes home from work and makes it their duty to "moderate" rBitcoin, every, single, day, someone has to do that, actively censoring the comments and posts, what a life.
1	1523335499	20	Or they get paid to do it
2	1523335975	3	in bitcoin
3	1523378843	1	I'm not sure they are paid in bitcoin. 
1	1523364044	7	What do you mean 'come home from work'? That IS their work.
2	1523365294	2	That's even sadder
1	1523378805	1	I think it is a full time job. If you've noticed fryday night and Sunday morning ore not heavily censored. 
0	1523335647	22	Don't forget to unsubscribe there, don't make noobs think they are more popular than they really are. You can still get there quickly via a search if you need to.
0	1523357144	24	That is a tactic direct from the CIA handbook.  Always accuse your opposition of doing the exact thing you actually are doing. 
1	1523360302	6	No need to infer anything remotely so organized. Projection is a very common psychological problem.
2	1523366771	8	In this individual case sure, but the core astroturf *have* consistently been using this as a tactic.Edit: you do realize though that a significant amount of discussions on r/bitcoin are faked discussions created by the core astroturf.
1	1523387873	1	Do you have link to a pdf of this handbook? I want to read it. 
0	1523348997	5	Can we put the /r/btc modlogs link somewhere near the banner at the top? So that it is blaringly obvious to newcomers or anyone who fact checks /r/bitcoin's lies, that /r/btc isn't censored.
1	1523349438	3	Damn right, why are people wasting their energy stirring shit. Let's focus on getting BCH developing into the dominant coin instead.
1	1523377320	1	Yes, please.
0	1523328395	28	take a look at this - https://i.imgur.com/KAj1wVf.pngregardless of what some of you may think, i've been around in this shit show for pretty much the entire ride and right now my care factor for BTC is less than zero. the community is fucking disgusting.THIS post is fucking disgusting. How the fuck did we go from a bunch of enthusiasts with a common goal to this type of shit?>oh you dont support Blockstreams vision of 1mb forever and pushing everyone off chain so we can make bulk profit, then ok, we'll harass your home country embassy and try to have you kicked out of the countryto be fair, it did get downvoted -3. But still allowed to remain there.
1	1523345169	11	> How the fuck did we go from a bunch of enthusiasts with a common goal to this type of shit?I was around when it happened:https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/z/dl8v4lp
2	1523345664	11	I got so bamboozled for a while I thought that small blockers might be right, I just did not know. Then I went  through all of Satoshi's writings again and I was like: WTF is going on here,  small blockers are creating a solution worse than the problem they are trying to fix. After a while I could not stop myself from believing that some power hijacked Satoshi's idea ON purpose. It was done very professionally and very effective. And as soon as Bitcoin Cash starts seeing some serious adoption we will be attacked just as relentlessly, what we have right now is nothing.  
0	1523341812	10	This sub does ban people, and banning people is to disallowing them speech on the platform, which in general is considered censorship. Read the open modlogs.All I've seen so far has been well motivated and it has never been due to their **opinions**.
1	1523346178	15	[This is what I got banned for.](https://i.imgur.com/73AwRNl.png) You know what is the worse? On some other places on the internet, where they still really believe that bitcoin cash is a scam they said they did not like /r/bitcoin cencorship but since I am in their eyes a troll I probably deserved it. You can read all about propaganda in the history books but when you see it's effective directly in your own life, under your own nose, you have to take 5 steps back and take a deep breath. This shit is so evil. 
2	1523350148	4	I am also banned there, so well aware of the effects of that censorship.
3	1523385524	1	Yeah I was supporting your claims by posting about my ban for other people that read your claims. 
2	1523377271	3	> You can read all about propaganda in the history books but when you see it's effective directly in your own life, under your own nose, you have to take 5 steps back and take a deep breath. This shit is so evil. You bet. Apart from the technology per se, I've learnt so much from politics, society, and psychology since I entered the Bitcoin world that it has affected very profoundly the way I see the world, and my role in it.
1	1523364021	3	> This sub does ban people, and banning people is to disallowing them speech on the platform, which in general is considered censorship.No, that's just moderation of behavior. Censorship is moderation of opinion.
1	1523379227	2	Kicking the disruptive kid out the class because he is constantly shouting fuck XXX disrupting the class is not censorship. Preventing the dissemination of information or blocking ideas is censorship.There is a difference. 
0	1523351428	3	[ironic post removed]
1	1523377376	1	[postal removal ironed]
0	1523326337	6	I haven‚Äôt even been banned and I don‚Äôt venture there. 
1	1523326561	10	Don't worry you don't even have to go there to get banned.  
2	1523326846	6	Maybe I‚Äôll start checking to see if my comments here get me banned there
0	1523341706	2	I posted one time and i was permanently banned.  and iv been a part of the community for long enough to hodl thru the best..  the better..  the boring.. est and the worst of 200 day averages.   They said my post was a shit post because i drew a parallel between the frozen lost on the summit of Everest, and  MY TENDENCY TO NEVER SELL...   and ‚ÄúHODL‚Äù  at all cost nomatter how COLD or HOSTILE the Climate may be.   ...yeah yeah..  im a dumbass, and i suck at picking my entry points..   but SHIT POST?    (He he i said ‚Äúbut shit‚Äù).   whatever...  they are just haters cuz they bought in at $18K and now they gotta file a nasty tax return on TOP of it..   and by IT i mean Mt. Go.....   er...  i mean Everest
0	1523356195	2	I've been banned for years.
0	1523367027	2	A self fulfilling prophecy, /u/wtfrusayin.
0	1523361818	1	If someone claims censorship on /r/btc, ask them for proof.  ceddit and moderation logs work.
0	1523366766	1	"censored within 3 seconds". That might be a bot at work
0	1523368884	1	That‚Äôs insane. I‚Äôve said some pretty vulgar stuff here and never got so much as a warning üôÑ
0	1523372197	1	I'm being censored right now.
0	1523372910	1	Jesus that place is just like the_donald. If you do not have full blown commitment to glorious coin leader you will be banned. 
0	1523378009	1	Looking forward to the day both subs stop bitching about eachother 
0	1523343768	-1	I want to know about new things happening in BCH. Why do I constantly see people in this sub bitching about whats happening in r/bitcoin???I don't give a shit what is happening there but weekly some of the top voted posts are just people calling out the other sub and it's getting boring. 
1	1523361551	4	Use the submit button then. You get what you give, feel free to contribute the way you think is best. This sub doesn't stop you from submitting what you want.
1	1523347478	4	same. I couldn't give less of a fuck about the borderline autistic screeching matches between all of the different coin subs, btc and bitcoin specifically.if we could just focus on developing the coin and underlying blockchain, but no.
2	1523377450	1	Welcome to the crypto world where half of it is technology and half of it is politics.
1	1523362858	2	BCH is Bitcoin, right now a bunch of ass Hays have r/Bitcoin, that's it
0	1523373535	0	both subs do. /r/bitcoin is worse and more obvious.
0	1523339074	-7	Downvote censoring yes. 
1	1523341567	15	downvotes are not censorship, *especially not* on this sub
2	1523350066	-1	Actually it leads to people like me getting the 10 min ban to post every time ive made a reply. It keep me from replying freely and is indeed censorship. Imagine a debate where one guy is only allowed to speak every 10 minutes.
3	1523355804	2	It's a throttle, not censorship.
4	1523358463	0	Call it what you want, it works the same - I cant post. Now theres another guy who replied also, and this means I can only reply to one of you guys now unless I wait.
5	1523363867	3	Yes you can't post for 10 minutes not the same of permabanned. You have your posts open and visible, how is this the same thing?
5	1523359764	1	Patience is a virtue. You spend quite some time here, are you a big blocker?
5	1523367543	1	That's a reddit wide rule. Subs are prevented to get flooded by spam from spammers. 
6	1523382242	0	Mods decide whether to use it or not.
3	1523356509	2	Imagine? I don't have to imagine shit because I've personally been censored on `/r/bitcoin`  on many occasions  over the years, including 2 (or 3?) bans. The only reason you think being able to post once every 10 minutes is even remotely comparable to being completely silenced as so many of us were is because you've obviously never been on the receiving end of actual censorship
3	1523360502	1	Strange, I can post however many times I like. Have you been submitting low quality content or trolling? What exactly do you mean by "people like me"? Small blockers? Lizard people conspiracy theorists?
3	1523352421	1	Agreed. This sub claims to be censorship free, but only if you adhere to their rules, and flex the definitions to what they say they are.
4	1523356037	3	I looked a few times at the mod logs when people were claiming they got censored and in most cases the supposed victim did indeed break the forum rules.The mod logs are an incentive to keep the mods honest. In the other sub, the mod logs are private.
4	1523361612	1	If you stand beside a god hates fag protest and protest louder and better than them, so that no one can hear the god hates fags protestors, is that censorship? Or is that the community standing up for what they believe in?
5	1523362557	1	Most probably, it's just a lot of sound pollution and a waste of time...
0	1523362490	-3	I was threatened with a site wide reddit ban by /u/bitcoinxio for referring to ["bitcoin cash" as the second letter in the alphabet cash and then was banned for 2 days for spamming r/btc....](https://twitter.com/hernzzzzzz/status/962360261104381952)  Check my post history, there is no spam. However, this is the same mod who, on twitter, accused me of [creating my account to just to troll Mike Hearn](https://twitter.com/hernzzzzzz/status/982996269902643201)  which is also untrue.
1	1523367302	2	> the second letter in the alphabet cashWhy do you keep finding contrived ways to avoid using the right name?
2	1523367468	1	BCH?> for referring to "bitcoin cash"
1	1523367897	1	You are a scammer who supports a censorship backed, segregated non-cash non-bitcoin settlement chain by claiming that shit to be Bitcoin. 
2	1523369924	1	bitcoin is bitcoin, "bitcoin cash" forked off August 1 2017. Download and run an older version of the bitcoin client and see which network it connects to. There is no debate about the issue, just shitty marketing and emotional pleas.
3	1523370487	2	Bitcoin Cash is the abbreviation of "**Bitcoin** - A Peer-To-Peer Electronic **Cash** System".The segregated non-Cash settlement version forked itself off the system into a non-Bitcoin system.
4	1523370701	0	Download a client from before August 2017 and see which network it connects to. 
5	1523371109	2	Miners cannot mine with old clients.Bitcoin Cash is the abbreviation of "**Bitcoin** - A Peer-To-Peer Electronic **Cash** System".The segregated non-Cash settlement version forked itself off the system into a non-Bitcoin system. 
5	1523378249	1	Download a client from 2012 and see which chain it picks.
6	1523379001	2	Is it BCH?
7	1523379574	2	Is it BTC?
8	1523379693	2	Try it.
9	1523379773	2	Try it.
0	1523360098	-1	why do you care?
1	1523361528	3	If this is an honest question, there is a simple answer. This sub was made directly as a response to the censorship in /r/bitcoin. This was the place people came when they got banned over there.There is a deep history between these subs and it is not going away any time soon.
0	1523362898	0	That sub sucks dick.
0	1523353443	-2	Ban and censor any mention of Bitcoin in retaliation.
0	1523346098	-5	I was censored here once for having a civilised argument with Lord Andresen.
1	1523371743	2	Link?
