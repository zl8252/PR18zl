They had years to sort it out but not bothered and I suspect they not bothered because it's more valuable as a social engineering tool for political desire than it is as a site for people to interact with each other.
1	1523373346	5	Agreed. I remember in 2009 / 2010 I thought twitter was about to die, I abandoned it then. Cannot believe it has continued to live, it is such a shitty social media site
2	1523375516	4	It's popular because it's bite sized.
3	1523377564	1	Well, double bite sized as of a few months ago...
1	1523373865	2	Not for me. Don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre looking at 
1	1523363541	5	Hey, I am quite proud of my bot.
1	1523375485	1	The only good thing about FB is it's hard to fake a profile.
1	1523385215	1	Twitter knows they have a huge problem with bots, but if they made a serious effort to purge them they would destroy their active-users count and tank their stock price/influence.
1	1523385885	1	Actually crypto twitter is one of the best ways to quickly see what the most influential people in the space are saying. I get less biased news there than on any coin specific sub
0	1523362471	28	Ah, he surely is, we are not surprised. He is an investor in lightning labs.
0	1523367451	8	Stop using twitter. 
1	1523373303	3	What is the substitute good?
2	1523382670	3	Gab.ai
2	1523375235	4	Mastodon: https://robekworld.com/what-is-gnu-social-and-is-mastodon-social-a-twitter-clone-1b12a98c37ecIt's popular in Japan as a Twitter replacement, such as in Pawoo.
2	1523383173	2	Let‚Äôs have a look at Peepeth, a twitter clone running on the Ethereum blockchain... Eth, IPFS = censorship resistant by design !https://peepeth.com/welcome
2	1523375742	1	Not sure what the petty downvotes are about, point is simple, if it's users are to stop they will want an alternative, until there is a viable substitute, I'll keep using it
2	1523378230	1	The time you take back for you own life is the best substitute.
3	1523378647	0	Oh come on, valuable communication and networking happens there, bury your head in the sand if you wish
4	1523384293	2	"valuable"
0	1523370251	6	I was sure that the accusations of Jack having played a part in removing @bitcoin was just rBtc overreacting. Then this article exposes it as plausible. WTF!
0	1523378175	2	Sure glad I'm not invested in that company. Deleted my account months ago, and all I had been receiving for a year before this was notifications that scammy accounts were following me. Good riddance.
0	1523372712	7	Whatever.  It's a private company.  They are free to do what they want, I guess.As much as I loathe twitter and I loathe people practicing censorship -- as long as it isn't the government doing it, it's not technically illegal in the United States.
1	1523374802	6	And everything not illegal in the US is okay to do?
2	1523384446	2	Yes. You can advocate for child porn, that is considered free speech. But you can't actually possess child porn, that is still illegal.
3	1523385203	0	I do not agree that it is okay to advocate for child porn. I don't think it should be illegal, but a person doing so is not okay in my opinion. Do you not see what I am getting at? There are things that are not okay, yet still not illegal. 
2	1523377517	1	Literally by definition, yes.
3	1523378320	1	Cheat on your SO is literally okay by definition, yes?
4	1523379682	6	Yes, you'll be a dick but you can absolutely do it and you have to deal with the fallout but it's A OK in the eyes of the law.You do not have a right to use their platform, you have no right to use their platform without restriction. They have every right to boot you off their platform for whatever reason they feel like. Do you know what you do when you disagree with a companies policies and actions (you know, "being a dick" as noted in the previous sentence)? You take your business elsewhere. They deal with the fallout.Your only right to free speech is against the government, they cannot repress your free speech. If you turn up to my house and I don't like what you're saying I'll get you leave, same thing applies to Twitter.
5	1523380399	2	People simply do not understand how free speech works. The government cannot censor your speech, private companies can. End of story. Don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt use that company‚Äôs platform/app. It‚Äôs as simple as that. 
6	1523382004	0	You're right about one thing; if Twitter does things that aren't okay then user have the choice of not using their services. But why did you bring the government into any of this?Either things are okay or not. It's as simple as that.
7	1523383723	1	Why did I bring government into this? Because, that‚Äôs what defines our right in the USA for free speech. You have the freedom from being censored from the government, that‚Äôs it. How is this so difficult to understand? When people say that their rights to free speech are being violated because a private company/citizen censors them it clearly shows they do not understand free speech. You can say what ever you want to say in the USA but you won‚Äôt escape judgement from your peers or other private entities. The only thing your speech is free from is censorship from the government. That‚Äôs it. End of story. 
8	1523385401	1	But we did not speak about free speech or not. We spoke about wheter or not there exists things that are not okay, yet still not illegal. Such as cheating on your SO. It is not okay, but it is not illegal. Or banning people on your social media platform for monetary gain. Not illegal, but not okay.
5	1523381708	2	> A OK in the eyes of the law.It wasn't a question of whether or not it was okay according to the law. Just if it was okay.Sure, they can do what they want within the limits of the law and the law won't do anything - but that does not mean they're not a dick.
6	1523383456	1	If you read the whole comment you'll see I covered that.> Do you know what you do when you disagree with a companies policies and actions (you know, "being a dick" as noted in the previous sentence)? You take your business elsewhere. They deal with the fallout.
7	1523385715	1	Yes, I saw that. I asked if the US law covered everything that is okay or not. It's obvious to us both that there are things outside the law that can be not okay. Why not say "Yes, you're right"?
6	1523382106	1	he is deliberately ignoring context. 
7	1523383371	1	Other than where I directly address it.> Do you know what you do when you disagree with a companies policies and actions (you know, "being a dick" as noted in the previous sentence)? You take your business elsewhere. They deal with the fallout.But yeah, I'm ignoring his context. Sure thing.
8	1523385923	2	You took his context (not qualifiers) added your own (in the eyes of the law) and this totally failed to address the point he was trying to make. In your first reply, you appear to have done this in your head without writing it out.Now, you're free to do that, of course (in the eyes of the law) but it means you're not really adding anything useful.
1	1523375914	2	The same people that scream about a private company limiting their free speech are actually seeking to limit that company‚Äôs and its employees‚Äô right to freedom of speech. I would call it ironic if ‚Äúhypocritical‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a better fit.
2	1523377039	3	It's mostly that they have to be transparent about it, otherwise the unsuspecting masses won't understand what is going on.
2	1523386124	0	How are they seeking to limit it?Most seem to be for publicising it and finding alternate solutions.
0	1523358956	12	Business Insiders are on the tabloid end of the media range.They just read twitter users saying it and "voila", twitter insiders reported it xD
1	1523358995	7	Isn't that all news these days? Haha
2	1523359204	8	Tst tst... BTCNewsUpdates is a the higher end of the scale... quality stuff for ya ;)
3	1523362502	5	You are best quality my friend, kudos ;)
4	1523364526	3	üëç
4	1523368244	2	Thanks, we know when to be tabloid-ish too xD
0	1523371891	5	Conservatives already know Twitter selectively mutes opinions it doesn't like and Project Veritas proved it.
0	1523378383	1	They also worry that Dorsey might interfere with account blocking before implementing a policy to justify the decision
0	1523358373	2	Oh my!
0	1523366464	1	lol this isn't news to anybody
0	1523369598	1	Is it free speech censorship if it‚Äôs his platform? 
1	1523378509	3	Yes ofcourse. Censorship and being legal are two entities. McDonalds have been feeding people with junk foods for decades. Just because it's not illegal does not mean we can't point out the bad and ugly of the business. 
0	1523377020	1	Good, I hope he does it more and more, this way eventually they will lose half their members , and this will give demand to a new platform that doesn't do this,  I hope Twitter, facebook, Instagram, and Google go to shit for helping blackout crypto 
0	1523380989	1	Is it just me who doesn't give a fuck what Dorsey or Twitter does?
0	1523381774	1	Jack Dorsey is Dangerous, he owns both Square and Lightning Network : Why Square is Poised to Become the Lightning Network and Why You Should Be Very Afraid. : https://www.yours.org/content/why-square-is-poised-to-become-the-lightning-network-and-why-you-shoul-bf2f89f4427e
0	1523383435	0	Fuck this guy, he‚Äôs s communist 
0	1523383944	1	I find it odd that a lot of people in crypto claim Libertarian, yet cry regulation of for profit, private, companies when "free speech" is infringed. In the U.S. at least, free speech is protection from the government, not private companies. They can do what they want. If your morals don't line up with theirs, stop using the service. The crpto community is such a small part of Twitter, no one really cares. So move on with your lives and focus on making BCH better, not who cotrols a specific account. I think the idea of a bitcoin Twitter is stupid, let the people using the tech speak for themselves. 
0	1523368345	1	Funny how that gets publicity after Jack blocked @bitcoin. Any bets when he'll be before a senate hearing committee?
0	1523378273	0	Silicone Valley is falling . They're literally digging their graves.
0	1523375320	0	remind me, why do you think the "free speech" SJWism is relevant at all on private platforms owned by private companies?
1	1523377086	7	Ah good now free speech is an SJW thing
2	1523378938	0	The perceived "right" to use private media for expression is indeed a SJW-ism.The right to make your own newspaper, your own blog etc. without being jailed. That's what free speech is about. Not "hurr durr, youtube won't let me publish mah videos"
3	1523380754	0	I am married to a SJW that actually fights for social justice every day in the court room and fully understands free speech and regularly points out to conservatives and liberals that free speech is about government censorship, not private censorship. It‚Äôs not about SJWs misunderstanding free speech, it‚Äôs about misinformed and uneducated people misunderstanding free speech. Stop trying to pigeon hole SJWs. And what‚Äôs so terrible about fighting for social justice anyway? Why is it bad to ensure that justice and equality is available for everyone? 
0	1523364389	0	Steemit ftw! 
1	1523368119	2	I still don't get Steemit. I have no idea who to follow. 
1	1523373564	1	Have you uses Twitter? Steemit is more like Yours or Reddit, not a replacement for Twitter 
0	1523377064	-2	Still talking about Bitcoin and Twitter. Unsubbed.
0	1523363490	-10	> The allegations will help fuel right-wing perceptions that Twitter has it in for them.Yep, Twitter has it in for r/btc
