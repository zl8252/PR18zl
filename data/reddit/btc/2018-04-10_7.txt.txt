0	1523386034	0	Why do you bother with full nodes? I thought those were only slowing down the network? Aren't miners are the only ones that should be running full nodes?
0	1523386914	1	lol, why bother?no one can run a full node with 32 mb block size anyway. but dont be sad, jihans mining farms in china will check your 0-conf transactions, all you gotta do is trust jihan :))
