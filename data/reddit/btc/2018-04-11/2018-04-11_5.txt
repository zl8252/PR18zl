2	1523424920	0	wait 3 years? u mean HODL? bitmain cash is not for hodling, its not a store of value, u bcore troll. go back to r/bitcoin.
3	1523448582	1	If you notice my flair you would know I’m no troll. If we consider BCH as a currency then what do you do with your paycheck? Do you spend it all? Do you hold it all? No, you use what you need for your recurring expenses, you use it to pay for dinners and comforts when you want to treat yourself and you keep a small percentage for a rainy day. That’s how I use my BCH and how I would recommend anyone use it. It’s fine to hodl but to say that’s all you should do is wrong. It’s meant to be used in all ways a currency would be, and you wouldn’t say spend everything in your bank account but you would expect your balance to waiver day to day and over years of time.Check out the site I maintain/cofounded to see all the places you can spend your BCH and you will be excited to see the amount of adoption we have been seeing and the momentum that BCH is building.

0	1523392404	4	Adoption!
0	1523449177	1	Cool adoption!
0	1523452099	1	At first I was like '95.50? That's hella cheap!'Then I pissed myself.
1	1523452206	1	same here xDi thought the number next to the watch was the price....
0	1523452668	1	I'll wait for a good clone for around 130 USD.
