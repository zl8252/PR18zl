1	1523866805	9	Bitflyer.... As much as people are probably astounded that Japanese vendors choose BCH over BTC, it's often because bitflyer ads here often show the cost and relative speed of transactions - that and local groups in Kansai (This shop is in Osaka which is part of the kansai 'region') hype BCH. That being said, I wouldn't be surprised if they accept BTC as well... That and now I have another cafe to check out when I'm in Osaka, yay!source: business owner in Kyoto.
1	1523866561	5	Nice. I'll grab a coffee there when I'm in Osaka.
2	1523867566	0	Cause you don’t have cash?
3	1523876448	2	Cuz BCH is better than cash. 
4	1523876765	0	There is 2 coffee shop, same price, one with the best coffee that accept only cash and one with the worst coffee that accept BCH, you have cash and BCH in your pocket, where you are going?
5	1523878007	5	I'd find good coffee for BCH. 
5	1523888266	1	Do you have knowledge of which coffee shops make the best coffee or only looking for attention?
1	1523859591	10	They already know that **Bitcoin Cash** is the abbreviation of "**Bitcoin** - A Peer-To-Peer Electronic **Cash** System"? Lucky Japanese. It seems that it takes some more time until the message reachs the North Coreans.
2	1523870968	2	Why on earth does everyone misspell "Koreans".
3	1523872478	12	It's making fun of the people who mindlessly follow Bitcoin Core. They are in a dictatorship like North Korea. So they are called North Coreans.
4	1523877422	6	OHHHH. Thanks, gotcha. I feel like an idiot now, lol. Makes sense!
2	1523891698	1	You guys can't handle a shortened version of Bitcoin Cash yet think it's fine to call Bitcoin Core supporters North Coreans? Atleast Bcash is simply a shortened version of the term, north coreans is an actual insult.
2	1523873753	-3	Japanese Coffee Shop Owners know nuts are the real tits
2	1523877309	-5	Satoshi worship is so lame. Satoshi abandoned Bitcoin in 2011 meaning Bitcoin has been around longer with out them as with. 
1	1523880117	1	bitcoin is the real bitcoin. Source: everywhere 
2	1523880127	1	Redditor /u/Hernzzzz has low karma in this subreddit.
0	1523867586	47	You certainly don’t get to decide what the real Bitcoin is. The majority of the network does, and they disagree with you.
1	1523885945	5	How you got upvotes on anti-BCH comment in r/btc?
2	1523893044	-1	Because it's true. The market currently supports BTC over BCH. The market also thinks the complete joke that is IOTA deserves a $4B market cap, along with projects like NEO that remain unreleased and therefore completely unproven as decentralized systems as of yet. This merely demonstrates that the market can stay irrational for longer than many people have the patience for. <shrug> More gains for those of us that do have the patience to wait for the market to come around. By the way, this is the same as late 2011 when investors who bought bitcoins at $2 when everyone was mocking them as digital Beanie Babies. At the risk of stating the obvious, the way to make money as investor is to identify the unjustly hated investment and go big into it. More broadly, identify a widespread misconception and there's a great investing opportunity. This is how investors systematically [make markets more rational](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=678866.0). But it does take time. As Jesse Livermore would say, "Sit tight!"
1	1523869091	7	The majority also bought BTC > $10k+.  
2	1523875934	4	Wow the troll vote gang is here in force aren’t they? 24 upvotes on a comment talking shit about BCH?
1	1523870551	1	Satoshi Nakamoto already defined what the real Bitcoin is; peer-to-peer electronic cash. Thus Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin as it is peer-to-peer electronic cash. Bcore wants to implement peer-to-node-to-peer, this is not Bitcoin; this is an alt scamcoin.
2	1523881641	-1	 No, Lightning is a peer-to-peer cash.BCH is miner serverfarm to miner serverfam cash, at best. With your silly terrabyte or whatever blocks you and fake-satoshi plan to have.
3	1523892458	2	>BCH is miner serverfarm to miner serverfam cashEmphasis mine:"The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be **big server farms**. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate." -Satoshi NakamotoP2P means you hold your private keys and no intermediary gets in the way. Miners *could* get in the way, and they also *could* collude to 51% attack the network. The key to Bitcoin is that while they could, they don't, because it would harm their bottom line. Meanwhile, Lightning is peer-to-payment-hub-to-peer, and unlike miners those hubs aren't incentivized to help Bitcoin. They can just as easily switch to altcoins.
4	1523896145	1	I do not sign up for farm2farm money, I want my **peer**2peer money, thank you.Don't care what Satoshi said.But if he wanted farm2farm SPV clients network, then he would not implemented the block consensus checking code when node runs in non-mining mode.
3	1523887126	2	lol the saddest thing is you actually believe that garbage you're spouting. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.
3	1523881664	1	Redditor /u/Etovia has low karma in this subreddit.
2	1523874698	-6	well satoshi didnt create bcash now did he?
3	1523874881	3	Ahh I don't even know what you're talking about. I'm talking about Bitcoin Cash.
4	1523891768	1	Yet somehow you know that people talking about north coreans are talking about Bitcoin Core?
3	1523874722	2	Redditor /u/Nikooohz has low karma in this subreddit.
1	1523867831	2	The majority are just useful idiots
2	1523869777	10	That doesn't sound very Satoshi of you. 
1	1523877112	1	So simple. So obvious. The whole "Bitcoin (BCH)" thing is the only legit reason people call Roger a scammer. 
1	1523885604	0	99.9% of people who knew about Bitcoin in 2011 thought it was a scam or worthless. The market can stay irrational for a long time. Exhibit A:  IOTA was up 20% yesterday.
2	1523893617	2	What’s your problem with IOTA
1	1523901940	0	Absolutely right. People wont even want to touch #bcash because of its shameless promoters. Truly pathtic as we are supposed to be on a subreddit devoted to the original and only bitcoin. 
0	1523865179	15	Why is there some much useless competition between bitcoin core and cash? The more projects the better imho
1	1523870608	7	I think that people think one of them is being manipulated and shilled and other people think that people are shilling the one with more fees ^(sorry, its 5AM)
1	1523871393	7	Never gave this much thought. The tribalism is bizarre. Why not just let the best fork win?
2	1523874522	2	You got down voted for being reasonable. It’s getting increasingly frustrating that the two can’t exist together and let markets dictate their growth and adoption. If Bitcoin cash, which I agree is a really poor name to adopt, is better, then it should (in theory) will be more widely accepted. However, we cannot right say that bitcoin will lose because well, it’s kind of winning at the moment and BTH’s spokesman seems to be quite dodgy (I get it, he’s a businessman). I’m going to use the crypto that everyone else uses (that is if we can transition from fiat, still waiting for that to happen). And don’t forget, there are plenty of other cryptos out there...there’s a long road ahead for lightening network and simply, adoption of crypto as a whole. I’m not doubting that crypto is coming but just being reasonable here. Maybe we should all just chill out and let markets do their thing. 
3	1523885731	1	It really depends on what you think we're here to discuss. A discussion of Bitcoin that tiptoes around frank exchange of opinions about which version you think is better and why is inefficient.
2	1523895480	1	This is how people think they make their side "win"
1	1523873402	2	> If it's your intent to refer to the name of two different reference clients on > each chain then one client is called **"Core"** and the other is called > **"ABC"**.

Bitcoin's name is bitcoin... You do not get to rename it You picked a dumb name.. live with it. "Bitcoin Cash"
2	1523873406	2	Hey, ImReallyHuman, just a quick heads-up:  **therefor** is actually spelled **therefore**. You can remember it by **ends with -fore**.  Have a nice day!^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
2	1523890444	1	This is actually a brilliant point. If you don't mind I am going to quote this on my Twitter acct w/ nearly 42k followers.  Well put, my friend!!
2	1523887031	1	> Bitcoin's name is bitcoin... You do not get to rename itNo, they should rename it. Bitcoin has a definition and is the original experiment. If BTC wants the name "Bitcoin" then they should try to implement the original experiment. If they want to try another experiment then they should do like everyone else and create an altcoin. It is seen that they decided to modify BTC instead of creating a new coin so they should use another name and leave the name "Bitcoin" for those who try to continue with the original experiment.
1	1523902583	1	#bcashers originally hijacked the name which causes just enough confusion to get people to buy it. Then #bcashers trash the original because there is apparently no reasonable other way to promote their shitcoin other than trying to hijack the original.They are a cult confirmed.
2	1523904007	1	Blockstream highjacked Bitcoin, and pushing out on their LN just to make money of Bitcoin!
1	1523875882	0	It's because you have the likes of Roger Ver and a community of idiots who will attack Bitcoin on anything and anytime they can. THIS sustains the crypto civil battle between the two. Also, they realise that Bitcoin Cash can only be truly strong if it keeps riding on the coattails of Bitcoin, by constantly proclaiming itself to be the true bitcoin. Otherwise Bcash would just be another Bitcoin Gold.Just let them both play out, and have the stronger crypto become the stronger crypto.
0	1523872706	2	That’s for offering those stickers to shops free of charge @memorydealers
0	1523880043	2	#BCHGANG
0	1523897292	2	Extremely confusing branding is it not? Why use both colors when you can stick to one?
0	1523866969	10	I love what you are doing, but I hate how you are doing it. BCH is already great with low fee room to grow and fast transaction why continues to create conflicting environments?Now purposefully mimicking bitcoin logo is a rather underhand and seemed like a cheap knock off rather than representing a strong brand.I feel that this tactic is rather sinister and will not work. It is turning away people who careless about btc vs bch.
1	1523868349	2	Agreed.  Shooting himself (all of us) in the foot imo.
2	1523874893	0	It’s really unfortunate because BTH has a good use case but led by a complete slimeball businessman which is extremely off-putting. That’s what’s keeping me from investing 
3	1523887614	2	There isn't a leader though.  I would base your decisions off of the technology, not the people. 
4	1523888739	0	Roger Ver isn’t very good for the brand, that’s all I’m saying. It’s unfortunate he had to use a a series of bad decisions with BTH. 
5	1523889635	2	I agree with the first sentence.  What bad decisions are you talking about? 
3	1523887145	1	"led" I don't think that means what you think it means.
2	1523876063	-2	You are not one of us. Go back to your censored sub.
3	1523877583	4	Wow. So refreshingly welcoming around here...
3	1523887437	1	Paid account? 
1	1523892159	1	It's because most of us are still pissed that bitcoin was hijacked and we won't be happy until the original that we all invested our money and time into is back at the top.
1	1523893535	1	Who is mimicking who? BTC has nothing to do with the original vision of Bitcoin and some have used extensive censorship and control of the original Github repository to take advantage of the current extraordinarily amateurish understanding of most "blockchain" investors to fleece them into thinking BTC has anything to do with the original vision that got Bitcoin investors so excited all those years ago. Besides sharing the original ledger, which Bitcoin Cash also has, BTC is a science project of Gregory Maxwell and a few others who heard about Bitcoin and decided it was fundamentally broken and that it was their job to fix it. They even said so explicitly. Yet they didn't want to give up the name to the coin that keeps the same ledger and doesn't think their fixes are needed?
0	1523869758	1	Roger lives in JapanThese guys are Japanese.......Roger: "Hold these signs up and i'll give you 100 BCHShop owners: "Can you make it 1 BTC instead?"Roger: "OK, but don't tell anybody"Dear down voters: I'm not hurt by losing internet points and your down voting is only better exposing my comments as a most down voted root comment on Reddit is the 2nd best place to be
1	1523887215	7	Nope. I live in Osaka and have been there. I know it is hard to believe. But many of us actually support BCH and it has nothing to do with Roger. 
2	1523889332	-2	I have nothing against BCH. Absolutely nothing. I wish it well and hope it does as well as all it's supports wantWhat grinds my gears is that the big BCH promoters are trying to steal earned turf of BTC. They don't seem to want to separate from BTC, they seem to want to take its ground and it's obvious why. BTC has earned itself a good name, so much so that general users of cryptocurrency call cryptocurrency "Bitcoin" in general.I don't own any BTC nor BCH so I have no conflict of interest. I wish all coins/tokens do well now and in the future but BCH supports are acting like children.The worst thing i'm seeing BCH promotors do is try and re-name Bitcoin to Bitcoin Core. There is zero need for that except for them to clear way for something else to take the Bitcoin nameThe majority of people couldn't care less for all of this and I wish the promotors would just get on with their BCH project and stop trying to chip away at BTC as it appears completely pathetic by them
3	1523890514	4	It really is a matter of perspective. Sadly there is no definitive answer as to what makes "bitcoin". I have no interest in having at you with what makes bitcoin. I do however agree that "the REAL bitcoin" comes with implications that I disagree with. I much prefer a slogan of something like "Bitcoin cash is the BETTER bitcoin" because in my opinion until one chain dies they are BOTH bitcoin. I do not agree with a lot of what Roger does but at the same time he is helping and has been helping for year with adoption of bitcoin so I am willing to overlook some of these minor things as he is free to do as he likes. The argument I see parroted over and over is that its not fair because it confuses people. I have yet to meet a single person who stays confused for more than a minute that there are 2 versions of bitcoin with different qualities to them. So you are telling me there are 2 phone OSs (smartphones)? There are 2 major computer platforms(PC MAC)? There are 2 Major Colas (Coke and Pepsi)? There are 2 disc based gaming systems (Xbox PS) etc etc. People are not that dumb. If you disagree that bitcoin cash IS also bitcoin then we can not find a compromise. If BTC people are angry about the CORE name for whatever reason I am happy to use a different name to help distinguish the 2. Or we can say BCORE and BCASH until one comes out on top and make everyone angry. You see it as someone trying to usurp and take away or chip at the bitcoin name while other people see it as restoring the bitcoin name to its former glory. This is a matter of perspective and only opinion. Who is to judge what is and what isn't bitcoin? You have to decide for yourself.
0	1523899259	1	I get sushi all the time from a local place, is there any literature in Japanese that is something good enough to hand to the restaurant owner that they could understand Bitcoin Cash?
0	1523861839	-12	Failing BCash.
0	1523888236	1	Plot twist: it isn’t 
0	1523890501	1	Or Roger lives nearby as hes in Japan and took this picture and paid these guys for it...
1	1523893976	1	Nope. https://twitter.com/sakuranobonsaiThat's the guy on the left. His twitter profile title translates to "osarucoffee (payment accepted in BCH)"EDIT: And the guy on the right is: https://twitter.com/morizo_coin (BCH meetup in his twitter profile title)
1	1523890518	1	Redditor /u/ItsEvan23 has low karma in this subreddit.
0	1523866082	-4	        They probably have no idea what the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash is..        I could print a sign that says "Bitcoin Money" accepted here. Who would know it's a     different chain? No one. Would these Japanese Coffee shop owners hold up that sign    if I reached them first? Yes, they would.         Which is why "Bitcoin Cash" is a dumb and abusive name, it will only hurt the entire eco-    system, not just BTC or BCH or LTC, it will hurt all crypto currencies and the whole     ecosystem. Just like squatting the r/btc subreddit or confusing people between the     two names on bitcoin.com, it hurts the whole ecosystem to do this. It might benefit     bitcoin.com/RogerVer but wont help anyone else. If your project really is better then     differentiate it with a unique name and people will use it anyway, you don't have to     confuse people into using it, which again.. will only damage the whole ecosystem.    
1	1523888008	3	I am not sure if you are a bot or a troll so this is probably a waste of time. But I found your post quite disturbing and couldn't let it pass in case someone else stumbles upon it without a counter point. **At best you are ignorant. At worst you are racist.** I understand it may be hard for you to understand that people outside of where ever you are from speak and understand English. People all around the world have been interested in bitcoin and the scaling debate and understand the topic and the issues at hand BETTER than you or I, many of whom are not even native English speakers.  While it is certainly possible that you could go to any random cafe in any country and ask people to hold a sign for you for a photo, if you had taken the time to click on the link by the OP you would have seen that the shop owner does in fact know what he is doing and accepts BCH enthusiastically. I can also personally vouch for him seeing as I live nearby and went there last week and paid in BCH. I assure you that the owner of the cafe is not confused and understands exactly what he is doing. I will go ahead and make an assumption that you do not speak/understand Japanese so it is forgivable that you are not aware of the vibrant community we have here. But your ignorance should not be imposed upon others. Here is the link again: https://morizocoin.com/bchpayment_osarucoffee/ Here is his twitter: https://twitter.com/sakuranobonsai
