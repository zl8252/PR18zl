0	1523844593	14	According to their [protocol page](https://memo.cash/protocol) theirs a bunch of new stuff coming in V2:- Reply to memo- Set profile pic- Attach picture- Repost memoI'm really curious to see where Memo.cash goes in the next few years.
1	1523851210	4	Maybe to give Twitter a run for its money?We can dream.
0	1523835292	21	Cool project.  Interesting to see these ideas pop up on BCH rather than BTC...
1	1523843375	16	As someone actively building a new web service on crypto, we would have been fools to build on BTC.  Not only is it unpredictable, I'm not even sure it will still be around in 5 years.
2	1523846349	10	Counterparty, and a lot of their tokens such as Storj, already learned this the hard way.
0	1523853781	7	On a technical level, why are people building dapps on BCH and not Ethereum? What advantage does BCH have? Serious question
1	1523878687	2	Predictable network security algorithm. Limited Turing completeness. Low costs.
0	1523845054	17	This is how I think BCH wins: big blocks filling up not only with financial transactions, but with all kinds of stuff people never imagined, maybe much of it replacing the functions once controlled by big companies like Facebook, maybe even Ebay and Amazon. The BTCers will scoff at all the "frivolous" stuff filling up the BCH blocks right up until the point they realize their chain is the irrelevant one no one's demanding space on.
1	1523855082	3	For stuff like Ebay and Amazon you don’t need a blockchain. You don’t want to store that data forever.
2	1523855879	6	What about OpenBazaar? Seems a pretty good idea to me.
3	1523871367	3	Yes. I’m pretty sure they don’t use a blockchain for the e-commerce data.
2	1523856137	3	Or for any social media. Even now anything you say is or has the potential to be saved forever, but it would be nice for it not to be, and I wouldn't make an effort to move towards a system that saves everything forever and distributes it in a decentralized system by design.
2	1523856110	1	This old tired rhetoric is exhausting. Nodes arent forced to store the entire history of the blockchain. But some will. Furthermore Ebay and Amazon do store your purchases forever for marketing purposes.
3	1523871301	3	There is going to be a problem if you have one single blockchain that stores the monetary transaction and everything else too. Longterm social media and e-commerce platform should probably put their transactions on some side chain.
4	1523895834	2	> There is going to be a problem if you have one single blockchain that stores the monetary transaction and everything else too. It wont, people are not going to use memo for every post when you can do it for free somewhere else. It will only be used sometimes for somethings. Even if a post costs a few satoshi. Yours is a good example of a hybrid approach. The real problem is that belief in markets to solve problems on there own does not exist nearly anywhere in the world.
1	1523846584	5	I agree.
1	1523854740	6	It’s hard to see how this is a path to “winning”.  Bitcoin doesn’t want to be in this space you are describing.   This isn’t a novel innovation that BCH alone provides, so it will have to compete with all the other tech out there trying to provide a similar type of platform. The concept is cool and i’m sure we will see some amazing stuff that we haven’t even thought of yet.   But let’s be honest,  supporting twitters usage alone requires over 5k transactions per second and a ridiculous storage capacity.   Increasing the block size is not enough to solve all the challenges inherent in something of this scale.    Lastly, I was under the impression that digital cash is what BCH is all about.   The white paper, which is (overly) quoted as why BCH is the real bitcoin, focuses on a trustless digital cash system that solves the double spend issue without the need for a central authority.   Storing social media content and decentralized marketplaces are a bit different from the original intent.   
2	1523860275	3	The more use there is for the BCH the better it is for decentralisation.Because typically those non-monetary use case increase demand for nodes.
2	1523854885	2	The higher the demand for BCH blockspace (for whatever reason), the higher the price, the more resources will be devoted to mining it, the faster and more secure transactions will be, the better it will function as money, both medium of exchange and store of value.
3	1523856287	5	>the more resources will be devoted to mining it, the faster \[...\] transactions will beThat's not how it works.
2	1523856206	1	It should be interesting to see where memo goes. I think it will end up being used only for posts that require censorship restistance anyways due to cost. So the concern trolling about blockspace is probably not an issue, much to the dismay of  /r/buttcoin

0	1523829803	7	This is pretty coo. I hope it catches on and displaces twitter
1	1523851449	10	>I hope it catches on and displaces twitterAccording to [this post](https://www.dsayce.com/social-media/tweets-day/), which is two years old (so is a conservative estimate), Twitter users post 500 million tweets per day. Every "Chweet" would require an on-chain transaction of about 226 bytes. That's about 113 GB per day, *just* for "Chweets". So this displacing twitter doesn't seem like a very likely scenario.
2	1523862257	5	Tweeting is free so people can spam tweets when they feel like it. When you have to pay each time to tweet, I am sure the number goes down significantly.By the way, I am not disagreeing with your opinion. It is that Memo is unlikely to be Twitter scale overnight and I think however unlikely it is, I won't write them off because who knows what the next few years innovations will bring.
3	1523882528	2	Good points. As counterpoints, Twitter is only one social media platform, and significant scaling issues will occur long before Twitter scale.
2	1523851611	4	Awesome. Hope it catches on.
3	1523852048	6	My point is that it would be an incredibly inefficient system and would not likely work in practice. 113 GB per day is ~41.25 TB per year.
4	1523857486	0	> 113 GB per day is ~41.25 TB per year.Yes, unsolvable problem for the Raspi Nodes on the other chain, but fortunately not a problem for the data centers of the BCH miners. 
5	1523858090	2	#**ALL HAIL THE BCH MINERS**#**TRUST IN THE BCH MINERS**#**DO NOT VALIDATE THE BLOCKS OF BCH MINERS**#**BCH MINERS HAVE YOUR BEST INTERESTS AT HEART**
6	1523858679	4	Yes, read Satoshi. Don't read UASF bolsheviki BS. Merchants have zero problems to validate the network. But I can only encourage you and your soulmates to defend your chain as a chain where the goat herders in Tibet and Aethiopia can 'validate' their txs. 
6	1523860594	2	Yes, the blocks don’t need to be verified by every single user.Just like with BTC.
4	1523857831	-2	More or less the server of twitter. We can do it 
5	1523858696	3	Memo appears to have a fixed overhead of 206 bytes per post, plus up to 76 bytes of message. Twitter would be out of business if they were this inefficient, and that's even before the cost of replicating this data to every full node.
2	1523854734	2	That’s less than 1 GB per block. Should be feasible within the next ten years.
3	1523854887	8	That's **only** for Tweets on the blockchain, with zero financially relevant transactions.
4	1523855118	3	Can't believe I am agreeing with you for once.~~0.1-0.5~~ 2-5 cent/kB transaction fees may may help. If nothing else, it will pay for the bandwidth and storage.
5	1523855668	8	>Can't believe I am agreeing with you for once.Careful, you may start actually considering the content of what I say, rather than the person saying it.>0.1-0.5 cent/kB transaction fees may may help. If nothing else, it will pay for the bandwidth and storage.Current transaction fees are ~1 satoshi per byte, right? That's 1000 satoshis per kB. At $770/BCH current fees are $0.0077/kB or 0.77 cents/kB. If I'm understanding you (and my math is correct), you're saying *lower* fees are the solution?
6	1523856122	0	Disk space and bandwidth is cheap.I was [too lazy to look up my calculations](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7qi6mf/estimating_the_marginal_cost_of_a_transaction_on/)You are correct: the fees should be about 2 cents/kB.
7	1523856325	4	Do those calculations change with the upcoming increase to 32 MB blocks? Assuming full usage of course.
8	1523856505	2	No, they work until putting everything on one disk array gets awkward: around GB blocks.Edit: marginal costs ignore overhead, which would dominate for tiny 32MB blocks.
8	1523856803	2	We are going to terabyte blocks. No problem for our small world network, We don't have UASF Nodes on our chain. 
9	1523858347	0	TB blocks then PB blocks. Welcome to decentralized world running on Bitcoin Cash, the real Bitcoin. 
0	1523860677	3	I think this is really cool in theory, but ultimately it's going to be hard to convince anyone to use a social network that requires you to spend money. I'm no crypto expert but here is my take on the sort of changes that might make a system like this appealing to normal people. The main issue is to disassociate from currency. Many people will be turned off by the idea of spending money to utilize social media, even if it's just tiny amounts many people will feel guilty about it because it feels like wasting money. The solution to this is to make the system not use money- make it have it's own tokens that have such little value they are easy to acquire and people won't feel like they're spending money. This means not using the BCH blockchain, nor any other cryptocurrency's blockchain. It would need to be it's own blockchain. The tokens should not feel like money, maybe call them 'Contribution Credits' or something like that (this would be a reference to mining which I'll get to in a minute). The next major thing to do would be to discourage the token's use as a currency, to prevent it from gaining a market value which would bring us back to the first issue. Perhaps a good way to go about this would be to make transactions that move credits to a different address require a fee rate 1000x greater, with an exception only for moving tokens freshly acquired by a miner. The exception makes it so that faucets for new users to collect their first tokens from are reasonably possible still.  This also would strongly encourage users to mine their own tokens which brings me to my next item... Significant changes to block reward and blocks. Social media moves fast, it can't wait 10 minutes to confirm. Blocks would need to be much more frequent to keep up with people's need to communicate quickly. This would also have the side effect of giving independent miners more chances to mine a block and make their own tokens- this would reduce the need for mining pools (but I'm sure pools would still be more efficient for most people wanting tokens so they can use the network). Another thing would be to make the block reward somewhat proportionate to the difficulty (higher difficulty = more mining = more adoption = more users that will need tokens to start using the platform). This would also mean removing the cap on the number of tokens created, there is no need for deflation since it shouldn't be treated as a currency. The last thing would be to make it reasonable to run a node without the full chain history. As mentioned in a few places on this page, social media will generate far too much information to reasonably store redundantly across every network node. This would have to be addressed by allowing people to easily run nodes that only keep a specific amount of block history and without having to download the chain from the beginning. Nodes that skipped downloading the chain from the beginning wouldn't be able to fully verify that their chain is authentic, but the operator should be able to tell pretty quickly they're on the right chain when they can write messages and other people see them; since the system isn't a currency verifying the entire chain should be less critical. Obviously there would be *some* nodes that store the full chain for archival purposes, but it would not be very common given the tremendous size the chain would grow to.There are probably a number of issues with this I'm not really seeing, but this is just my take on what could make a system like this feasible.TL;DR:  - Has it's own blockchain  - Discourage usage as a currency  - High fees for moving tokens to different addresses (except when freshly mined)  - More frequent blocks  - Block reward proportionate to mining difficulty  - No token production cap  - Pruned nodes
1	1523870914	3	Well I think this is getting a lot of interest in the Bitcoin Cash community because it is on Bitcoin Cash. If it launched on its own blockchain or other chain, like Steem, Zappl, Peepeth - there would be much less interest here. From a technical pov another chain makes sense.Also.Paragraphs! 
1	1523878507	3	I think now more than ever people are realising that there is no such thing as "free" when it comes to personal data.You can choose to spend the 238sats (which is less than 1 cent) or you can "give" your data to someone else to sell on your behalf.
1	1523900389	1	Stand back and watch. 
0	1523829355	4	So can this replace twitter? Could the network handle a twitter like volume?
1	1523837224	8	Time for miners to become the new cloud.  They already use more energy than some countries, they've got plenty of horsepower.  They're just waiting for usage :)
1	1523832445	7	Projects like [peepeth.com](https://peepeth.com) are far more likely to give Twitter a run for its money. 
2	1523834514	5	Maybe, but im not so sure ethereum can handle the volume
3	1523837789	5	The initial stage of sharding will be ideal for Peepeth as it doesn't need intershard communication so volume constraints won't be an issue. It works well, too bad they didn't choose a better name for the frontend though but there will be other options.
3	1523837390	1	So far so good. 
2	1523835172	4	I think bandwidth is the key...and I would put my money on BCH being able to handle the volume.
3	1523856067	3	Can you explain why BCH would be able to handle a scale of this magnitude?  There is so much more to it than bigger block sizes.  The current tech isn’t designed for this type of application.   
4	1523878717	2	What's the point of your comment? Can you explain why BCH wouldn't be able to scale to this?There is no point in saying "it won't work" without trying first.
5	1523893274	1	My point is to have an open dialogue about the technology and get input from others who might have a deeper technical knowledge of why something might work or what is on the roadmap that would make something like this viable .In production level software, you don’t just try things without assessing the feasibility and potential outcomes of a change.   Blindly hoping something of this magnitude will just work is not how successful operations are run.    So, there is definitely a point in questioning whether something will work or not.  Agile development is all about trying things, but in an iterative fashion.   Going from 0 to 100 in terms of scale with a completely new use case is not iterative. 
5	1523894289	1	I forgot to add why I don’t think it will be able to handle this use case.   As others mentioned in this thread, the sheer storage and bandwidth requirements for handling tweets alone is many years out.    BCH was not designed for this type of usage.  With increased block size, theoretically it could work assuming bandwidth and storage get to levels needed, which again is years out.   If this is actually something the world wants, which is completely unknown, there will be many competing projects that will focus on this type of decentralized content repository technology.   Solutions that minimize storage capacity through compression algorithms and sharding techniques where not every node needs to store the entire content, will be the preferred solution.   Miners won’t prefer BCH network if another network accomplishes the same application at a lower cost.    
4	1523857689	0	You are right the tech is definitely not ready yet for 10K tweets per second.  But I do believe one day it will.  Once BCH gets opcodes that give developers options, I believe the sky will be the limit in terms of creatively solving global problems.  I think one day we might even see email on any blockchain that grows to support it.  Be it ethereum, BCH, or anything else.
2	1523839863	1	I can't even pronounce that
3	1523845153	1	"Peep ETH"
1	1523842478	4	Absolutely not and absolutely not.
2	1523846533	10	Not yet, and not yet.
3	1523884156	0	Boom. Tell that always negative fucker.
0	1523845004	4	This type of thing is going to end badly and be bad for the whole industry. Just because you can put something on a blockchain doesn't mean you should. Immutability means everyone running a node is going to have a copy on their computer of every illegal thing ever posted on this platform. It's also going to spell the end of privacy as we know it since any time someone gets doxxed, for example, their info could end up on one of these ill-conceived platforms and then never deleted.The most ridiculous part is that you don't even get any meaningful decentralization as part of the bargain because all of these sites have centralized front ends.
1	1523846482	10	If something should not be put in the chain, then it should be technically impossible to put in the chain.If the protocol allows it, then people can and will do it.You are correct - people should not plan kidnapping and murder over email, but we know it happens...that's not email's fault.
2	1523860788	2	>If something should not be put in the chain, then it should be technically impossible to put in the chain.The blockchain is permissionless, there is no way to prevent any particular use.
2	1523848060	4	Right, you can do horrible things with a kitchen knife but you can do practical things too which is what they are used for most of the time. The benefits outweigh the costs. On the other end of that spectrum you have things like bazookas which are rightly illegal.There's no real benefit of putting social media on a blockchain. The front end will always be centralized so you get no practical utility in terms of freedom of speech but you do get the very real cost of every illegal thing ever posted stored forever on every node. This is not good for Bitcoin.
3	1523848498	6	The front_end being centralized is an annoyance at most.  The data is what needs protecting.  And certain data being on the blockchain in terms of social media IS important.  Any kind of disruptive technology whose future depends on open communication cannot run on a privately owned website and it should not be censorable.  I am not only referring to Bitcoin, but any technology.
4	1523849263	8	I don't see which social media data needs protecting right now. Although I don't like how platforms like Youtube and Twitter hypocritically and inconsistently delete content, there are always sites like 4chan (or 8chan for people who *really* don't like rules) where you can say pretty much anything you want as long as it's legal.On the other end of the equation, what we will inevitably get when social media goes on a blockchain is an immutable record of:* libel* the worst kinds of illegal porn if the platform supports images or video* doxxing* leaked nudes* leaked health care records* lists of crap like emails of thousands of people* similar lists of credit card number, social security number, etc.* death threats* probably more that I haven't even thought ofBlockchain is supposed to make the world a better place but if we don't step back and consider the side effects of making it easy to put anything on there it's going to make the world a worse place.
5	1523854215	6	Excellent points. I think though that this sort of thing is inevitable in some form or another. Things like eternity wall have been around for a while. The protocol design allows for, so in some form and degree it is inevitable. So, taking a step back, what do you think should or can be done to mitigate these potentially negative side effects? 
6	1523855418	3	I agree with you that this problem is inevitable. It already sort of exists with the dark web. The question is how many people it ends up affecting. If social media ends up on the bitcoin blockchain, for example, it's going to affect orders of magnitude more people than it otherwise would. I believe in using blockchain not for the sake of it but when it can a) do something that can't be done with a relational database, and b) actually solves a real problem. For example a legitimate issue with social media is the unfairness of companies like Google and Facebook reaping billions of dollars of economic surplus every year that is created by their users. That could be addressed by new platforms incorporating micro payments to compensate content creators. Doing that without blockchain is extremely inefficient, especially internationally, but with blockchain it's feasible in a way we've never seen before. That isn't to say, though, that the content belongs on a blockchain.
3	1523856923	0	Front end not always centralized. See scuttlebot, mastodon. Nobody needs to look at content which might be offensive or illegal. Its better to have it than to not have it, since it can be very important to be used in the correct context. 
1	1523848732	1	It could have applications we haven't thought of though, like twitter but with politicians being unable to retract statements.
2	1523856448	2	Then why would a politician use it? Why would anyone use it if they can't delete mistaken or embarrassing things they've posted and then regretted?
3	1523856524	1	By the same reasoning you would think they would avoid Twitter
