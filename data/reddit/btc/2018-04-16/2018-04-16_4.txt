0	1523842643	22	He's right to point out this danger: the BCH community is not a random selection of former BTCers. It is a selection of people who thought it's okay/a good idea to go your own way when you reach an impassible disagreement.I am a pro-secession ancap myself who supports the Nozick-type idea of everyone seceding till they find a level of organization they can happily accept voluntarily, and maybe this is part of why I support BCH.But we have to be aware of the pitfalls of this mentality, too: there is strength in numbers, especially with something like crypto, which relies on network effects.Recently I was having a discussion with someone who claimed nChain is "Blockstream 2.0." Basically that the exact same thing is happening again. But I don't expect history to repeat itself, at least not exactly. The BCH community is a very different community from the BTC community and may face different dangers.This is not to say we should drop our guard against groupthink, going along to get along, blind adherence to authority and unwillingness to defy perceived "consensus." But we should also be aware of the opposite danger: naturally contrarian types (of which I am one) seeing a new cult leader behind every corner and going their own way until BCH is balkanized down to nothing.Mike Hearn is right that crypto is a social problem. And solving social problems is quite hard. Sometimes the best way is just to go your own way (as I wish e.g. California and Texas and many other parts of the US would just break up rather than remaining locked in eternal struggle over conflicting visions), but that doesn't mean that's always the best way, either. A successful movement will include a range of personality types and a range of mechanisms for conflict resolution.

The "danger" is nil. If there is enough controversy to split on anything and the market supports it, a split probably should happen. If there isn't enough market support, a split won't happen. Economics rules not just Bitcoin but every split attempt. What is also missed is yes, we are independent thinkers but we are also highly galvanized by the years if Core's reign. All their errors let us know what not to repeat. And happily, almost every single one of their errors were in deviating from the original vision. 
2	1523853375	5	I hope you're right. Maybe splits are technically and economically self limiting such that only a split about a significant issue, like block size, will produce any economically viable alternate forks.I am concerned, however, that it may not be purely technical and economic factors that determine when/if/how splits happen. For example, if there is disagreement on a technical question, like OP_GROUP, but the parties disagreeing fundamentally respect and want to keep working with each other in the future, a reasonable compromise may arise. But the exact same technical disagreement could lead to a split or bad faith deal, like SegWit2x, if those involved don't respect, trust, or just plain like one another.*Technical and economic factors will determine whether any given fork is viable, but interpersonal factors may determine whether one is necessary. That is, it is possible that interpersonal factors may turn what could have been an easily solvable technical issue, like block size, into a big deal. The split could happen first at the interpersonal level and then find an excuse for itself at the technical level.I think the ideal balance is an environment in which diversity of opinion on technical, strategic, economic, etc. matters is welcomed and encouraged, but interpersonal drama, ad hominem, etc. is discouraged. This is harder to achieve than it sounds, and it sounds pretty hard.*I'm not saying that different groups working on BCH should have to like each other for BCH to succeed. In fact, quite the opposite: so long as discussion focuses on technical, factual, economic-type levels then the personalities involved don't much matter. What I'm hoping to avoid is a situation in which personalities take center stage, with a possible negative consequence of adversely affecting ostensibly technical, strategic, economic decisions.
3	1523887061	2	This! --^One thing that help avoid many personal conflicts is to not get personal. If the other part gets personal, do not get sucked into it, by starting to do the same. Keep cool and level-headed, always. Yes, it can be difficult - I am no saint either, but I will try harder from now on. If venting is neccessary - at least take it out on a core-troll instead :-) 
4	1523887065	1	Hey, chainxor, just a quick heads-up:  **neccessary** is actually spelled **necessary**. You can remember it by **one c, two s’s**.  Have a nice day!^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
5	1523888291	1	I have looked up this word maybe 100 times. It's not only the c's and s's but also the e's and a's. I still get it wrong every time. Let's see if your trick helps. :)
1	1523844205	14	Well said, and particularly important to understand what's at stake.> But we have to be aware of the pitfalls of this mentality, too: there is strength in numbers, especially with something like crypto, which relies on network effects.Before considering a fork we have to ask ourselves it is worth giving up the network value for this point of difference?  Big blocks vs small blocks seemed worth it.  Personality clashes don't.
1	1523870123	4	I think what lies at the heart is the left/right mentality. Particularly libertarian vs totalitarian / authoritarian. The Bitcoin Core team is riddled with totalitarian / authoritarian thinkers. That's why they're putting forward just one single solution to the scalability problem. It's *the* solution. That's totalitarian. Meanwhile Bitcoin has its roots with libertarian ideals. We remove constraints on the chain and let the market figure out if some offloading solution has a right for existence. 
1	1523845791	5	There is strength in numbers but I think there is more strength in being fluid and being able to adapt to circumstances. And bear in mind that even if you do leave, you can always return, often with little to no penalty (I still retain BTC should that chain ever regain sanity).I am not worried about nchain. I think they are a vehicle for CSW's ego mostly and a way to advance whatever he hopes to achieve. And I'm not too worried about him because if he's up to something, he doesn't seem to be very good at it. It'll all resolve itself in good time.I do thing the op-codes question is potentially divisive. I think it will be settled amicably though. I don't think the stakes are high enough whether they're included or not to cause a real rift. I could be wrong though.Addendum: It should be noted that California and Texas should be much more loosely coupled anyway. A good weakening of the federal government would go a long way towards easing tensions. Along those lines, more fluidity between chains would be helpful. Perhaps there could be contract based decentralized exchanges.
0	1523843585	12	I'm a big supporter of any crypto network that builds new technology successfully.   I started looking at BCH seriously because it has a community behind it and is progressing.   No crypto is *there* yet.  The race is very cool though. That being said, I believe the CW drama, mainly him dancing around the idea that he's SN, is ridiculously counter intuitive to a community that is primarily using cryptographic tools.  It shouldn't even be drama.  Either he confirms he isn't by saying that out right to all the people who suggest he is, or he signs a headline with the block zero private key.How we managed to end up here where we are taking people's word for it that he is SN is strange af to me.  Identity in cryptocurrency is meant to be trustless.  Proving identity was the Bitcoin's first function.  Mainly talking about /u/memorydealers saying CW is SN.  Your thoughts on this Roger?  
1	1523847174	6	> or he signs a headline with the block zero private key.As much as I would like this to happen, there should be no impetus to having anyone perform this.Assuming that anyone could do this, why should they? If they do this then that person opens themselves to massive, likely debilitating tax burdens, opens themselves up to physical danger (abduction/blackmail/etc) simply to prove to you (or others) that they are in control of a certain private key. Let alone the possible deleterious effect to Bitcoin Core & Bitcoin Cash that would likely occur if it was proven.I'm not going to argue, one way or another, about the effects that his allusion to being Satoshi creates; each individual needs to come to grips with either believing or not.
2	1523847603	7	Of course he doesn't have to do it.  He's put the impetus on himself though.  And it's exasperated by people like /u/MemoryDealers.  He is dancing around being SN so that changes the expectations.  The claim he's making is enough for his country's central revenue agency to pin all that income on him.  He's already opened himself up to all of the physical danger by painting a picture that he is SN.  None of those are good excuses for keeping up the charade.  If he truly is worried about all of that, he should come right out and say "I am not Satoshi Nakamoto" so that we can all move on from the drama.  Maybe he is, but at least then he can't pretend to be and cause drama.  It's damaging.  
3	1523848576	2	> He's put the impetus on himself though.He's stated several times that he did not want to come forward.  There are plenty of reasons for him not to want to prove it beyond question.
4	1523854107	5	That's just the thing, saying he doesn't want to come forward is still leaving it dangling.  Dangling it isn't something that somebody who didn't want to be recognized as SN would do.  Dangling it still puts him in danger, still makes the tax man wonder, and still makes the community divide.  Further, prominent figures like /u/MemoryDealers claim they know he is SN.  I can't find the video where he says he saw it, but it's out there.  He knows he has said it on camera. However, in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZNtbAFnr-0), CW shows someone he is signing a message as SN.  That's pointless.  We have to trust that everything behind that laptop screen is above board.  That defeats the purpose of the entire system he claims to help design.  Identity in cryptoeconomics is trustless.   He goes on and on asking why he has to reveal himself, but he just put on a song and dance moments before that where he pretends to reveal himself.  It's time he either shit or get off the pot.  The dance is ridiculous.  I'm surprised it's been allowed to go on this long.  People have a lot of issue with CW, but this is the only one I think is of any importance.  
5	1523856191	2	Consider you were Satoshi.At the beginning, somehow, lots of bitcoins ended up on Silk Road.  The guy who set up SR had the book thrown at him.  Would you not be concerned about the legal contagion here?  At least leaving a crack in the door to escape from if big bad government came calling?Also, combine the fact that he didn't really want to come forward (read Andrew O'Hagan's article for more on this).
6	1523856419	2	I get your point.   If I were in that position with those concerns, I wouldn't even claim to be SN.Thats not what CW is doing.  He claims he is but also refuses to prove it.  
7	1523856693	2	He had his arm twisted.  Basically he needed the cash, signed a contract, and was then pressured into it.> (read Andrew O'Hagan's article for more on this).
8	1523856871	2	I've read O'Hagan's article.  It doesn't change anything about the current situation.  
6	1523873267	1	More speculation isn't the answer.
5	1523856411	1	Those arguments have been discussed ad infinitum, and it seems it will never end. Some argue, that he sould prove, and others argue that's exactly what he does not want because there are some reasons to act exactly in the way he does. 
6	1523856686	3	I don't believe that the length to which it's been ignored and deflected, diminishes the fact that he continues to claim he is SN and refuses to prove it in public.  
7	1523856992	0	You can believe what you want and add the same chapter to this drama as many times as you want. Isn't it great?
8	1523857217	1	I think I will.  Thanks.  
2	1523849399	6	There is a simple way something to the same effect could be done, though. All "satoshi", whoever he is, needs to do is to send a Tx back and forth in BCH blockchain.No need for public appearance, no need for anything. He can also input data with whatever the msg he wants from that block.
3	1523854370	5	I'm not sure why you were down voted for that.  It would definitely prove that SN is still alive and involved with Bitcoin at the very least.  
4	1523854754	5	Because some ppl are stalking my account, when I post I get automatic down votes. :)
5	1523854780	4	Fair enough.  Have an upvote on me.  
0	1523849349	2	very important and informative video
0	1523872259	2	I really like your videos - you're well spoken, short and on point (but not too short) and IMO really represent the ethos of what Bitcoin Cash stands for. Please keep making more.$5 /u/tipprAlso, if you want community feedback on the next video, my preference would be to stay away from selfish mining. In fact, a short tutorial/talk on what the new opcodes are and what they'll enable would be pretty cool.Edit: d'oh. Enjoy the tip OP! :)

0	1523874269	1	Here are some suggestions for future videos.  I like all the ones you suggested at the end of this video.Please speak about how yours.org curates its content in a general sense.  Have your expectations been met or surpassed in relation to this?Where are the weaknesses in the framework of earning crypto for content and what limits are there in addressing these weaknesses?  Maybe there are none.What sites with a similar content monetization model are your strongest competition?Could you imagine yours using another crypto, blockchain or protocol such as [Oyster](https://oysterprotocol.com/) to store files such as video and images, alongside BCH for reward?Could you speak about specific individuals who have a high profile among BCH enthusiasts?Maybe you could point to a favourite post on this sub in the last week and explain why you liked it and give your take on the matter.
