0	1523825697	11	Once we have cards and businesses have Crypto-card-readers, We will be there. Should not be too much longer now if we don't get "owned" (ruined) like Btc did.
1	1523826573	5	Assuming we don’t get pwned, I really feel like this is at least 10 years away. There is really no major advantage to merchants, relative to the enormous hassle at this point. Yes, there are some advantages... but the hassle far outweighs them. In fact, it can really only go mainstream if mainstream POS systems like Square decide to accept BCH... because vendors aren’t gonna switch their POS systems. The current system is just too damn good and works too damn well most of the time.
2	1523828710	11	Before BTC went off-mission, it was well on it's way to making this sort of adoption happen. The nearly free fees, freedom for The People mission and other advantages of BCH should be enough to garner mass adoption. A major factor speeding this up will be massive coin-price rises attracting people and merchants to the space (same as Btc's path before it hit it's self-imposed wall). 
2	1523849105	6	The killer value for merchants is not paying 3% of *revenues* in fees.I don’t think you realize how much value that is... that can be tens of % of the profits for small item merchants 
3	1523892546	2	True. But the other side of this is that consumers get 3%-5% back when spending with their credit cards, so all consumers want to pay with credit cards. For example, I get 5% back just from shopping at Whole Foods (my normal grocery store) with my Amazon Visa Card (Amazon owns Whole Foods). And I get 3% back whenever I spend on my Chase Sapphire Reserve card at restaurants. Plus, consumers love credit cards because they get a lot of consumer protection, such as the ability to dispute charges. Plus, of course, most consumers don’t have enough money to spend anyways, so the credit cards allow them to defer payment. I guess I really don’t see Bitcoin becoming a gigantic payment mechanism for most consumer-to-merchant transactions in the developed world... its best strengths are amongst the unbanked and within the developing countries and for international peer-to-peer payments... these are all the areas where credit cards can’t currently be used. And then, of course, there are all the forthcoming BCH features such as smart contracts. These are things that credit cards will never be able to do.
2	1523885587	2	it will take something compelling. low/no fees are compelling for merchants, inverse is true for consumers  (2% cash back for example)I agree with everything you said - it needs to come from POS vendor.... merchants won't want to deal with many machines. 
1	1523850844	2	> Once we have cards and businesses have Crypto-card-readersHow do cards and crypto-card-readers work?
2	1523882561	1	Like a credit card. Cell phones can already do it, but, takes a bit of learning on both sides.
3	1523885531	1	I mean from a technical perspective.
0	1523850154	3	You don't need a guide for credit cards because the banks do all the work for you. The cost of that convenience is them holding all the money and power.Crypto requires more work up front, but you get the privilege of retaining control of your funds.
1	1523850663	2	Agreed!Being your own bank is HUGE.And merchants saving on tx fees is also big, even if they use a processor like BitPay...
0	1523858619	3	In regards to CoinText, there is a huge security vulnerability with it.  They claim to store no data related to phone numbers, so it has to be an algorithm they use to derive keypairs from a phone number.   What is the algorithm that does that, and what is preventing anyone from deriving that algorithm to find the keypairs to any publicly available phone number?  edit:  Another point is that they have the algorithm.  A central point of authority is protecting it.  Think about that.  
1	1523866416	2	Cointext apply their own private key to the algo just like SHA256 and Private Key. You have the code to SHA256, does not mean you can reverse engineer the Private Key for Bitcoin. SO not only do you need to work out the cointext algo, you also need the cointext master key (or keys). The phone number is not the only input for the algo.
2	1523901599	1	So that means they control all keys and this is just another centralized bank. I don't trust their employees.  I shouldn't have to.  
0	1523867081	2	In the UK all stores basically use the same contactless debit card terminal. Instead of trying to create a new POS system for every store so it can accept crypto which will never work we need to be able to integrate with these machiness. And I mean pure crypto payments not fiat. These are the terminals https://ingenico.co.uk/smart-terminals
