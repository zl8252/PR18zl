Submission title: Debating or talking technical stuff with somebody in one of the Reddit crypto subs is so incredibly frustrating. Most people are just parrots. They just repeat without actually having spend the time to get a rudimentary understanding themselves. So ... here is what we should all aim for:

0	1523889925	14	There's two reasons I reply to trolls here:* Once in a while it's not really a troll, just an innocent that has been mislead by them* And even if it is really a troll, it is important to not leave wrong information unchallenged; it is not as much that I'm trying to convince the troll to change their minds, as it is that I'm showing to other people reading the conversation later that the troll is wrong (or otherwise acting maliciousky) and has not been downvoted just for disagreeing with the sub's opinion/narrative.| Once in a while the trolls keep insisting after I made my point clear; in those cases, I leave them with the last reply in the conversation as it usually just reinforces my point against them.
0	1523886413	9	>Just don't get bamboozled in wasting your time on a troll. They are attacking one of your most precious and scarce resource: time.I like this.Good rant with many good points 
0	1523897675	3	Case in point... Both air and oil are fluids.  Hydraulics and pneumatics both use fluids.  Pneumatics use gases and hydraulics use *liquids*.
1	1523898061	5	Found the expert. :-) TIL the difference between liquids and fluids. 
0	1523879599	16	OP TLDR: I argued with some idiots over the Internet and now I am ranting here.
1	1523879924	17	I have a ranting quota to fill and I am lagging a bit behind. Like a sleeping dog that suddenly remembers he is suppose to guard the property and scare all the bad guys away by barking. 
1	1523881966	6	Actually the TLDR is that most people who are in this debate on the other side, don’t even understand the basics. That’s the take away from his post. Yours was a little bit derogatory.
2	1523882583	5	It wasn't meant to be derogatory. It was meant to suggest that Internet arguments are usually a waste of time.
3	1523896771	1	I think it helps others to see well constructed arguments so they can appropriate them for their own use later. If not, only the shit will get repeated.I've learned a lot from online discussions I never partaked in.
1	1523891295	3	If that was supposed to be a ranting, it ended up in a quite good article. Cheers.
2	1523892312	5	I got lucky and mined a rant that the other miners validated as genuine. 
0	1523889000	3	That reminds me when Charlie Lee tweeted he sold all his holdings for the general good so he could be more objective about developing the project r/litecoin didn't question any of it and used his words to promote the coin...
0	1523879881	5	OP, I bet when you started this post it was going to be one or two sentences wasn’t it?  
1	1523880442	9	I still have 35 minutes before I have to get ready for work, so it could have been worse. 
2	1523885295	4	:D I feel your frustration.. $2 /u/tipprIt's just annoying to see these people arguing based on arguments censorship has clearly planted in their brains. It's obvious that there's a huge lack of understanding. I am now kind of in a stage where I don't really feel explaining it is worth my time (It's sad I know) I feel like for each person I helped to question their believes there are 5 new ones appearing. I'm now focusing my energy on my bitcoin cash project to just help making bitcoin cash more useful. In the end all these noobs will change their mind anyway once they see LN fail and onchain scaling work out. Some will only understand the language price charts speak.
3	1523892148	3	Thx a lot.

0	1523880423	2	> Even Satoshi himself would probably agree with this Isac Newton quote: ""If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."Some say that Newton was actually referring to Robert Hooke, his rival, because Hooke had very short stature. Hooke alleged that he discovered the inverse-square relation. Newton trolled him for posterity.

0	1523896149	2	The influx of users into Bitcoin around the end of 2017 was nothing more than profit chasers. They have no knowledge and have no interest in seeking additional knowledge on Bitcoin or any crypto currency. They just want 1000% returns as they were promised. When people tell them about technical issues they are seen as the enemy, Bitcoin is simply their 'widget' to 1000% returns and they will fight anyone saying anything negative about their pick. With the price now vs. end of 2017 they are in too deep to switch, they will fight and defend their choice down to the last dollar. 
0	1523900036	2	It's ironic you'd lament the parroting... you have no idea how many times I've tried to discuss rationally the pros and cons of big blocks on r-btc, and how often the ultimate response, when cornered, was "*Satoshi's Vision!*" or "*The White Paper!*". On those occasions when I do encounter someone with a better technical understanding, the conversation generally finishes with "*Moore's law!*". Now I'm all for tech improvements and love the progress, but ultimately relying on it to make a blockchain sustainable is wishful thinking - It might happen, or it might not. And this is what I've never seen from **ANYONE ON THIS SUB** address, what happens if tech enhancements just don't keep up? Nobody is ever willing to even admit this possibility, just in case... to come up with a plan B. And, in my opinion, what's absolutely worst is that there are respected members of this community who know that could happen, who know that tech might not improve as required for on-chain scaling, yet they never say anything about it. You can tell people are aware of this in the subtle ways they avoid the question... Just as they avoid discussing the role of full nodes - The silence in some cases is truly deafening. But clearly, if I never expose myself, you'll just assume I'm on board.So yeah... I think you should "do your own laundry" before "casting the first stone".
1	1523900049	0	Redditor /u/DesignerAccount has low karma in this subreddit.
0	1523880607	5	That's why with the SM I havent picked any side. I just try to disarm the tribal rhetoric.
1	1523882027	3	Not picking a side, is picking a side, when one side has shown themselves to be insanely corrupt.
2	1523886368	6	It shouldn't be about people, but about arguments. It's good to only pick a side of an argument once you understand it, unless arguing provisionally / devil's advocate
2	1523882690	7	Lol. That's exactly the tribal rhetoric that's retarded. I have no mathematical authority or arrogance claim to know the answer. However bullshit like "my side or their side." That's exactly the bullshit that I will call out everytime I see it, before it tears apart the community.If people see each other as enemies they will not talk, and people who don't talk will never resolve conflicts. We grow through conversation, even if we disagree, and that's how you find the truth together. Without this function, we can only fight and split. We must be allowed to disagree freely. There is no consensus without free speech, and that comes from the community as much as the moderation.Pick your own damn side. We all have our own individual sides. And the right way to play the game is to pick no sides but your own. You don't know me, and it's your loss if you assume I'm on the other side because I won't join your shitty tribe and paint a group of individuals as "insanely corrupt' and etc, even if some individuals are those things.It's like my liberal friends accusing me of being complicit in Trump's election, because I call them out when they say resentful shit of "trump supporters." I don't even like Trump. Like this tribal bullshit is so retarded, because people have no idea they are doing it.My concern with SM is that people fall into camps and no discussion ever takes places because the rhetoric takes over, not genuine discussion. 
0	1523885158	-4	wall of text - TL;DR/r/btc is are the FUD-spreading parrots, for example your ridiculous claim that SegWit transactions are "not signed". You have no shame, you anti-intellectuals. 
1	1523892669	5	Yes, strawman an entire community of varying opinions and ideas. Good job.
2	1523894092	0	> Yes, strawman an entire community of varying opinions and ideas. Good job.No regulars here debated this points, entire cabal of Bcash was spreading this lies or standing idly by.You lack the mental capability to see this lie and/or integrity to speak out against such totally false bashing of Bitcoin.Only case where bcashers have some reflection is when it comes to the fraud, to Craig Steven Wright the fake-satoshi... everyone in cryptoworld, especially Bitcoiners know he's obvious conman, but even on this topic only around half or so bcashers woken up, rest keeps praising him.Really sad.
3	1523894442	1	Cool story? I can only speak for myself and dont want or expect anyone else to speak for me. And you can't tell me to say anything I don't want to.I don't really care about how segwit works. The signature thing, I'm not smart enough to make a judgement either way.https://youtu.be/BWvKMu7OYV4But I'm against this.And tbf, 90% of blindly proCSW comes from sockpuppetting.
4	1523903035	1	I did not said every single one bcasher in the world is guilty personally of spreading lies and FUD, but looking at how /r/btc operates, how bcashers groups operate, what is on the frontpage, this is the end result.BCH is project started and owned by conman (CSW, Ver) and patent loving monopolist Jihan Wu, this is their coin. Seems you are cool with that, lol.
1	1523893580	2	Better TL;DR: "Make sure your shit does not smell before complaining about someone else's."
