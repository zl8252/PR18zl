0	1523951014	72	I realize that paid sockpuppets seems to be stalking Roger reddit account and brigading his thread and comments. It goes for his Twitter account too. Seems like Adam Back is right when he let slipped propaganda is a full time big team job.My question for these paid full time big team people is how ashamed and lack of dignity as a low life human being do you have to be to do all these? It reflects very poorly on your family upbringing and lack of values as a human being. Life is short, karma will get you.
1	1523959656	12	Those paid suckpuppets are also scammer
2	1523983234	0	Saying there are paid sockpuppets in crypto is about as accurate as right-wingers crying "paid protestors" every time they see a dem with a sign. These are INVESTORS with invested money riding on a crypto (BTC, in this case). Just like yall, they claim their invested crypto is better. Please stop with this claim that the other side is "paid off," it undermines the legitimacy of the whole cryptosphere.Edit: I'm defending crypto and getting downvoted. Wtf is this sub.
3	1523986845	2	Lmao. Use RES (r/enhancement) for a little while to tag users and you'll see. The astroturfing is mind numbingly obvious and has been since 2014 when it started. These users aren't real.
4	1523987501	1	Dude, users make multiple accounts to shill their ideology on both sides of the debate. That doesn't change the fact that they're investors shilling their investment. Calling them "paid off" is undermining all cryptocurrencies.
5	1523988068	1	Sorry, I didn't make myself clear by explaining the reason why RES tagging for a while will have you understand. It's because when you read posts by users you've RES tagged previously, the contents of their posts reveal their true intent. You'll have users use intentional fallacies in technical discussions, discussions on subjects surrounding the quality of the community, and discussions about companies. All fallacies which for newbies or people who are less knowledgeable to read benefit certain money interests.Do RES tagging for a while and you'll see. I suggest making small notes on each RES tag noting how much hypothetical chance it may be that the user isn't real, and noting certain deceptions they've pushed before.
6	1523989336	1	Can you use that RES tag on mobile?

3	1523987509	1	Not really considered “investing” more as in speculating that the price will go up tomorrow rather  than go down.  So they are speculators that this new anomaly will either soar or tank. 
1	1523964716	13	> My question for these paid full time big team people is how ashamed and lack of dignity as a low life human being do you have to be to do all these? It reflects very poorly on your family upbringing and lack of values as a human being. Life is short, karma will get you.Loved this.  I want to know as well.  But one thing you learn is that people feel justified in what they are doing. They don’t think they’re doing anything wrong. They think they’re doing something for a good cause. They genuinely do. Maybe it’s because they have no clue the history of this debate. They’re new to crypto. Or they don’t care about the social change Bitcoin was intended to bring.  Or they want their own particular coin to win. There’s a thousand reasons people feel justified to do unethical things. So they don’t see this as their mom completely failing at her job. Even though we do.
2	1523979161	1	Well said. Exactly this.
1	1523953648	8	I can't phantom real people actually doing all that. Some of them, sure. But that much stalking takes so much energy that, to me, it has to be automated. People sell their accounts for a few bucks and a few use them en mass to troll. If the majority is actually real people then that is very distressing. 
2	1523964791	-8	Of course this aren't real people trolling because only people that are getting easily triggered or something like that are getting trolled and Roger has such a  good smelling cute pink anus how can someone dislike him and bitcoin CASH anyway at all *claps rogers butt* ?
1	1523954819	15	Or what if... people just don't like Roger Ver and that's pretty much it? 
2	1523956563	13	If that is enough to stalk him everywhere with personal attacks, then that still reflects very poorly on that person
2	1523961185	15	Right, here I am bashing roger for free like a sucker
3	1523966675	3	Why tho, why not do something more useful like stalk and bash Trump on all social media sites?
4	1523967117	4	I don’t go out of my way to do it, but just by browsing this sub regularly roger gives me more than enough reason to shit on him without even trying
5	1523967170	-1	What reason is that? You think what core does to people is in someway better than what anything Roger has ever done? 
6	1523967306	1	I didn’t say that. I’m strongly pro BCH. I just hate him as a person
7	1523968035	2	Have you ever met him?  Spoken to him?  Or, you just hate him remotely?
8	1523969070	6	See above comment
7	1523967321	1	Yeah why? 
8	1523969055	12	Here’s one quick example I have on hand since I replied to it.https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/86mjyl/comment/dw6olnf?st=JG3NOPX5&sh=951cef0cHis personality just seems shitty most times I’ve seen him comment on Reddit or post anything. He also is technically breaking Reddit’s rules for self promotion based on how often he posts links to bitcoin.com, which he owns and gets money for. I don’t feel like digging around for more examples, but there are more out there. I don’t see why it matters so much to everyone here that I like him as a person. I support BCH, and most other people in the community and I understand he’s been influential in the bitcoin community for a while. He’s just a shit person
9	1523974579	4	So accidentally using a hashtag that others have associated with a shitty movement makes him a bad person in your eyes?Seriously needs more examples, it looks like you just hate him for no reason to me. If someone says "me too" in real life do you hate them for that too, since the phrase "me too" now means you support rape, regardless of any kind of context?
4	1523967040	0	It would better to expose the deep state.
2	1523961480	1	Unlikely. Would you go to such lengths as creating countless sockpuppet accounts just for that?
2	1523973126	2	Well Roger's been kind of a dick about his Altcoin, BCash. 
2	1523974028	1	Then why debase themselves by hounding his every move?  Obsessed much?  It shows that they have poor character, there’s no way around that fact.
1	1523956371	5	It is sad how many people would jump at the chance to do evil for money. I wish I had more faith in Karma providing Justice. I do think those who take shortcuts in life often end up without the skills needed for a good life.
1	1523975144	1	There are some people you just can't empathize with because they have zero sense of shame.
1	1523985176	1	They hire people that are dead broke which is why most of them have poor grammar because they live outside of developed countries and are happy with pennies a day 
1	1523962398	-8	The conspiracy theories are strong with this crowd. Maybe, just maybe, Roger  s a controversial public figure that a lot of people aren’t a fan of. Or maybe it’s the big banks and blockstream colluding to spend all their time trying to tear roger down on Reddit and Twitter.You all have drank the kool-aid (fun historical fact I just learned: Jim Jones actually killed everyone with “flavor-aid”, so this reference is wrong), so you’re not really capable of seeing how he fights dirty with his own intentional misinformation. He’s basically on a global media campaign to tell the idiot masses that bitcoin is dead, despite over 40% market dominance. Of course people with a vested interest in bitcoin are not going to like Roger.You all are going to self-rationalize this nonsense all the way to 0. It would be funny if it wasn’t so sad. But I’m sure writing this post helped you rationalize your beliefs against a market telling you you’re wrong (price, dwindling media coverage of BCH, etc.). Our minds value that sort of cohesion, so hopefully it gave you some comfort.
2	1523964971	16	Why is it always somebody who’s only been around for a year that thinks BCH is a joke?We’ve all been here since 2012 or earlier, and Satoshi‘s right-hand man Gavin Andresen even supports BCH. As does Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum, Coinbase, Gemini soon, and the biggest merchant processing company in the entire bitcoin world. BitPay.Are they all drinking the Kool-Aid as well? Or do you actually think you know better than every one of them?
2	1523963085	6	despite 40% market dominance?You realize that it was 100% first? Then 90%. Then 80%. Then 70%. Then 60-50-40% with a brief foray into the 30’s. 
3	1523964394	-2	Do you know that for every shitcoin that is new on the market bitcoin needs to gain 10x of the shitcoins value to stay at 90% Dominance? If I release a shitcoin and pump it to 100million marketcap just by buying 1 of the coins for myself for 1$ (at 100 million coins supply) bitcoin would need to add 1 Billion $ to stay at 90% JUST because I invested 1 Dollar. Market dominance is not a measure of how big bitcoin is - it's a measure of how many shitcoins there are and how much the market is manipulated.
4	1523967490	5	> Do you know that for every shitcoin that is new on the market bitcoin needs to gain 10x of the shitcoins value to stay at 90% Dominance?Do you know that even the Litecoin copypasta coin quintupled against BTC since the 1MB blocks got full?
5	1523967867	1	It did that 3 times already and also got much higher in 2013 and 2015 even without any fork your conclusions are wrong.
6	1523968139	6	As BTC blocks became full, all the first competing currencies gained against BTC cripple coin. Pretty obvious. 
6	1523968708	0	We should really just unsubscribe from here and move on with our lives while these clowns circle jerk themselves into their parents’ basements. They’re so hopeless. Logic and reason went out the door months ago. Now it’s all conspiracy theories and delusion. The scaling debate is relevant, but the hardcore BCH community is embarrassing. 
7	1523968954	-2	NO U
8	1523968959	2	No you both
4	1523973023	1	So now the same metric you touted a second ago is meaningless? Makes sense. 
2	1523963858	0	How much has Adam paid you? Be honest. Reveal yourself.
2	1523964583	0	This. 
1	1523976492	0	dont u ever hear about mtgox? google the "mtgox scam" and you will understand why everyone fking hate roger and everything about him. he is literally most hated person on the cryptoworld.and no one needs to get paid to hate roger. oh, hell no.
1	1523963354	0	Not only sockpuppets but also evil paid scammers, they are so evil it's probably Adam himself together with his best friend Gregstream directing attacks from their trollbase. Now they do not only try to keep the blocks small but also the minds. It's disgusting. I wouldnt believe it if I haven't seen it myself.
1	1523972489	0	Ver uses the exact same tactics as Trump.  Blatent lying and accusing your enemies of the exact tactics you yourself employ.
1	1523951206	-2	Money talks.
0	1523959633	75	Is this sub just people shit canning btc?
1	1523962592	45	Seems that's all it is now... Gonna unsub soon if this keeps up. No useful info here
2	1523962935	18	I just did. It's basically the only content I've seen here for around 3months
3	1523965372	-2	^ ^ when trolls fake-talk to eachother to try and encourage ***real*** users to unsub. Nice job guys. You must think we’re all idiots.
4	1523980069	9	I don’t care for either coin. But the bitcoin cash community is horrible. You all think absolutely anyone with anything negative to say must clearly be a troll how delusional can you be?! I don’t get why almost every hardcore bitcoin cash supporter is like this. (Again I have no preference)
5	1523983845	2	The problem is that there are a lot of trolls out there and they make most of the negative comments. So it is hard to tell. Usually when I ask someone about a negative comment they quickly show how little they know and that they just want to troll.If you have serious concerns or negative comments you need to give some justification and be ready to back it up. 
6	1523983958	2	I agree
4	1523965631	15	Take off the tinfoil hat and stop crying bud. Im not convincing anyone to unsub. I asked a question and it was answered/confirmed.You can't tell me the countless posts bagging btc, on a sub dedicated to btc, is any better?
5	1523978314	8	People on this sub are delusional, we bring up a valid concern that all we are doing is attacking bitcoin and then they attack us. I subbed here for news on what is happening with Cash not memes for days. Unsubed
5	1523966187	-2	You act like you don’t know why this sub exists. You’re so shocked, that you have to run away and unsubscribe. 80% of the people here were banished by corrupt mods for supporting on-chain scaling.  Do you have any clue what this entire thing is about? I’m betting you’re new to crypto. Probably less than a year? Please unsubscribe. Don’t talk about it. Just do it.
6	1523966407	13	Haha holy fuck. You sound like a 12 year old having a tantrum! Did those downvotes trigger your PTSD from being banned? I'm sorry they hurt you. For someone who doesnt care...you're not doing a good job of it. 
7	1523966553	-4	“Redditor for less than 6 months”Actually you have more down votes than I do.  Why would down votes bother me when this entire thread is full of trolls downvoting anything pro-BCH? You guys look desperate to me.  Afraid.  Worried.  Honestly.  Do you realize that just makes everyone here work 10 times harder for BCH to succeed? All you’re doing is motivating people like me to do even more than I would have.  So thank you for that motivation.
8	1523967641	17	You've edited the same comment, completely, twice now. Talk about desperate. 
8	1523967077	16	I gave you some extra time to edit your comment for accuracy and 'extra impact'. Bitching like a little baby...haha. mate I couldn't care less.. you'll see from my profile I've never commented here before. It's just your spicy reactions that keep me coming back.It was a good talking to indeed. You just needed a few extra goes at it. Do you need a few more revisions?
9	1523968267	8	I edit my posts to better convey what I’m thinking.  And your response has nothing intelligent or meaningful in it whatsoever. You’re trolling.  So this is where I bow out of the conversation. If you have something meaningful to say related on chain scaling? Then let’s talk. But youre here to talk trash and laugh. I’m about to further BCH’s reach around the world by actually doing something proactive this week. So thanks for the additional motivation.  That’s all you’ve accomplished. Hope that makes you smile :-)I’m out. 
5	1523966310	-4	Oh god the horror, giving the scroll wheel a little extra nudge is just too much to ask, better unsub, move to the mountains, and forsake all technology to stop yourself from seeing that *one* picture that makes fun of a group of people that have been bullying and censoring the community for almost 10 years.
4	1523966345	-4	Yeah it pretty obvious that these troll represents the fear of the success and adoption of Bitcoin Cash.  They are seeing their plans of criplpling and retarding Bitcoin starting to unravel.
4	1523983248	0	I find it a little suspicious they all have exactly 9 upvotes as well. (Would not be surprised if you had the same number of down-votes)Should not be *too* hard to randomize that.
3	1523985849	0	You should leave already if you cant find useful info, its posted frequently
2	1523983423	-2	Theres useful posts every week, do you just not bother to come here often? If so dont make it our fault. 
1	1523963548	19	There's so little focus on crypto talk in general... a pity
2	1523983604	-1	Theres useful posts every week, do you just not bother to come here often? If so dont make it our fault. 
3	1523983759	3	There are useful posts here and there, there's no denying that. The amount of posts just bashing on the other side is just too high imo.
4	1523985901	-1	Ok then its prob better you go, otherwise help vote up the useful stuff
1	1523973891	7	I tried suggesting on more than one occasion to focus on developing BCH rather than hating Bitcoin... and always managed to open the floodgates of downvotes. I am a firm small block supporter, but would love to see how far can tech be pushed if you want big blocks. Most of the stuff I'm seeing, though, is about how shit Bitcoin is.
2	1523983581	-1	You must love Microsoft
1	1523966949	15	Yep. Riding on the coattails of BTC is the only way BCH can stay relevant.Otherwise it's just another BTG, and who ever talks about Bitcoin Gold?
2	1523983490	1	Bitxoin Cash is growing ridiculously fast without LNcoin, sorry you cant see that
3	1523988822	1	I can see that. I'm happy. I own BCH and BTC in equal amounts, so BCH's success directly benefits me.But really? Snide attacks at BTC constantly? Is that the only way BCH can stay relevant?Stand up by your own merit. Not by attacking another.
2	1523983148	0	Bitcoin Cash came first. Bitcoin Gold was devised afterward (with a pre-mine!) in order to discredit Bitcoin Cash.
3	1523988947	1	So? BTC came before BCH. BCH was devised afterward in order to discredit BTC.Timeline doesn't matter. What matters is how a crypto stays relevant, and BCH can't do that without constantly comparing itself to BTC and attacking BTC whenever it gets the chance. It's disgusting. 
1	1523973275	6	Yep! FUDing bitcoin and perpetuating easily debunked misinformation. 
2	1523983936	2	Please give examples of debunked misinformation. 
3	1523984242	1	BCH is not bitcoin.
4	1523985422	3	What is your definition of Bitcoin that excludes BCH?Claiming to be a decentralized open source software project that does not allow forks is very hipocritical. 
5	1523985657	0	Bitcoin consensus. BCH is just another fork of bitcoin. >What is your definition of Bitcoin that excludes BCH?
6	1523988051	2	Bitcoin consensus is defined by Bitcoin developers. Your definition is circular logic. "Bitcoin is Bitcoin because Bitcoin says so." A fork of Bitcoin is still Bitcoin. BTC is a fork too. 
7	1523988554	1	In order...No it is not. Close. No it's not. bitcoin is bitcoin and not a fork of itself.> Bitcoin consensus is defined by Bitcoin developers. Your definition is circular logic. "Bitcoin is Bitcoin because Bitcoin says so."A fork of Bitcoin is still Bitcoin. BTC is a fork too.
8	1523989206	1	You need to justify your "no"s.Who defines Bitcoin consensus? Bitcoin BTC has had like 5 soft forks and at least one hard fork in its history. It is every bit as much a fork as BCH. 
2	1523983537	1	All you do is post easily debunked negative info. 
3	1523983629	1	Such as....
4	1523984672	0	Most of your post history
5	1523985049	2	Sorry the charts are negative for BCH.
6	1523985785	1	This is dumb
7	1523987337	1	You can argue with market until you realize you are wrong or run out of money.
1	1523965440	9	The picture is not correct anyways. The tires are just 8 times bigger but still squared. Wake me up when bitcoin cash provides more than bigger blocks
2	1523966512	4	But than it wouldn't be like the white paper describes, I can imagine the inner conflict it will bring.

1	1523965885	1	Maybe, but they aren't wrong.
1	1523979192	1	Sadly most of BCH's success lies in people realizing that BTC is broken as a world currency for everyone. So yes, there will be lots of shit talking. 
1	1523965584	-5	We are shitting on Gregs Corecoin and Adams evil plans, btc is fine

0	1523955313	16	Their cart had wheels once. I think Greg Maxwell is using one as a hat now.
0	1523961063	26	Just a quick question: Is Roger a programmer?
1	1523962301	12	*crickets*
2	1523965446	2	Thank god he’s not.  Look what programmers being in charge did to Bitcoins market share.
3	1523969565	2	The marketshare of bitcoin and ethereum (measured in btc) is bigger than all bitcoins in existence so it's all fake anyway. There is nowhere but up to go from here for bch.
4	1523977544	2	>The marketshare of bitcoin and ethereum \(measured in btc\) is bigger than all bitcoins in existenceIn other words, the marketshare of bitcoin, plus something else, is bigger than the marketshare of bitcoin?  I can't argue with that.
1	1523970429	1	You just blew my mind a little bit.
0	1523976430	3	Nice picture, but what are the actual arguments ?
0	1523951517	23	r/im12andthisisfunny 
0	1523949488	33	I get that you're pro-Bitcoincash/anti-Bitcoin, but why do you keep pushing negativity? seems counter productive to get your product more popular by shitting on others for having different opinions. 
1	1523965150	7	No. Roger is not anti-Bitcoin. That proves you don’t know what this is about and you’ve been listening to your overlords tell you what to think. Doesn’t freak you out a little bit? That you don’t even understand the basics of what this is about? That you’re getting lied to, and you don’t even have the brains to actually question what you’re being told?Roger supports bitcoin. What he doesn’t support is a corporation coming in and controlling the direction of the code, strangling on chain scaling, and nullifying bitcoins social change in the world. All of those things are happening. Which is exactly why every OG in the fucking ecosystem supports bitcoin cash right now, not just Roger. Do you even know any of this?
2	1523966564	8	>listening to your overlordsnice.his current sentiment (which is very obvious, it's not a secret or anything) is that he has turned his attention from Bitcoin in favor of BitcoinCash, this post itself is proof of him having negative sentiment towards Bitcoin - ``every OG in the fucking ecosystem supports bitcoin cash right now, not just Roger.`` I wouldn't class myself as an "OG" but i have been following BTC for a while, it is wrong to disregard someone else's opinion based on their length of network use, and blindly follow those that are "OG".
3	1523967315	2	Please take a moment to actually listen to my words this time. His focus is on BCH because it has the technical elements that Bitcoin was supposed to have. BCH had the ***same*** codebase, and ***same*** block chain at the time of the fork. ***It’s a clone of bitcoin, set aside, so that a new development team can redirect the code back to the original vision.***It’s called a fork. Do you know what forks are for?They’re for redirecting Bitcoin back to its original vision.  In this case, on-chain scaling as was described in the white paper.   Major, important technical aspects of Bitcoin that have been blocked by a corporation.  A corporation that came in and hired the top developers in bitcoin. So that they could force transactions ***off-chain*** and charge for them. You’re not aware of this? That doesn’t bother you? It doesn’t make your conscience uncomfortable? Maybe we have different ethics. But don’t get confused. Roger doesn’t hate bitcoin. Forks happen when the development team currently in charge fucks up. Forks are intended to take the ORIGINAL product and redirect it. Route around. Save the system. Yes - - you get a new ticker. But it’s still bitcoin.
4	1523967727	3	I didn't talk about any of these points - which are very clearly opinionated might I add, why are you bringing them up? my comment OP was about bashing other opinions to further your own. 
5	1523972231	-5	You’re literally not listening. I directly answered what you said. And I introduced new concepts and thoughts that you didn’t mention, because you need to understand them.  The cognitive dissonance is unbelievable. You’re on your own buddy.
6	1523975624	8	>  I directly answered what you saidno you didnt, you brought up points about "BTCvsBCH" > because you need to understand them.i'm fully aware of the situation and whats going on.
2	1523970161	2	>every OG in the fucking ecosystem supports bitcoin cash right now, not just Roger. Fucking lies.I've been around since late 2010. I mined on Slushpool, used MtGox before Mark bought it, bought Alpaca socks and Capucin coffee, bought bitcoin on Bitcoin-OTC, remember when Atlas started r/bitcoin. I feel like I'm pretty OG and I absolutely do not support Bitcoin Cash, in fact I sold most of mine.
3	1523971312	7	Cool.  So you don’t care about the social change Bitcoin was supposed to make in the world. And don’t acknowledge or understand that strangling on-chain scaling kills that usecase. Well I do.  We just have different ethics. Different priorities.  We got into this for different reasons. You’re correct. It isn’t “every“ OG.  When I said OG, I wasn’t talking about Joe miner  sitting in his parents basement in 2010.I was talking about the biggest names in crypto, who worked directly with Satoshi.  The ones who were part of building Bitcoin. MANY of them support BCH. That has meaning.  I’m sorry that you don’t give a shit about Bitcoin disrupting banking, or banking the unbanked, or giving financial sovereignty to the poorest and oppressed in the world.. I do. You’re entitled to not give a shit about improving society.
4	1523971709	4	>So you don’t care about the social change Bitcoin was supposed to make in the world. Go fuck yourself, you moronic piece of shit.Turning Bitcoin into PayPal 2.0 with miners as a huge central point of failure and regulation, because only corporations can afford to run nodes - woo yeah such social change that's going to make.
5	1523976331	3	> Turning Bitcoin into PayPal 2.0 with miners as a huge central point of  failure and regulation, because only corporations can afford to run  nodes You are talking about Lightning Network right?
6	1523976512	3	No, I'm talking about gigablocks.
5	1523978214	2	Don't fuck with Bcash fans they are totally mindless. Lets see what will happen to bcash.... 
1	1523954071	12	I found the photo amusing because it reflects reality.  I’m still just as busy as ever promoting Bitcoin. (BCH)
2	1523960236	14	You think this is Harry Potter vs Voldemort where one can't live if the other survives, but in reality BTC and BCH are Harry & Ron. They're rivals, but in a constructive way. If one wins, they both win. You've gotta stop the 'us vs them' narrative and grow up a bit. You're fuelling a fire which has the potential to burn down the whole village. Sit back, relax and let yourself go. Positive vibes my friend, for all. 
3	1523961774	3	BTC can't win on its current path. They will either change direction or lose. The sooner, the better for everybody.
4	1523964578	2	Why not?
5	1523965207	6	You might want to learn the basics of what they’re actually doing to bitcoin. It’s unbelievable to me that you don’t even know.
6	1523984592	1	I'm asking if you know. 
5	1523969292	3	Bitcoin Core is betting everything on LN which will never be adopted because it requires your private keys to be online to receive money and then you can only receive the money that you locked up yourself in the first place.
3	1523964300	0	Downvote for Harry Potter reference ! 
2	1523961934	13	You shit on btc in btc-subreddit and get props for it? Whats wrong here?
3	1523963322	-4	Is it shitting on BTC by pointing out that the PEOPLE involved in BTC are doing things the hard way?
4	1523963863	4	not only his post counts as shitting on BTC, it's also misleading and smells like propaganda.
5	1523965268	6	No, dear simple minded friend, he’s shitting on the developers who changed the definition of bitcoin and nullified it’s on chain capabilities. That’s what he’s doing. Stop drinking the Kool-Aid your overlords of keep serving you. It’s spiked with something.
6	1523968745	1	> dear simple minded friendstarting strong with adhominems? you, my "friend" contribute to the reason this sub has been a shithole ever since roger and co took over and made it their propaganda platform.
7	1523971768	2	Actually I’m quite proud of this place. It’s full of people that care about what bitcoin was supposed to accomplish in the world. You guys have lost the vision. You’ve lost the purpose of bitcoin. I don’t know if half of you ever cared about the vision in the first place. *The fact that it doesn’t outrage you that thousands of people have been forcibly silenced for supporting on-chain scaling, says a lot about you. Your lack of ethics.*The freedom to dissent is a foundational premise of bitcoin. When corporate interests and corrupt moderators have taken over, and you don’t care? I have no respect for you as a human being.Especially since you come over here and shit all over this sub like a bunch of children.
8	1523973838	3	> The fact that it doesn’t outrage you that thousands of people have been forcibly silenced for supporting on-chain scalingnice propaganda tactic. what happened was that there were *many more* people supporting segwit and hesitant to do a hard fork. the moment bch crowd decided to fork off - it became an altcoin discussion.nobody was silenced *because of their opinion on scaling*, people still talk about scaling tradeoffs on r/bitcoin without getting banned. it's the moment when you start promoting a forked coin as a bitcoin that gets you into ban territory.> You guys... come over here and shit all over this sub like a bunch of children.i'm not guys, i'm a lurker on both subs. and so far the only people shitting here are roger and his shills spewing their propaganda and attaching as many labels per sentence as they can. 
2	1523958000	1	just like how you keep promoting craig wright, the proven lying scammer?liars/scammers stick together.  nice blocking/censorship on twitter, hypocrite.
2	1523961321	0	Is it ok to bully and tease people with mental disabilities if you are biggest promoter of the special olympics? BCH doesn’t need this kind of promoter.
2	1523978293	1	LOL, Bcash pointless coin...
1	1523963610	1	You must be a Blockstream sockpuppet /s
2	1523963915	-4	they are out in full force today
3	1523964712	1	/s means sarcasm
4	1523964907	-2	I'm a troll enjoying the narrative
1	1523950105	-30	Like he's going to answer you honeydew, you are a liability. Your neckbeard is sticking out of your shirt
2	1523953431	10	Blc? Bacon, lettuce, cucumber?Terrible fake account my dude. 
0	1523957930	15	"BTC Supporters........"A few inches above that: "/R/BTC"
1	1523959294	12	Quite amusing cult-like dissonance
1	1523961825	4	It shows both kinds of BTC supporters. Bitcoin Core supporters and Bitcoin Cash supporters.
2	1523962318	3	Bitcoin core supporters and Bitcoin ABC supporters * fixed for you
3	1523967208	7	Bitcoin Core supporters and Bitcoin ABC, Unlimited, Xt, Nchain, Bitprim, Flowee, parity, and don't forget Gavin Andresen, bitcoin.com, Coinbase, Bitpay, Bitmain, etc.Fixed for you.
4	1523967296	1	is "Gavin Andresen" a bitcoin client? link me please, i want to install it and run a full node of Gavin Andresen
3	1523969152	2	Sorry, I meant Lightning ICO supporters and Bitcoin Cash supporters.
1	1523979329	0	It is called that because /r/bitcoin banned everyone who would talk about bitcoins scalability problem. This started many years ago before BCH. These people migrated to this subreddit. It just so happens BCH falls in line with what most people here think is the real bitcoin.Pretty crazy how few people know this. 
0	1523975193	2	BTC be haulin' a cart full of Lego dildos.
0	1523985039	2	Love it! 
0	1523974646	5	I like how this sub is called btc not bch :D
1	1523979093	3	It is because /r/bitcoin has banned any disucssion of a scaling solution (besides LN) since like 2015. Everyone that was banned migrated to this subreddit, which has exsisted much longer than BCH. It just so happens that BCH falls in line with what most that were banned think is the real Bitcoin.
0	1523967275	2	BCH fanatics know that only way to keep BCH relevant is to constantly compare it to BTC, otherwise BCH is just another BTG.It's actually pretty sad. I own BTC and BCH in equal amounts, so I don't really care who wins, but the sheer amount of animosity from BCH against BTC is pretty staggering. Fueled by numbnuts like Ver.
1	1523986075	2	There is a huge reason for the animosity and if you cant or dont understand why then it shows you dont undertstand the reason for the rift very well, you should do some more research
2	1523988735	1	We've all heard all your petty little excuses - Bitcoin got derailed, Bitcoin Cash is the true Bitcoin! /r/Bitcoin is full of censorship! Bitcoin is full of corrupt assholes! Waaaaaah!Now you need to understand that at the end of the day, BTC and BCH have taken two completely different paths. The reason BCH is adamant on constantly barking at BTC, is because that's the only way it was stay relevant - in the shadow of BTC.Now grow up and move on. I wish both BTC and BCH success, but I hope users like you and Ver fall and break your nose.
1	1523986893	1	This sub likes to compare so : You have one big badass dog and a small shitty dog.  Guess which one is barking the most? The little shitty one which is BCH. This is nature. BCH is the shitty one so its strategy is to shit talk BTC.
2	1523986905	1	Redditor /u/braitacc has low karma in this subreddit.
2	1523988592	1	I'd actually say BCH is a decent sized dog. But it doesn't need to bark - yet it chooses to do so, fueled by stupidity.
0	1523959235	2	roger why are you censoring people on twitter?
0	1523970307	2	But posted in the /r/btc sub. Lulz
1	1523979394	0	It is called that because /r/bitcoin banned everyone who would talk about bitcoins scalability problem. This started many years ago before BCH. These people migrated to this subreddit.

0	1523950682	-7	bcasher has only wheels, no cart, no load. best analogy for the state of bcash :))
1	1523956614	3	That's pretty good. We have the great idea and a plan to use it. I like our chances since your side promised to never use the idea, lol. We can build the cart. Remember, we did try to offer (beg you to use) the wheels for everyone's cart first. 
2	1523958142	3	Having a blocksize limit  is a bit like having vertices on your wheels. The bigger the limit the more vertices, the smoother the ride. Optimal situation is no limit, no vertices. The BCH dude gets it! ;)

0	1523961746	1	Lol pretty funny i guess it is one of those it’s funny because its true moments Maybe bitcoin will make a wheelbarrow nextEdit meant to say a wheelbarrow with round wheels next 😂pardon my thickness  I like bitcoin and bitcoin cash I really don’t understand a lot of the bickering over it , imo we are all on the same side . ie not the banks side 😆
0	1523972885	1	Brilliant!! Love this!! :) My only concern to Roger u/MemoryDealers is that the branding on the bitcoin.com website still seems very supportive of BTC instead of BCH. For example, these two things immediately stand out to me:1. On the homepage, there is an extremely large price chart for BTC but absolutely no price chart at all for BCH.2. The entire website is still branded with the color orange instead of green, which seems to indicate BTC to me... especially after looking at the great cartoon above.
0	1523978866	1	This is funny. I support both communities. I'd like to see crypto move together rather than fight but some of these memes are hilarious. 
1	1523986202	1	There was a fork
2	1523986478	1	And a spoon
0	1523953959	-1	This.
0	1523949267	-1	Given our large block size, I think there should be one BTC and two BCH people!
1	1523950250	-4	Actually number of people is OK, but bch lad should be in lambo :D
2	1523951120	1	The reason why I didn't mention lambo is because I'm not some 14 year old kid wanting to get rich hoping for BCH to "moon 4 ma lambo". I'm focused on adoption, utility and technology.
3	1523952359	-6	Reasonable. I'm just taking a piss and I think lambo would be nice little nudge to bitcoin core hodlers dreaming of their own Lamborghini from £5 investment.Edit: hodlers
4	1523958612	-1	At least poland has hot women, not everybody is a dumb lambo bitch like you.
2	1523951496	-5	Stfu hypocrite, when I talked about price you down voted me and called me a troll, now you say you want lambo? Like 6x less lambos, douche?
3	1523952160	-1	Oh hello my brother in faith.Are you ready to raise above mempool yet?Let's be lambo bamboo brothers.I love you.
0	1523970763	-2	The BCH has no cart and isn't even sure what to do with the wheels so it just stands there in awe as bitcoin creates financial revolution... Someone should set up a store that only sells straws for BCH.
