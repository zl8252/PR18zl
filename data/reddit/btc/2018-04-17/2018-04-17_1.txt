1	1523932451	-43	“Core can not compete.” Stop using core’s codebase hypocrites. 
2	1523932979	53	We’re using the original codebase, not core’s. Ours doesn’t have segwit, lightning, RBF, or other unnecessary workarounds.Did you genuinely not know that?
3	1523933850	-35	Didn’t core developers make BTC? How much of the codebase before the fork did BCH developers (before fork) make?
4	1523935969	33	> Didn’t core developers make BTC?  no, they removed Satoshis' name from the license, not the same thing as writing it all.  
4	1523935871	25	Are you being serious right now?
5	1523938215	22	He is serious... None of the Core developers were with the project during the first three years.
6	1523944354	2	> None of the Core developers were with the project during the first three years.That’s not true:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors?from=2009-08-01&to=2012-01-09Not sure why your incorrect statement received 13 upvotes within minutes.
7	1523947189	8	Because it's true in spirit even if some of those people got involved in the later years. "Core" didn't invent Bitcoin. They leeched off it after having shoved out the people originally involved.At least one of those original people is now a Bitcoin Cash contributor.
8	1523947585	1	>one of those original people is now a Bitcoin Cash contributor.Only one? How come that BCH is not able to attract more than a single BTC developer if it is so superior?
9	1523949444	6	Well Satoshi is gone. Mike came back here to do an AMA and while he supports BCH he has moved on. So of the the most important early devs, one out of three isn't bad. 
4	1523953346	4	Some of the original devs from the Satoshi years of BTC like Gavin Andresen, are now behind BCH. Apart from that the various BCH teams contribute substantially to BCH with new things that are not from BTC Core. BU gigablock research, Graphene - block propagation compression etc. New op codes, colored coins proposals etc.. In fact, the next year in the roadmap have ZERO stuff from Core. 
4	1523943371	6	> Didn’t core developers make BTC?No Satoshi did.The client was named bitcoin QT.Bitcoin Core is relatively recent.
5	1523951998	6	The project was renamed from Bitcoin-QT to Bitcoin Core on a proposal from Bitcoin dev Mike Hearn.Incidentally, though Mike no longer contributes to Bitcoin, he is a big-blocker who is supportive of Bitcoin Cash, and cowrote (the first versions of) one of the Bitcoin Cash implementations.Mike was ousted from the project largely because he supported onchain scaling efforts and promoted client diversity in opposition to the monopoly that formed around Blockstream / Core.
6	1523952320	1	True, unfortunately that rename to bitcoin core helped confuse people into thinking Bitcoin Core is the true Bitcoin.
3	1523940791	-10	I got bad news for ya, bub. Do a git blame on Bitcoin ABC
2	1523943248	7	>“Core can not compete.” Stop using **Satoshi** codebase hypocrites. FTFY
2	1523946916	7	are you forbidden from buying BCH? why the hate..its just a coin.  just buy some so if it does good you don't have to be walking around angry for the rest of your life.open_source means that anyone can use the codebase.  You are not a hypocrite if you restore what is broken in BTC to get Bitcoin back.

2	1523971146	1	You realize that the ability to fork is intentionally put there in case btc got co-opted.  A fork isn’t a betrayal, it’s literally intended. 
2	1523947338	1	Haven't you figured out that we can't steal something if it was already ours to begin with?
3	1523950343	1	> it was already ours to begin withWhy are you claiming ownership of an open source project that is supposed to be decentralized and to which anyone can contribute?Ps. I wasn’t able to post until waiting for 10 minutes. Why am I being slowed down? I want to voice my civil opinion here without being held back. Why is that being made more difficult for me? Especially in a forum like rbtc that rails against censorship.
4	1523951640	3	> Ps. I wasn’t able to post until waiting for 10 minutes. Why am I being slowed downOne would assume any Redditor of four years such as yourself would have learned how Reddit works by now.You are being slowed down very likely because you do not create intellectually honest content in this sub, and thus receive downvotes.  If you receive more downvotes than upvotes in a particular sub, Reddit rate limits you.This question you ask is a *lovely* example of you creating intellectually dishonest content that justifiably earns downvotes, because you and I both know that you know why you're being rate limited, and that it is Reddit policy.  This form of softcore trolling doesn't always go unnoticed.  FWIW I myself try not to downvote anyone below score of 1, so that their content isn't hidden by the Reddit user interface.https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/4dz17t/what_are_the_effects_of_negative_karma/
5	1523955303	1	> You are being slowed down very likely because you do not create intellectually honest content in this sub, and thus receive downvotes.Excuse me? In this thread my comments have a net of 14 upvotes as of this moment of writing.
6	1523957616	1	Good for you. If you continue to post content that the sub finds valuable then I'm sure your karma in this sub will return to positive and then the sitewide rate limiting policy will no longer apply to you.

1	1523975800	-2	Nice one /u/seweso ???He has a track record of being patently wrong on blockchain workings. Back in fall last year he was **absolutely adamant** S2X would blow Bitcoin out of the water. There was just no reasoning with him, and he had all the "reasons" in the world to support his claims. Of course, we all know how that ended, the "reasons" were bogus but he would not listen.And now he's making some grandiose claims again? Not impressed.
0	1523939135	14	Just think of it as another early adopter opportunity.
1	1523951047	9	Bitcoin Cash allowed me to pick up more coins than I ever had on BTC and in turn I'm actually using it, while I never really got to use BTC back in the day.That alome makes Bitcoin Cash way more attractive to me personally. The fact that it's actually usable as money and blows LN out of the water is just a huge bonus.
0	1523956040	2	Why must there be a competition? The more projects the better IMHO. 
0	1523943879	4	Couldn't the same be said about several other cryptos (e.g. Nano) in relation to BCH though? This doesn't seem like a compelling argument.
1	1523948957	7	Nano security and scalability still isn't proven, it's only a year old. 
2	1523952451	5	In fact it's [proven](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2626) to be unscalable. Average network distance much greater than 3 by design. 
3	1523973937	2	Nonsense. That 2016 article only addresses 'regular' blockchains. The combined PoS/PoW system of Nano's block-lattice protects it from Sybil attacks. See [the whitepaper](https://nano.org/en/whitepaper).
2	1523975181	1	> Nano security and scalability still isn't proven, it's only a year old.Hang on... neither is BCH's, if you really want to be completely honest. https://fork.lol... BCH hash rate is ~8-9% of total. This means it can be attacked **very easily** by any one of the larger mining pools. For example, Slush could secretly mine empty BCH blocks for ~6hrs, which is GUARANTEED to mine more blocks than the regular chain, and then release them onto the main net. Every txs is blasted out of the water. This would spook exchanges big time, especially the ones dealing with fiat, as they would not be sure how many confirmations are actually safe. The result would be a price of very close to 0.Taleb would say you are mistaking absence of proof as proof of absence. BCH has never been attacked... does not mean it's secure. Certainly not with 8-9% hash power.
3	1523980873	1	>Hang on... neither is BCH'sYes it is. If BCH security is not proven then neither is BTC. Yes BCH is not as secure as BTC with only 9% of the hashpower BTC has, but both networks are still incredibly secure.
1	1523944963	2	What other cryptos are really trying to be adopted as a person to person currency for the world? Most of them are not even trying to be that. Of the few left, which ones have a decentralized blockchain that is keeping the network safe from doublespending and such? I could go on if there are any left?
2	1523947950	5	Monero, for one. 
3	1523949244	0	Where can it be spent? (Adoption) Is there a website with a list or map of places Monero can be spent? Do you think they are working to seriously grow adoption? I'm not expecting too much yet. Just wondering if they are serious about the effort. Last I heard Monero was not able to scale for worldwide currency use. I love Monero and wish it well, but, I don't think they are trying to be a currency for day-to-day transactions for the People of the world.
4	1523949368	3	Monero can be spent all across the dark web. Here are a list of open web vendors of goods and services:https://getmonero.org/community/merchants/
5	1523951675	1	That is a start to real adoption. Last I heard Monero was not able to scale for worldwide currency use. I love Monero and wish it well, but, I don't think they are trying to be a currency for day-to-day transactions for the People of the world. I don't think Monero is trying to do what BCH is planning to do.
6	1523955148	1	Yes Monero is trying to. It's just much harder since the transactions are much larger. But don't mistake problems for intent.
7	1523955370	1	Fair enough. I hope Monero does well.
2	1523945344	4	I already named Nano.
3	1523947425	2	Where can it be spent? (Adoption) Is there a website with a list or map of places Nano can be spent? Do you think they are working to seriously grow adoption? I'm not expecting too much yet. Just wondering if they are serious about the effort.
4	1523952164	2	I see that your polite and utterly reasonable question was worth 5 downvotes but apparently wasn't worth a response.Heh.  Totally organic.  No Nano shilling going on here, nossir.
5	1523953515	2	Can one see the number of upvotes/downvotes a comment gets, and not just the net result?
6	1523954896	1	Years ago you could tell that. But reddit changed it so that you can no longer see the votes balance anymore, it just shows a "controversial" mark `†` now, if appropriate.
7	1523955359	1	OK, thanks!
4	1523973583	1	There's a list of some sites [here](https://usenano.org). It's smaller than some other cryptos but then it's only been on people's radars about four months. The devs are most definitely serious about adoption.
5	1523976667	1	Ahhh, Previously something like Raiblocks. Ya, You guys might be for real. I have thought we should be checking you guys out as a possible competitor for a while.
1	1523952298	-1	Maybe you are right that other crypto's are also better (better fundamentals) than BTC. It seems that's an off-topic comment though. I fell for the distraction in my other reply. Well played.
2	1523974507	0	Distraction? I was completely on topic. The premise of this post is that BCH does what BTC does better, so it will overtake it. That reasoning doesn't hold, even if you accept the premise, since multiple cryptos are better than BTC, and can also be argued to be better than BCH (under the same criteria).
3	1523975657	1	>  The premise of this post is that BCH does what BTC does betterYes, so, your point is off-topic (even if it were true).
4	1523976538	1	You missed out 'so will overtake it'. This post isn't 'BCH does what BTC does better'; if you think that you've misunderstood the post, but this is a point I never even argued against. On the actually topic, 'BCH does what BTC does better, so will overtake it', this is an incredibly simplistic way of looking at things and is obviously not correct. If it were a two horse race, then *possibly*, but it's not.
5	1523977188	1	I guess I figure any good currency-coin that can scale will overtake BTC. Your point seems to be about determining a winner between BCH and coins other than BTC. I'm not saying you are necessarily wrong. I'm just saying this post was about BCH vs BTC. I think BCH wins vs BTC (even if Nano or whatever actually beats BCH).
6	1523978126	1	That wasn't my point. To put it another way, let's say I created 'FooCoin', and FooCoin is better in every way than BTC. This post's logic asserts it's therefore going to overtake BTC. Now, say I create FooCoin2, ..., FooCoin9999 - all clones of FooCoin so all objectively better than BTC. It's ridiculous to assume they'll all overtake BTC because they're all better. Now replace each FooCoin with a different crypto - BCH, NANO, XLM, DASH, etc. Hopefully you can see my point. This, of course, also ignores non-technological factors in adoption, which further run counter to this post's assertion. So again, I think it's a highly simplistic (and flawed) way of thinking about adoption (a trap other cryptos also fall into).
0	1523932147	7	According to my (conspiracy?) theory, I think market manipulators are still using the high liquidity of BTC to pump and dump in a big way (along with all the other coins that seem to be in lockstep as if machines were doing the trading on all of them as a group). I too wonder when fundamentals will matter. Does not look like it will be real soon. I'm thinking the next pump will take BTC well over 50K (and most all the coins well past their all time highs). The group behind this are long-term thinkers and may do many mini-crashes along the way up (to gather massive BTC), so, this could take quite a while. The last one was years between the 1k and 20k pump. I think they plan to use BTC at least one more time. If they were not keeping it alive, it seems unlikely it would be recovering from crashing since smart money can see it lacks the fundamentals to succeed long-term. Edit: I also assume they see Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin for the future. They like BCH and they are buying whatever people want to sell while they keep it relatively cheap. If BCH was to make a price move on BTC, that might make Bitcoin look so bad it would be harder to pump it at the end, so, they may keep BTC worth around 10xBCH on purpose until they are ready for the flippening of values. A high BCH value is not super important to our use-case, so, we should be fine while they keep BTC riding high. If I am right, they can choose what coin or coins will be the worlds future currency(ies) when they let BTC die and leave their favorite(s) at the top of the pile. Adoption should keep us up there. Watch for any other coins getting their adoption ready to know if there is going to be any real currency-competition for BCH when fundamentals really start to matter to coin price/value.
1	1523948159	6	TLDR:> *they*
1	1523952834	2	some of this reads like fanfiction but I think you're onto a meta-concept.If the cryptomarket is fundamentally organic, then BTC can be expected to continue to do very well: the market has signalled this quite strongly.If the cryptomarket is fundamentally manipulated, then there's a killing to be made flipping the King, and it's only a matter of time before someone pulls that score.
2	1523955510	1	Why do you think "BTC can be expected to continue to do very well"? Is that a typo? I'm suggesting/thinking BTC would fall if not propped up by the manipulators.
3	1523957811	1	>Why do you think "BTC can be expected to continue to do very well"? Is that a typo?*If* the cryptomarket is fundamentally organic, then BTC can be expected to continue to do very well: the market has signalled this quite strongly.**If** the market value of BTC is organic (meaning, not manipulated) then we ought to trust it, and BTC is clearly the crypto valued most in the market.>  I'm suggesting/thinking BTC would fall if not propped up by the manipulators.Then you agree with the next sentence I wrote:*If* the cryptomarket is fundamentally manipulated, then there's a killing to be made flipping the King, and it's only a matter of time before someone pulls that score.
4	1523974850	1	Ahh, I think I get what your saying. You assume it might be possible BTC prices are moving at mostly naturally occurring (unmanipulated) levels. I loved BTC and would be happy to be able to love it again. I'd be happy if that assumption was true. Maybe people/investors believe Core will fix BTC scaling (even though they don't seem like they plan to soon). Even if I'm wrong about the big money manipulating the BTC price, I think pretty big money is clearly social engineering the price to keep it up. SO, I think it is unlikely this market is fundamentally Organic. I'm sure it is a mix either way, but, I see no chance of BTC organically doing well in the long-run without fundamentals allowing it to scale (without high fees, centralization, KYC gateways, etc.). I could be wrong. I guess it is possible fundamentals will never matter, lol. I don't think that's likely unless manipulators never release crypto "into the wild" to reach a natural (organic) equilibrium.
1	1523982827	1	August 1st, 2017> I too wonder when fundamentals will matter.
0	1523949376	2	So two questions then:Do people actually want digital currency to be MofE? As it seems the incumbent system is pretty good for most purposes, cash especially. Perhaps a SofV is actually of more value when states/banks go rogue?If you don't believe the above, then when will the flip happen, and why has there been little inclination in the last nine months or so that it will ever happen?
1	1523953422	2	You raise good questions here.> Do people actually want digital currency to be MofE?Well, no.  Not as such -- or rather, the people who do are hanging out in this sub already :)But: some people definitely want "better currency."  There's millions of people in Venezuela right now that could benefit greatly from having better currency options.We can agree that - even if BCH is ready for this - Venezuela might not be, or might be close but not quite.  There's still a gap to bridge.  But we're a lot closer to being able to bridge that gap than at any time in history.> Perhaps a SofV is actually of more value when states/banks go rogue?When you study "what makes a good store of value" you find that *stable currency* is the archetype "store of value".   So, "means of exchange" and "store of value" are not mutually exclusive, but a "store of value" implies that the thing will have transactional utility at some arbitrary point in the future.  Here, cash is king *except for inflation* -- but we don't have to worry about inflation, do we?
2	1523960385	1	>  There's millions of people in Venezuela right now that could benefit greatly from having better currency options.i would argue they want a better SofV. I mean, cash is still working there as MofE - its the hyperinflation is the problem - which is linked to SofV of the monetary system, not the degree of friction of their currency system. > But we're a lot closer to being able to bridge that gap than at any time in history.this is a very big statement to make. I agree, there is a very appealing system (cryptocurrency) that has emerged, but i am not wholly convinced that we are on our way to making a better world. A lot of aspects actually worry me greatly about the industry - but they are a function of humanity more than anything. Removing central authority is all well and good, but if you aren't actually removing the root of the problems in society, all you are doing in decentralising them. > When you study "what makes a good store of value" you find that stable currency is the archetype "store of value". So, "means of exchange" and "store of value" are not mutually exclusive, but a "store of value" implies that the thing will have transactional utility at some arbitrary point in the future. Here, cash is king except for inflation -- but we don't have to worry about inflation, do we?look, this is a philosophy of economics argument, and we can go down that line if you want. I am willing to engage with you, as we have engaged before. I have actually thought about it a lot over the last few months, and really attempted to grasp what is actually going on, and what the sides of the arguments are attempting to convey. It is difficult amongst all the noise, as you well know. I am actually starting to think that SofV in the context is of crypto is different to what you are describing. What you are describing (and i think where a lot of the problems with the debate are appearing) are based on the framework of incumbent economics. Indeed, a lot of how the industry is trying to describe all this is built on legacy economic theory. I don't think the theory is all that relevant anymore. As technology has evolved, so must the framework used to describe it. I am going to point you to an emerging (but also somewhat neglected ) sub-field of economics. Here is the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoeconomics), a [nice intro article](http://natoassociation.ca/thermoeconomics-and-entropy-a-lesson-in-realism/) and here is a [book](http://amzn.eu/0ZczCh3). Now you may read some of that, and go wtf, and that is fair enough - but i think you may well understand what i am hinting at. The interrelation between energy expended in mining (distributed security) and value (market driven forces) is where you may start to understand cryptocurrency in general (not just you, but all of us) and why it offers a better framework for understanding what the hell this is all about, and how we can frame the future in more grounded, and relevant theory. 
1	1523953245	1	There is no reason to think MoE hinders SoV. On the contrary they enhance each other, and in fact are nearly inextricable. Diminishment of one is diminishment of the other. BCH will excel at both.On your last question, "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent." 1-3 years perhaps. One need only look at how many complete joke coins (half of the top ten don't even pretend to be decentralized yet) have held multibillion-dollar market caps for how long to see that the timescale for market irrationality to clear can be years.
2	1523959244	0	> There is no reason to think MoE hinders SoV.this is not entirely true, though is for the most part. For example, if MofE means that everyone is using hot wallets, and are not educated on long term storage/cold wallets - this is detriment to the system as a whole. Also, remember you say the above is true. The reverse is also true. i.e that SofV does not necessarily hinder MofE. However, i do realise that e evidence suggests that it has in the case of BTC (mainly due to the technological gap that appeared when trying to move from robust SofV to scalable MofE (on BTC roadmap). This may well change when LN becomes operational fully (if you don't believe it will, fine, but let the evidence appear first before casting judgement. It seems to be going ok so far). > Diminishment of one is diminishment of the other.not true at all. and actually very simplified. You can have the best MofE in the world (i mean Venezuelen cash is pretty damn good still as MofE), but we can all agree its probably a pretty crappy SofV.> BCH will excel at both.this may well be true, and i am open to this being the case. However, at the moment BTC is more secure in terms of hashpower. So by that measure, it is a better SofV. > 1-3 years perhapsfrom now? ok. if that's your timeline, that is fine by me. good luck!

0	1523946856	0	Just a question. If the changes bitcoin cash made are indeed the best possible solutions for scaling and usability. So basically the bcash camp where right about the technical aspect. What is bitcoin core stopping from just adopting those changes later on? Or are the segwit changes going to block/prevent that in the future?
1	1523952910	5	The miners won't allow it. Why would they? "We already have a big-block version of Bitcoin. Both experiments should run their course."
1	1523948028	3	Nothing is stopping BTC from moving to 8MB blocks, and in fact it’s in the road map. 
2	1523952849	3	On what date?
2	1523960356	2	> in fact it’s in the road map. [citation needed]
2	1523969249	2	That's a bold claim. I don't think we'll ever see 8mb blocks in segwitcoin
1	1523948264	2	Segwit is an experiment that probably cant be removed from BTC. We don't know if it will make BTC unable to scale if it tries. They say they will not try to scale since that does not fit the Blockstream business model (they want high fees so everyone has to pay the corporation fees instead of paying the miners). If they go back on their word again and try to scale (hardfork in a bigger blocksize), it could help a lot in the short run. Few would trust the people behind this whole fiasco though. 
1	1523946863	3	Hey, Boesboesje, just a quick heads-up:  **basicly** is actually spelled **basically**. You can remember it by **ends with -ally**.  Have a nice day!^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
0	1523942587	-2	At what date in time or what event will bitcoin cash fans concede to the supremacy of BTC ?Serious question, not trolling.Disclaimer: I view the whole debate like the American Civil War and BCH as the ones holding onto the “original way of doing things”, and BTC saying they need to “move on and end this nonsense”.
1	1523947790	2	Totally trolling, lol. BTC did move on and end the effort to achieve it's original mission. Their original mission is the reason for a Bitcoin to exist. Don't worry, though, BCH has that mission on our roadmap and BTC can go do whatever useless stuff it prefers to do and we will keep the dream alive for the people of the world.
2	1523947859	2	But I already have DOGE... how is BCH better than DOGE?
3	1523949052	2	lol

2	1523973361	1	He's not trolling but he's comparing BCH to the south supporting slavery in the American Civil War

0	1523932190	-4	Bold call considering BCH is down by 50% since January against BTC.When it's 70% down, will he still be making these claims?
1	1523936797	16	It's like none of you guys were around to see Bitcoin drop over 80% in value against everything 3 or 4 times. BCH is that kind of Bitcoin. 
2	1523937600	-9	I'm assuming you're referring to the myriad of ICOs? Bitcoin didn't "drop" against them, they were pumped massively and now have collapsed massively.BCH has no value proposition against BTC when fees are low, and even if they are high, LTC is a better cheap alternative to BTC than BCH.
3	1523938358	10	Bitcoin has gone from 18 to 2, and 1000 to 200, and took multiple years to recover. I thought there were more times, but they weren't as severe as I remembered. It's worth remembering that its only been a little over a year since Bitcoin finally crossed north of $1000 again. What are your objective reasons that LTC is superior to BCH?
4	1523938773	-7	> Bitcoin has gone from 18 to 2, and 1000 to 200, and took multiple years to recover.You're comparing apples to oranges. All crypto rises and crashes against fiat. What is valuable info is the relative value of the cryptocurrencies, for example ETH vs BTC, or BTC vs BCH in my example. You could see when the ICO craze started that ETH gained a lot of ground vs BTC, and that has nothing to do with the fiat market.> What are your objective reasons that LTC is superior to BCH?* More decentralised* More transaction value over network* More liquidity (greater percentage of coins move each day)* Adopted segwit* Adopted lightning* Doesn't put businesses over users like BCH which forces the protocol to be upgraded instead of business infrastructure (segwit vs. 8 MB).BCH is competing with LTC as a cheaper alternative to BTC for transferring value. It doesn't bring anything new to the table, but instead comes with the toxic personalities of Craig Wright and Roger Ver.

And method of measuring decentralization?> More transaction value over network> More liquidity (greater percentage of coins move each day)This will change soon> Adopted segwitThis is a negative as it makes future scaling more difficult> It doesn't bring anything new to the table,You have it backward, Litecoin doesn't bring anything to the table. Bitcoin was first and Litecoin simply copied it. BCH is Bitcoin as it was originally designed.>but instead comes with the toxic personalities of Craig Wright and Roger Ver.This ad hominem is very old. Theymos, Luke, Adam Black, Greg Maxwell, and Charlie are very toxic, but that doesn't lessen BTC or Litecoin

5	1523950079	1	The first problem with LTC is that it is an alternative investment rather than a diversification. I own at least one BCH for every BTC I own. It was automatic during the fork. I didn't have to take any chances and send my BTC to an exchange, then convert to LTC. The diversification was automatic. My cold wallets automatically contain equivalent BCH to complement their BTC. No work necessary.The second problem with LTC is that they seem to be following the same road map as BTC. I prefer the BCH road map of finding out how big the blocks can get using ideas like graphene.

Do yourselves a favor and advertise what it actually is and what it’s benefits are.  Give up on the childish jealousy of wanting something YOU WILL NEVER HAVE.

0	1523957511	-1	If your reading this you have way to much time on your hands - b cash and bitcoin are both the same thing you gronks b cash is just b cash and I mean that’s all there is to say. 
0	1523968708	-1	True, but everyone on the internet thinks that "bcash" is a scam. :-(How can we fix what Core trolls have done to the reputation of BCH?
0	1523935440	-5	The higher the price the less usability, scalability becomes pointless when mining fees are higher and costlier than your micro-tx's worth. Applies to both, BTC and BCH imo. 
1	1523935623	8	BCH will always have low mining fees, even as price increases. There may be a delay in calibrating the fees back down, though.
2	1523935845	6	Alright thanks, I was unaware of this information. Mind explaining how/why BCH fees stay low even with price increase? 
3	1523936253	15	Much larger maximum block size, so you don’t have to compete against other people to get your transaction included. Block size is still scarce, but only because of storage, transmission, and computation costs, which are tiny. Sub-cent transaction fees forever is what BCH is all about. It’s for commerce.
4	1523936666	7	Appreciate the helpful answer. Will definitely do more research on it. 
5	1523946562	-1	Also have a look at Litecoin, which is one of the first altcoins and has always had four times the transaction capacity compared to BTC.Also, Litecoin never really took off, even when BTC blocks were full. This indicates that increased transaction capacity is not a factor in the success of a coin.

3	1523943876	3	a typical transaction is 225~500 bytes. with a 1 satoshi/byte ALWAYS confirming next block every ~10 minutes (or whatever the scientists say) the cost will ALWAYS be 500 satoshis per transaction. with price increase, the satoshi price will increase. however there are plans to drop the fees even lower to 1 satoshi/10 bytes which means it will cost only 50 satoshis per transaction. add that to the fact you can have MUCH higher transaction limit per block and you will miners who will have no problem mining your chain. 
4	1523959300	2	Fees are measured in sat/byte but are not specified this way.The fee is the difference remaining when you subtract outputs from inputs. It’s quite possible to have a fee of just 1 satoshi.1337 bits u/tippr for justice and truth!
