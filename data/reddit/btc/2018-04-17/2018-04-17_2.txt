0	1523967009	86	He openly compromised the professional integrity of his company and product to support his own personal feelings against Bitcoin Cash.
1	1523967125	37	Yes. I was about to purchase it but I'm not giving money to that type of CEO and the hardware is not that awesome, a regular MCU... a hobbyist could develop it in his spare time.
2	1523988783	1	Don't worry, they'll come around, quietly and without much fanfare, as the BCH ecosystem grows.  Its hilarious to me that it's being added across practically the entire OG bitcoin industry but some of these business owners still haven't gotten the memo, and are entrenched in their kool-aid anti-BCH drunkenness.  They are entitled to hold their viewpoints but ignoring what the industry is doing is not a very smart move.
1	1523986862	2	I moved to Ledger after the crap they pulled when Bitcoin Cash forked.  Since then I've recommended Ledger products and helped them sell a further 3 via referrals.
1	1523973458	-32	> He openly compromised the professional integrity of his company and product to support his own personal feelings against Bitcoin Cash.You mean he's doing the same thing as Roger Ver is doing with Bitcoin?
2	1523974794	15	>&gt; He openly compromised the professional integrity of his company and product to support his own personal feelings against Bitcoin Cash.>You mean he's doing the same thing as Roger Ver is doing with Bitcoin?100% of the critic Roeger Ver make on Bitcoin Core is accurate, he never call bitcoin core a scam.
2	1523980745	5	Your emotional opinions regarding Ver and Bitcoin Cash have been given to you as a result of coordinated and planned attacks that were lies to begin with.  You're a victim of propaganda.I would suggest putting your negative emotional opinions aside, and looking for actual information from a nonbiased point of view.  Ask yourself frequently:  Could I be wrong here?  Am I okay with being wrong?  And start looking for the benefit in carrying around emotional opinions, see if they actually help you to get what you want in life -- the same ones that cause you to hate Ver and Bitcoin Cash so much that you have to go around being a troll on the internet.
3	1523986471	1	You sound like a Jehova's witness. Not everyone who dislikes Roger Ver is brainwashed. My dislike for Roger Ver is based on the things he himself posts in this sub and what he tweets. 
2	1523973582	22	are you feeling OK?   a bunch of self-proclaimed "experts" compromised Bitcoin years ago and Roger never stopped fighting for Bitcoin
3	1523978476	-13	Roger is the self-proclaimed expert. In reality hes a douche and an ignorant like yourself.
4	1523978925	14	ahh yes, no actual arguments, just name callingthank you for showing others what blissful ignorance and/or trolling is

2	1523987935	1	Roger hasn't changed. Bitcoin has.
0	1523969210	35	Erik's response is spot on https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/943533919265099776
0	1523975595	9	The Monero community actually funded an open source software and hardware  for a hardware wallet made specifically for XMR. Perhaps we should be thinking about adapting that project for BCH? Or funding our own hardware wallet project?Sources:Link to the funding FFS page - https://forum.getmonero.org/9/work-in-progress/88149/dedicated-monero-hardware-walletProject work update page - https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/michael-rfc-hwallet-1-implementation/Project site looks a bit under construction still - http://kastelo.org/
0	1523983988	6	If you support Bitcoin Cash, you should be an advocate of free choices in a free market and chose whatever hardware wallet that suits you best.    
1	1523984395	3	Yes and since you vote with your money I've decided not to increase the revenue of a company that talks shit about one particular coin they include and that I particularly support. It makes sense to me to punish that company by not buying from them. And as it always happens with karma it turns out the hardware is very incompetent https://youtu.be/BzxGoJdd8a4?t=19m10sAlso the upcoming improvements in the Ledger are promising https://www.ledger.fr/2018/02/23/announcing-new-ledger-wallet-desktop-mobile-applications/
2	1523988384	1	thats totally fine.    i just dont think that calls for boycott are a healthy way to debate or to engage other entities.    after all, BTC is heavily critizied for boycott calls against anyone who isnt in full support of BTC.    BCH should not follow the same path.    
3	1523988780	1	BTC boycotts companies for accepting other coins. It’s very different than refusing a company that uses tortuous words against BCH. Would you want to enter a bar where they insult you?
0	1523970551	25	What else do you expect from a certified Blockstream fanboy?https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DE9JQs2UMAA93hc.jpg
1	1523970653	12	Intelligent communists are dangerous and get extraordinary greedy and corrupt when there's money around.
2	1523972428	3	Putin...
3	1523972574	4	Fidel Casto, Chavez, Kim Jong-un... and many others

1	1523976376	4	Good bot. I'm blocked on Twitter by Slush, so this bot helped me read what Slush wrote.
2	1523985115	1	Also on mobile it's good because Twitter require you to log in these days just to view tweets, which is extremely retarded I might add.
0	1523974781	12	Slush has lost ALL of my respect.
0	1523966703	28	Slush is an absolute moron.
1	1523969941	17	Although I agree, we don't need to win by making personal attacks, lets win by being better, by becoming a global reserve currency.
2	1523976745	6	So you're saying that we won't win this war by fighting what we hate, but by saving what we love?
0	1523966620	17	There is an intentional attach on their website. The CEO is not mature enough to separate his personal views from his business. But still he offers BCH, classic lack of integrity of rich communists.https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8cvoky/the_trezor_company_calling_bitcoin_cash_bcash/
1	1523974991	6	>The CEO is not mature enough to separate his personal views from his business.And ledger CTO is not better unfortunately..I am impressed how unprofessional they behave..
1	1523967541	5	Clearly Communists lack business acumen and despise markets.
2	1523968400	7	The danger are the intelligent communists. Slush might be an hypocrite and his values might be completely corrupt but he's probably a smarty pants.
0	1523975913	4	The recent events including such statements should really make users and businesses reconsider the safety of hardware wallets. The known vulnerabilities/risks of hardware wallets are:- frequent need for firmware updates including critical ones- a need to have seed words handy in case firmware update requires it- a bug in RNG(s) could cause predictability for some private keys- not able to control privacy/which coins to spend (sometimes you can do it via third party app though)- not being able to mix coins = everyone knows your balances- not being able to store privacy coins = everyone knows your balances- a rogue/angry employee (see Shapeshift hack) could push a rogue firmware update - a bug in firmware could expose private keys or cause loss of funds- wallet software has very narrow set of features (Trezor doesn't even support ETH directly at all; If you use Ledger for smart contracts, you can't see what you're signing)In order to mitigate those risks compromises must be made, but for some use cases it might be worth considering:- generating a bunch of (encrypted?) paper wallets (hundreds if needed)- using a dice to generate seed- using a dedicated offline computer - using a dedicated online computer with just OS and trusted wallet software (i.e. for mixing coins, ZEC/monero wallets, transacting with paper wallets and exchanges...)- never keep large crypto amounts online (either on your PC or on exchanges)- using a dedicated mobile phone for crypto transactions/payments- using multisigIf you have other suggestions for security practices or SW/HW to recommend, please comment.
1	1523978035	2	I don't really suggest encrypted paper wallets: where would you store the decryption key?I recommend storing the bulk of your Cryptocurrency in at least two geographically distinct locations. Technically, your back-ups should be verified as well. For example, when moving funds one day:I was horrified to learn the keys were only stored in one location.Eidt: I suggest buying a tablet with no cell-phone support as a cheap offline computer. In theory, an old cellphone in "airplane" mode should work too. Just make sure you disable wifi separately.
2	1523978598	2	In the safe deposit box + in the head? You can also use answers to questions that only you and your family know...
0	1523979855	3	Well, it is a "Bitcoin" hardware wallet after all. 
0	1523969828	3	Agreed, Use KeepKey instead if you are only to buy one. I own a Trezor, Ledger nano, KeepKey, and a Model T and although Trezor has the nicest and most feature rich interface, KeepKey also has a great user experience, it has a simpler interface compared to the rest and supports ShapeShift. Not to mention the device itself is just nicer then any of the Trezors (the box is also nicer, Trezor products have the worst packaging)
1	1523970055	4	Whats your opinion on the Ledger nano?
2	1523973489	4	Hardware is nice (and secure), packaging is nice, but the interface is atrocious. First of all there are three different apps (manger, bitcoin, ethereum) that you have to open separately. secondly the interfaces are clumsy to use (if you want details I guess i could provide but there are many, just try using it and you'll see). Third, although they support many coins, you can actually only install maybe 3 because you'll run out of memory on the device. And Finally in order to do the last firmware update I had to remove some of my wallets in order to have the memory to update the firmware. They have a solid product and offer support for lots of coins but they need a lot of work on the interface design.Edit: It is cheaper than Keepkey so that is a good point in its column. I'd argue you get what you pay for, KeepKey cost more but is nicer and more enjoyable to use than the nano, but if you are price sensitive and just need a secure place to keep your coins and have a high tolerance for bad interface design than it is a perfect choice. I've been in crypto since 2012 so money is not an issue for me.
3	1523980576	4	>  you can actually only install maybe 3 because you'll run out of memory on the devicenot true at all after a recent firmware update. you can have over 10 coins on one device. i think the total number of coins available at once is 18.
4	1523988623	1	Ah good to know the recent firmware corrected that issue, I only recently updated it because it was such a huge pain (had to delete wallets first).However i wouldn't say its "not true at all" as it certainly WAS true, good to see they are making improvements though.
0	1523971691	3	Should one worry for having BCH on Trezor?
1	1523971717	7	I don't think so and you still have the seed, that's only yours.
0	1523967785	13	Slush is an idiot, but I happen to not use trezor only because I prefer ledger, which is by far better and more secure.Meaning: I'd never boycott a superior product because of reddit mental masturbation.
1	1523972322	3	>ledger, which is by far [...] more secureI used to agree, but after [this vulnerability](https://saleemrashid.com/2018/03/20/breaking-ledger-security-model/), it's clear that the secure element doesn't provide nearly as much protection as Ledger marketing claims. Their response (detailed at the end of that post) to the vulnerability was almost more concerning.
2	1523973425	2	When I said it's secure it's because the seed is stored in a ST31 chip.
3	1523973910	2	Did you read the blog post in full? 
4	1523974547	1	yeah, I accidentally came across the blog the very first day he publish it even before Ledger was aware of it.
5	1523975429	3	[That's false](https://www.ledger.fr/2018/03/20/firmware-1-4-deep-dive-security-fixes/).>We want to stress out the professionalism and skills of these three white hats who worked together with our security team and strictly respected our Bounty Program process.
1	1523968190	7	I was about to purchase the Trezor since some people are complaining about the Ledger usability but since your comment I'm definitely buying the Ledger and giving it a try, thank you. The hardware is more secure in the Ledger as the SMT32 interfaces with a small secure chip where your seed is actually stored unlike the Trezor.
2	1523970980	6	Best to wait a while till some impartial businesses enter the space IMO. Ledger needs to up it's game and needs some real competition to start pressuring it.Paper wallets work quite well.
2	1523968723	6	You can do just fine with ledger hardware and, for BCH for instance, you can use electron cash software to access it and have more flexibility. Electron cash nodes are also better than ledger's. that's what I use.Not sure about android wallets or iOS wallets tho.
3	1523968783	6	It sounds terrific and it's cheaper.
2	1523983599	2	I own both and while I'd love to say that the ledger is better and throw my trezors out because slush wants to play politics, the true is that the trezor is a better product from a usability standpoint.
3	1523983777	2	It might be but check this out https://www.ledger.fr/2018/02/23/announcing-new-ledger-wallet-desktop-mobile-applications/Oh yeah.
1	1523976036	1	>because of reddit mental masturbationWhat?
2	1523976416	1	Bitcoin cash is bitcoin.
1	1523968218	0	> and more secureHow is it more secure?
2	1523968862	5	As of now, ledger hardware has never been breached, unlike trezor. Sure, there are attacks such as man-in-the-middle, but this is not a ledger issue as ledger displays the correct address that should be checked by the user always.
3	1523972687	6	It is quite well known that the ledger firmware has been hacked. You can find the video posted of the kid that did it. Don't ever fall into the trap of thinking that anything isn't hackable. Ledger has since addressed this issue. One thing that I do like about Trezor, is that you load your firmware to the device and you can confirm that the firmware is legit with encryption.They are both good products. Just use the one that fits your utility and your needs.
4	1523974024	3	Trezor has been hacked by a kid.Ledger appears to have been hacked to bypass the tampering proof, one needs to actually modify the hardware and sell a modified hardware, which is a problem. But I don't recall any hacking of the physical device to obtain the seed or pvt keys.EDIT: I stand corrected, the article mentions a form of attack that demands that the user utilizes the ledger again. While not an extraction of pvt keys from the physical device in case you lose it or it is stolen, it is a problem. Wasn't it fixed with firmware 1.4.1?
2	1523968528	3	Watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKWYO3Qh79A That guy has a deep understanding of electronics fundamentals.
3	1523969456	6	I watched the video. He sent a transaction with an huge unnecessary fee and said ledger does not display the full address. Of course it does display the full address, but since it doesn't fit in the screen it shifts it from right to left.
4	1523969718	4	Yeah but pay attention to his notes on the hardware. You asked why the Ledger is more secure and it's because the STM32 does not store your seeds but a ST31 chip http://www.st.com/en/secure-mcus/st31-arm-sc000.html?querycriteria=productId=SC1617
4	1523971880	4	Check this video from minute 19:10 https://youtu.be/BzxGoJdd8a4?t=19m10s and you'll understand the Trezor is not what you want if you really need security.Pay special attention from minute 20:45
5	1523972376	3	Yeah, I'll take a look. Thx.
0	1523967208	8	Conbase, BCash, the Blockstream engineered culture to fool Core while they try to create their own corporate empire.
0	1523984364	5	Let's not forget that it is his poorly designed stratum protocol that is responsible for much of the mining centralization today. It really takes some nerve to call Bitcoin cash centralized.
0	1523974520	4	but alternatives? Trezor is still my most trusted device... even though i personally asked him on aug 4, 2017 when i could claim my BCH and he seriously replied something like '' we'll take our time and hopefully we wont even have to, i'll write about it more in the post mortem bcash blog ill release later this week... BCH held its ground and Trezor fulfilled their promise, but still... it scares me... my money is in a vault of which the gatekeeper hates the content of the vault..One side note... its a tweet from december... attitudes are changing, even Scamlie Lee already admitted in an interview that BCH could overtake btc
1	1523974842	6	> even Scamlie Lee already admitted in an interview that BCH could overtake btcThey say that in public, the same as Riccardo Spagni. They say it's a scam and the next day on the TV they try to be politically correct and say BCH is a legit competitor. You can't never trust cynics.As for your BCH, if you had your seed you didn't need to ask for permission to that guy to move your BCH.
1	1523974644	2	Agreed. Do you have a link to that Charlie interview? I would love to hear it from the horse's mouth.
2	1523974770	2	i think it was with doug polk a couple weeks ago
0	1523988527	2	Was [Bcash](https://medium.com/@freetrade68/announcing-bcash-8b938329eaeb) ever actually released? It was supposed to come out in the first quarter of 2018. Maybe he's right that it was a scam?Not sure what that has to do with Bitcoin (Cash), though.
0	1523974308	0	Fuck this guy
0	1523972791	1	Coinbase is Blockstream's biggest competitor/enemy.
1	1523972832	3	That's why the Coinbase CEO and founder really loves freedom and Bitcoin
0	1523974669	1	Damned he turned full Core-fanboy...If Bitcoin cash is a scam why don’t he remove support immediately??Idiot..
1	1523974887	3	Because he's okay offering scams.
1	1523980226	3	If he's concerned about the name fooling people, why does he support Bitcoin Gold?
0	1523973609	1	Thank you for posting this. Sad to see such venomous lies like this spewing forth from people who were once considered “leaders” in the community. But it’s great to be able to clearly see now who the TRUE leaders really are.  
0	1523978915	1	Everytime I see him tweet and I see this picture, I want to punch him in the face.
1	1523980572	1	well there is no need to do that.
0	1523987871	0	If you support Trezor, you should avoid Bitcoin Cash.
0	1523984460	-2	Roger & Jihan forked so they could free capital that wasn't already tied up in their Bitcoin holdings. They never have to touch bitcoin holdings while creating more income. They are both merchants, pitched it to merchants & they bought it. They used block size to pin the two communities against each other. If you believe they have moved their massive btc holdings into bch your naive.edit: He can sit on camera all day long, and say that's he's majority bch but I wouldn't believe the snake. He's 50/50 just like jihan and all the other Bitcoin loyalists.
0	1523986984	-1	Old news from Dec20 2017. Guess you shills need something to bitch about while bitcoin is fast and cheap. Why would anyone use bcash when bitcoin is more secure, fast and is the real bitcoin? 
1	1523987012	1	Redditor /u/ryanisflying has low karma in this subreddit.
0	1523970939	-12	Thanks for pointing me to the right direction. I am going to order a trezor now.
