0	1523934224	11	These crying memes thing comes off a little bizarre to me... Something with hint of 4Chan sprinkled. But yes, we have a lot of good things going here. And more to come I'm sure.
1	1523937475	6	dont underestimate 4chan
2	1523940768	7	He is the greatest hacker of our day
0	1523958814	2	No. They're paid. They don't care at all about any of these things.
0	1523948657	3	he's not pink enough
0	1523957811	2	Why is everyone so tribal? You know, a day will come when we'll need to rally together to protect our collective interests and then, and only then will we see who the true actors are in this. I hold equal amounts of both, I don't mind what happens, just wish the tribalism would stop. Reminds me of politics.
1	1523958858	3	You'd probably like our vibe over at r/BitcoinDiscussion.
1	1523969426	1	You know, before all this "flippening" nonsense started in the automn, I *did* consider doing the same. Now, this community, that *to me* seems being based mostly around *taking down* BTC, puts me seriously off. I don't even retreive my tippr balance anymore, should anyone tip me.I am *sure* there are people that seriously believe in BCH having utility as it is today, being independent on "taking down" BTC value. I respect that. They are. though, very much overshadowed by the people in the community that see this as a fight between BTC and BCH.I don't usually partake in those fights. I still BTC will  be most viable in the long run. I respect those with a different view than me, though.And btw: I downvote the obvious trolls here that are shilling for BTC. I don't like that behaviour any more than you do.
0	1523939879	3	Stop making retarded meme posts on this sub. You are making the same mistakes.
0	1523975116	1	Classic.
0	1523933592	-5	So a handful of things I've never heard of or used?
1	1523933655	23	Were you living under a rock?
2	1523970660	0	No, I do my shopping almost exclusively online and based on Bitpay's website, they have barely any merchants on board that the average person would buy stuff from.
3	1523979166	1	you need to get your eyes checked
2	1523970897	0	None of these have any significant merchant presence from what I can tell. I do shopping pretty much exclusively online and I've yet to encounter anyone that accepts Bitcoin, at least not in recent memory.
1	1523947041	7	You've never heard of bitpay, yours or cointext?
1	1523956401	3	If you haven't heard of BitPay (only THE biggest crypto payment-processor for merchants and the one that started with BTC) or Yours, you are most definitely a no-coiner or a hodl-tard that doesn't really care about using your crypto for anything. 
2	1523970616	1	I've never seen it accepted anywhere. I've yet to buy anything from any place that accepts Bitcoin in any shape or form...Judging by their website, they have no significant merchants. 
3	1523971697	1	Are you fucking serious? Already on 2013 Bitpay had over 10.000 merchants: https://www.coindesk.com/bitpay-now-10000-merchants-payment-processor-network/
4	1523973715	2	How about we play a game? I name a common item, and you find a place to buy it with Bitpay. Deal?
5	1523975258	1	What are you trying to prove? I just explained to you how old Bitpay is and gave a whole fucking list of merchants. I believe it is your turn to actually spend some time to do some research. Looks like you could need it. 
3	1523971924	1	Here is an older list from when Bitpay only accepted BTC: https://blog.wetrust.io/list-of-merchants-that-accept-bitcoins-9f4f991b95d1But at least my suspicion was correct. You're not using, just hodling like most BTC fanboys. 
4	1523973641	1	That list is bullshit. Many of those places you would need to buy a giftcard with Bitcoin and then use a giftcard lol.That's retarded.
5	1523975520	1	Gyft and a couple of others. But that is not the majority of the list. You are grasping for straws. Your original comment was that nobody knows Bitpay and that they had virtually no merchants. You have been proven wrong on both accounts and now you are moving the goalposts. Just suck it up and move on. 
6	1523979529	1	I believe my point stands.What is the total revenue generated by Bitpay merchants divided by total retail sales? US annual retail sales are about 5T.So yes, they have virtually no merchants in the scope of real world needs. You can barely buy anything specific on a day-to-day basis from Bitpay merchants.
0	1523948579	-11	It amazes me how much time Bcash fans spend looking over their shoulder at what bitcoin doing.If your product is so great you shouldn't care about the competition.
1	1523951695	8	the irony 
2	1523971171	1	Perhaps you're mistaking me for a bitcoin supporter who is here looking over my shoulder at what bcash is doing, which would be ironic if true. I'm here because I take information from multiple sources. One thing I've noticed is this sub seems obsessed with bitcoin core to the degree it almost cannot talk about anything else. Like someone bitter and obsessed that their ex-partner has moved on.Btw I'm only calling it bcash to get a rise out of the rusted-on cultists here, and by the downvotes I see it's working.

0	1523937256	-12	Yes.  Also, Satoshi's spirit will soon rise from the grave and the world will know he was right.I forget his name, but some dude in the BCH camp also has this thing called the Tulip Trust.  BCH is winning, boys.
