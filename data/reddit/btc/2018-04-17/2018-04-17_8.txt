0	1523963539	7	memo.cash and yours.org. what's next for BCH? enough fighting. lets drive adoption
1	1523965433	1	300 bits u/tippr hopefully more freelancing sites and remittance services. I like the human agent fiat gateways in Kenya - we need to learn from the 3rd world because banks are not our friends.
2	1523976798	2	indeed. the way Kenya economy grows because of mpesa makes me understand more about money and believe in the blockchain technology more

1	1523979883	1	I have a super idea in the works but need help a dev to help
0	1523966067	6	I got a $1 tip from bchtips but didn't have a bch address listed at the time so it doesn't appear to have gone through - will everyone have to add a BCH address before being able to tip/be tipped with bchtips?

1	1523971285	3	I'm the creator of BCH Tips. If you don't have an address when you're first tipped the tip will be placed in a queue in the sender's browser and retried every 5 or 10 minutes or however frequently they configure it to check (it can even be set as low as 1 minute). Basically it should come through automatically next time they're online.
2	1523971606	2	But it was /u/CityBusDriverBitcoin and he was on a few hours ago
3	1523972043	2	I think he goes offline a lot. It should come through eventually. Here's something to tide you over. :)I sent you a tip of 0.00063885 BCH ($0.50 USD) with [BCH Tips](/r/bchtips)!
4	1523978428	1	thanks a lot
4	1523979834	1	Someone is logging..... 
3	1523975400	2	yes that was me, I cancel it/remove from queue if you take more than 2 days to registrer ;)there you go.I sent you a tip of 0.00128318 BCH ($1.00 USD) with [BCH Tips](/r/bchtips)!
4	1523978398	2	Thank you kind sir, I was more curious about it than anything but it was really cool seeing it randomly appear in my wallet like that
1	1523970908	2	yes you need to link it first

2	1523965001	1	That opcode allows you to store data in the blockchain by burning coins right?
3	1523965700	3	"OP_RETURN allows a small amount of data to be included in each transaction, creating a provably _unspendable UTXO__ that the miners do not need to track, and that __does not require a non-dust burn value__."

The changes they made is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of fulminology most of the changes will go over a typical Beecaesher's head. There's also Adam Back's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from *Joseph Goebbels* literature, for instance. Core's supporters understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly *appreciate* the depths of these changes, to realize that they're not just intelligent- they say something deep about LIFE.

0	1523974828	1	I'm a newcomer, have been interested in bitcoin for a little while but only looking at bitcoin. Did get a bitcoin cash tip when I first got on Reddit and looking  into it on bitcoin begginer but they said it was a scam so I never collected it. Bit wiser now. Still not sure which one is best but I'm starting to lean towards bitcoin cash. 
1	1523975880	2	300 bits u/tippr well, the best way to find out is to use it!https://learnbitcoin.cashhttps://usebitcoin.cashhttps://yours.orghttps://memo.cashetc.

2	1523977896	2	That was a little confusing, another guy replied sending a tip too but his had a different message saying I needed to collect it (more like happened last time ) I read the instructions but I don't have a wallet yet to give it a bitcoin cash address so I moved onto your reply and have managed to get it to send me a balance which shows your 300 bits, cool. Going to look into getting a bitcoin cash wallet to claim the other guys tip. I already have mycelium and I'm sure I read they were going to include bitcoin cash but I don't think I have that option yet.
3	1523978961	2	look like you just received it, what wallet did you use ?
4	1523980413	2	Yes I did 😀 and it took like seconds 😀😀I got the bitcoin.com wallet from the resources links on the sidebar of this sub.Was a bit confused at first as the other guy sent a tip at the same time and they had different messages but figured it out. Very generous of you and the other guy too.
3	1523979621	2	Actually, as soon as I tip you with u/tippr , tippr creates a wallet for you.This isn't really meant to be used as a wallet, but of course you can deposit to it and withdraw from it, so it _is_ a wallet of sorts (but one where you do not control the keys, just like many other web wallets).You can find out your tippr deposit address using the instructions for 'deposito' here:https://www.reddit.com/r/tippr/wiki/reddit-usageAnd you can receive funds to that address from anyone while you set up a wallet of your own.
