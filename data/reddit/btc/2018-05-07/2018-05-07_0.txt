0	1525657697	19	holy shit, reading this thread is giving me block-size debate flashbacks.
1	1525660098	11	Same here, didn't expected it that early.Anyway, as long as it's not on protocol level, I'm fine with it. It seems that ideas must collude, and I'm good about it as far as there is no forcing it on everybody.
2	1525697355	1	You should not be fine with that. The debate is indeed on protocol level — the difference here is we are on a higher level than blockchain itself. 
1	1525686727	3	Cos it's the same painfully goddamn thing: admirers of competition camp aka "try everything, see what works" vs "Bitcoin is fragile" camp
1	1525700697	2	[Easy resolution](https://twitter.com/zbingledack/status/992536591326298112?s=19).TR;DR: If a willing buyer of blockspace meets a willing market of blockspace selling (miner who mines the block, miners who choose to mine atop it, stakeholders who choose to value that chain, and any miners or other archivers who find it profitable to keep the data unpruned for as long as the user asks), there is never anything to worry about. Bitcoin is a *fully* economic system; there are no collective action problems or tragedies of the commons (because there is no commons). This might mean no one will use Memo long term because it will get too expensive, but that is again never a problem for BCH itself.
1	1525697629	0	Yep. I would not be surprised if Blockstream is somehow interconnected with BlockPISS. They were likely so scared with Memo.cash that they decided to dissolve the network effect by introducing the brand new protocol with a slicker user interface.Holy shit. Please guys, we need to defend Memo — that is a diamond in our hands that no other cryptocurrency has. In this thread BlockPress guys demonstrated how clueless they are in terms of protocol architecting. Please ignore them.
0	1525639025	60	By the creator of the Memo protocol:**Open Sourcing Memo**The main reason I created memo was to have a universal social network. It seems like every month there's a new social network popping up. As my friends jump from one social network to the next, I'm forced to either sign up for another account or be out of the loop. These social networks aggressively track you, have apps that read your text messages, and do a number of other terrible things.I've always wished they worked like email, where I can sign up for a single provider and communicate with anyone. This is why email has been successful for the last 40+ years, basically becoming our main identity, and is the key ingredient social networks are missing.Most people think that because memo is on the blockchain, it's inherently uncensorable. **Being on the blockchain does not make memo uncensorable, what will make memo uncensorable is when there are many different implementations.**If a bunch of blockchain-based social networks pop up, each copying and using their own version of the protocol, then they won't be censorship proof. For example, suppose one of these social networks started censoring and so people created another implementation of their network. If the incumbent was big enough, they could decide not to display any messages that didn't come through their application. They could even stop writing messages to the blockchain altogether.What really makes a social network uncensorable is for it to be decentralized. This makes the power over the network distributed between the service providers, meaning they'd have to collude to censor information.**Memo.cash was intended to be the first implementation and that other implementations would pop up. The second implementation, wewo.cash, did just this, which was great. However, the third implementation, Blockpress, decided to unnecessarily break the protocol, throwing out the benefit of decentralization.**To encourage others to head in the right direction, I’ve decided to open source the entire Memo.cash codebase. My hope is that people will fork and create their own implementations, giving it the decentralization it needs to be uncensorable.The more implementations there are, the more decentralized the network will be. I’ve even added a feature to Memo.cash to delete your account. This is useful if you prefer to run your own local memo client and don’t want to trust a third party.**The memo protocol is simple and extendable. It’s already proven to work for Twitter type communication (the initial release) and chatrooms (the recent “Topics” feature). These are two very different use cases and demonstrate the flexibility of the protocol. The protocol can be extended to handle any social networking use case, whether it’s images, videos, long blogs, voting, or whatever other ideas people come up with.I hope this is the beginning of decentralized social networking. Thanks for reading.**https://github.com/memocash/memo**Edit: this is what BP commented. Looks like the copycat is saying no, we’re going to keep on being shady.** We want to congratulation Memo on a HUGE milestone for them and this community.Congratulations! The implementation looks solid and we're excited to see how the ecosystem evolves and what amazing products get built on top of the Memo protocol.We will be open sourcing our implementation soon \(sorry it's taking us so long\).Just like you, we believe in decentralized EVERYTHING:\- Decentralized publishing \(ala Memo, BlockPress protocols, etc\)\- Decentralized UIs and backends \(multiple backend implementations and UI implementations\)\- ...And Decentralized various protocols.Having a single brand owner have a fiat/by\-decree say over what is a "broken" protocol and what can make it in or not is not decentralization, however.Therefore, we believe there will be many \(100's\) of social networking protocols, and each with dozens or hundreds of implementations on each of them.  We intend to help us get to maximum decentralization at all levels, and not just at the levels on top of a single social networking protocol.Congratulations again, and we're excited for what's happening in this ecosystem and proud to be able to contribute and help.   Competition is healthy and the community benefits greatly by rapid open sourcing of projects and having more builders create amazing products.Sincerely,\-BP
1	1525641553	95	As of today, I'm announcing that my implementation (https://unite.cash/), will abandon our protocol and support memo.cash. The reason we didn't originally is that it was closed source, but we will do our best to implement it. We are working tirelessly to create a better user experience so that billions of people are empowered by this technology. We're hiring, and we greatly respect your decision. Thank you. /u/tippr $0.25

1	1525664949	4	Wow! I just started similar but allow checkbox with item like things to do list.  If Memo.cash open source, I might well stop what I am doing, move over to memo.cash.
1	1525640678	-6	Asking for people to follow a single protocol is a centralizing feature. The beauty of having each implementation doing it's own thing is that if one implementation starts doing bad things, users can simply move to another.Another problem with your suggestion is that it would restrict creativity. A team may find a protocol that is way better than Memo's and yet just forget about the whole thing because convincing all the other teams to accept the changes would take ages, not to mention facing opposition and abuse as we are already seeing from some Memo proponents (seriously, wtf this is awful.) Finding consensus on a change of protocol for one implementation is a simple affair (none needed), a change of protocol that involves hopefully the 100s of implementations that will use BCH blockchain will be like a UN meeting. Not to mention the politics that will inevitably come from the need for such consensus. We already have way too much politics going on here! We don't need more, we need less!Changes, including backward compatibility, will take ages. Most probably, a new team won't bother. This stifles creativity and will encourage people to find solutions off-chain (to avoid the hassle) or to work on other chains where they are provided with a freer environment.Seriously I don't understand why you and others put pressure on BlockPress the way you do. I think you should let them do their own thing and give them all possible encouragement. Perhaps discuss protocol compatibility with them, but if it's not their priority then respect their ability to know better than you what is good for them and trust that they do what they think is good for BCH too.Speed, Innovation resulting from decentralization (no central authority dictating terms or putting pressure on teams) is a key strength of BCH. Why compromise it? As a last note: once an application protocol is public (or not tbh, it could be guessed), anyone should be able to create a basic reader reasonnably quickly and if incorporating in a full blown suite like Memo or BP, create a blockchain interface layer that will read and write to different formats.
2	1525642337	20	There is a very instructive precedent here: web browsers. The web is just a set if standardized protocols, and it already went through these growing pains. Differences in the features that different browsers support made browsing the web a nightmare for many years. Every web page had a big heading that said "this website is best viewed in <browser> version <number> and it sucked. Standards are kind of annoying sometimes but the alternative is worse.Here's a kind of a fun read illustrating one aspect if what happened with the web: https://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/
3	1525643056	12	As someone who's been looking into both blockpress and memo.cash protocols, I can confidently say they are "application layer protocols", just like SMTP and FTP, but even a higher level. We're not talking about competing implementations for TCP/IP level protocols. We're talking about competition between Twitters, Instagrams, Facebooks, etc. They all have different dynamics and neither memo.cash nor blockpress protocols can handle all of them.And these applications do need competition, just like how during the early days of microblogging there were multiple competing services other than Twitter. We shouldn't socially pressure people into not building what they could have built. All competition is great as long as it takes place on the same BCH protocol.
4	1525644065	2	Thanks, much clearer than what I replied.
4	1525681202	1	> All competition is great as long as it takes place on the same BCH protocol.Whereas competition that comes from a non-BCH blockchain is bad and should be stamped out. We don't want that kind of competition around here.
5	1525685788	1	Username checks out. 
5	1525687683	1	Give me a coin which is better than Bitcoin (BCH) and I will use it. 
6	1525695226	1	I would, but since I disapprove of the very existence of competition from non-BCH blockchains, I haven't tried any of them. Q.E.D.
3	1525644030	1	To use your analogy, BCH is TCP/IP, not HTML. Memo and BP are implementing their own protocols on top of that.I know what you mean about the web browsers, but these were apps that were meant to access the same data from the start. This does not apply here. From what we can see Memo and BP are going in different direction from the start. One could become reddit and the other twitter or FB or Chat, who knows. Memo is not meant to read BP's content and vice versa. A universal data format for BCH social networks is not a requirement worth the cost at this stage. From a user perspective, I don't see the need, and the associated cost would be enormous and un-affordable to BCH at this stage (we can't even take care of our developers...). 
4	1525648402	2	shouldn't a standard data format save costs by avoiding duplication?
2	1525641379	16	Nonsense. Is asking people to follow the bitcoin protocol a centralized feature? If it is, it is one that enables permissionless and censorproof payments. If the Memo protocol does anything, it enables permissionless and censorproof social networks.Does the bitcoin protocol restrict creativity? No. Memo doesn’t either, it enables you to be creative in a permissionless and censorproof manner.Consensus is reached like with any open source, don’t make it sound like engineering warp engines.Off chain memo is already here, it’s called twitter.The reason people are putting pressure is because BP copies Memo, breaks it and then acts like they did something new. It’s like one of these 1000+ altcoins, useless.
3	1525641700	4	I don't see how BP broke memo.  I just found out about BP the other day and I was impressed with their layout.  They have some extra features and seem to have improved on memo in some ways.  I see competition as a good thing.  Eventually there may be consolidation onto one protocol and that is fine if the market chooses that.  Perhaps its best to have competition in early days to see the best protocol arise to gain the network effect advantage.
4	1525641807	11	According to u/Chris_Pacia [this is how they broke it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8gpv0e/blockpress_published_its_protocol/dye1cf8/) [And another example.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8gpv0e/blockpress_published_its_protocol/dyeh4eg/) They could of done all that on top of Memo and not just copy/paste, break it and call it new.
5	1525645780	9	Chris is right that it may be more convenient for filtering. But as always in crypto, there is no straightforward right or wrong answer.  In that spirit, let me balance out chris's point by pointing out one "advantage" of the approach taken by blockpress (which couldn't have happened when they used memo.cash's protocol):Memo.cash uses multiple push datas for the OP_RETURN. But according to the Bitcoin documentation, this is not considered standard: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Flow_control> Currently it is usually considered non-standard (though valid) for a transaction to have more than one OP_RETURN output or an OP_RETURN output with more than one pushdata op.This means blockpress approach of having a single pushdata is considered "standard" while memo.cash is not.Now, I am not sure what this will mean going forward. Maybe the decision by blockpress will prove to be the right one. Or maybe the memo.cash's approach might be the better design. We never know, just like how there's no 100% straight-forward answer to whether BTC or BCH will absolutely succeed. Each has its pros and cons. And that's what I am talking about. The community shouldn't try to bury one competing protocol just for the sake of making a single "king". At the end of the day, all these are all nothing but BCH protocols.Just to be clear, if you really think I'm doing this as a "Blockpress shill" or something like that, you would be completely wrong. I just think it's unhealthy to have in-fights without having a proper discourse.
5	1525644097	2	Come on.
6	1525644147	2	What? Too much truth? Not fair?
7	1525645634	4	Nothing to do with fairness, but don't you get the sense of deja vu?You're better than that.
8	1525681686	2	Yeah they are way way better than that. It's not as if that person has always seemed driven by ego & irrational spite. For example, witness their highly rational & selfless comments in this thread:https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/86xxy0/comment/dw90bu8
3	1525642070	-4	> Is asking people to follow the bitcoin protocol a centralized feature? Of course it is, did you see what happened to BTC? The consensus process? But in that instance there is no choice, the blockchain format must be the same for everyone. Memo is not Bitcoin, it's an app running on top of it. Anyone should be allowed to use BCH any way they like, without pressure or interference from a third party. It's not just a matter of principle, it's more efficient that way.Re. BP "copying" Memo, our understanding is that BP started work on this a long time ago, before Memo released what it had. Both released their apps long before they were finished so that tells us nothing about who was first, unless you have inside knowledge we don't have.
4	1525642410	0	You clearly are not very bright.Btw, whats this ‘our understanding’ about? What group to you represent?Memo was first, read the top post. 1)Memo 2) Wewo 3)Blockpress 
5	1525644229	1	Wtf are the ad-homs about. Come on Mr Vinegar, be nice!Memo was first according to YOU. To us (btcnews) it is not obvious, and unless you are privy to the date from which BP started working on their project, you don't know.

6	1525645652	1	Well well look who's here. The poison!Do you know what's worse than a failed politicking Core coder? A failed politicking coder with a sadistic streak even Core won't have. You, your socks and your "proof of CSW's... mom" no wonder.

6	1525647591	3	When you say "BlockPISS", doesn't it give you a strange reverse deja vu feeling of when you hear "BCash"?
4	1525643458	-4	Memo went live first! That is all that matters! The icing on the cake of Memo going live first is that it happens to be a Fuckton times better than BlockPISS.
5	1525644325	1	You're an obvious sock. Won't bother replying.
6	1525681902	1	Yes and I won't bother replying to you either. I know exactly how to handle your type! Just don't reply.
2	1525641524	5	I agree competition is good.  Everyone has their choice on what to build on.
2	1525642790	3	I don't know why people are downvoting you but I totally agree with you. Also I am not a fan of this political attack, as I've been as frustrated as the blockpress guys when looking at the memo.cash protocol (when blockpress guys said they tried to build on memo.cash, they weren't lying). See my comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8hi2u9/memo_is_now_open_source/dyjzkyu/
3	1525647207	2	> I don't know why people are downvoting you We constantly frustrate and call out efforts by a few to re-create a tech driven Core group around BCH. They downvote because that's what people like that do .
3	1525695979	1	Oh my god, you simply don’t understand the meaning of a ‘protocol’ word. Telling that Memo.cash protocol is centralizing because you don’t see your posts immediately is such a bullshit. Holy shit.
2	1525685370	2	I absolutely don't understand why you're being downvoted. Tbh, it looks kinda fishy...And the behaviour and dickish comments towards competitors has been coming from people in other circumstances aswell. its seriously not cool.
2	1525644056	1	> Asking
3	1525645825	1	I should have written "demanding"/trying to impose, that would have been more accurate based on what I'm seeing.

2	1525669328	1	This hostility all seems really weird to me. The bloom filtering would be nice, and it looks like the two protocols are near copies of each other, but who cares if they are different. They don't need to work together and I didn't expect them to. It seems authoritarian to want all others to conform to your wishes. It's weird people are going around calling names like block piss.I'm not using either platform and I'm not sure why you're getting a bunch of downvotes. It seems like you're being pretty reasonable

0	1525649772	24	Open sourcing it is a great move.Bashing competitors and questioning their motives is a dumb move.Blockpress isn't breaking any protocols, they just made their own competing version. Welcome to the marketplace.
1	1525651245	11	I'm not bashing their motive.  I don't think many people see that the current situation where we have accounts on a bunch of different social networks doesn't need to be the case.  Currently I have Discord, Slack, Telegram, Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, Google chat, and a bunch of other apps that I constantly have to switch between and check for updates.I understand they think having their own protocol gives them more flexibility.  I'm just trying to inform people that we can solve the million social networks problem, and that building on a single protocol doesn't mean you have to give up any flexibility.  This wasn't really possible before the blockchain.
2	1525696321	3	Those guys are just trying to ride the hype you have created. They do not understand what a word ‘community’ or ‘interoperability’ means. They just need a quick buck.Kudos to you. You have created a great thing!
1	1525656923	8	> they just made their own competing version.I wouldn't say replacing 6's with 8s really counts as 'made their own'
2	1525698298	2	Yeah like changing one variable from 1mb to 8mb doesn't make a difference?This is open source. Anyone can make changes for any reason. 
2	1525696190	1	Yep. Even if they are free to do anything they want on top of permission less blockchain, this is 100% stupid in terms of sustaining strong community.
0	1525644350	3	Thank God!

0	1525642573	26	The following comment has been brewing inside me for a while, but since now the founder is blatantly criticizing blockpress, I'm just going to say it. I don't think it's right to use politics to compete. Here it goes:When memo.cash first launched, I tried to build a client on top of it because it was so cool. And very soon I found out that the system is CENTRALIZING as hell. Let me make a point about this since the creator seems to try to spin this as a "decentralization" attempt.Here's what I found when I dug into memo.cash:1. During the first couple of days, I found that the system was centralized. Things I posted following the memo.cash protocol would not display on the website. I assumed that they were not really posting directly to the blockchain but storing to their DB first, and then posting to blockchain. Instead of the other way around (crawling from the blockchain to populate the DB).2. I assume this was part of the reasons why Blockpress decided to just go with their own implementation. The hype was too high but when you actually tried to build something on the protocol, YOUR implementation would never show up on the memo.cash website because they weren't crawling from the blockchain but instead the content was being pulled straight from their DB. How would blockpress build their app on this protocol when the "protocol" was nothing more than just a show (at least in the beginning)?3. I've been keeping a close eye on the discord channel where the founder clearly said he has "no plans of open sourcing the backend". This really turned me off, especially considering how nothing was directly coming from the blockchain (although the contents are still on the blockchain, all the social graph associations and relationships are on their DB)4. Just to clarify, it seems that this has changed in the last couple of days, probably because the memo.cash founder has decided to change strategy now that blockpress is out. Now when I look at memo.cash website, it's using websocket to pull from the server, and although I haven't looked at the code yet, it looks like they have now started crawling from blockchain to populate the DB instead of just displaying stuff from their DB. However I'm still not sure how they handle the social graph part (I haven't looked at the code yet, but just wanted to say what I observed so far)I am offended that he tries to spin the narrative into "blockpress is an immoral copycat and I'm going to take the high road by open sourcing".My point is that none of this is true.1. Blockpress literally probably couldn't build on top of memo.cash protocol because memo.cash was 100% centralized at that point in time (not to mention how blockpress probably has been working on this for a while too)2. Open sourcing doesn't make something like memo.cash automatically decentralized. Actually I find this very deceiving. Let me explain:The reason why it's hard to implement social networks in a decentralized manner is because to build a social graph in an efficient manner, you need relational database to keep each user profile and posts. Then when you "follow" people, the algorithm needs to construct your feed at runtime to deliver the feed. This is a very challenging problem even in a centralized system (remember when Twitter kept going down during the early days? This is why). But implementing this in a decentralized environment? I am very skeptical.The way memo.cash or blockpress works (theoretically) is they track all the "follow" and "unfollow" transaction events, and store them to their CENTRALIZED DB. This is the only way to make sure things are delivered efficiently when you load your home feed.To be clear, I'm NOT saying this is bad. This is a compromise we need to make and there's no way around it. Like I said, this is a challenging problem even in a centralized system.However, claiming yourself to be "decentralized" just because you open sourced the backend is not right.Here's what I think what memo.cash hopes to get from this PR stunt:1. They want to create a narrative that blockpress is bad because they're copycats.2. They want to claim that memo.cash is decentralized because they have open sourced their code.But what will actually happen is, no matter how open source their code is, people will still go to memo.cash to use the protocol. And due to the very centralized nature of social networks, memo.cash will still be the main gateway to access the social network.Again, not saying this is bad. But as someone who's been closely following the project, I think the founder needs to be more transparent about what he's doing, instead of making political attacks to the competition.I truly believe competition is VERY IMPORTANT when it comes to these protocols. I'm surprised at most of the reactions here saying "there should be only one implementation". Are you guys going to shame all attempts to death in the future who try to do different experiments? What if someone wants to build an Instagram? What if someone wants to build a Facebook, or Snapchat, etc. They all have different purposes and not all of them will be implementable using a single application protocol.Please, let's be open minded and support ALL developers. And please, let's not use politics to compete. That's what corrupt people do.p.s.I DO think it's a great move by memo.cash and congratulate them on the decision, it's just unfortunate how he tries to steer the narrative this way when what they've done is genuinely great without any need for political attacks.
1	1525647622	6	Thanks for this. It's nice to see the voice of dissent is still alive and well here, you can rest in the knowledge that you've at least convinced one person to dig into this more deeply. Probably more.Don't mind the downvotes, free speech can be ugly sometimes.
1	1525644521	3	+1, and the downvoting doesn't change the quality of your post.There's been quite a bit of brigading from unexpected quarters lately.
2	1525647002	-4	Yeah, it's called a Following. Memo has one BCH!
3	1525647292	3	You're still here?
1	1525643078	4	You’re full of shit. Memo had links to a block explorer from day 1, most block explorers implemented memo within a few days (**cause it's really simple**)wewo.cash came out within about a week of memo, so I don’t know what was so hard about implementing it. Also you’re confusing ‘protocol’ and ‘implementation’. Look them up.
2	1525643865	11	\*\*\(**cause it's really simple**\)\*\*Well then, why didn't you reach out to this community to offer your services to implement the reading and publishing side of their protocol?  Talk is cheap.  Try implementing it and get back to us. =\> Listen, we burned \*2\+ days from our own roadmap\* trying to change to their protocol.The Edoera is right, we had issues as well and then decided "Why are we wasting our own time and money trying to implement something that is not detailed enough and has nuances that we do not agree with?"Frankly, I'm ashamed that you, someone who owns a business that I shop at, is treating other business owners in this manner.  But I guess human nature is the way it is.Hello!!? Amazon and OpenBazaar called, they want their idea back, Cryptonize. Just kidding.Feel free focus on your business and your priorities.You will not hear me shitposting about Cryptonize being a copy cat of Open Bazaar, Amazon, or the hundreds of other online stores.It's ok, because the blockchain and POW make this permissionless and we will continue to build amazing things for this community and for also people like yourself \(if you choose to want to join us \-\- great!, if not...that's ok too\)Best,
3	1525657177	2	> to implement the reading and publishing side of their protocol?What's the hard part about that? If you can craft a bitcoin transaction you can publish. If you can parse a bitcoin transaction, you can read.
4	1525697098	1	Memo is a protocol that is beautiful in its simplicity. If someone is telling they had troubles implementing it — they are just lying.
3	1525644443	4	Where was the trouble in implementing it exactly?And cryptonize.it isn’t Amazon or Open Bazaar, what are you talking about? And even if it was, a business idea is one thing, trying to copy/paste a protocol, break it and call it your own is a whole different matter. You not seeing that makes you 1) not a very good business man 2) not a very good developer. I appreciate your business like all 500+ customers a month, doesn’t mean I can’t be real with you.
4	1525644885	8	\>And cryptonize.it isn’t Amazon or Open Bazaar,Clearly not.\> trying to copy/paste a protocol, break it and call it your own is a whole different matter.Break it? We had announced our own platform about a month before anyone heard of Memo [https://twitter.com/BlockPressApp/status/984312527071993856](https://twitter.com/BlockPressApp/status/984312527071993856)We tried to do the right thing, but failed to implement their protocol and TO NOT BREAK MEMO PROTOCOL we made sure to have our own unique prefix/namespace.  Why would we build on top of someone elses platform when we had \*our own unique roadmap and we were worried about implementing with the Memo prefix and causing a fork/problems for everyone later?\*There is not a committee of what's allowed on the blockchain and we are free to use the OP\_RETURN, in a non\-collision manner, on our own. #Permissionless. You are free to follow or free to create your own path.\>You not seeing that makes you 1\) not a very good business man 2\) not a very good developer.Thanks for the ad\-hominem and attacks of our skill.
5	1525654768	3	> We tried to do the right thing, but failed to implement their protocol and TO NOT BREAK MEMO PROTOCOLI wouldn't even say that's the right thing. Nobody knows what the right thing is at the moment because we've never had this much freedom to experiment with OP_RETURNs. So the "right" thing to do is NOT to suppress ideas but to encourage experiments as much as possible with different approaches. I am appalled at how people are trying to bury different experiments for the sake of having a centralized implementation, when all of us here are refugees from the same type of fascism from the other side.I hope you keep pushing forward with your conviction and don't compromise with your protocol unless there's a good reason to do so. In my opinion it's worth experimenting with.
5	1525645377	3	>Clearly not.Then why say it? If you don’t get the difference between businesses ‘looking alike’(even though you comparing cryptonize.it to OB makes 0 sense) and protocol that is copied and broken, it makes you both a poor business man and developer. That’s not an ad hominem, that’s an observation based on your comment.I would of believed your story if it wasn’t for the fact that you can still make the change but refuse even though it would serve as a better decentralized social platform to build on 1 protocol, you know like it’s better to build on 1 ledger.
5	1525712084	1	Excuse me for asking; The earliest Memo transaction i could find by combing BlockChair was posted on 2018-04-11 somewhat around your Twitter post. However, i couldn't find anything that resembles a BlockPress transaction before 2018-04-29; Could you kindly tell me where the development took place? Testnet, perhaps?
5	1525646059	-11	No one cares what you "announced" "months" before! BCH's only care about what is Live! Memo is an Internet 4.0 .Cashsite. BlockPISS is just the same old bored and tiring POOP.
6	1525646947	9	> No one cares what you "announced" "months" before!Actually everybody does and your using a sockpuppet and being rude about it doesn't change the fact.

8	1525648106	7	I wonder...
8	1525697004	1	Lol, they are using sock puppets to downvote you and blame you that you are using sock puppets. Holy shit. We, as a community, need to do everything we can to prevent blockpiss from gaining any network effect. Those guys ate just a bunch of toxic and selfish trolls.
4	1525669501	1	"Freedom to follow, freedom to lead".What matters in the end is adoption and usage of BCH.We got countless thanks from people for creating something they want to use --- they expressed being turned off other publishing platforms... but found a home with us for now.Our goal is to drive BCH adoption and create cool products for people to use.Thanks for sharing your thoughts
2	1525643255	4	Yes it did. But it didn't pull the content from blockchain. Instead it posted to their DB and then to the blockchain.  This meant that the "single source of truth" at least at that point was memo.cash's centralized server, not the blockchain.This is a huge difference because this meant: if you implemented memo.cash protocol and posted using your own client, it would show up on block explorers but NOT show up on memo.cash website. This means, no matter how "open" the protocol is, you would still have to come to memo.cash to do things if you want things to show up on memo.cash website. It's obvious blockpress couldn't do this because the only way to add a "write" feature that will show up on memo.cash was to actually go to memo.cash website.Wewo.cash did the right thing and they crawled the blockchain. But note that wewo.cash doesn't have a "write" interface. Because like I said, during the early days, the write action could only happen through memo.cash servers.I know this because I have built a client. It didn't work during the early days (but it does now because the founder changed his stance and decided to open source after blockpress came out. You would know this if you've been following the chat room. He clearly said he will NOT open source memo.cash backend the night before blockpress launched). Hope this makes sense.
3	1525643761	12	We have had multiple dev/test/prod servers from day 1 that were in no way connected.  Memos propagated between them solely through the blockchain. We did have some issues with 0-conf but were very transparent about that - https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8eirl7/memo_update_released_improved_0conf_handling_and/dxw4qbd/?context=1
4	1525644200	4	I tried tons of posts during the early days, using different accounts, at different timing and different configurations, and none of them showed up on the website. And magically a few days ago it started showing up.I'm sure if blockpress guys ever tried to do the same thing, they would have experienced the same problem.And do you acknowledge how you clearly said you will NOT open source the backend even the night before blockpress launched? This was what turned me off from the project, and is the main issue I'm taking. Don't use "decentralization" as a political weapon to demonize another competition when you yourself is not completely decentralized.
5	1525644706	9	Yes, it was not our intention to open source the backend.  I don't believe in security through obscurity, but given the data that we are handling I didn't want to take any risks.  We've fixed a decent number of security issues since then, but even now I feel a little uncomfortable open sourcing, which is part of the reason why I added the "delete account" feature.Once I started seeing things fragment my hand was forced.  This needed to be nipped in the bud.
6	1525697175	1	The truth is on your side.
3	1525657266	0	> Yes it did. But it didn't pull the content from blockchain. Instead it posted to their DB and then to the blockchain. This meant that the "single source of truth" at least at that point was memo.cash's centralized server, not the blockchain.That's not a bad design decision at all. In fact it's actually smart.That cache needs to exist anyways, so saving it locally before broadcast allows them to not have to reparse it back out of the blockchain, but also allow them to retransmit in case there was a failure to transmit.If it happened the other way around people could be losing posts.At least complain about stuff that makes sense.
4	1525661965	7	As I mentioned, I am not blaming them for taking this approach. This is an inherent problem with anyone trying to build one of the most naturally centralized applications that you could think of--social networks--on top of decentralized networks.My whole point was that it's not fair for anyone including the founder of memo.cash to blame blockpress for not following their protocol when their own protocol implementation was flawed. Literally it was not possible to post something outside of memo.cash and make it show up on their site, without going through memo.cash (at least during the early days)What's more baffling is, according to several posts the blockpress founder made on the thread, turns out blockpress had launched even before memo.cash, they just didn't get enough attention before. Why should they be forced to implement another protocol which initially didn't even work, and arguably is more complicated than their own protocol which came before?
2	1525670389	-1	Yeah well blockpress works better and looks nicer and also you call everybody an idiot and that's no way of building a community so for now I am going to go with blockpress and delete my memo.cash ... oh wait you can't delete it. But I will stop posting on both just to get more tx on chain. That is fun for one day and then it becomes like a job. Blockpress.com it is for me and I will see what happens in the future. 
1	1525657462	-2	The problem you're probably having is that memo.cash website was only looking for and displaying messages from registered accounts. Probably too much hassle to display arbitrary data from unregistered addresses initially. To ascribe nefarious intent to this simple limitation is kind of stupid, at the very least ignorant. There is no real reason to have multiple protocols to implement literally the same thing.
2	1525661568	3	Let me ask you this, do you think you've done more research, or me who wanted to build on top of memo.cash and actually have finished building a functional client?The problem I was "probably" having has nothing to do with that because I have tested all kinds of configurations. Of course I started from signing up to memo.cash website and exported the keys. So your accusation is wrong.But it's much more than that. I spent days trying to figure out why the protocol was working in a weird manner because it had a lot of quirks.Lastly, the same code that didn't work (which i wrote) now works. Which means it's not my fault, but memo.cash's own implementation fault.
0	1525676159	3	I'll pay a $100 bch bounty to someone who reads the memo.cash backend source code and posts a markdown formatted *detailed* human-readable technical documentation of the actual as-implemented protocol.  Detailed enough for a clean room third party implementation.   It should leave out as few details as possibleMost likely such documentation will be 5-10x longer than what is currently provided (which as others have posted, is nowhere close to enough)
