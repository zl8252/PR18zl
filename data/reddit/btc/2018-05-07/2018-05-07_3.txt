0	1525636551	23	So it's time to make venmos like BCH app ;)
1	1525638008	12	Yes it is. But it also needs users. The users give the network the value
2	1525638381	8	Make the app, users will come :)
3	1525640029	3	If crypto goes mainstream, and lightning has a venmo like app, users will just use that. That's what I'm worried about
4	1525642226	14	lightning will never be a secure stable product, i can guarantee you that. The routing issues alone are a huge hurdle to cross. Its been a known problem in computer science for close to 30 years, and something tells me lightning lab devs are not going to be the ones to solve it. It will continue to be what it has been for the past 3 years, nothing more than a false promise. 
5	1525645555	1	Something that always seems like an obvious issue that I often forget to bring up, storing your coins on the LN. Are we to assume that in this possible future where LN is mainstream that everyone stores all their money on the LN? If people kept their savings in a cold storage, then tried to move their spending money onto the LN, wouldn't any cold storage withdrawals have high fees and take a long time?
6	1525658137	2	Yes the initial move to a new address would require whatever the bitcoin tx fee is at the time.  
4	1525643599	1	I agree with you about "if there is a venmo-like app that people just use then they will just use that" - there needs to be something more for BCH that makes it more attractive to use than these apps and credit cards - and maybe there is I just don't know enough about itJust look at this kind of stuff from cult of /r/personalfinance https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/8-creative-ways-build-credit_card-rewards_points-quickly-1277.php>"It's free money," Leff says. "It's like the banks want you to fly internationally in premium cabins for free.">"Savvy reward chasers" that "everyone should be"
5	1525673961	2	saturday i'm flying in a $15k one way cathay pacific first class suite.  i paid about $80 and some AA frequent flyer miles that were not all that challenging to earn.  i think BTCs claim of digital gold/store of value only or first for a long doesn't make a lot of sense, where i think they are particularly wrong i think is saying it's for larger transactions and not coffee shops.  but coffee shops are easy, simple, riskless, meaningless daily transactions and among the easiest to adopt.  foregoing of any credit card protection or any mileage is most easily done at that level.people will use cc's for 1% cash back, or a point worth a penny; which just comes out of the processor/bank's 3% or so fees.  i think crypto's win is in discounting the crypto price from cc.  i believe part of the card processing agreement is you cannot offer a cash discount (done in many countries around the world of course - or they just add the processing fee to your bill) - since crypto is volatile though i would think it's way easier to go ahead and get away with something like this.  instead of visa taking 3%, merchant keeps 1.5% and you keep 1.5% - their profit margin is up, and you got more cash than you would have points or USD cash back.
5	1525658196	1	Called Coinbase lol 
4	1525646026	1	Don't worry about what others are doing, they can fail in a million different ways and there's no way you could predict how they could fail. Focus on the task at hand.
2	1525689138	2	Paypal / X.com back in the day gave people free money to build their network based around this philosophy. It was a unique dot com time, but it worked. Unless there is a similar giveaway, a competing app won't gain traction based on technical merit alone.There should be some kind of foundation promoting this kind of thing for BCH - the increase in usage and therefore price would probably pay for itself.
3	1525700941	1	Underrated comment
2	1525651869	1	true
2	1525660518	1	I'm good for a couple / few dozen. 
1	1525648976	1	I believe that this is what centbee is trying to do? 
2	1525650928	1	Also Handcash.io.
1	1525658215	1	Soooo coinbase?
0	1525637112	32	Venmo disadvantages (it is clearly NOT P2P Cash):* Pmts within US only* NOT instantaneous, can be canceled (Merchant, do you know this?)* 1-3 days before settlement* MUST have/use/link a bank acct/debit card/credit card* Privacy setting is OFF by default (most dont turn-on)* Owned by PayPal[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venmo)
1	1525637828	20	I agree with you 100%. But the point I was trying to make was that most people don't care about that, they'd rather use whatever other people are using/most convenient
2	1525639815	9	Understand and agree.Just listing aspects of Venmo that others here may not be aware of so if it comes up, one can discuss more factually.Many, probably even majority of *banked* people just focus on *ease of use* at the possible peril of all else with privacy being at/near the top of the list.> I started to talk about "if you're not paying for it, you are the product" but she said she didn't care,Excellent point you made! And unfortunately a likely common response...Likely why many/majority(?) of the *banked* populace may be part of the [late majority/laggards](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/DiffusionOfInnovation.png) of P2P Cash adoption...Until/if they see the light regarding privacy, permissionless etc... as important concepts...The recent twitter/facebook privacy scandals are helping to bring awareness to many. But some are just too lazy to care...
2	1525641059	3	You're right. That's what the network effect is all about. That's why these companies are buying up smaller ones left, right, and center...because then they onboard all the existing users. Just look what Square is doing. ("person-to-person payment services industry")
2	1525648941	2	u/tippr 250 bits 
3	1525648984	2	u/DoctorStickyJuice, you've received `0.00025 BCH ($0.4355125 USD)`!***[^^How to use](https://np.reddit.com/r/tippr/wiki/index) ^^| [^^What is Bitcoin Cash?](https://learnbitcoin.cash/) ^^| [^^Who accepts it?](https://acceptbitcoin.cash) ^^| ^^r/tippr  ^(Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin should be. Ask about it on r/btc)
2	1525658329	1	Those are negatives to some people but very few and they’re also not deal breakers. The convenience outweighs all of that.  You’re talking about sending people $10 for lunch etc.  
1	1525646960	1	you totally missed the most important reason of all; BCH is not inflationary so one's savings will not only hold their value but likely go up in value until you decide to spend.  
2	1525652698	1	Not sure I would count it as the most important, but definitely important...Yep, BCH deflationary especially long-term
3	1525674233	3	it's not supposed to be 'make you rich hodl til moon/lambo' deflationary, it's supposed to be slow predictable deflationary, as one might hope for with stable steady adoption with no speculation.  of course what we actually have is mostly rampant speculation; which makes it highly deflationary; which makes people unlikely to spend it - the entire point of having a currency and in making a new fully reserved currency to compete with the fractional system.note a deflationary spiral was a problem during the depression as well - people wouldn't spent, business activity would not occur, gdp would shrink.part of the reason i like the BCH community is that the BTC community seems full of much more "investors" who for all intents and purposes simply treat BTC as if it really is a ponzi.  it should go up in value, as it is adopted, but it's point is to outcompete fractional government fiat - not make you rich.  i like that BCH is more focused on adoption vs. BTC being more focused on HODL.
1	1525642130	0	What’s the solution? And ethereum wallet paired with the stablecoin dai, which 1 dai = 1 USD. 
2	1525690417	2	BitPay-like systems. Seemless convertation for merchants from received crypto to fiat of choice (while it exists) and for customers ability to pay with as many mobile wallets as possible. In the ultimate form: decentralized exchanges and atomic swaps
0	1525643537	9	I made this point the other day in a thread asking why big banks aren’t going to just take over the crypto market. I received the answers you would expect:Big banks are bad Decentralization Privacy “I would never trust X”While I agree with all of these I think many people in the crypto world are making the mistake of living in their own bubble. The masses don’t even know about Bitcoin yet, not mention other crypto, blockchain, or why any of this started in the first place. The masses just want convenience, novelty, and the illusion of safety. It doesn’t matter who was there first, who has the better product, or who has the best ideals at heart. All that matters is who can bridge the gap between fiat and crypto the best and make mass adoption possible. The fact of the matter is, many more people would be willing to follow a big bank into the crypto world rather than some obscure entities they haven’t heard of or that brings up bad memories. So the question remains, how do we keep the “sanctity” of the crypto world?
1	1525644304	2	My grandparents still use AOL for fucks sake, because to them it was convenient, novelty, and illusion of saftey (at the time). Maybe they need to understand "ownership" more.
1	1525702225	1	You're wasting time worrying about such things. Bitcoin grew exponentially the last 8 years not because of a good sales pitch. In fact, all most people have heard over the last 8 years was negative. I've listened to concern trolling since 2011 and its never been at all relevant.People will use the currency that serves their self interest. Bitcoin succeeded despite all the bullshit because it had more utility - and that's ALL IT NEEDS.Who cares if some chick doesn't get it yet - she'll use it when men start using it, and men have already started using it.
0	1525650440	6	Some things that would help crypto go mainstream:* Wallets that do in-wallet fiat <--> crypto exchanges as well as in-wallet crypto <--> crypto exchanges.* Wallets that receive and fulfill payment requests to any crypto from any crypto, as easily as making same crypto transfers.* Universal adoption of account prefixes for every crypto (BTC, ETH, BCH, ...), so your wallet knows exactly what chain an address refers to even if you don't.  Saves on mistakes and hassle.* Universal "easy" address naming service that lets you send any coin (that someone accepts) to them using the all-chain address.* Use of normally automated third signatures that can be turned off to freeze and unfreeze all activity on all your accounts.  Easy way to transfer all coins on all chains to new keys.  Other support for easier security actions.* Wallets on desktops that are essentially Quickbooks accounting apps, making record keeping a breeze for taxes, managing expenses and other regular accounting that banks normally do for people.* In wallet support for services that act as 30 day escrow payment services (like credit cards do), so you can add trust and refund ability to transactions for any crypto (that supports multisig, and only when you want to - although it would be common).I.e. the point is to take out all friction and need for banks.  Probably 100 more things like this before cryptocurrency becomes a no-brainer for everyone.Wallets need to do ALL these things, as people don't want 100 apps to do 100 thingsAll wallet features (as much as possible) need to be chain agnostic so people can easily move to the fastest, cheapest, most secure coin while not having to hassle with other people making different chain choices.
0	1525648837	3	Seems to me that you really get it. This is related to why I think that, for the cash aspect to really take off, applications built on the blockchain might need to take off first, because they will (of course) require using the underlying cash system of the blockchain... And if everyone is already using that underlying token (Bitcoin, BCH) for applications in their daily lives, it will be even *more* convenient to use than Venmo, because VENMO is something extra you download to just deal with money, but BCH will already be the foundation of your social media presence, your gaming accounts, your investment strategies (via stocks as tokens), your national and worldwide identity, etc.I think ethereum is a great example of value and usage being derived from being the default payment system for *applications*, as opposed to being simply "better cash". Better cash will change the world, but first we need to get people to actualy want to use it.
0	1525639885	7	This is my biggest problem with the lightning network.  99.99% of people will never use it as it is too convoluted.
1	1525640103	5	If coinbase and the big players support lightning, people won't care what goes on underneath
2	1525645684	3	Won't uploading savings from your cold storage onto the LN have to go through the 1 mb chain, and thus have high fees and long tx times? This seems like a hurtle that pretty much stops any practical use of LN by the masses. 
3	1525692921	1	goal of LN is to reduce small, redundant transactions that are basicly spamming the chain. if only big players do transactions then it should not be fully loaded and regular users wont care/notice
4	1525704931	1	How exactly would it be a mainstream currency if only big players are using it?
5	1525715302	1	He meant only large transactions go on chain. The rest of day to day payments would be on LN. 
6	1525715759	1	So then everyone is supposed to keep all their btc on the LN at all times? Only big players would have cold storage? 
7	1525716115	1	See this is where people will have to sacrifice the whole point of crypto for it to be usable. But I’m assuming there will essentially be “banks” that will hold your BTC on the LN and allow you to spend that. And then you could have like a “savings” account and a “checking” account.Note I think this is an awful way to go, but I was just trying to explain what the other guy meant 
1	1525640606	2	A good/simple UI can make complicated solutions easy to use, but LN is a terrible "backend" solution.
0	1525701947	2	>They will just use whatever everyone else is using.First off, I'm going to be really sexist here and say that women aren't going to be pioneers of new currencies. They generally don't understand money because they have never needed it as much as we do. They have their own currency that is accepted pretty much anywhere (Y).Men are far more likely to look for new angles to challenge the status quo. Such men are always going to gravitate to a more useful currency no matter what the zeitgeist/status quo/'what their friends are doing'/propaganda, etc.
0	1525654617	2	Nano it is.
0	1525642031	2	If you want peer to peer electronic cash that the masses (not speculators) will use, it’s a crypto that has a set value that doesn’t fluctuate wildly. The masses if paid 50 dollars, want to know that tomorrow, they have 50 dollars because people need reliability if they are working to pay rent, food, utilities. They may like that their 50 is now 60 but going the other direction would not be acceptable. In this sense, both bitcoin and bch, or any other currency coin has failed. The theory is that the value of these will go up so high that in a few years the fluctuation will be minimal. The solution already exists. Dai for example is always worth 1 dollar, or dgx is tied to the price of gold. These have much smaller fluctuations and already work. They are ethereum tokens and have the security of the eth chain. Users can already from their ledger trade any of their tokens for dai without funds ever leaving their wallet. 
1	1525643247	5	if you think crypto should have it's value tied to a national currency you are really missing the point. see the genesis block "chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks"
2	1525651272	2	It goes to convenience though, which is your point.Noone wants to break the mood and perform currency conversions after a few glasses of wine, just to split and pay the restaurant bill. 
2	1525645506	1	USD is one possibility. The value can be any set value as long as it has stability. Dgx is pegged to gold and planning on releasing another pegged to silver. If you have a multicollateral system which draws the value from an average of tokenized oil, gold, silver, lube, cars whatever the fuck, you can set a singular stable system. This requires smart contracts of course. Dai is planning on being a multicollateral system in the future as well. Think bigger dude. 
0	1525646592	1	I believe the advantage to be in developing countries first b/c their nation currencies are unstable and using Crypto as "store of value" and for payments is the golden ticket.  Its still very early but so far Dash has the most transact in Venezuela since they have regional Venezuelan DAO with a 24/7 support desk.  I like Bitcoin Cash but the problem is there's no split in block rewards for DAO, marketing ETC.   
0	1525646916	1	..
0	1525651301	1	I'm not well versed in this stuff even though I love and hold crypto, but what's the significance of permissionless? You can configure auto-deposit on numerous money-sending platforms so that people don't need to ask permission to send you money 
0	1525652491	1	>  And when mass adoption happens the coin with the most users will be the most valuable.Fully agree with this. I believe we will soon see something like Facebook Coin. People will use it because other people in their circle have access to it. It will have bigger user base and likely higher marketcap than BTC. If not Facebook then some other social network crypto. Telegram may be the first one, others will follow.   
0	1525654273	1	Yes and this is: 1. First world problems 2. Its called friction aka ease of use. Blockchain software engineers can create brilliant backend software but usually suck badly at UI/UX.
0	1525656441	1	Totally.
0	1525672699	1	The volatility is the #1 biggest problem with cryptocurrencies that prevents them from gaining mass adoption. If you pay someone $20 in BCH for dinner, they don’t want to wake up the next morning to find out it’s only worth $15.
0	1525673581	1	if you are in a western society your need for crypto is simply not nearly as strong as elsewhere.it absolutely must be quick, easy, and cheap to compete - but the current banking system is already competing and trying to improve as well.  what is your case to her really?  what bitcoin is really about is being analogous to gold as money - it's fully reserved banking.  libertarians and some others have been in the US for decades proposing various fiat or gold fully reserved banking solutions, and gotten little traction outside of their circles.  the reality is they do not feel the pain of the currency slips, as gold went from 100% to 0% backing of the dollar.  the state enjoys this as well as it allows them to more easily fund wars and more easily intervene in the economy, and oops make mistakes - like cheap money available for too long fueling a housing bubble - but how many of your average citizens are really aware of this and understand how an alternate system of banking would make more difficult?  your friend just wants to pay for her meal.so i think in the west, it's libertarian geeks who care about this who will push adoption, and perhaps merchants willing to split the credit card fee between themselves and the customer so that a discount is offered to encourage payment in crypto.contrast this with money movement to other countries or mismanagement of currency/shitty governments.  remittances sent to mexico or the philippines can more cheaply be done with crypto, full stop.  government imposed currency controls can be escaped and capital can be transferred from one country to another.  rural africa where no banking will be built for people who live on $2 a day can have access to mobile savings.  mismanaged currencies like those in venezuela or argentina can be escaped today, into what should be a store of value as a feature of being a currency, but i would also even consider it an edge case where 'store of value only' digital gold might make a little economic sense, vs. the nonsense i typically think of that claim.tl; dr:crypto is a more important tool and an easier thing to adopt when you live under a problematic state.in a western developed state it's adoption will have to primarily come from merchant adoption based on financial incentives, as libertarians have shown that very little traction can be made trying to educate people on fractional reserve banking and convince them into supporting fully reserved banking.
0	1525678255	1	> I started to talk about "if you're not paying for it, you are the product" but she said she didn't care, everyone in her circle was already using venmo, and it just works.Facebook user mentality? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
0	1525686654	1	Bitcoin Cash is coming to take over the planet.Whatever Carol and her friends are doing cannot stop this.  USD itself is losing influence world wide.Don't underestimate people.  Maybe they're about ready for change.
0	1525690256	1	It'll be either convinient Bitcoin or something else
0	1525708431	1	As Rick said, "Profit, profit, profit." In a few years, you'll ask her, "Hey remember that bill I could have paid you in Bitcoin Cash a few years ago? it's worth X times that now."
0	1525708565	1	good write up and hit on point with current situation!
0	1525649768	1	OP did you take a look at nano? 
1	1525651359	3	one of the few others i hodl :-)
0	1525644933	0	Btc with the LN will certainly not be easy to use or convenient. How much more can the bch payment system/UI be simplified ? 
0	1525639967	-2	Tell her this, imagine buying a $100 Venmo gift card, but over the next 4-6 months, it will be worth $200. 
1	1525640659	4	OP's friend already acknowledged volatility. Just needs to be easy to use.
1	1525640140	3	Haha that's a good idea but what if it ends up worth $50 in the short medium term
