It's the worst example I've ever seen of assuming what you are trying to prove.I'm a real person.  I've got 8 kids.  I give them their allowance in Bitcoin Cash.  My wife and I save in Bitcoin Cash.  We do real things with it.  Tonight my wife bought a bunkbed for two of our boys with Bitcoin Cash and used our Shift card to send $25 to a Christian mission effort in Ghana.  I'm not making this up, and I'm going to continue to buy and use Bitcoin Cash.  I haven't made an on chain BTC transaction since mid-August last year and I hope to never do so again.
1	1525657392	1	> It's the worst example I've ever seen of assuming what you are trying to prove.Sorry, what?
2	1525659965	3	They are question begging: proving that Roger Ver uses sockpuppets by assuming that anyone who supports Bitcoin Cash must be a sockpuppet.
0	1525639043	55	Am I the only one who does not care about these people and this drama at all?  This sub is less and less about the bch coin and more about shitty arguments from shitty people who don't matter. 
1	1525655685	6	>  This sub is less and less about the bch coin and more about shitty arguments from shitty people who don't matter. To me this sub is about wresting control of Bitcoin away from those people.  BCH is the project to do that.
2	1525705407	1	Nothing on this subreddit will ever amount to control of anything.  Delete the sub, nothing would change.People don't understand how insignificant they are.
3	1525706926	1	> Nothing on this subreddit will ever amount to control of anythingGood.  I don't want anybody to control anybody.  Sounds like you misunderstood what I meant.
2	1525678766	0	> this sub is about wresting control of Bitcoin away from those people. Huh? The BCH developers are in full control of their own codebase. What “control” are you talking about?
1	1525641371	25	At least you are allowed to say a contrarian viewpoint on this sub and not get banned for it... like I was quite recently on "the other sub".  All I did was simply bring up the fact that many people have been silenced simply for speaking up against the party line.Keep spouting out that this is silly, and more significantly point out something interesting every once in awhile by posting something intelligent and useful too.
2	1525642013	1	Haha sorry I don't have much interesting to post myself, I'm just a humble hodler.  The content I love to read here are discussions where I learn about new uses, news on regulatory changes, etc.  Also I'd recommend you just ban that trash subreddit.  I have about 300 subs banned on this site including /r/bitcoin.  So many trashy cesspools with shit mods.  Let the idiots scream propaganda at each other.  It's funny imagining them ranting and raving not realizing nobody even hears them. I think it probably bugs me because I've banned them on reddit, blocked them all on twitter, etc.  I don't hear any of their bullshit unless someone posts it here. Spez: for example on the front page of our sub right now is a discussion about someone on their sub talking about shooting people in the head.  Look they're trashy people we don't need constant updates every time they say stupid shit.  People are downvoting me so I guess they enjoy reading that kind of content. Lol. 
3	1525642497	2	how do u ban subs lol? :)
4	1525642676	-2	Install reddit enhancement suite on desktop.  Click filter on the subreddit and you'll never see nor hear from them again.  On phone I use reddit is fun and you can choose to hide the sub there too. This is also extremely useful for political purposes.  I started doing it during the election when the leftists were spamming dozens of new anti Trump subs daily.  Got so sick of it and I needed to shut them the fuck up.  
3	1525654105	1	You're being downvoted for sounding like a dick...
4	1525654301	-1	Our two comments currently have identical vote totals hombre. 
5	1525671199	1	Then what are you complaining about, broheim?
6	1525672951	2	Nothing, don't worry.  As soon as I posted it there was some downvotes but nothing now.  I could go delete that part but it's not a big deal. 
1	1525642194	6	Sorry, we're just mad at these con artists.
2	1525643021	-1	I don't like them either but I don't want to read daily updates with screenshots.  It's like middle school drama.  They're retards we don't need to read retard updates daily. 
3	1525651226	6	Subscribe to a different sub then. If you don’t care about the history of why this sub was created, that’s fine. But respect the fact the people here are very passionate about this issue.
4	1525652813	1	The sub was not created to post screenshots of petty arguments with irrelevant people.  Lmao.  I don't vote on posts including this one so I'm not changing the content here.  But if you look for example today all of the biggest posts are simply about arguments with reddit accounts on r/bitcoin.  No one fucking cares about reddit accounts in an echo chamber subreddit.  And anyway my comment became the top comment in the thread so clearly my opinion is more representative of the subs attitude than yours. 
5	1525663487	1	> And anyway my comment became the top comment in the thread so clearly my opinion is more representative of the subs attitude than yours.Oh that's a great attitude. Have you noticed how these threads are voted to the top, as well as comments on this kind of stuff, on the regular? You're contradicting yourself here, especially considering *this* is what you're complaining about to begin with.
6	1525663649	0	I replied to another subscriber who said I need to leave the subreddit for having different views from them.  You didn't notice this is the reason I said that?  Does it change things in your mind?
7	1525663772	0	Oh I see what you're doing now. Fuck you.Edit: further into the responses he suddenly gained 2 upvotes (from 0) on each of his comments in the space of a few seconds. Interesting.
8	1525663801	0	> Fuck you.Sure ok.> Oh I see what you're doing now.Oh, what's that?
9	1525664006	1	Intentional fallacies in order to turn the point away from reason. I write this for anyone reading, you yourself can keep up your charade.Oh nice you edited your comment from 'wow' into 'sure ok'. Makes you seem more reasonable.
1	1525656676	1	No.  We need to remind ourselves of where we've come from so it doesn't happen again.  Anyway, you can't be a pacifist when somebody is continually punching you in the nose.  Maybe you're that guy.  People come here bringing whatever and they get a discussion, good or bad, without moderators rewriting history by deleting things.  If you don't like it go back to the echo chamber. edit:  Shill for less than 60 days, way to go with all the b.s. upvotes there.      
2	1525657745	-2	> If you don't like it go back to the echo chamber.> > edit: Shill for less than 60 days, way to go with all the b.s. upvotes there..I see you post in /r/bitcoin.  You're a shill, I'm blocking and reporting your account for trolling behavior.  
3	1525659538	1	lol  Nice one.  Be my guest, asshole.  I was banned from your sub long ago.  
4	1525663999	0	> Be my guest, asshole.
0	1525640144	9	/u/jratcliff63367 what is the meaning of this?
1	1525643720	-6	jratcliff wasn't wrong.  There was an instance where the senior writer for bitcoin.com's newsdesk (and Roger Ver's website) was caught because he forgot to change accounts before responding to someone criticizing his article.https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87t3ot/delicious_proof_that_roger_employs_sockpuppets/He promptly deleted the comment ([not before it was archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20180325235159/https:/twitter.com/jamieCrypto/status/978054447984082944)), and then [claimed it didn't happen](https://twitter.com/AaronvanW/status/978676364407660545).
2	1525655789	20	Doesn't mean Ver had anything to do with it.
3	1525661421	-3	Well he's certainly not going to ever admit condoning such behavior -- but he does still pay his senior writer... who sock puppets.
4	1525674552	-4	Idiot 
2	1525657475	12	Roger already acknowledged that happened in his recent video, and he told the employee that if they ever used a sock puppet again, he would fire them immediately.
3	1525673856	-3	Yeah he didn't even fire the guy. Says a lot about Roger's views on the situation. Slap on the wrist and nothing more. Culture starts from the top and it seems definitely plausible that Roger keeps a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy on this.
4	1525675919	8	What? You're either trolling or a complete moron. Why would he fire Jamie over a presumably once-off incident when Jamie has otherwise proven invaluable to Bitcoin.com?If he DID fire him immediately over such an incident THAT would be indicative of toxic leadership. Leaders empathise, rationalise, and communicate with their employees. What you're saying Roger should have done shows none of these traits. Roger responded publicly to the incident and reprimanded Jamie due to the negative impacts on the Bitcoin.com vision and pubic image. That showed real leadership.
5	1525676447	-1	> Why would he fire Jamie over a presumably once-off incident when Jamie has otherwise proven invaluable to Bitcoin.com?Because it's **highly unethical behavior**, duh! >If he DID fire him immediately over such an incident THAT would be indicative of toxic leadership.What the fuck are you talking about? Look to the policies of any legitimate news organization. Such a person would be out in a heartbeat. But Roger doesn't hold these ethical standards, clearly. >Leaders empathise, rationalise, and communicate with their employees. Oh brother, you clearly do not understand this situation in the slightest. This has nothing to do with his relationship with his employees. It has to do with his relationship (and trust) with the public. Jamie should've been fired immediately and sent to a journalism ethics program or else he should be blacklisted. You clearly do not understand the first thing about journalistic ethics.>Roger responded publicly to the incident and reprimanded Jamie due to the negative impacts on the Bitcoin.com vision and pubic image. That showed real leadership.Lol, what? Yeah Roger did some very weak damage control. You're still entirely missing the point if you think this has anything to do with his relationship with his employees, it doesn't. It has to do with journalistic standards and lack of ethical policies at the company. But go ahead, just call me a troll or a moron, just like every other shill on this sub. Anything to please Master Roger, amirite?
6	1525679453	3	> Because it's highly unethical behavior, duh!No, it's not. He was defending himself on Twitter, which is a completely different website and it wasn't in regard to anything with specificity but was rather an attack on his person. If he was making up lies within his articles, sure, that's unethical, but he wasn't. His means for defending himself were questionable, but they were personal. Go check his feed for the plethora of trolls and sockpuppets he's attacked by on every post. If you were under attack 24/7 like that, you'd do the same. The point is, he kept it separate from his work, and the ongoing attack against his and Rogers character over it is pathetic at best and the antagonisers will continue to attack the character of Bitcoin Cash proponents because their attacks Bitcoin Cash itself have failed.> What the fuck are you talking about? Look to the policies of any legitimate news organization. Such a person would be out in a heartbeat. But Roger doesn't hold these ethical standards, clearly.See above.> Oh brother, you clearly do not understand this situation in the slightest.

Anything to please Master Roger, amirite?You're assuming I'm not a genuine Bitcoin Cash user? I've been in this game for a long time, and Bitcoin lost its way. I'm very excited to have Bitcoin back again in the form of Bitcoin Cash and you bet your arse I'll call any troll or moron for being just that.
7	1525679935	-2	> If you were under attack 24/7 like that, you'd do the same.No I definitely wouldn't. Don't pre-suppose facts.>The point is, he kept it separate from his work, and the ongoing attack against his and Rogers character over it is pathetic at best and the antagonisers will continue to attack the character of Bitcoin Cash proponents because their attacks Bitcoin Cash itself have failed.Did you even read the twitter exchange. He got caught lying and then tried to hide it. It's beyond unreasonable to think that this passes any basic ethical smell test. This violates basically every journalist tenet. The  only other place this type of behavior might pass is on Fox News. At the very least Roger should have placed him on leave and sent him to a training. Only hacks get to keep their jobs at hack organizations after such incidents. >You're assuming I'm not a genuine Bitcoin Cash user? No, I'm saying your arguments don't hold up to pressure.>I've been in this game for a long time, and Bitcoin lost its way. That's just, like, your opinion, man..>I'm very excited to have Bitcoin back again in the form of Bitcoin Cash and you bet your arse I'll call any troll or moron for being just that.Lol, unsubstantiated claims mixed with ad-homs. My favorite!
8	1525681367	2	> No I definitely wouldn't. Don't pre-suppose facts.I hope your character is never under that sort of attack, but if it is and you pre-suppose that you wouldn't act like that, good for you! Until your reaction is proven and not pre-supposed, I guess we'll have to bury that one; lest we both pre-suppose facts ;-)> Did you even read the twitter exchange. He got caught lying and then tried to hide it. It's beyond unreasonable to think that this passes any basic ethical smell test.Yes. I read a version of it on archive.is. Unfortunately Jamie removed the exchange before I was able to see it with full context, so could only see a version from the protagonists point of view. Like I said, it was questionable behaviour and I don't agree with it. As someone who hasn't been in under the bombardment of hundreds of trolls a day, I can't say how I'd have reacted (and whether you pre-suppose you'd react one way, neither can you). > At the very least Roger should have placed him on leave and sent him to a training. I agree that he should have done that, with the public reprimand. I disagree that he should have been fired.Keep in mind that Roger is under a much greater deluge of trolling. In my opinion it's a great show of strength of character and empathy to react the way he did. People try to frame empathy as weakness, but it's most certainly not.> No, I'm saying your arguments don't hold up to pressure.You clearly implied that I'm a shill. Here's a link for you to read up on what a shill actually is:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shill>>I've been in this game for a long time, and Bitcoin lost its way.>That's just, like, your opinion, man..And it's an opinion that's shared with a lot of others. If you disagree, that's your opinion, to which you have every right. >Lol, unsubstantiated claims mixed with ad-homs. My favorite!There was nothing unsubstantiated. You call it ad-hominem, I call a spade a spade.
9	1525682659	2	> And it's an opinion that's shared with a lot of others.Except not the market. The bottom line regarding Roger is that he's lying and manipulating. He's calling Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin and admits to doing so openly. This would be illegal in a regulated market or industry and for good reason but Roger doesn't care. The fact that he feels he can get away with purposefully misleading people just shows that his character is severely lacking. BCash **is not** Bitcoin in any way shape or form other than the fact that they share chain histories prior to Aug 1. That's the only similarity. Bitcoin retained the network, the market, the majority of developers (and the skillful ones) and everything else of importance. Bitcoin refers not only to the software implementation, but also the network, consensus rules and chain itself. Roger is an asshole for making people believe that Bitcoin is "Bitcoin Core," as if that made any sense and BCash is "Bitcoin (Cash)" or just "Bitcoin". It's just a blatant falsehood and he defends it by citing the subtext of the white paper, which is just an absurd argument. If BCH has captured the network on or around Aug 1, then it would be Bitcoin, but it didn't, so it's not. End of story. Roger and all the people paroting this nonsense need to get a clue and start promoting BCH under its own name. The consensus was that BCH was a contentious hard fork and was rejected by the network. The only reason it retained and gained value afterwards was because it was an 'air-dropped' dividend for BTC holders that was distributed through wallets and exchanges at different times. Turns out if you give a network of people something new to trade, they'll trade it. In the end though, BCH has no intrinsic value. It's weaker than several other projects and cannot compete with Bitcoin in terms of roadmap or consensus. It's, quite frankly, redundant and inferior in every way. Good luck if you think otherwise, really.  >There was nothing unsubstantiated. You call it ad-hominem, I call a spade a spade.Didn't realize I was arguing with a petulant child. 
9	1525681375	1	**Shill**A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps or gives credibility to a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization. Shills can carry out their operations in the areas of media, journalism, marketing, confidence games, or other business areas. A shill may also act to discredit opponents or critics of the person or organization in which they have a vested interest through character assassination or other means.In most uses, shill refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers, participants or "marks" the impression of an enthusiastic customer independent of the seller, marketer or con artist, for whom they are secretly working.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
3	1525661163	-4	So he's still paying him?  And we're supposed to assume someone who used a sock puppet account won't keep using sock puppet accounts... because... honor system?  
4	1525664497	3	People have definitely been guilty of using questionable morals in business unbeknownst to their bosses before, been caught, told to stop, and then have stopped.  So it’s definitely a possibility that this guy went rogue and assumed he was doing something “for the greater good,” and then was set straight with proper expectations and consequences of revisiting those unethical actions.On the other side of the coin, you could be completely right about it all being lip service and the behavior continuing.
2	1525644834	13	> jratcliff wasn't wrong. There was an instance where the senior writer for bitcoin.com's newsdesk (and Roger Ver's website) was caught because he forgot to change accounts before responding to someone criticizing his article.What does that have to do with the claim that Roger Ver hires an astroturfing company?
3	1525645403	-7	Well I guess if bitcoin.com *is* the astro-turfing company then there isn't much reason to hire one.  But I'm not sure *running* an astro-turfing company is any better than *hiring* an astro-turfing company -- pretty shady either way.
4	1525645972	4	That's not the accusation. The accusation is that he hires a company, not owns one. So no, this does not prove him correct.
5	1525671189	2	Lol, I can't tell if you're being serious. The distinction between hiring an astroturfing company and doing the astroturfing in house is a meaningless one. Roger apparently thinks this is no big deal, "people make mistakes". I can't believe you're defending this.
6	1525674047	1	Do you care that /u/jratcliff63367 lied?
7	1525674456	2	He didn't. He speculated and that speculation was correct. Roger did hire (and still employees) someone committing the alleged offense. Go back and read the original exchange. He says that Roger does and then quickly corrects himself and says that he *thinks* Roger does. Turns out he thought right. Either way, yes, he should've clarified his original comments.Again, not sure how you think this behavior is acceptable from Roger but BCH proponents just seem to fall right in line, don't they? I don't really understand why you're trying to spin this into a discussion about /u/jratcliff63367, when really the bad actor here is clearly /u/MemoryDealers.
8	1525675511	1	He speculated and stated the speculation as though it was fact. It turns out the speculation was not true.What exactly did Roger do?
9	1525675840	1	Hired someone who was an astro-turfer and then kept them on after he found out. The appropriate move would be to immediately fire the guy as any reputable "news" org would. Beyond that though, I would not be surprised at all if this is the unsaid policy at the company. Again, Roger doesn't need to explicitly institute this to make it happen, he can just sit back and let others do it and that's clearly what's happening. How can you not see this? Is it because you *don't want to* see it? It's plainly obvious but you're doing everything you can do defend Roger for some strange reason.
5	1525647058	-7	Yea, you're right.  Shame on you /u/jratcliff63367.  Roger Ver would never hire an astro-turfing company.  That would be ludicrous when he has more than enough money to just run one himself.
6	1525673526	3	What's ridiculous is you spreading lies. jratcliff makes a baseless accusation and retracts it because he had no facts to support it. Then you double down and say he was accurate and refer to something irrelevant as evidence.
7	1525685637	2	People like lurker are a special breed of imbecile.
6	1525648095	2	[deleted]
7	1525651490	6	You want to know why that’s complete bullshit? Because it’s not actually ***happening*** anywhere. Come to this fucking sub though. Every fucking day, in every fucking thread it is filled with shit from you core trolls. Fake upvotes in the thousands HERE (on threads talking shit about BCH). Comments, down votes, threads, posts, everything. Saturating the sub. Daily.You guys are the kings of fraud online. If Rogers actually paying anyone to do this shit, they are a miserable failure. Not to mention completely invisible because I haven’t seen it.
2	1525645959	4	Okay that's interesting. I don't really know what Roger Ver, [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) etc is exactly doing but they are at the end of the day not BCH, they are just supporters, so whatever they do does not necessarily represent the BCH community.
3	1525661575	1	Have you ever wondered why half the links on the sidebar go to bitcoin.com?  I've seen numerous claims in this sub that Blockstream has co-opted /r/bitcoin, but nobody questions bitcoin.com co-opting /r/btc.  Probably out of fear of being downvoted to oblivion.
2	1525694519	1	That you get downvoted into oblivion for stating facts is a clear sign of an echo chamber.
3	1525694530	1	Redditor /u/uglymelt has low karma in this subreddit.
0	1525651732	7	Hear that? That's the sound of your Jratcliff's credibility going down the drain.If you have no evidence, don't even make the accusation.
1	1525651961	6	That's a bit harsh. He admitted he didn't have any evidence and said that's why he deleted his post. He also asked people to stop using those deleted words.We need more honesty in this debate, so good on him for making things clear and trying to rectify the situation. I don't see that as someone's credibility going down the drain.
0	1525640631	7	The linked archive.org page is one year old. Just warning you all that this is not recent news.
1	1525642131	4	No, but the attacks on Roger using jratcliff's first statement are very recent. Roger talked about it in his [latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=quJctIjKoi0), but he didn't have the link pulled up in the video. I went and found it.
0	1525637668	12	As weird as his "transition" was, i respect him for trying to correct this mistake. Edit: Guess what. Haters gonna hate. Lets be better than that and focus on whats important: adoption and clearing up the misconceptions that have been spread. No one ever has been convinced to rethink their positions by getting hated at.
1	1525638351	16	What's to respect about this really? I'm no mindless BTC basher, but for this specific instance it's really ridiculous to suggest that he's "respectable".To use an extreme analogy, a robber gets caught, he regrets his deeds and wants to return all the things he stole. Does that make you respect him?
2	1525639139	4	Guess what a robber makes a plan to rob and has to execute it. Writing something you strongly suspect as fact in the heat of an argent is something that can happen to everyone.I also have written some posts that i regretted after a few minutes of cooling down and deleted them after deemeing them unfair to someone.I respect him for admitting that he's wrong and trying to make it right instead of doubling down. Fuck that tribalism and trolling.
3	1525640904	9	It's not tribalism, if he really wants to apologize he should apologize to the very person who he accused of. Instead he's just trying to hide his shameful post, probably because of legal reasons.Don't know if you ever looked at the rest of his Twitter feed, but he's still making the same type of aggressive and trolling comments about everyone on the BCH side. If you want to respect someone like that go right ahead, but don't call me tribalistic for calling out what's not right, regardless of which "side" you're on. It's not right to make accusations about someone and then even when you realize you've made a mistake you never apologize to the person but just sneakily try to remove your comment from online.
2	1525639410	1	Also there's a difference between respecting one action and being respectable. I can respect Kim Jong II for shaking South Korea's President s hand while still hating him for being a piece of shit.
1	1525641428	7	There's no way you should be respecting a guy like him. He's made all sorts of ridiculous anti big block posts over the years. 
1	1525643319	6	Nope...fuck that disengenuous prick. He knowingly attempted to fuck up this subreddit by falsely claiming that he believed in free speech.
2	1525649663	3	I agree, fuck that guy.
1	1525639334	3	Respectable thing would be letting the accusation and retraction stand, not trying to bury it.
1	1525651310	3	This guy does not deserve respect. He’s been viciously vulgar towards everybody in this community on numerous occasions. Blatant mocking and spitting hateful comments on a regular basis. He lost my respect a long time ago.
2	1525654710	-1	I feel like... you're kind of vulgar and hateful...
0	1525643594	2	Why does it matter? Did he first support forking and then changed his mind?
0	1525663080	2	Who cares? Why do we need to talk about every single shit that people say about roger ver?Don't complain when people accuse BCH to be totally roger ver coin when you guys can't stfu about it, we have an upgrade coming, very nice price action recently and we should talk about it.

0	1525705237	1	The fact that these kind of actions exist, make me very nervous and worried for our future generations.Good luck!

1	1525639506	14	Seeing as people like you are out there spreading unfounded accusations, I'm glad this sub exists to refute them.
2	1525640198	-4	There’s a difference between refuting valid accusations and “making it seem like any crazy shit a random user says represents every core user” like that shooting threat thread today 
0	1525645966	0	What I don't understand is... what happened with jratcliff? It is very interesting/confusing seeing his history of posts/comments over the years. Seems like a falling out and he's still angry about it. Hopefully he comes around and realizes what has been going on, he doesn't seem like a bad guy really just strong in conviction, and that can sometimes appear odd to people who aren't used to that.
1	1525651582	2	Have a down vote for saying he’s not a bad guy. You haven’t seen what I’ve seen.
2	1525661118	1	Ok...? Then why downvote me? Why not just post what you've seen..https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/43qav0/core_scorched_earth_policy_towards_a_hard_fork/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7df2iy/if_bitcoin_made_you_fabulously_wealthy_do_youThis shows something weird. 
0	1525656839	0	Don't be too harsh. That ratcliff guy is just a good BS foot solder, he is not supposed to think for himself.
0	1525637565	-13	Well, there was [that one time](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87t3ot/delicious_proof_that_roger_employs_sockpuppets/)...
1	1525638648	11	Where he demonstrated in public that it was easy to hire sock puppets to raise awareness about it?What is wrong with you?
2	1525639455	-4	Nope, that must have been a different time.
0	1525643559	-3	Cool story, but it’s already proven he does
