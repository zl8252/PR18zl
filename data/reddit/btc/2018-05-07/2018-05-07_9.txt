0	1525673970	6	I quite like what you are doing in this community ;)
1	1525675595	5	You are welcome. Together we are going to build something great! A second economy that runs on a separate financial system. That can provide a backup financial system for when they run the old one in to the ground, which will happen sooner or later anyways. Bitcoin might speed it up when the banks secretly FOMO and start buying coins with your savings without letting you know. 
0	1525671279	4	That will be great. I hope it all works out.
1	1525688626	6	This community is surely changing my life in a very good way. This is what I have been dreaming about ever since 2011. It's only the start of the dream, lots of good things to come in the future! 
0	1525672704	3	It's very cool. Keep pursuing your dreams I say :)
0	1525680886	2	What's the internet job?
1	1525682243	1	I will tell after it's official. 
2	1525684783	5	If it has anything to do with accepting and forwarding on anything (products, payments) claiming to be distribution, it's usually laundering
3	1525688667	3	No it has nothing to do with that. 
0	1525691451	2	You gotta love when a plan comes together.
0	1525695745	2	Fantastic!  I'm supposed to be teaching a "Bitcoin Cash for users" class later this month to my extended family including my inlaws - we bought our house from them and still owe them money; maybe they will be open to receiving Bitcoin Cash as payment after they hear about it!  In the meantime I'm starting to pay some utilities on my shift card, at least.
0	1525677777	2	lol
0	1525703684	1	*offWhy don’t you just convert your crypto to actual cash if that’s what your Dad wants lol? 
0	1525707428	1	hopefully you can achieve it.
0	1525694749	1	I was really thinking, "how awesome is this...." Then you put ca$h on the end of the word Bitcoin. 
1	1525694973	1	Does it matter if my family uses Bitcoin Cash instead of Bitcoin-BTC? What does your family use?  
2	1525695663	-2	My family uses "ye good ole American dollaro." No worries man. I was just making a silly joke. I think it's "sorta" cool your family is all about the crypto.
