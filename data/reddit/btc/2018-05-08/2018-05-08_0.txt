0	1525752501	76	This is not about Buffetts interests. If Buffett thought that bitcoin was a better investment then Wells Fargo he would just simply sell Wells Fargo and buy bitcoin. Buffett's loyality is in things that promise good and safe return, not on speculative investments, and his stand on this has been the same since like 1964. I own a good chunk of bitcoin in my portfolio but please be rational instead of finding every excuse to fit your worldview.
1	1525783730	7	Exactly and cryptocurrency and banks are not contradictory concepts. Banks make money from giving out loans, savings and checking accounts are not how they make money. Loans are still going to exist in a cryptocurrency world
2	1525794983	-2	Bitcoin was invented to make banks obsolete. The banks "make money" by literally printing it out of thin air and lending through fractional reserve. Bitcoin is about sound deflationary money - the opposite of how banks work, so yes, banks and crypto are mutually incompatible (except for shitcoins with no supply cap).
1	1525771193	2	Selling that kind off money will crash the whole system, he can't do that even if he sees the potential in bitcoin
2	1525791554	3	well, he sold his (or actually BH) holdings in IMB worth of 10B (at a loss) without tanking the market. the whole crypto market would've gone to zero if anything like that is done.  so actually the correct statement is:  *he can't buy btc even if he sees the potential in bitcoin, cause crypto market isnt liquid enough*
2	1525793953	1	True that selling all at once would crash the price. Which is why he has no incentive to sell so foolishly. Big investors sell slowly, bit by bit and change positions over several quarters. He could easily do that if he thought it was warranted.
0	1525737910	65	Like Jamie Dimon, Buffet's attitude will magically turn around once all the banks have stuck their fingers in the crypto pot. Everything is bad until they have a stake in it
1	1525741374	57	I don't think so.  He's been wrong a bunch in tech stocks (and is slow to include them after they do well), overall staying away from technology, I'd say this explains his attitude towards Bitcoin better than shilling for how banks.
2	1525747839	29	He has stated many times throughout his career that technology companies are inherently the riskiest, and that's why he stays away. He's a pure fundamentalist, and most new technology companies have way too high a PE to justify him investing. It's a fact that with every new technology, 99&#37; of the companies that try to lead the way fail.His first speech and analysis on the subject are here. His insights on horse, automobile, and airplane technologies as they were emerging is quite amazing. He gave the speech to a room full of dot com investors \(including Bill Gates\) and many of them saw him as an uneducated old fool. One year later the dot com bubble collapsed. While many of those investors lost everything, he literally became a millions richer: [http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune\_archive/1999/11/22/269071/index.htm](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/11/22/269071/index.htm)
2	1525751307	6	He has tens of millions in Apple. Only reason he has so much Wells Fargo is because he bought up a bunch of shares during the crash in 2008 when they were trading at like $7. 
3	1525764884	6	Apple is mostly consumer electronics and not tech. The stock’s fundementals prove that
2	1525769806	1	Right he includes them eventually (i.e. Apple)
2	1525772831	1	I'd say it's 60/40 with the 60 being staying away from tech stocks and 40 being self serving interest.
3	1525788311	1	What's wrong with self interest? Bitcoin runs in self interest.He has a self interest in investing in things he knows and understands.He doesn't know or understand new tech.
2	1525782823	1	It's called "talking your book" and the old man is a master at it.what a friendly, believable grandpa character he is...
3	1525788342	1	If he believed in different things, he'd have a different book. Wouldn't you?
2	1525763373	-5	Because he's old and lame now, and you can't convince smn like him if he doesn't believe smth himself, somebody should tell him: the future is now old man!
3	1525777138	3	They said that when he was being all 'old man' in the dot com boom. Guess who won long term? He always thinks and acts long term. He has never been looking for a quick buck.Don't confuse Buffet with the greedy visionless banksters.
3	1525770066	2	Says a random poor to one of the most well-known, successful investors in our time.
0	1525751366	18	I thought he wasn’t explicitly against bitcoin, but just said that he doesn’t understand it enough to know if investing in it is good or bad. Seems like a perfectly reasonable position. He’s not going to jump in something just because it’s popular unless he feels like there is value. It’s how he’s had consistent, if slow, growth for so. Damn. Long. 
1	1525760162	2	He said this initially then a few months later came out against it as fundamentally flawed, hackers and so on. The major cryptos started to go through a collapse about a week after he was on the news saying these things. 
0	1525740684	61	Not to mention he sitting on almost 100 billion in monopoly money.
1	1525742014	16	Talk about vested interest - he has some
1	1525779867	4	Anyone that wants to get rid of your “monopoly” money, I’ll take it!  
1	1525755808	5	What a toon, he also indirectly owns poloniex since he owns goldman. lmao.
2	1525766167	3	He doesn't 'own' Goldman. Goldman's market cap is about 93 billion according to Bloomberg: [https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US)So he owns about 2.69&#37; of Goldman. Now don't get me wrong, that's a lot of Goldman for a single shareholder but that doesn't mean he owns it at all.
3	1525768585	0	Does he own a share? He owns Goldman. Nobody owns a public company, they can have a majority stake - which I didn’t say buffet did.
1	1525788790	1	Do people honestly think his net worth is just sitting in a bank account somewhere?
1	1525785987	0	That monopoly money that determines how good your crypto is.....wait.
0	1525745848	19	Lol you guys are silly. He's also the greatest investor of our time...???
1	1525799757	1	To be honest it didnt take much brains to make money when he did.  
1	1525754213	-2	He's been wrong many times on tech.Never invests in speculatory industries.Has vested interests against those of bitcoin.Not doubting his investing prowess, but his criticism here seems to be a bit misguided. 
2	1525776677	2	Exactly. He’s the master of long term investing and market wisdom. He doesn’t have a damn clue what the next big thing will Be because he’s technologically illiterate and refuses to buy into something he doesn’t fully understand. He’ll miss the blockchain revolution, he’ll miss AI, IoT, robotics, and whatever business Elon Musk is in because he’s too stubborn
3	1525794109	1	True. But he'll also still be rich when Elon Musk (or at least Tesla) inevitably goes bankrupt.

0	1525753030	7	Most crypto "investors" would be better off taking his advice. When you look at Bitcoin Core, and most of the shitcoins that currently exist, his criticism that you are investing in a non-productive asset is true. Only adoption as a currency will ensure that Bitcoin Cash has any future value.
1	1525774566	4	I find this quote of his most relevant to your post. Granted, it's about businesses, but the same principle could be applied to cryptocurrencies.> Never invest in a business you cannot understand.
1	1525762929	-6	why would bitcoin cash be used as a currency?  the confirmation time takes 10 minutes for a single confirmation, that is way to slow to use as a regular currency in daily transactions for anything smaller than several thousand dollars worth of value.  Nobody is going to want to wait 10 minutes to buy a bag of groceries at checkout.
2	1525767653	6	Just yesterday I purchased breakfast at the Brisbane Airport with bitcoin cash - the store was happy to give it to me instantly. 0 conf works, and the risk is with the merchant, not with the happy customer!
2	1525764302	6	Ever heard of 0-conf?

0	1525747009	7	Buffet already made his money. His time is up
1	1525777305	2	History has shown long term value investors win over every other strategy.
2	1525777395	2	Good thing I’m into the whole HODL thing then
3	1525794169	1	HODLing is not investing. It's savings crossed with speculation. Investing is an entirely different concept. It involves putting capital into things that pay a yield.
4	1525794261	1	Berkshire stock don’t pay a dividend as far as I know. Is it investing if I buy buffet’s stock?
0	1525764832	2	Some chinese guy saw through the picture too:http://news.8btc.com/munger-bashing-on-cryptocurrency-stir-up-irony-among-chinese-coiners
0	1525737923	4	Big if huge!
1	1525751738	0	> Big if huge!What?
0	1525737307	5	Holy fuck!!!,
0	1525776776	2	Buffet's attitude towards bitcoin is almost certainly because he doesn't understand it. The guy is immensely brilliant at what he does but you are talking about someone who doesn't even use a computer and who avoided all tech companies until his recent investment in Apple.His strategy has always been to invest in things he fully understands, and if there is any doubt, avoid.Again. Buffet is brilliant. But asking him about bitcoin is like asking the world's best chef about oil mining.
1	1525777745	0	>Buffet's attitude towards bitcoin is almost certainly because he doesn't understand it.  >"Produces nothing of value" >"Is gambling not investing"I think he has a pretty good idea about it.
0	1525740873	0	Wow, Buffet, it must be reallly hard to make money by investing in all the companies which print money out of thin air! 🙄[The Biggest Scam In The History Of Mankind - Hidden Secrets of Money 4](https://youtu.be/iFDe5kUUyT0)
0	1525743905	4	No the main point here is that buffet presents himself as being completely independent in his criticism of bitcoin. Truth is he has a lot to lose in bitcoins gain.Furthermore if he really thought what he said he would be looking at opportunities to short the currency.
1	1525794283	1	If he thought crypto was a great idea, he could slowly and quietly sell holdings in other areas and get even richer if/when crypto moons.If he believed it would make him richer, sustainably over long periods of time, he'd probably just do it.It's fine to argue that he's wrong. But guy kinda does whatever the f he wants with his money. And he wants to invest in things he understands.
0	1525748859	1	Probably the two worst banks from a customer's point of view
0	1525755058	1	They've never paid a dividend.
0	1525766998	1	Warren Buffet's Berkshire is also a very large stockholder of USD fiat money.
0	1525778838	1	He obv knew about all the shady wells bullshit too
0	1525782768	1	And that's nothing compared to his insurance business.Blockchain disintermediates warren buffet.
0	1525741513	1	That doesn't mean what you think it means. Your case would be better supported if the case were flipped, so that "BoA and WellsFargo represented the largest positions held by Berkshire"Edit: I see that is the case in terms holdings in financial sector. Your title doesn't follow from the screen cap. 
0	1525745932	1	How do we know this? There are no SEC filings.https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/brk.a/secfilings?subview=8kSorry, there are no filings available for this symbol.
1	1525752460	2	you can see holdings here https://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/institutional-portfolio/berkshire-hathaway-inc-54239
2	1525795907	1	Probably because they put it in a difficult format that yahoo couldn't parse it into a usable form.
0	1525759203	1	But he never mentions this when asked about crypto. Real honest guy like Wells Fargo. 
0	1525772715	1	wow you got him!LOL. idiot.
0	1525752757	0	It's easy to look like a great investor when you get to borrow $ at negative interest rates \(insurance companies\).
0	1525752811	0	Or maybe you're just using this as confirmation bias 
0	1525744791	-5	He is decrepit, people worship him because he picked stocks very well. This is nice and shit, but he didn't produce anything for society and plays market manipulation.
1	1525746086	5	[OVERVIEW: Warren Buffett has pledged to give away 99% of his wealth to philanthropic causes. Approximately 83% of that will go to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and much of the rest will be distributed to the foundations of his children. He is a very hands-off philanthropist, preferring to entrust his wealth to those he knows will spend it wisely on worthwhile philanthropic causes.](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/wall-street-donors/warren-buffett.html)He also constantly advocates that the rich should be taxed more.
2	1525794504	1	Advocating that people get taxed more is way more evil than making lots of money.In fact, making money isn't necessarily evil. You can do so by doing good.Taxes on the other hand, are everywhere and always an evil. Whether or not they are a *necessary* evil is what's up for some debate.
2	1525747717	-2	Well this has surprised me. I’m glad he has this intentions. I heard about the worlds richest lady dying last year. And how much money she died with. Insane wealth. So much good can be done with that money, and it’s simply kept in a bank to feed ego. Even Buffett could be doing so much good now, why wait until death. 
3	1525748014	6	[When Warren Buffett announced in 2006 that he would gradually give away the majority of his fortune to charity, he wasn't kidding.The billionaire investor just donated another 18.6 million Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway worth $3.17 billion to five different foundations.

4	1525752335	5	Goddamn he's awesome. Truly an inspiration. Why would I care if he stays away from speculative assets?---my species needs more people like him.
4	1525763925	1	It seems he is doing something now. I have found some respect for this guy.
4	1525752548	-6	he's giving away most of it to bill & melinda gates foundation as 'charity' . This 'charity' is mostly using that money to promote their agenda of vaccination and GMOs etc. 
5	1525753257	5	That sounds like a pretty okay agenda.
6	1525785365	1	Those are tools for spreading autism and cancer towards population control. 
2	1525748989	-2	> He also constantly advocates that the rich should be taxed more.Is it good? Everybody should be taxed LESS, and banks should pay most of the bill for obvious reasons.
3	1525749667	8	I don't think that you know how taxes work.
4	1525749782	3	I don't think he knows how anything works.
0	1525746403	0	Berkshire is, sure, but the investors of Berkshire all vote their own proxies. He's facilitating people investing in BoA, but I'm fairly sure this doesn't give him a whole lot of "controlling interest". 
1	1525747604	1	Lol
0	1525746607	0	Follow the money. Always. Follow. The. Money.
0	1525747051	0	Goldman already started to get into crypto
0	1525748263	0	The real question is, what is he capable of doing to set crypto back.... Would he do anything, and if he did can it even stop crypto....The last answer is no, crypto can not be stopped. 
0	1525772399	0	This is irrelevant. Berkshire owns 17.6% of American Express, this fact doesn’t mean he is against other payment methods.In fact, being for or against something doesn’t mean is a good or hedge or a good leverage for your portfolio. And the same applies the other way around
