1	1525767031	92	This is actually very very sad. Some of the old timers here remember the real dream of permission-less money... Blocksize conflict put that dream back a good 10 years probably. And we thought MTGox was bad and hurt adoption... pffff. This puts things in perspective. Sad sad sad.
2	1525770795	37	The best time for Bitcoin to spread was years ago. The second best time is now.
3	1525775756	12	I like how the "plant a tree" analogy can be used in anything.
4	1525778272	12	Turns out thinking about the future can be beneficial in many situations.
4	1525784792	10	Indeed. But the **best** time to use the 'plant a tree' analogy was years ago.
5	1525786877	3	And the second best right now
4	1525778569	2	The best time to take a shit was years ago. The second best time is now.
5	1525799720	3	I feel blessed, as i am taking a shit while reading this.
2	1525775947	2	As a person who hold both btc and bch i have a question: crypto is just in the very beginning, far far away from adopting. Just few millions users and bch already needs upgrade to 32mb. What will happen when we get to the point of full adoption billions of users?another upgrade? 1gb block size? What is the plan? 
3	1525777535	35	It doesn't *need* to upgrade to 32 MB, but it's good to plan ahead and allow room for plenty of future growth. Note that what is being increased is the block size *limit*, not the actual size of the blocks. If blocks are consistently 32MB, that means that Bitcoin is already processing nearly as many transactions as PayPal. Yes, the block size should grow along with demand. Even 1GB blocks are doable: https://news.bitcoin.com/gigablock-testnet-researchers-mine-the-worlds-first-1gb-block/
3	1525777558	19	> Just few millions users and bch already needs upgrade to 32mb. What?The upgrade is to 32MB block LIMIT. It's not that the blocks will be 32MB in size right after upgrade. You really need to understand why the LIMIT is there in the first place. Clue - it is not to limit the tx capacity.This upgrade is to show the users the path BCH is going  - on-chain scalling. Yes, 1GB blocks were already tested. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ax5ih/scaling_bitcoin_stanford_20171104_peter_rizun/
3	1525788339	14	The 32MB block limit is a transaction limit. Given no one has presented a valid reason to limit transactions this upgrade restores the original limit. While we grow and approach, that limit people who want to scale more should be looking at ways to do it.The 1MB gave us 7 years unsuppressed growth.The 32MB limit will also give us a few years to develop new scaling solutions.If someone thinks LN is a good idea they can develop that. Having a 32MB limit just means we're just not forced to use it. 
4	1525796519	6	there is also nothing stopping BCH + second layer solutions like LNjust as the internet founders never ever foresaw YouTube or Facebook - the crypto community has not seen the killer app of the 20s and 30s that are yet to come. onchain Wikileaks? scaling will be a combination of both - but one thing is absolutely completely clear: 1MB blocks are a death knell for BTC even with second layer solutions.  with 2 onchain transactions per year (open and close channel), you still can't provide banking to all 7 billion humans on the earth... let alone bots or other non -humans.I think the point of the BCH community is not "big bigger biggest is the answer" it's a roadmap that accepts innovation and ideas freely, with larger blocks being just one of those accepted ideas, and is also a short term answer. 
5	1525799695	-5	>there is also nothing stopping BCH \+ second layer solutions like LNEven if BCC HF in a solution for transaction malleability they have three problems using and adopting LN scaling solutions1\) The whole ethos of bcash is to always have low onchain tx fees regardless of other scaling solutions and to keep HF blocksize increases to insure this happens therefore there will never be any motivation to do the hardwork of building LN on BCC2\) Because many of the LN solutions are dependent upon aspects like segwit , RBF and the codebase keeps diverging between BTC and BCC it will become increasingly more difficult to copy the work from LN implementations without creating bugs3\) One key aspect of LN securely is users being able to run their own full nodes or watch towers which will become very hard to do if Bcash keeps increasing their blocksize limit
6	1525800945	3	1) huh? No it was to allow cheap transactions and not hamper the network while we design the scailing solutions so not to hurt adoption.  Remember that all of this is open source, if LN is created elsewhere and there is desire to add it to the network it could be done. 2) not dependant on segwit, it was fixing the malleability bug which can be accomplished many ways, segwit isn't a requirement.3) pruning is a thing if that's one of your concerns. Your FUD is lame and obvious, come back with the next spoonfed argument you have, maybe something something bcash ver scam....
7	1525801391	0	1) Users that invested in bcash have been fed and believe propaganda that LN is insecure and onchain is the way to scale so I don't see this happening anytime soon. Additionally, Bcash devs will take the easy way out as there will be no demand for Ln on bcash due to low fees on bcash 2) You are completely missing the point. I never suggested that LN is dependent upon segwit but that the codebases have significantly separated and becoming more and more different each week despite BCH still copying some of BTC new code. This means the introduction of bugs in a Bcash LN more likely if they simply copy the work and they sure as hell aren't competent enough to design LN from the ground up themselves 3) That isn't my concern and I have repeatedly stated that disk storage is the least of my concerns but people still keep going back to the propaganda while ignoring the real concerns 
8	1525802486	2	1) I half agree with you here, but the same is true about BTC users, propaganda is a real bitch, at least one forum allows for uncensored conversation. Currently correct that LN isn't required, might be nice to have though for cross chain support. Might be better scailing solutions that don't involve LN at all though. It's just the solution BTC is working towards at the cost of keeping the network working reliably for current users. 2) This would be the case for every other altcoin that decides to add LN style scailing. Assume your a BTC maximalist then or you really distrust the BCH developers. Cross chain support is something I see in the crypto future rather than everyone moving to BTC.
9	1525804402	1	\> Cross chain support is something I see in the crypto future rather than everyone moving to BTC. Being that I care about sound money and scarcity I believe you should pick a winner and support it till it wins or fails. I am happy for you if prefer BCC or are a BCC maximalist... great ... I am not interested in the hyperinflationary world of multicoiners though
6	1525801355	2	BCC is bitcoinect,Bitcoin Cash AKA Bitcoin BCH is what i think you are talking about. > The whole ethos of bcash is to always have low onchain tx fees regardless of other scaling solutions and to keep HF blocksize increases to **insure this happens**you really have no idea why the transaction limit is bad, do you? You are aware transactions are subsidized at this stage by a block reward to make it cheep to transact and decentralizes the 80% of coins that have already been issued. >Because many of the LN solutions are dependent upon aspects like segwitlike the BS/Core patents. >...watch towers...you know those are where they put the guards to make sure prisoners cant escape. 
6	1525804423	1	First: Bitcoin Cash is BCH, not BCC (BCC is the ticker for BitConnect, a ponzi scheme)Second: The name is Bitcoin cash, or Bitcoin. You should not confuse BCH (a legitimate contender for Bitcoin) with the supposed marrying of bitcoin with zcash (bcash https://medium.com/@freetrade68/announcing-bcash-8b938329eaeb)Next: my statement "second layer solutions like LN" should not be confused with "LN will suport BCH, or vice versa".You are thinking small and short term, I am thinking big and long term. I don't care what BTC and what LN are doing today. The technology of today will be ancient history in 2025, and for certain in 2100. Many in the tech industry were once convinced that ethernet would never scale and ATM would always reign.Innovation will continue - and in directions that are not yet known, or planned. I do not believe watchtowers are a good idea at all. I have a watchtower today that watches over and protects my Canadian dollars, I sometimes call it a a bank. 
3	1525795112	5	BCH can and will implement other features that will help fit more transactions per MB before it hits 1GB. Things like schnorr signatures, time locked transactions that could bundle many small transactions to an address; think satoshi dice using 0\-conf time locked so all transactions made to an address will be posted as one transaction after x blocks.
3	1525796360	2	> Just few millions users and bch already needs upgrade to 32mbThere's no immidiate need, but there's a certain shared vision> What will happen when we get to the point of full adoption billions of users?Don't forget incalculable amount of machines> 1gb block size?And more> What is the plan? Indefinite chain of signatures maintained by competitive boom-and-bust mining industry. Such system has **empirically** low fees
3	1525779852	2	Ethereum is doing sharding. They are gonna run 100 ethereum chains in parallel so each shard will have the transaction limit of the current chain. This will give 1000 tps before plasma is even considered (child chains) or raiden (lightening). 
3	1525778104	-10	>1gb block size? What is the plan?I know someone working on a vending machine to sell M&M’s one by one. It's a funny flashback to me because I remember back in the 90s it wasn't unusual to see street shops in eastern Europe sell bubble gum as individual strips.Anyway, he wanted to use BCH at first. His project however was the prime example for how there is unbounded demand for virtually free transactions. Imagine Netflix charing and settling by the minute.  Imagine Google no longer having to sell it's users souls to display advertisement but instead using a paypercall that charges 0.1 Cent for a search query. Now imagine the blocksize required only to cover those two usecases.BCH will need a layer comparable to LN. The cancerous illiterate religious zealotry that promotes blocksize increases as a scaling solution will be BCH's demise. It has no vision, it's misguided and it is as far from "innovation" as can be; regardless of what Ver likes to claim.BTC needs larger blocks. BCH doesn't. However both won't get to far by playing with the blocksize knob.
4	1525787095	10	If it is truly unbounded, we would have full blocks right now. The entire history of bitcoin until January of last year is proof you are wrong 
4	1525778360	12	Greg? Is that you?
4	1525787995	5	>I know someone working on a vending machine to sell M&M’s one by one.

His project however was the prime example for how there is unbounded demand for virtually free transactions.If we lived in some bizarro universe where your friend’s idea weren’t completely shitty and was instead wildly successful with millions of people every day making separate on-chain transactions for the privilege of purchasing individual M&M’s from a vending machine then yeah, that might support the case that there is almost “unbounded demand for virtually-free transactions.” But that’s not this universe. In this universe, it took Bitcoin approximately 8 years just to begin filling up itty-bitty 1-MB blocks despite the fact that its transactions were, for the vast majority of that time, “virtually-free.” And in this universe Bitcoin Cash has enjoyed “virtually free” transactions for the nine months since the split and its blocks are on average still less than 100kb.
4	1525795764	2	Absolutely. Shame that BCH have made second layer solutions impossible.u/tippr 0.00001 BCH
5	1525795806	2	u/FreedomlsntFree, you've received `0.00001 BCH ($0.02 USD)`!***[^^How to use](https://np.reddit.com/r/tippr/wiki/index) ^^| [^^What is Bitcoin Cash?](https://learnbitcoin.cash/) ^^| [^^Who accepts it?](https://acceptbitcoin.cash) ^^| ^^r/tippr  ^(Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin should be. Ask about it on r/btc)
4	1525779228	-1	So like every dispute in the world the truth is in the middle? The solution is somewhere between bch and btc? 
5	1525780596	-6	I don't think we are searching for truth here.Let's take SW as an example. Many people around here hate SWSF with a passion. Some would have accepted SWHF. Others will always reject SW. If you think about it you'd come to the realization that there is no truth justifying any of the camps. We are all grasping for wisdom to guide our decision because there is absolutely no way to axiomatically deduce the exact outcome for any of the given options.Knowledge precedes wisdom and most of us around here make up for what we lack in both by substituting hubris. So if yo ask me the "truth" is not in the middle. There is no truth. Just short sighted fools arguing over things the brightest of us don't dare to claim to fully grasp.The only conclusion I'd come to would be to stick to one project until it fails and then start over instead of spreading our resources thin and wasting them on toxic disagreements. But that's obviously not human nature.
6	1525782182	5	Very well put. My conclusion is a bit different though. Instead of waiting for Bitcoin to fail, I'll do my best to steer it back on track once I've seen it's on a doomed trajectory.
6	1525787178	3	SW as a soft fork is a horrible over complicated hack. There are much simpler means of fixing tx malleability.
6	1525796785	2	> to stick to one project until it failsMaximalism is never productive. Focus on a tree and u **will** miss the forest. Hitting 1MB limit was BTC's economical long-term fail if u ask me
3	1525789252	-9	> What is the plan? Their plan doesn't make sense on paper because it doesn't scale even if they choose to be very centralized , less secure, and just trust the miners without validating their own txs \- [https://www.coindesk.com/spv\-support\-billion\-bitcoin\-users\-sizing\-scaling\-claim/](https://www.coindesk.com/spv-support-billion-bitcoin-users-sizing-scaling-claim/)
4	1525790646	2	I don't have the technical knowledge to understand that.... 
5	1525791279	-2	ELI5\- 1\) The whitepaper assumed that Bitcoin might scale with SPV nodes\(light clients that don't validate all the consensus rules\) with something called Fraud alerts or fraud proofs . These have never existed and may never properly exist , thus reinforcing the importance of validating your own txs with a full node as trusting a third part is not using p2p cash by definition and is less secure 2\)  Many Bcash supporters care less about security , de\-emphasize the importance of full nodes , and promote the idea that we should just trust the miners to do the right thing instead of having economic users validate the txs and keep the miners in check. 3\) The article I linked makes the assumption that Bitcoin or Bcash scaling in a far more centralized and less secure way as a hypothetical and does the math to see if it could scale with almost all users using light clients 4\) The math shows it cannot scale with this assumption due to the demand on the servers serving SPV clients Thus BCH is a technical dead end and Bitcoin's plans to scale in many ways with  Onchain, decentralized payment channels , offchain private channels , optimizations like MAST and schnorr sig aggregation, and possibly sidechains/drivechains intelligently may work
6	1525796964	3	Bitcoin is trustless cos miners are bound by game theory to play fair. Not cos u've to redo miners' work of validation by reading the ledger they mined> we should just trust the minersNo. Trust no one> These have never existed and may never properly existLight wallets are absolute majority of wallets in existance. Both Bitcoins work just fine
6	1525798394	2	> The math shows it cannot scale with this assumption due to the demand on the servers serving SPV clientsDoes the math take into account how cheap storage and bandwidth will be once Bitcoin grows to a billion users? I read the article, and the answer is no.
7	1525798776	1	storage space  is not the issue and never has been due to pruning and the article stressing the issue of disk I/O\(not bandwidth\) which doesn't improve that rapidly ... are you sure you read the article? Your reply above appears you skipped it entirely
2	1525789104	0	> real dream of permission\-less money. Being permission\-less means that a central authority , miners , or devs cannot impose changes upon you. There are over 30 UTXO splits \(not including most alts which copy code but not the  UTXO history\) where part of the community adopts different consensus rules. This is testament to the fact that the money is indeed permission\-less 
3	1525795240	3	bitcoin works by consensus, consensus of what the miners deem.this is a very, very, very basic fact of bitcoin and no amount of your wishing miners didn't control bitocin will change the fundamental strucutre of bitcoin, that miners control it, and that people who run non mining nodes have no actual voice
3	1525797195	2	> miners ... cannot impose changes upon youRight. U can stop reading chain they mined. So? If u don't mine, u are not able to change anything. If u mine and want to change something maliciously, u'll be economically punished, but the network will go on
1	1525768951	14	This is what the small blockers missed. They thought decentralization was the purpose or Bitcoin. They lacked vision, they can can have their coin but Bitcoin lost alot of it's critical momentum. Hyper bitcoinisation  might never happen...
2	1525778496	13	Holding your keys is decentralization. They just only have one definition of decentralization and just like everything else they spew they are wrong.
2	1525779077	-16	Decentralization is a means to an end. The end in case of Bitcoin is it facilitating a trustless, peer to peer, uncensorable, global, immutable ledger for transacting value. That is Bitcoin's purpose. Without decentralization Bitcoin is just Ver's PayPal 2.0 Though the 2.0 would falsely imply that it's somehow an improvement over v1...
3	1525785323	9	Decentralisation was never threatened by increasing the blocksize. It isn't that those who support bigger blocks disregard decentralisation. It is that we understand it is not even an issue.Mentioning Ver makes no sense as he has no authority over BCH. Unlike BTC which seems to have one corporate authority in Blockstream.As for nodes being related to centralisation though nothing stops a cheap computer from running a node with larger blocks.
3	1525782648	9	By calling it Ver's PayPal 2.0 you show a fundamental misunderstanding of what happened during and after the fork. As Roger didn't openly support BCH until months after it forked, many in the community urging him to take action since S2X was clearly not going to happen.
4	1525783303	-4	I'm sorry you seem to have misunderstood me. I'm not calling it pp2.0 based on when Ver started doing something. I'm calling it pp2.0 because "Only miners matter, terabyte block initiatives, users should use validationless SPV and trust miners to do the right thing, satoshi envisioned data centers" doesn't sound anything like a peer\-to\-peer network to me.S2X proved miners don't matter as much as miners would like, considering \>90&#37; of them were signaling support for S2X yet nothing happened.
5	1525785755	11	You see right there you exposed the myth of centralisation really well. Also your lack of understanding of Bitcoin.People saying "only miners matter" are not talking about miner opinions. They are talking about nodes. Only mining nodes make the network decentralised. Non-mining nodes are irrelevant in judging the centralisation of the network."Terabyte block initiative" is just hyperbole. 8MB and 32 MB are not terabyte blocks. He'll as it is 1GB blocks have been tested, and they could work to give around ten thousand transactions per second with a moderate gaming computer. So even then centralisation couldn't be an issue. We are a long way from needing blocks that big though and by then it wouldn't be considered large.As for Satosshi's vision, well yes. He didn't think miners and other node operators would be small computers. It was always meant to scale up. Once established that we'll it wouldn't matter though. Everyone's phone is not meant to be a node, and no that doesn't mean it is not P2P.
6	1525797726	1	> They are talking about nodesAnd about economical punishment for misplay. Game theory makes Bitcoin work, your reading of mined ledger does nothing
5	1525797662	2	> trust minersNo, u don't have to trust miners. U don't understand how Bitcoin works> terabyte block initiativesMiners maintain the ledger. If u want to have a copy, it'll never be free hobby
3	1525797464	1	> Without decentralization BitcoinWithout decentralization of power there's no Bitcoin. Years passed, so far no 51% attacks (first miner had 100%, mind u). If such attack will ever happen, something new would have to be created to replace failed Bitcoin. Game theory prevents 51% attack, this is proven empirically
1	1525767215	10	BlockStream is like a reversed bank heist in which the robbers lock people's coins inside the bank's vault instead of breaking in to get the coins out of the vault.EDIT: wording

4	1525802505	2	I was here , and have been involved in bitcoin as far back as 2012, I never paid fees that high last year . The highest I paid was around 8 USD and I made tx almost daily. Not using RBF/CPFP, not manually setting fees , not using segwit  are symptoms of over paying on tx fees

[so Christmas 2017, when the *average fee was ~48 USD*](https://i.imgur.com/hwItjNQ.png), you made multiple transactions and never paid more than 8 USD?

0	1525771485	27	God damn the community lost an asset in Mike Hearn. Very frustrating.
0	1525768553	28	Nothing short of profetic. If somebody makes a "Mike Hearn: I told you so" T-shirt, I will buy it. With BCH of course. 
0	1525770835	33	“They would conclude that the bitcoin developer community were incompetent”Exactly right. Thinking it’s ok for fees and conf times to go that high is incompetence of the highest order. I have precisely 0 confidence in bitcoin core because of this.
1	1525790401	6	Actually, this unfortunately seems incorrect. The community trusts the "experts" will fix it and will continue to do so. This is why LN cannot fail: trust in the experts fixing it is unbounded. It was already a major success before it was even done.And the community judges the experts to be those with the most complicated solutions, ( and certainly not those that claim it already works and thus "present  no solution" ).It's a common sociological problem of open source development that is causing these problems: community driven development favours complexity.
2	1525799121	1	Don't forget the censorship. It's hard to see developer mistakes when everyone who points out those mistakes gets banned.
3	1525799718	1	The censorship is bad but I believe it is more a symptom than the root cause.Long before the censorship the divide started between Hearn/Andresen explaining Bitcoin can scale already and team Maxwell/Todd claiming it could only scale with their clever cryptographic sidechain solution.The latter team gained support (and millions to develop these sidechains) because people put their faith in those with the "clever solutions." This *caused* people to dismiss Hearn/Andresen and support (or at least not oppose) censorship of their idea.

Bitcoin had the highest amount of user adoption when fees were the highest last year, the investors have not gone away either as bitcoin keeps growing in userbase while fees remain very low of a few pennies per tx 
1	1525798548	3	Yes, thank you for pointing this out.Every one of his predictions was proven false. He was **wrong** on all counts. It is remarkable to see so many here trying to say the opposite.

0	1525782201	2	Yes he was.
0	1525795595	2	Come back to us Mike, we've changed!
0	1525802891	2	Did you read the article? Most of what he predicted didn't happen, but he was right about needing to raise the block size limit - so were a lot of people.Mike Hearn's background qualified him to understand that what Blockstream was doing was going to clog the network. He doesn't understand the importance of PoW, though, and that demonstrates a lack of understanding of Bitcoin in general.

0	1525774572	3	I know Mike very well. Pretty sure he recognized that BCH is Bitcoin early on and likely loaded up around 300$. 
0	1525789952	2	A few years ago I was predicting fees in the order of $10\-$50/tx.  In fact, I still predict them.  That specter is always around the corner until a scaling solution can be found, which I personally find doubtful.
0	1525794363	1	sound familiar?" [I’m not sure why you think the memory pool would fill up so quickly. The average size of a bitcoin transaction is 250 bytes. At 100,000 transactions per day, even if no transactions were confirming at all, that is only 25 megabytes of data entering the memory pool. Do nodes have so little memory that there is really a danger of them crashing…](https://medium.com/@chris45891/i-m-not-sure-why-you-think-the-memory-pool-would-fill-up-so-quickly-the-average-size-of-a-bitcoin-c6cea15cf373?source=responses---------0----------------)"
0	1525796025	1	I believe Bitcoin will crash.
1	1525796242	1	Bitcoin Core? I agree. 
0	1525800322	1	Would I be right to say that today marks the 3 year anniversary of the rebellion against AXA?
0	1525799419	1	I dont know why /btc is giving Mike Hearn all this credit.He is the guy who wrote the code that crashed Bitcoin network in 2013.He is the guy who wanted a Bitcoin benevolent dictator.He is the guy who sold out to R3 to be a pion in the Blockchain spaceGuys, WTF are you thinking? How do you win quoting Mike Hearn?

0	1525789715	-1	He was not, stop making such bold and assuming titles for opinion articles, this trend is cancer spread everywhere. Mike Hearn made really good points, but they are still debatable. This sort of title misleads so many people...
0	1525786572	-5	LOL every prediction is wrong... please everyone read the article
0	1525765435	-16	Then he went on to publicly dump all his coins at 400$ish. Lol.
1	1525765600	37	Yeah, it's too bad that Mike got so frustrated with the Bitcoin Core takeover of bitcoin that he decided to leave the project for good. He was a great asset to the community and clearly cared about the ideals of the project, not just speculating on price pumps and waiting for his moon lambo with a HODL license plate like >90% of the people coming into the space today are. 
1	1525766209	27	There is no reason to keep hodling a currency if you don’t believe in it anymore..I disched all my BTC too.
2	1525768654	22	Me too. I was hedged equally BTC/BCH for a while, but I have converted all my BTC to BCH now. Every fucking penny. 
3	1525770222	8	As I said back then, I have little love for tulips :)
4	1525771392	9	All crypto are a lottery ticket. I am fully aware of that. But it is my assesment that Bitcoin Cash (and Ethereum and a few others) are the ones with best upside long-term, should the lottery transform into the next phase (mainstream adoption). BTC will be to crypto what Mosaic was the browsers. A nice first attempt, but where dev stagnated, and was replaced by competitor(s).
3	1525774700	8	Same here, I hedged for months but then sold last BTC for BCH. I simply don't care, even if it goes to 1 millions Usd I don't care anymore. I'd use anything else but won't touch BTC
2	1525767731	2	The Armory wallet dev held a big amount of XRP.
3	1525768209	5	I am not how that relates to my comment.
4	1525769008	6	Tbh me neither.
5	1525770174	5	Indeed.
2	1525767616	-8	Uhhhhhh 10,000% gains is a decent reason 
3	1525767811	22	Many people, especially early adopters, are interested in bitcoin because they want to create a peer-to-peer system of sound money, not just because they're interested in the SICK GAINZ BRAH. The thing most of the noobs seem to miss is that succeeding in the primary goal of making bitcoin ubiquitous *will* result in the value of their holdings increasing. Price increases driven by speculative euphoria are not sustainable.
4	1525780920	-1	I get that. But the point was that he didn't believe in the project. So if you don't believe in bitcoin, is there still a reason to hold some?Absofuckinglutely. 10,000% gain, no matter how much you wanna call it "bro dude lambo talk", is an incredible reason to hold on to something. That provides funding for whatever project he might decide to believe in. This isn't bro talk this is common sense. I hold lots of coins I don't believe in. They help me make money to put into holding the coins I do believe in. I understand there's two worlds at play in crypto. The tech and the markets. I want both to succeed. I invest in the markets because I believe in the tech. You'd be silly to ignore the huge reality that is the markets. Caring about the price and the tech don't have to be at odds with each other. 
5	1525781230	4	Not everyone is interested in day trading and speculation. It shouldn't concern you what another person does with their money.
5	1525798359	1	> AbsofuckinglutelyNo. Only if u're a short-term speculator and have a strategy to profit before it fails according to your calculations. Not for everyone
5	1525786814	0	> I get that. But the point was that he didn't believe in the project. So if you don't believe in bitcoin, is there still a reason to hold some?He didn't just stop believing in the project, he made a trade which is based on "Utility drives value, as utility goes down, price will go down", which on the short term, seems to be invalid.However, there is much to debate on the current valuation of BTC,
6	1525795821	1	>on the short term, seems to be invalid.The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.
4	1525779727	-4	>they want to create a peer\-to\-peer system of sound moneyHow is BCH peer\-to\-peer if Ver, Wright, Wu and by extension all of rbtc claims only  miners matter and should run nodes? Either everyone around here has collectively somehow managed to redefine what a peer\-to\-peer network is, or every single time they write "peer\-to\-peer" somewhere that phase is entirely devoid of any meaning.The world running SPV wallets and trusting data centers to validate and transmit your transactions has nothing to do with "peer\-to\-peer" and it has nothing to do with being trustless. I mean I get that BTC has problems and that a blocksize increase wouldn't have been the end of days. But that doesn't justify the asinine bullshit that people around here repeat ad nauseam.
5	1525786919	5	So you're saying to be P2P, every user has to run their own node? 
3	1525768244	4	Not if you think bitcoin has even more potential.
1	1525780838	8	Because not only was Mike Hearn an unjustified punching bag for all the paranoid borderline clinical phobias of the $32 bubble boy 1MB4EVA Core devs, now he's also a piece of shit for not being a BTC price psychic. 
1	1525798249	1	Statism at its finest. Who cares about principles when u can make money, right?
0	1525789623	-6	He was right on all counts? lol. This is the guy who rage quit when Bitcoin was around $450 and sold all his coins.\>  It would have become the MySpace of digital currencies.Bitcoin still #1 and kicking. Deal with it btrashers.For reference, here is his rage\-quit post where he violently attacks Chinese miners \(lololol\).[https://blog.plan99.net/the\-resolution\-of\-the\-bitcoin\-experiment\-dabb30201f7](https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7)
1	1525792872	1	Even if we assumed that your argument is not stupid and that price/market cap is the only thing that matters, since he started to become an Etherum supporter you could assume that he re-invested in that instead which would make him gain even more than if he held his BTC.
