0	1525775280	18	The were banning people from rbitcoin for citing the whitepaper for years now. Nothing new.
0	1525789015	12	The religious small block cult conflates the Bitcoin white paper with a sacred text. They then project that others do too.The reason it's referenced is that it's a scientific hypothesis. It describes a concept that works as designed, a consensus mechanism that has yet to fail. The burden of proof sits with those who want to do another experiment by deviating from the hypothesis presented in the white paper after almost 9 years of empirical data proving it works.Go for it BS/Core, but don't call it Bitcoin. 
0	1525786672	4	While back ago they used it to back their statements. Basically anything that dines't contradict them is valid.

0	1525795370	2	The truth: BTC is BTCNYEAEEEEEEH
0	1525786936	1	It's not debunking though, is it?There are different opinions as to what it should be used for. If electronic cash was Satoshis original ide, that doesn't make btc a bad idea in and of itself.I'm sick of this tribalism.
1	1525787535	9	I think the problem is in the fact that Satoshi created Bitcoin to be electronic cash. Now people want to make Bitcoin something else, but still call it Bitcoin even though it is no longer in line with the original idea. It's not a bad idea in itself, but if you want to change how Bitcoin works you should call it something different. In reality it is not the Bitcoin that was laid out in the whitepaper. 
2	1525788405	2	So bitcoin = 'store of value' and Bitcoin Cash = 'Electronic Cash' makes perfect sense then.
3	1525791329	3	Not perfect. In the long term Bitcoin will be peer to peer as intended and (working name) BitCore BTC can be whatever Blockstream board wants it to be.
2	1525794196	-4	Just because it says the word cash in the abstract doesn't mean that it was referring to Bitcoin cash.And Bitcoin right now is still fully compliant with the white paper. It covers all aspects mentioned with the exact same functionality, but with extra features.Why is it no longer in line with the original idea? That part I don't understand at all. 
3	1525795184	4	Cash is mentioned in the title of the whitepaper as well.
3	1525800377	1	If it was meant to be peer to peer electronic cash, then $10+ fees are not in line with the original idea. 
3	1525801861	1	> Just because it says the word cash in the abstract doesn't mean that it was referring to Bitcoin cash. Sorry, I used the title. It's a reference to the fact that Bitcoin should be able to be used as cash.>And Bitcoin right now is still fully compliant with the white paper. It covers all aspects mentioned with the exact same functionality, but with extra features. Added features? You mean like high fees, unreliable transactions, and everyone's coding projects?>Why is it no longer in line with the original idea? That part I don't understand at all.Ok, these are from the white paper:>The network itself requires **minimal structure.** [The bloated Segwit, the perception that a LN is needed to scale, etc.] Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, **accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.** [You can't just leave and rejoin the LN at will, and with soft forks, you can't just take the longest PoW chain as the valid chain]>The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off **the possibility for small casual transactions,** and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services.Small transactions are impossible with high fees. Replace By Fee is a reversible transaction.>With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.You can't have anonymous transactions and reversible transactions, it just doesn't work.>What is needed is an electronic payment system **based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,** allowing any two willing parties to **transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.**LN involves a multitude of trusted third parties.> In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using **a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.**This basically affirms what Core denies, that the Bitcoin Network is run by the **miners,** and **NOTHING ELSE.** Because they "generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions."And that's just the Abstract and Introduction!
0	1525781710	-1	Bitcoin \(BTC\) is p2p cash and digital gold . Here is my man buying coffee for less than 1 us penny and an instant confirmation without any middlemen payment processors \-[https://twitter.com/danielalexiuc/status/993667149238435840](https://twitter.com/danielalexiuc/status/993667149238435840)Using 0 conf tx with a payment processor by definition is not **Peer to peer**
1	1525789384	8	Dream on if the transaction is not on the blockchain, it's not bitcoin. When fees are $50 do you think they'll be using smart contracts that require 2 on chain transactions to run a tab?
2	1525798471	0	I guess that goes for satoshis vision of updating the same tx many times, and settling on the blockchain isnt bitcoin right?
3	1525799769	2	You are confusing payment channels with the need to limit the transaction capacity to 1MB. I'm Pro Bitcoin. 
4	1525800412	-1	Sure you replied to the correct comment? If thats the case how the hell did you get anything in my, or the previous comment, to be about the blocksize limit?
5	1525802256	2	You respondent to my post about the conserved inevitable failure of layer 2 payment channels as a result of limiting transaction capacity with this comment.>> I guess that goes for satoshis vision of updating the same tx many times, and settling on the blockchain isnt bitcoin right?I just assumed you understood my comment, sorry. 
6	1525803039	1	Heh, you said "if its not on the blockchain its not bitcoin" in relation to LN. You were directly saying that LN tx is not bitcoin. I responded with an example of satoshi suggesting exactly this kind of updating tx, which ia only settled on the blockchain later. Now, is satoshit vision of updating tx lke this "not bitcoin" either? Could you please give me a straight answer. Yes/no.
7	1525803948	2	> Heh, you said "if its not on the blockchain its not bitcoin" in relation to LN.Correct it's only bitcoin when the LN smart contract confirms on the blockchain. If Money never confirms on the blockchain, then you don't need the blockchain. You will need to trust some other authority something other than the Bitcoin PoW to secure the system. Bitcoin is secured by transaction fees paid to miners to write transaction to the blockchain. >I responded with an example of Satoshi suggesting exactly this kind of updating tx, which is only settled on the blockchain later.  Satoshi designed the system, the only way to reconcile his discussions it to understand that if you want micropayments use a payment channel. Satoshi did not discourage the development of LN, rather saw it as a viable solution. Likewise, LN does not need limited on chain transactions to work, Satoshi described bitcoin scaling 2 days after releasing the white paper.https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DcqZveoWsAAOWXh.jpgpayment channels are a side story in the scaling of bitcoin, not a feature.  Don't like the Bitcoin described in the white paper invest somewhere else don't destroy it by limiting transactions to 1MB and think payment channels are a smart solution. They are nothing but a side note in the bitcoin story not even mentions in the design descriptions. LN is offered as a solution to an edge case for adoption criticism. 
8	1525804146	0	Thats an awful lot of useless text to answer a simple question.Just to be clear: satoshis vision of updating tx's can not be considered bitcoin?
9	1525804579	1	You could learn how you are could be wrong by understanding it. If it's not on the chain it's not Bitcoin. It's nothing more than a promise for bitcoin with counterparty risk. 
7	1525804021	1	It's not Bitcoin until it's settled on the chain. Why don't you respond to my other comment?https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8hv0wa/they_tell_us_to_stop_mentioning_the_whitepaper/dynjh7l/
3	1525802672	1	> satoshis vision of updating the same tx many times, and settling on the blockchainThis is meant for an edge case of a **small trusted group** of people needing to send funds between each-other with high frequency, like gambling, or day-trading securities.It was meant for a small edge-case where multiple transactions would need to happen faster than block can be found.It was not meant to be used instead of on-chain transactions, for scaling purposes.Show me where he said it was meant to be used instead of on-chain!Show me where he said it would be a good idea to make a network of these transactions to be used instead of direct peer-to-peer on-chain transactions!
1	1525802284	1	The Lightning Network is a middleman. Some would also argue that it is also a payment processor, because you are transferring actual value to the middleman node(s), unlike Bitcoin where the miners just validate that a transaction occurred, and never actually receive the value of the transaction. They just receive the small fee for their validation service.
0	1525787257	-2	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8GM3q6XkAI-c5_.jpgA lot of people like to pick and choose whatever Satoshi said that supports their own arguments.
1	1525787265	2	Redditor /u/InfoFront has low karma in this subreddit.
1	1525789800	2	Is he saying 0.01 BTC or 0.01USD? 
2	1525796779	-2	0.01 BTC. So, despite what most people in this sub will tell you, Satoshi himself told us that second layer solutions (like Lightning Network) are necessary for any transactions under 0.01BTC. 
3	1525800656	3	LOL, OK - you know that statement was relevant to **4th of August 2010**?>*Satoshi in August of 2010*: "[Bitcoin isn't **currently** practical for very small micropayments](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8GM3q6XkAI-c5_.jpg)" and 1.00 BTC on that day was worth $0.060.01 BTC = $0.0006$0.01 = $0.01 So when he is referring to a micropayment he is either referring to **less than** $0.01 or 0.01 BTC ( <$0.01 or <$0.0006) 
3	1525800924	3	>despite what most people in this sub will tell you,don't listen to the people in this sup, given it is uncensored you can find the truth, and nonsense, **you need to think for your self,** unlike r/bitcoin you are not told what to think here. You can't trust Satoshi as a divine God either. There is nothing wrong with payment channels. We should have them too. There is something wrong with expecting bitcoin to grow and more people to use it while the transaction capacity is limited to 1MB while the network is at capacity. 
3	1525803808	2	> 0.01 BTC1 BTC was worth $0.05 when he said that comment, so 0.01 BTC was worth $0.0005. That's about 5 Satoshis in BTC at today's price, or about 32 satoshis of BCH.>So, despite what most people in this sub will tell you, Satoshi himself told us that second layer solutions (like Lightning Network) are necessary for any transactions under 0.01BTC.No, he did not. You cut off the rest of that thread.>Forgot to add the good part about micropayments.  **While I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall.**  If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time.  Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms.  **Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical.  I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.**>I am not claiming that the network is impervious to DoS attack.  I think most P2P networks can be DoS attacked in numerous ways.  (On a side note, I read that the record companies would like to DoS all the file sharing networks, but they don't want to break the anti-hacking/anti-abuse laws.)>**If we started getting DoS attacked with loads of wasted transactions back and forth, you would need to start paying a 0.01 minimum transaction fee.**  0.1.5 actually had an option to set that, but I took it out to reduce confusion.  **Free transactions are nice and we can keep it that way if people don't abuse them.**This confirms that by 0.01 BTC he meant in inconsequential amount, which at the time was $0.0005 or five-hundredths of one cent!>That brings up the question: if there was a minimum 0.01 fee for each transaction, should we automatically add the fee if it's just the minimum 0.01?  It would be awfully annoying to ask each time.  If you have 50.00 and send 10.00, the recipient would get 10.00 and you'd have 39.99 left.  I think it should just add it automatically.  **It's trivial compared to the fees many other types of services add automatically.**>>Does including more slow down your hashing rate?  >No, not at all.Also, he specifically said in the image you linked that:>**Bitcoin is practical for smaller transactions than are practical with existing payment methods.** Small enough to include **what you might call the top of the micropayment range.** But it doesn't claim to be practical for arbitrarily small micropayments.So he considered $0.0005 to be the "top of the micropayment range" Bitcoin fees aren't even in the micropayment range anymore, according to his definition.
1	1525789250	0	No one is talking about micropayments.  Bitcoin Cash cannot handle micropayments yet (on a large scale), and likely won't be able to for a long time.  Our current goal is to handle everyday transactions, like buying coffee, lunch, etc.
2	1525801555	2	>  Bitcoin Cash cannot handle micropayments yet (on a large scale)How so? I see no big demand for it. Many people see the wave coming, but polished business models and working business processes aren't here yetYourg.org and Memo txs fit as microtransactions of 2018 just fine
2	1525796091	-2	I'd classify a $2 payment for a cup of coffee as a micropayment. In the quote above, Satoshi defines a micropayment as anything under 0.01 BTC.
3	1525796890	3	0.01 Satoshis = $0.00000091 USDAnd it was much much less at the time Satoshi wrote that. 
4	1525802686	2	0.01 BTC when that post was made was worth $0.0006 I think Satoshi meant $0.01 or $0.0006 in value when he said "currently" on August 4th 2010. 
4	1525800089	-3	Sorry, I did write 0.01 satoshis, but it was supposed to be 0.01 BTC (fixed now).It's impossible to send 0.01 satoshis - 1 satoshi is the smallest unit. Anyway, 0.01 BTC is approximately $91 now. And Satoshi said one Bitcoin will either be worth $1 million or zero. So at $1M/BTC, 0.01 BTC is $10,000. Hence, he foresaw that one day anything under $10,000 would be a micropayment, needing a second layer solution.
5	1525801626	1	> It's impossible to send 0.01 satoshisIt can be fixed when needed pretty easily. There's no gigantic demand for it yet
5	1525802915	1	edited to remove a mistake.  >he foresaw that one day anything under $10,000 would be a micropayment, needing a second layer solution.Are you sure that's what he meant when he said "Bitcoin isn't **currently** practical for very small micropayments" when defining a value of approximately $0.01 - $0.0006 at the time? I think you are spreading nonsense. 
6	1525803499	-1	I was extrapolating a bit with the $10,000 figure. That's beside the point. Satoshi's words speak for themselves.By the way, I think you are spreading nonsense as well. 0.01 * $9,100 = $91. 
7	1525804191	2	You are correct on that one. Ok, good maths yes.how do you think bitcoin adoption grows if people are not going to use it for payments. who do you know that uses electronic cash in denominations of $10000.  
8	1525804536	1	He also referred to 0.01 BTC as the fee, because it was an inconsequential amount, take a look at my response to him:https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8hv0wa/they_tell_us_to_stop_mentioning_the_whitepaper/dynkrvt/
0	1525794573	0	Yeah man.  Once they have their sidechain that will connect core to cash they are just going to pump and dump into the BCH network to make their gold coin usable. 
0	1525796726	0	If this was a reference to the Dark Souls 2 area below the castle. God I hated that place.
