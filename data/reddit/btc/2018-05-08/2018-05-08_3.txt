0	1525734347	10	Really dirty as I gave myself a firm time limit to show that's it's actually not that hard to implement. So ~~yes, the reply to addresses are still the wrong endian'd~~ and everything else besides New Memos and replies are unhandled.Edit: Fixed that issue with a short line.Example output:    ➜  memocash python client.py        ----------    TX: f8ca50021e8e83bc45f38b2b1d087c4e165cc81b2d6b665aaad900a588ec2115    Script: 6a026d03209ac0e0469df55efda42c29884db5fab8ba8674b4bcc8b1608d8f15c3975ffe86085265706c7920546f    To: 86fe5f97c3158f8d60b1c8bcb47486bab8fab54d88292ca4fd5ef59d46e0c09a    Length: 08    Message: b'Reply To'

0	1525739090	5	The complaints I read were about using the protocol to post messages and have them show up on the memo.cash website... Not about reading messages off the blockchain.
1	1525759976	-1	if you have read it from the blockchain in  python, you can use interfaces from  php/js to python to post it on your website. I am a noob in web dev, but I know, that from here it's pretty easy.
2	1525801169	1	The issue was the official memo.cash site wouldn't show posts made through other clients (i.e. posts not made through the memo.cash site).
