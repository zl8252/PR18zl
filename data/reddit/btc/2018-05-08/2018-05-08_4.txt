0	1525770856	19	Yeah, upgrade is so much more relatable to most people. People upgrade their computers and software all the time. It's a positive association for most people (I hope).
1	1525783098	6	Most people associate them with stuff breaking - look at Windows 10 for the reason why that's the case.
2	1525802731	1	Yeah, Windows 98 SE worked just fine for me, should have never left it behind /s.
1	1525800673	2	We shouldn't focus on bullshit marketing. We should focus on what can and can not happen. Fork can happen, economically meaningful fork is unlikely to occurIt's a hard fork event
0	1525772111	42	Nope. Calling it a 'hard fork' is perfectly suitable. It clearly demonstrates that uncontroversial hard forks, such as what a blocksize increase would have been without -core running interference, are safe and simple.
1	1525773550	6	you mean that if a "hard fork" goes well, there is no risk of any chain fork. Doesn't that demonstrate we have been using the wrong name all along if the successful completion make the name NOT applicable to the result?
2	1525775651	6	It's an interesting question.  Can we know that it won't result in a split prior to the fork though? 
3	1525784125	2	No we can't actually, which is why calling it a hard-fork is still perfectly valid. However we can assume that it doesn't happen since no one is supportive of that, no active and outspoken devs wanting to keep a different chain alive, so all zombie nodes who don't update will simply die off (this is why Core calls hard-forks disruptive, since your forcing nodes off) You can call it a protocol upgrade sure, but no point in hiding that it is a fork and with majority consensus it doesn't really matter if a different chain will live on,
3	1525800027	1	No. Miners are free to split the ledger at any moment for any reason. Game theory heavily restricts is practically, thus, orphaned chains dieFrom my perspecitve BTC vs BCH is just a major chain split and BTC will be orphaned. Then remaining BTC community will likely switch from PoW. If they adapt DAA before they lose hashrate, BTC will live further just like ETC
2	1525773815	11	I agree. The terms hard and soft fork are invented simply because soft forks sound less disruptive than hard forks.
3	1525776621	3	A soft fork IS less disruptive. It doesn't force un-upgraded nodes off the network. (Doesn't mean I support them - I see them as coercive for the very reason they are backwards-compatible). 
4	1525778426	12	I understand what you're saying, and I'm not trying to be pedantic, but soft forks *are* disruptive precisely *because* they are coercive.  Consensus begins in meatspace.
5	1525781557	2	I have BTC in cold storage from 2013. Long before SW and many other SF. How has the P2SH SF affected me? Why should I feel coerced? The rules I agreed to when buying BTC have remained unchanged to me. If BTC had hard forked in P2SH and 95&#37; of the value was now on the "upgraded" fork. I would have been forced to upgrade along with everyone else or I would have lost everything. THAT is coercive. The mental gymnastics people perform around here are staggering.
6	1525785909	10	I do not understand the case about your cold storage. Whether there is a hard fork or not, the coins are there. A soft fork can indeed make them unspendable on your network, but a hard fork by definition can not.And you are not forced to upgrade in case of a hard fork. Where did you get that idea?The entire hard fork thing means the network's rules are *not* changed with only miners' consent *and* that those who want to change them can move on without dictating the new rules to *you*. That is the utopic opposite of coercive.In the case of a soft fork, miners decide on an addition to the consensus rule set and you have no say in it. Your claim to not have been affected by it for one singular use case and one particular soft fork does not change what the mechanism entails.All in all, you seem to be making a hypothetical case where you do *not* want to abide by some rules and decide not to access your coins on the network that has these rules. I am puzzled by what you claim to have lost? If any of that makes sense, you can in fact claim to have lost everything if you do not like a soft fork that is forced on you, and that would be more plausible.
6	1525789657	8	> How has the P2SH SF affected me? Why should I feel coerced?Because whether or not you agreed with it, it was imposed on you.> The rules I agreed to when buying BTC have remained unchanged to me.No, now 100% of your capital is stored on a blockchain that enables P2SH.  Hope P2SH doesn't cripple the blockchain, because if it does you're going down with the ship.> If BTC had hard forked in P2SH and 95&#37; of the value was now on the "upgraded" fork. Then you would have a set of coins on a P2SH enabled blockchain worth 95% of your original value and another set of coins on a blockchain that follows the rules that you originally agreed to worth 5% of their original value.In your case you were "pro-P2SH" so you could have additionally sold your stake in the original chain and increased your stake in the P2SH chain.Optionally you could have held on both chains.  If P2SH had turned out to have a crippling defect, you'd be covered.So you see that in a hard fork, you as a user have complete control over how your capital is protected and nobody is forcing anything on you.In the case of P2SH it was a non controversial change, so it really didn't matter if it was hard or soft forked in, because everyone was happy to upgrade to it.But some people have this idea that because non upgraded clients will follow a soft fork, it can be used to get compliance with *controversial* changes. That's coercive. Segwit proved this was bad strategy.
4	1525776634	2	Redditor /u/DrBaggypants has low karma in this subreddit.
3	1525774332	1	And sticking with the name 'hard fork' demonstrates how wrong that assertion was.
2	1525796797	2	> Doesn't that demonstrate we have been using the wrong name all alongNo. The term hard-fork is meant to indicate the severity of the change. By your logic we could just "upgrade" the 21 million coin limit to 70 million coins.
3	1525800979	1	Exactly. It's purely political
4	1525803845	2	Yes, but as software engineers we shouldn't be disingenuous. We can't only call things we like upgrades and things we don't like downgrades or chain-splits. A major change which makes the software a user is running incompatible with the rest of the group should be labelled neutrally, ie a hard-fork.It's the user that then decides whether they're better off or not (whether they have in fact upgraded).
5	1525804048	1	I have nothing against value calls. I'm against consealing technicalities for marketing purposesIt's both a HF event and network upgrade
6	1525804465	1	> It's both a HF event and network upgradeWould changing the 21 million coins to 80 million also be a HF event and network upgrade? It's only the HF part that's objectively true. The upgrade part is purely subjective. In the case of the May 15th HF, yes, most everyone here including myself firmly believes it's an upgrade (that we'll be better off).
2	1525800843	1	> the wrong name all alongName is accurate. Chains do split
2	1525789301	1	Nodes that do not upgrade via hard fork will no longer connect to the network. "In other words, when the median timestamp of the most recent 11 blocks is equal to, or greater than 1526400000, then the new consensus rules shall apply to the next block. The exact time of activation depends on the time this block is found."
3	1525789324	2	Redditor /u/Hernzzzz has low karma in this subreddit.
1	1525803259	1	Naming semantics are only worsened by understanding definitions imo.Conceptually, it's a 'protocol upgrade' - but so is pretty much every other hard/soft fork. This is a hard fork, as it's a fork of the main repository with incompatible rules. 
0	1525785007	6	Monero already does this, and calls all its scheduled hardforks protocol upgrades. Such a hardfork may or may not create additional chains (such as the old ASIC-Monero chain), but I agree that BCH should start using this naming system too. Regularly scheduled protocol upgrades are necessary, and it's better done as hard forks over soft forks. [Vitalik Buterin has written an excellent article on this](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/03/14/forks_and_markets.html)
0	1525771175	14	"Protocol upgrade" is a subjective term so I don't think it's a great alternative to "hard fork". At least hard fork describes an objective phenomenon.Imagine the community adopts the term "protocol upgrade" instead of something like hard fork. Just the use of the term will introduce unnecessary politics.  For example imagine if BCH decided to implement SegWit in the next fork. Is this a "protocol upgrade"? It's subjective.That said, I do agree that there's got to be a better term than "hard fork" but just think "protocol upgrade" is too subjective to qualify as one.
1	1525771702	2	But it is a protocol upgrade. 'hard fork' is just a crude term we use to describe how the upgrade is executed. The problem is that most ppl see 'fork' as a 'split'. It is more like 'mandatory'.
2	1525780530	6	It's not mandatory though - anyone is free to maintain the pre fork side of the chain.
3	1525782118	1	It is mandatory IF you want to be on the network that is upgrading that way. In contrast with 'soft-fork' where you upgrading is not mandatory for you to stay on upgraded network.
2	1525803436	2	That confusion is based on not understanding.It's like telling an Australian you'll spend the afternoon with your Barbie. He will show up with shrimp amd steak at your toys' tea party."Protocol upgrade" is so vague it applies broadly to almost every type of soft or hard fork in the code repository
0	1525770831	13	Some of the nodes will not upgrade though and fork might still occur. Correct me if I'm wrong, please.
1	1525773731	12	What will happen to non upgraded miners?Within a few blocks they will realize that they are no longer participating on the network with everyone else, and upgrade.Zombie nodes that don't upgrade should be pruned off the net.
2	1525779033	4	So simple isn’t it? I wonder where was this opinion when segwit happened.. this community is amazing.
3	1525782293	8	This opinion was present but those of us who expressed it were kicked out of the discussion.
1	1525774241	6	Correct - some miners might not upgrade, and they might create a fork. But they will be left behind, their blocks ignored and their reward worthless - they will quickly fix whatever problem caused them to fork off the main chain and so start mining on the main chain again.This a major feature of bitcoin - it was built to be safe from unintentional forks.
1	1525774975	7	> Some of the nodes will not upgrade though and fork might still occur. While not false, this is a detail that is rather irrelevant. Sure, people can make mistakes of any kind and stuff happens. Bitcoin is robust and the system will quickly self-correct.The thing to realise is that at every single block we might get a chain-split for an abundance of reasons. Many of them simple based on mistakes.Highlighting one mistake doesn't really make the situation anything special, we have chain splits often enough and we just call them orphans. These chain splits die out very quickly making them non-events.I mentioned this in the OP post as well.> The blockchain itself has the capacity to fork every single block. Technically miners can do that. Nobody benefits from this, though and as such we call it a "blockchain" not something like "blockforkchain".
1	1525775413	2	If nodes don't ugrade then they will stop following the chain. 
1	1525771276	1	Only miners not upgrading can split the chain. If a node does not upgrade it will just stop following the chain.
2	1525771517	8	Sorry for not being precise enough. By nodes I meant full mining nodes. Silly mistake.
3	1525771934	4	Mining pools are in control of mining nodes. Mining pool operators are in contact with developers about this upgrade, and they say there is no controversy. 
4	1525773305	1	Hopefully we can trust what they say
5	1525777420	4	Do they have any incentive to lie?
5	1525801065	1	Trust no one. Bitcoin is trustless
0	1525770586	12	>  absurd ideas like an ABC coin forking off.Actually that very thing did nearly happen due to a bug in the Bitcoin ABC code:> https://www.bitcoinabc.org/2018-05-07-incident-report/
1	1525793145	1	Calling it a coin means there is some community supporting it. A fork by mistake is no coin. Where is the incentive in maintaining both chains after something like this? Remember, Bitcoin is based purely on incentives.
0	1525777032	5	[That's why](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/83sogn/its_time_to_kill_the_hardfork/dvkb6tu/)
1	1525799492	2	> I think we should start calling it a spoon. Spoons scoop everything up n moves it somewhere elseA piece of genius from that thread.
1	1525785341	1	This.
0	1525782307	3	Monero did a hard fork and everyone thought it was a good thing.
0	1525772769	9	Personality i explain this one to friends as a **Bitcoin upgrade**. With the capabilities of the new opcodes, BCH is **Bitcoin 2.0**. They understand this. No bones about it.
1	1525773617	5	I like this.
1	1525778415	11	Did you explain Segwit the same way? It’s even less disruptive since it doesn’t require hardfork. I’m asking because double standard in this community is blatant regarding this issue.
2	1525779992	2	I didn't, because Segwit is meant to optimize (no rebase, no new use cases) so it's more of a 1.1. (obviously it doesn't "fix everything" like Tone famously croaked it would, but inasmuch as it set out to optimize a bit, it succeeds a bit.)With the enabled opcodes though, new whole businesses can be created. It makes the same chain more robust. It's a 2.0.BTW does anyone know if any of the thousands of LTC/btc clones (i.e. currencies, not platform tokens) have enabled or otherwise included opcodes such as BCH will introduce? 
3	1525782524	1	> it's more of a 1.1.which is still an upgrade from 1.0 if this line of thinking is followed.
4	1525788134	1	Since segwit was a soft fork, and supposedly one could not bother with it and continue to use the non segwit code, then it seems more like a patch.If someone is a fan and wants to call it an upgrade that's fine too.
5	1525788713	0	well of course choosing to run 1.0 instead of 1.1 can't be called an upgrade. but switching from 1.0 to 1.1 *is* an upgrade yet the view on this sub was very much different.
6	1525800193	1	Feel free to call it an upgrade. It's not like other softwares' upgrades haven't broken things and introduced misfeatures after all.
6	1525803561	1	Segwit was one route towards solving scaling and malleability. BCH took a different path to those goals, and most of the community divided between the two paths.In comparison, the idea to continue scaling BCH and re-introducong opcodes is widely supported and is in line with the goals set by BCH 6 months ago
2	1525781638	2	It's not a double standard. Hard forks are opt in, and require the support of each new user for them to be successful. Segwit was forced on the legacy network and users had no opportunity to veto it. They woke up one day and the same software they had been running before was now infected with segwit.The bch community has consistently opposed forcing controversial on users.
3	1525782291	4	do you even understand what you're talking about? segwit is infinitely more opt-in than hard-fork because it is a *soft-fork*. you can still run pre-segwit node and it will follow the main chain just fine.with hard-fork you opting out is entirely dependent on whether there is enough miner support and even then, in case with BCH there was yet another hardfork needed to fix the problem with difficulty swings.
4	1525785674	4	>you can still run pre-segwit node and it will follow the main chain just fine.If you do this, the network you connect to will still have Segwit blocks in it. There's no way you can avoid this without hard forking away.>with hard-fork you opting out is entirely dependent on whether there is enough miner supportOf course, your choice of network is only as good as the people who agree to join you. But at least you have a choice!
5	1525786071	2	> will still have Segwit blocks in itsegwit blocks are **valid pre-segwit bitcoin blocks**. there is nothing in segwit block that breaks pre-segwit consensus rules.> There's no way you can avoid this without hard forking away.hard-forking away from *valid bitcoin blocks according to consensus rules*? that just means hard-forking away from bitcoin consensus rules.> But at least you have a choicewith hard-fork this "choice" means with high probability you end up on a dead chain. i wouldn't call that a choice. with soft-fork consensus rules didn't change - you still follow the same chain, just some subset of nodes are more strict about blocks they will validate.
2	1525780256	1	True that it wasn’t a hard fork. However some may consider Segwit a *Bitcoin downgrade*, and it was clearly disruptive in that sense. It was one of the instigators of BCH itself. 
3	1525782402	3	some consider BCH hard-fork on may 15th a downgrade, that is irrelevant to the hypocrisy and double standard compared to how people treated and described segwit soft-fork.
4	1525782564	-1	And that is nothing compared to the  harassment BCH gets from core on a daily basis. You have the choice to use the coin you want to, so vote with action. 
5	1525782845	2	harassment is mutual for one. there would also be much less of a negative reaction if people behind bitcoin cash didn't try to appropriate bitcoin's brand to scam people out of their money and enrich themselves.this is all off-topic anyways, the topic is hypocrisy and double standard of this community.
6	1525787107	1	IMHO that is a genuinely misguided viewpoint of BCH. Calling it a scam and money grabbing attempt with no validity to the arguments isn't helping anybody. There are clear and valid reasons why BCH exists. I, as many others, wanted to support BTC to the moon, but it became abundantly clear over several years of deliberation with Blockstream that it wasn't going to happen.
7	1525788022	1	> There are clear and valid reasons why BCH exists> but it became abundantly clear over several years of deliberation with Blockstream that it wasn't going to happenthe double standard in your message isn't separated even by a dozen words.either you accept that BCH and BTC have valid reasons to choose the scaling strategy they did or you are being intellectually dishonest here> Calling it a scam and money grabbing attempt with no validity to the arguments isn't helping anybody. this has to be addressed separately. i agree that BCH has a reason and right to exist. i disagree that the way it was forked off bitcoin chain and the way they are handling naming of their project is not indicative of ulterior motives in people behind BCH.first there was the spam attack in the midst of blocksize debate exactly year ago. it is clear that was a spam attack, it only takes a glance at mempool size over that interval. the goal was to sway public opinion and get enough miner support to make the fork succeed, which would grant ver/csw/jihan authority over bitcoin project that they never had.then there was a failed segwit2x upgrade attempt clearly designed to destabilize the network by making nodes pretend they follow consensus rules that they didn't.and finally over last couple months we've seen the swift manouvering from "Bitcoin Cash" to "Bitcoin (BCH)" to "the real Bitcoin".all these are indicative of the scammy nature of ver's/jihan's enterprise and undermine the real reasons for BCH to exist.
8	1525789908	1	BTC and BCH have the right to compete and people can vote with action. I'm not interested in regurgitating all the vitriol and finger pointing from either side. In the end the better coin is going to succeed with adoption and innovation.
1	1525774476	3	This... is actually a better way to explain it. Thank you, I'll be ~~stealing~~ using this way to explain it to my friends.
0	1525781298	6	It is hard-forking, and so what? Forking is currently required for the platform to develop  - not a bug but a feature.
0	1525801605	2	There is literally no reason to stop using the term hard fork. Please no. Its not hard to explain, stop hand holding. 
0	1525782073	4	It is literally a fork.
1	1525788298	2	The code could potentially cause a fork in the blockchain. But that is not happening because there is no incentive to mine blocks on the would-be minority chain. So no, it is not *literally* a fork.
2	1525803831	1	A hard fork refers to the code/repository being split between an [original] and [updated, incompatible version]Even if 100% of the community is running the new version at the time of activation, there is still a "hard fork"
0	1525778489	3	The irony being that because of the EDA used to survive a contentious hard fork with minimal hash power means even noncontentious forks may cause a chain split.
0	1525785210	4	Not again :(
0	1525775333	5	Leave the term hard forking to bcore. bitcoin cash simply does an upgrade.
0	1525785485	2	Repost x10. Piss off.
0	1525780648	1	Bitcoin developer who does not understand why a hard fork is called a hard fork. Please stop wasting time on name games and focus on real stuff.
0	1525788380	1	This is better. I've seen so much confusion talking to people about this upgrade and they always get concerned like "are the going to be two BCH chains?" and then I have to walk them through how no, this is a mass supported thing.Sure, technically it's a hard fork and for the technically minded people that might seem more correct. But talking to less technical people this freaks them out like Eth Classic, Segwit2x, Litecoin Cash, etc and they shouldn't be. Edit: example I just saw http://reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/8huxos/bitcoin_cash_fork_may_2018/
0	1525791162	1	We should definitely focus on upgrade, but educate what a hf is. If u in crypto at this stage you should know. If you have been conditioned to fear hf, it wont help to hide yhe fact that most changes need hf. 
0	1525797152	1	Agreed. The term "fork" is confusing and used to describe different things.It's better to use terms like "protocol upgrade" and "persistant chain split".
0	1525799959	1	U can't guarantee that the chain won't split. BCH itself is a part of Bitcoin HF. And previous BCH HF resulted in a fork, and minority chain is alive, but economically invisible. So it's a potential forking event. Probability of forking is extremely lowOverall: network will upgrade - BCH community are welcoming it. The chain may fork, but it's unlikely. Populism never leads to good places
0	1525803012	1	"Fork" as it applies to code is developer jargon, and in the minds of non-technical users it means a chain split.
0	1525776384	-1	A week before bombing Libya.Can we call it a government upgrade?If it's not  a war crime, why use term "going to war"?And some people thought you had any integrity, /u/ThomasZanderbtw. "Thomas Zander - Bitcoin Developer" really? I thought you just develop on bcash. Even the flairs on /r/btc must be propaganda...
0	1525790022	1	A hard fork is not an upgrade, otherwise you could still use the old version. If some users don't want it there is a chainsplit.A softfork is an update.But yeah start to confuse everyone further...
1	1525790033	3	Redditor /u/uglymelt has low karma in this subreddit.
1	1525800690	1	Software upgrades are quite frequently not backwards-compatible. It's usually wise to make it so but not always necessary or even possible. This is why the poor design of Bitcoin locks it into an obsolete version of Berkeley DB.
2	1525801316	1	I don't get it why should it be a poor design choice? If a miner changes the fact that Bitcoin has a deflating coin reward and sells it as an upgrade to social media sites than the rest of the community can still run the old chain if they care. I predict that we run in the next 10 years into something like that on a major coin.
