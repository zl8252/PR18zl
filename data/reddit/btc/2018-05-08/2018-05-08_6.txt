0	1525737004	77	tone vays is a fucking moron
1	1525746134	30	Probably the most accurate observation.
1	1525759519	15	I'm a Core supporter and agree with this statement.
2	1525770469	6	We (here in /r/btc) love you. Thanks for being here.
1	1525752937	7	>tone deaf vays is a fucking moron 
1	1525753020	12	My conclusion about him also. Tone is very obvious sellout (paid actor)
2	1525763220	6	No evidence of that, could easily just be deluded by standard cognitive biases.
3	1525769910	5	Maybe, but I am leaning towards paid actor. He did say many times he gets paid in BTC, I assume he doesn't mean this as giving trading advice only, which he charges for 0.1 BTC/hour, I think he gets paid to promote Core and their Lightning network, and while its true I have no direct evidence for that, I think his actions hint that he must be doing so.
4	1525781836	2	i also think he's an actor who's using a fake name. When i do a pre 2013 google search for him, nothing comes up. 
5	1525783093	3	yeah, he came out of nowhere, he actually said he had full time job in wall street as a trader, and that he quit to promote Bitcoin, and that would have to go back to his old job if Bitcoin doesn't succeed. I remember him saying this in one of his videos many months ago (early 2017).
6	1525785269	2	Btw, your doing God's work with your videos Ed, keep em coming. There's too many shills like Adam Meister and Tone Vays spreading btc propaganda on YouTube, we need more people like you to counter them. 
5	1525791974	1	I for sure know his name isn't Tone, must be Tony...Can't find anything about myself on the internet and I hope it stays that way
0	1525750352	28	I feel dumber each time I hear this guy say something.
0	1525752013	12	The sap cannot admit he was wrong about Bitcoin Cash so he advocates just not using Bitcoin at all.
1	1525786975	1	Keep a tab..
0	1525744504	27	So he admits that the crippled coin cant even perform more than 4-7tx/sec. So we'll just put adoption in the crapper, and tell everyone be patient... for how long??? (yrs already) When even just raising max-block size to a mere 2/4/8MB could have PREVENTED the catastrophe that is the intentionally crippled coin.The shear insanity seems to be only be explained by:* Complete Real-World Economic Ignorance of the consequences (likely reason for most like Tone Vays)* To achieve goal of STOPPING/slowing down P2P Cash (for a few/TPTB) 
1	1525763446	6	It's fine, they're ceding the market to BCH and assume they're untouchable---fiat currency once took the same attitude towards bitcoin.
1	1525758100	3	It's like they want the Fud to show up by leaving obvious operational flaws leftover on the main chain.
1	1525787290	1	Yet people still tell me that it was the right thing to do. TWO megabyte blocks??? Muh full node. Insanity.
0	1525757156	9	I watched the whole thing and not a single mention of Bitcoin Cash anywhere. Really a shame.We're truly lucky that BCH forked when it did and has had some time to get established because with what the mainstream is being told I wonder if BCH would have had the same chances had it arrived today. Watching these videos and seeing the number of views they get compared to your average BCH video it's not surprising that so many are misinformed.Overall it's not a bad video though when ignoring that they didn't mention the fork. Crazy to think that it hasn't even been 50 years since the gold standard was abandoned. When Bitcoin came around it hadn't even been 40 years.
1	1525761073	9	Don't worry - I'm working on a documentary similar to this based on The Scaling Debate and BCH into the future.All of the mainstream Bitcoin docs are super basic and for noobs. My doc will be for those people who somewhat understand what Bitcoin is but have no idea about the civil war that has been happening. Stay tuned!
2	1525772665	2	This is what we need, keep up the good work!
0	1525736860	19	What happened to telling your friends and your friends friends about (Bitcoin)? BCH
0	1525755831	9	I can't believe a person this dull with a haircut this bad can be relevant in bitcoin community. 
1	1525773899	1	I cringe whenever I see it. Wtf is he thinking!
2	1525774882	1	That's what happens when you watch *Dumb and Dumber* too many times. You get dumb and dumber, and eventually you go to a barber and ask for such a haircut.
0	1525760311	4	Hypothesis: The maturity of the crypto space is inversely correlated to Tone Vays' number of social media followers.
0	1525737393	8	Nobody uses it, it is too crowded
1	1525739008	15	Incorrect, it's 100% ready and blocks are less than 3% full capacity at the moment and are due to hard fork to 32 MB blocks soon. Not crowded at all.
2	1525749052	5	He was talking about BTC. I donâ€™t really like the analogy in this context though for some reason.
1	1525770162	2	Truly one of the worst sayings I know
0	1525759393	3	OMG...
0	1525796557	1	Tim, great work
0	1525775528	0	Well, I hate to say it, but in a sense, he's right. Bitcoin is too popular, since I see plenty of newcomers nowadays who are in it for $$$ gains. Is it any coincidence that they also tend to bash Bitcoin Cash and the idea of P2P electronic cash?
