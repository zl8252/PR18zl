0	1525732376	15	Just wait until some of these "cutting edge innovations" turn out to be pipe dreams and ICO bagholders start crying for regulated markets. Adults are happy to make their own decisions, and less happy to suffer the consequences.
1	1525733983	23	Adults can suffer the consequences of their decisions too. That's how it goes. You don't get this freedom without bearing the responsibility. 
2	1525774923	3	I mean, you're both right.  People can suffer the consequences, and should, but that won't stop a very loud minority from crying out for regulation.  Seeing as there's quite a bit of money involved it's very likely to happen when things go south for some of these projects.

1	1525746043	11	Yep. Erik is a world-class hypocrite!
1	1525765262	1	That's not what he has said. You can disagree with him, but what is the point of straw man-ing his ideas?
1	1525790664	1	You don't understand Erik's position, if you truly believe that.
0	1525751043	2	I canâ€™t find this tweet. Can anyone share the twitter link?

0	1525775234	3	That is one of the most deluded pieces of text I have read in the last year.  The ICO market in it's current form is a criminal/scammer/fraudster's paradise.
1	1525780598	4	Yes but it is in fact a fast growing and cutting-edge innovative criminal/scammer/fraudster's paradise where adults are able to make decisions with their own money, so I don't see what's so deluded about that piece of text.
2	1525782635	1	Cutting edge scamming innovation indeed
