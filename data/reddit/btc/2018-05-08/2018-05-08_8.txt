0	1525762891	33	I really like the green color of the logo, and it clearly differentiates Bitcoin Cash from Bitcoin :)
1	1525763686	17	Yes yes. Green is good.
2	1525775941	10	Green works.
2	1525767158	5	Most humans have eyes tuned to green
3	1525769160	3	i think it's just your cones are most receptive to it as it's in the middle of visible light.
4	1525776707	2	I think it has to do with nature being green. 
5	1525777203	1	like an evolutionary aspect to our eyes evolving to be most sensitive to it?  sounds logical
6	1525778107	3	Exactly, yeah. Liking green (nature) and fearing red (blood). 
4	1525783926	1	You have more green cones than red/blue cones. 
2	1525794064	1	user testing shows original bitcoin orange is received better by new users than green.
3	1525798761	1	More important to differentiate, and green goes with the "cash" label.
1	1525786980	3	Green also tricks our brains into thinking that the graph is (more) positive than the others.
2	1525789560	1	True :)
1	1525793421	2	Hmmm I agree I like it. Should all BCH logos be green? I built a small app over the weekend and I'm beginning to think I should switch from yellow to green...
2	1525794869	2	I think the community is slowly moving toward green..,
0	1525762239	15	Coinbbase.com is that some kind of phishing site?
1	1525768298	8	The B key on my keyboard double enters it sometimes.. :( It even did it when I was typing this. 
2	1525771163	3	Macbook pro?
3	1525785475	2	Kakbbook schmoe. I also have one.
3	1525802271	1	Macbbook Pro.
2	1525772211	3	If it's a mobile device, like a phone/tablet, try clearing the data for the keyboard from the settings app.  That's worked for me before on an Android device.
2	1525772068	2	I'm a huge supporter of you and the real Bitcoin (BCH) so take this lightheartedly, but you had that low quality mic for a while and are using a keyboard that annoys you... how come? You have got to be swimming in it. lol
3	1525782996	3	About the keyboard - he uses a MacBook. A good keyboard was *definitely* not a priority for him.^^t. ^^smug ^^ThinkPad ^^owner
2	1525789187	1	So this is the power of Macbooks... woah.
2	1525782322	0	you cant afford a new keyboard?? i thought you were a self maid billionaire.
3	1525785059	3	Is that a billionaire who picks up after themselves?
2	1525779125	-6	bbcash 
3	1525785242	1	4chan has rotted your brain.
1	1525763718	0	forgot the /s ?
0	1525760165	19	How is that center lol
1	1525763611	4	OP is overhyped lel
2	1525775633	2	Roger doesn’t realize they just put it in alphabetical order
3	1525785905	3	It used to be sorted by market cap, so its an improvement
1	1525770544	-13	narcissistic psychopaths think like they are even in the center of the universe.
2	1525770560	11	Redditor /u/sumsaph has low karma in this subreddit.
3	1525788898	4	As do 90% of the jelly Core Neckbeards commenting here. 
0	1525763613	2	Now if they would update their app so I can see BCH prices that would be really nice. It's been like 6 months, what's the holdup?
1	1525780585	2	I click on my CB app and it shows current price first thing on all four coin, and my total balance.. I hold all four of these coins. Half on CB, and half in my wallets. 
2	1525789254	2	CB won't let me screenshot the app, but it only shows BTC, eth, and LTC for me, and is fully up to date on Android :/
0	1525772118	2	Yeah, I also noticed a few hours ago that when I go to their charts page, it defaults to Bitcoin (BCH) >:)
0	1525794010	2	It's embarrassing that coinbase lists charlie lee pump and dump coin.  
0	1525776382	1	Those 4 charts are so similar
0	1525789100	1	Time for a lawsuit against Coinbase for “confusing the noobs” !!  😂🙄/s
0	1525798625	1	Alphabetical list of all there products. 
0	1525761442	1	Because it is widely known that the center of 4 elements is 2, lol’d.
1	1525788948	1	What was the point of that post? You literally said nothing.

2	1525775917	3	> Lmaooo Keep downvoting meOK
2	1525786051	2	Another scam lawsuit perpetrated by Core. Not only is it not legally defensible, but just like happened last time no one in your community is trustworthy enough to receive money.
2	1525788996	1	You actually come here, talk shit, and complain like a little baby that you’re getting down voted?
3	1525789209	0	I think it’s funny that you can’t see the truth tbh.It’s fine I’ll leave. I’m obviously not wanted here.
0	1525778851	-2	You're setting up to become just as bad as /r/bitcoin with these shitposts. Posts like these are so sad, and these constant attempts to "beat" BTC, make it seem more like desperate attempt from a losing side. The user/bot /u/trolldetectr, and the constant namecalling of anyone who disagrees, labeling them as "core-shills" or "core-trolls" is gonna lead to the same censorship currently present at /r/bitcoin.I pretty much consider myself an outside observer, and watching this whole BTC/BCH drama on reddit is like watching a pair of 10-year olds arguing.
1	1525780732	5	In the spirit of no censorship, Roger can post whatever he wants, you’re free to downvote his posts if you want
1	1525787907	5	It's crucially important that we wake people up to the attempt Blockstream made to hijack Bitcoin and the fact that we have a solution in Bitcoin Cash.
1	1525787411	-3	There is a gigantic difference between /r/Bitcoin and alt coin subs./r/Bitcoin has been bombarded with alt-coins, shit-coins, bitcoin forks, and crap for years.For years Bitcoiners have watched alt coins die, shitcoin pump and dumps, and bitcoin forks fail.. /r/bitcoin is a prime shilling ground and it was/is out of control./r/BTC is supporting an altcoin, so they are going to act like altcoiners who are obsessed with any news regarding their alt coin. Go on any alt coin subreddit, lots of koolaid.BCH supporters are rightfully upset because they bought into a coin that ended up tanking(vs BTC). As a result, they are doubling down and need to FUD Bitcoin and hype BCH. 
2	1525791004	4	Haven't been paying attention much have you?
0	1525771998	0	LCore. Lol 
0	1525772756	0	2nd in line...
1	1525775864	2	For now. . . 
0	1525769025	-4	I wish they would update their app so I can remove it.
1	1525803234	1	It's a post about the site
