0	1525755020	2	Why is it always 5000 ETH? Couldn't they at least make it marginally more plausible by mixing up their presentation from time to time and changing the number?

1	1525794482	1	I once read these scams are intentionally poorly written because they're not trying to fool everyone. They just need to lure a few people into opening the link and following the process, and by posting obvious scam messages, they increase their success rate of people who click the first link VS people who give them money.
