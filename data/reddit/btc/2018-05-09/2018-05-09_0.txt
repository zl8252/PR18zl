Even if someone steals the ball from me, I'll give you a new ball just like the original one.  As you gather more toys, bring those to me as well.  I'll securely store all of them for the same low fee and you can access your toys from any one of my thousands of toy boxes spread out around the region.
1	1525886278	22	I’m curious what fees people are talking about? I have a free checking and savings account. I don’t pay any fees to withdraw or deposit my money. I have a credit card through them that gives me rewards points for paying my bill on time.So in my situation I’m actually earning money by using a bank and they keep my money safe and insured...
2	1525886988	9	the risks/problems have definitely shifted, or 'abstracted away.' The fees are yes more or less gone for the average user \(although the lower class/low account balance/un\-banked populations, entirely different story\).What you are 'paying' though is the close to ZIRP \(0&#37; interest rates\). It wasn't too long ago 3\-5&#37; on a savings account was commonplace, but with sub\-1, or anything sub 2.5&#37;, you are paying a fee by your balance in your account depreciating by 2&#37; in purchasing power per year.And then the true abstracted fee you're paying is while your deposits in there are quite literally wasting away in savings \(although for now, folks are ok with the opportunity cost of security and access of emergency savings over inflation losses\), is that those banks are turning around and lending for decent returns \(fractional reserve banking\). It's what made bank runs so damaging, but the FDIC has largely solved that risk. To be fair, that bank\-lending is also limited due to the general low interest rate environment, but you are still very much paying a fee. However, that's the trade off.
2	1525887184	3	Different banks, different functions, different business model & overheads. Lots of no fee banking exists but they tend to offer little in terms of physical locations you can go to for assistance.
3	1525888062	3	This is a national chain bank
4	1525888914	1	Okay, what is it?
5	1525889492	1	I’d rather not say. But if you look at all the largest US banks you’ll find it’s pretty easy to set up a free checking and savings account. The catch is usually a minimum deposit amount or else they charge you
6	1525897242	1	So it's not free...
7	1525897971	1	It is if you have enough money. Usually like $500 for a savings and less for checking
5	1525898364	1	There are several huge international banks like that in Europe. In banking that bad in the US that this sounds unrealistic?
3	1525897564	1	USAA baby
2	1525890042	1	one word, 'privileged.'  Your situation is rare in the world, but not rare among the wealthiest.  Your deposit is part of the 9:1 reserve ratio (research "fractional-reserve banking"): you are an enabler of the banking industry, for which the bank (rightfully) is grateful.[transacting in fiat, is debt:](https://youtu.be/cuiGwpVjJcM)
3	1525890394	2	You’re right I am privileged. The bank makes it worth my time to use them, so as a consumer looking to find the best way to manage my wealth a bank is very useful. They also are one of the few people who would be willing to give me a loan for buying a house with a minimal down payment and low interest rate. If crypto was as easy and beneficial as a bank to me for every day spending needs I would switch. But currently it’s not there and probably will never offer the same services. I understand this isn’t the same everywhere in the world and crypto is way more beneficial to other people. I’m just sharing my experience, which is common among middle class Americans 
4	1525891474	2	I totally get it; Really, I do.  But the writing is on the wall; U.S. currency, while enjoying its place as the global de facto trading mechanism in unstable economies, will be displaced by an even more stable currency of precise, finite supply; i.e. Bitcoin.   This will cause a decay in the U.S. banking industry, and the amenities they offer to the middle-class will recede to upper-classes.  But, I get it; you appreciate the current benefit-levels offered by your loan servicer; and are wise to defend it, and them.
5	1525891837	1	Yup. And once they take away the benefits then I’ll switch to another method
2	1525890670	1	what stonecipheco is saying is that indidious but low 2% / year compounded over your lifetime wipes your lifesavings and solid retirement all into the banks pocket.  life is actually easy when you cut out the parasites.If you put $1,000 / year into an account at 0% return / year for 60 years in a currency with the standard 2% inflation minimum target, you will have $60,000 but only $34,000 in value because of the inflation.If you put $1,000 / year into an account at 2% return / year compounded for 60 years in a currency with the standard 2% inflation minimum target, you will have $116,000 but $60,000 in value after inflation.If you put $1,000 / year into an account at 2% / year in a hard currency with no inflation for 60 years, you will have $116,000 in name and also $116,000 in value as well.but sure, keeping your savings at the bank is "free".
3	1525891764	1	What’s a “hard” currency?I don’t keep much in my savings. Only enough to cover emergencies. The rest are in crypto, properties, and stocks. Those make me enough I don’t worry about the tiny losses from my savings account because the ease of access is worth it
4	1525892376	2	Yeah, this is that way to do it. However, some people keep a huge amount of their wealth in savings accounts, with little investments. Obviously these people are a bit misinformed (they probably thing investments are “risky”) and keep their money there because they know they won’t lose any.... but they are losing 2%, year over year 
5	1525894958	1	Yep. I always forget not everyone learned basic economics and personal finance growing up. 
2	1525893374	1	You are actually paying "fees" they just aren't apparent ones.  They take your money in your account and lend it to others to buy stuff.  They make a certain percentage on that loan.  That is the fee.  Even if you are paid interest they make more then they give you.  So you are loosing what you could be making if you lent the money directly.  Know any rich people?  Bet they have some direct loans to local businesses.  
3	1525895145	2	That’s not a fee... I don’t keep enough in my savings account that it would make sense to lend out myself. All of the money in my savings account I need immediate access to Incase of emergencies. That wouldn’t be possible if i lent it out myself. The bank is offering me a service and in exchange I allow them to lend my money as long as they promise they can cash out my savings account whenever I need it.  
1	1525885679	1	But then when everyone wants all the balls...
2	1525895202	1	This is the scam. The bank started loaning out balls that belonged to other people. There are more people who think they have balls then there are balls. 
1	1525887039	1	Almost liking banking services provide people with ease of use, convenience & piece of mind. Why people attack traditional banking when comparing to crypto I don't know. Banking has it's issues I know, but it provides things crypto never could. Crypto is not a replacement to traditional banking, it is meant to supplement it as an alternative route for certain functions.
2	1525888565	4	Yep, people love to circle jerk and attack banks generally, but really only the central bank is the issue. Banking itself is a time-tested demand that will always exist. Not everyone wants to be their own bank, and so when grandma wants to open a bitcoin checking account with Wells Fargo and let WF control her wallet and loan out the Bitcoin for interest, there is a value add where grandma is either getting (1) convenience and/or (2) interest. BANKING itself is not the evil. It’s **Central** Banking - or, more specifically, the unique ability of a Central Bank to mint.
3	1525892715	1	Are you aware that central banks actually almost do not mint anything? Fractional reserve system makes commercial banks the biggest minters. In the worst (or best, up to your point of view) case on every 10K deposit they can mint up to 100K of new money. Tenfold!

0	1525887570	4	And if your ball isn't big enough, we're going to charge you even more
1	1525889106	3	Was going to mention this. Such a BS thing that banks do. “You need $500 minimum. If you are poor, we’re going to make sure you are poorer. Overdraft $1? Let’s make sure we take $37 for every time this happens. It will make sure you stay poor”. And my favorite “overdraft $1. $37 charge. ‘Automatic monthly deposit to overdraft account’, $37 charge for overdrafting”. College was fun >.<
0	1525888464	5	**Capitalism died in 2008**. The economy literally went bankrupt and the working people saved it with their money being funneled by the hand of the government without which the economy would have halted, proving the capitalistic economical model in the USA has been inherently based on taking money from the working people and handing it to the very rich. What the business papers call "crisis" are really a mass transfer of wealth. The investment banks get unlimited credit to gamble with people's money with which they buy assets to sell for profit until they fail for whatever reason and then lose only "their" assets (not their own money) and it all restarts again.Historic Fun Fact: Satoshi included in the genesis block the news title of the 2008 bank bail out.
1	1525889580	2	Thanks Obama

4	1525894425	1	>before he got elected from his secret Kenyan Muslim terrorist breeding ground?Actually, it was during a witch doctor ceremony.  He was covered in dirt, wearing a loin cloth, and had a bone piercing in his nose.  It all took place in Kenya (where he was born).  He killed a live chicken and drank it's blood while prancing around yelling "OOGA BOOGA!  ME KILL WHITE MAN!"
1	1525894617	2	straight from the federal reserve's very own statistics: https://alfred.stlouisfed.org/graph/alfredgraph.png?g=jN3oIt's not that Bitcoin is going up; It's that U.S. money is down.

0	1525892830	3	Banking is not inherently bad. Having a central bank that can print money is bad. 
1	1525894588	2	90% or more of all money is 'printed' by banks. Whenever someone is willing to go into debt, the bank 'prints' the money.
2	1525895412	1	Not really. If somebody wants to go into Dept, the bank will give them the companies money.
3	1525896651	1	If you want to buy a house, the bank creates that money by a corresponding accounting record.
0	1525888247	2	Except the most important benefit of banking is it drives growth by giving out loans, artificially increasing money supply temporarily. Banks are still useful guys. 
1	1525891667	2	Allienation. 
0	1525895157	1	The dollar is a scam coin.
0	1525895518	1	Excellent analogy..
0	1525888239	0	Not how banking works. If anything she's giving him a fee for holding onto the ball (interest) while lending the ball out to other kids. Granted, she's also lending out 50 other balls she created ex nihilio but analogies only go so far. 
1	1525889672	2	Interest? Where?And.... if so.... above the rate of monetary inflation?
1	1525894657	1	> Granted, she's also lending out 50 other balls she created ex nihilio but analogies only go so far. Banks cannot create credit ex nihilo. 
0	1525891173	0	 ICOs allow you to earn money very easily though you have to be confident in an ICO you rely on. For me that is FTEC. I buy and sell currencies there and for doing that I get my money. It’s not complicated at all. So here’s the link for you:  [https://ftec.ai/?utm\_source=reddit](https://ftec.ai/?utm_source=reddit) 
0	1525892487	0	this is bank networking.Every bank offers diferent product at different interest and facility
0	1525886694	-1	Sounds like all forms of money, ever, including crypto. There's no such thing as a free lunch.
1	1525889863	1	I think you mean all forms of banking. Money does not require banking. It is just likely to emerge in any market.Not that there's anything wrong with banking necessarily. It's a valuable service. The problem is when they get in bed with government and lose all accountability from their customers.
