0	1525833333	28	> Liberty means responsibility. That is why most men dread it.> -George Bernard Shaw[Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/) IS an innovation that likely can only be matched in our lifetime by the invention/use of the Internet itself-and in fact P2P Cash likely will exceed it in terms of disruption to the lives of most on the planet-for the better!It is therefore quite normal for MANY to resist it with every fiber of their being! Reason and logic cannot/will not sway everyone... at least in the early adopter phases... **In time we WILL come to wonder how we survived before [Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash!](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/)**
1	1525858820	2	People said the Internet and the digital revolution were going to be a great democratic force but so far it looks like the future will be more [like Minority Report](https://youtu.be/aE1kA0Jy0Xg?t=262).Sure, people can use the tech to empower themselves but the state and the bad guys ("Evil Corp") are better at it and far more determined.
2	1525870928	3	It all comes down to the fact that most people want someone else to take on the responsibility of their lives.  Hence the quote above.~~Bitcoin was originally engineered to not only make use of that fact and general , but take advantage of it.  Which is why it has succeeded way beyond my expectations back in 2009.~~EDIT:  Upon reading it again... I don't think I got this part right..   so ignore it for now.And to more directly respond to your comment...  I don't know how many people said it would be more "democratic" or not...   but it has definitely had a huge liberating affect.  While not always mainstream, the things we can now do as individuals has drastically changed for the better.This subject deserves a very long article, but I won't be writing it. ;]

2	1525880953	1	Huge part of it is people's willingness to put up with it. Like if you take a look at Chinese surveillance thing you've linked - it's because people of China allow themselves to be held hostage to government that gets waiver to do whatever it wants.On the other hand, in practice you likely see it more as "choosing lesser evil". Like we see in BTC vs BCH case - you practically need to choose between figures like Greg Maxwell and Roger Ver. I dislike both of them, but somehow them as extremists are the ones that end up pushing prospective narratives. So you end up needing to choose between: - Small blocks and BCASH BCASH - "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin", Bitcoin (BCH)Both choices are very stupid... but try not picking one of them and then you'll be under fire from both dominant camps. Doesn't have to do so much with what Roger is saying about "psychologically incapable of disobedience"... but it's more practical stance of "I can't make enough of difference, so I won't bother".

And if no perfect solution exists they seem ok with inaction, even if that puts bitcoin at risk.They seem to have a strong belief that bitcoin will not be able to scale long term, and any block size increase is a slippery slope to a future that they are unwilling to allow.”“Even though core says they are ok with a hard fork to 2MB (they have it on their own roadmap, just very far in the future), they refuse to prioritize it. They prefer to withhold something that could help the network now, because they don’t trust the community to make educated decisions in the future. “They view themselves as the central planners of the network, and protectors of the people. They seem ok with watching bitcoin fail, as long as they don’t compromise on their principles.”https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf

1	1525849412	2	To me the two different approaches are summed up by this statement.One group says: the people serve the codeThe other group says: the code serves the people. You can see this also with Ethereum Classic: ETC people believed that the people serve the code. Vitalik and the Ethereum team said: that's not why we invented Ethereum. The code serves the people. Same with Bitcoin Cash: we belief the code is suppose to serve us not the other way around. 
2	1525866336	2	> The code serves the peopleYou do realize what you are saying here correct? The moment a Blockchain becomes mutable to democratic demand is the moment it ceases to exist.
3	1525874243	1	Code that would change all the time would not serve the people.Code that can absolutely never change would also not serve the people.What are the ends here and what are the means? And btw the blockchain is not code, it's the output of the code. 
3	1525877176	1	Huh? The point of consensus is being mutable by democracy and *nothing else*.

1	1525862903	-2	> Agreed!I agree as well! Which is why I never question Roger Ver's excellent opinions in this subreddit. It's also why, when I see Roger say something completely illogical like for example that storing seed words in plaintext "isn't a security issue", I simply assume there must be something wrong with logic, or with my brain, and when Roger ad-hominem insults me for mentioning anything completely illogical that he has said, I accept the accompanying totally-plausible 50-odd instant downvotes with humility and grace.

1	1525834041	21	Huge Libertarian and big fan of yours, Roger. I agree, Bitcoin is a Libertarian dream come true. If taxation is theft, cryptocurrency makes it that much harder for oppressive regimes to steal their citizens' hard-earned wealth. We're already seeing massive crypto adoption in places like Venezuela where the socialst regime has failed the people to the point of their currency being worth less than World of Warcraft gold.
2	1525853244	-9	Taxation is theft is not a motto of libertarians. You’re ancap, stop trying to appropriate a less fringe name for your fringe ideology.
3	1525859166	11	'Libertarian' was coined to mean anarchist. Stop appropriating our terms.Also logic states that taxation is theft. Sorry bud, but it is.
4	1525864282	-11	If you dont like to pay tax, theres a perfectly fine spot in the middle of the ocean where you are free to make your money without paying taxes. That you choose to stay whereever you are is your own problem, but dont call the rules you chose to live under theft.
5	1525864405	8	>  but dont call the rules you chose to live under theft.That's a funny way of supporting slavery
6	1525866691	-7	Huh... I didn't know slavery included being free to leave your "master".
7	1525869176	2	I didn't know that I could claim that I am not a slave owner if I get my neighbors to agree to do worse shit to my 'indentured servants' should they choose to escape.Hmm...
8	1525873007	-2	I dont think you know what slavery is, abd if you consider yourself a slave you are insulting people subjected to real slavery. If you really feel like a slave, leave. Sail into the ocean for your freeeeeedooooom.
9	1525875942	2	**The Tale of the Slave***By Robert Nozick.**From Anarchy, State, and Utopia, 290-292 (1974), winner of a National Book Award in 1975*"Consider the following sequence of cases... and imagine it is about you.There is a slave completely at the mercy of his brutal master's whims. He often is cruelly beaten, called out in the middle of the night, and so on.The master is kindlier and beats the slave only for stated infractions of his rules (not fulfilling the work quota, and so on). He gives the slave some free time.The master has a group of slaves, and he decides how things are to be allocated among them on nice grounds, taking into account their needs, merit, and so on.The master allows his slaves four days on their own and requires them to work only three days a week on his land. The rest of the time is their own.The master allows his slaves to go off and work in the city (or anywhere they wish) for wages. He requires only that they send back to him three-sevenths of their wages. He also retains the power to recall them to the plantation if some emergency threatens his land; and to raise or lower the three-sevenths amount required to be turned over to him. He further retains the right to restrict the slaves from participating in certain dangerous activities that threaten his financial return, for example, mountain climbing, cigarette smoking.The master allows all of his 10,000 slaves, except you, to vote, and the joint decision is made by all of them. There is open discussion, and so forth, among them, and they have the power to determine to what uses to put whatever percentage of your (and their) earnings they decide to take; what activities legitimately may be forbidden to you, and so on.*     *    *Though still not having the vote, you are at liberty (and are given the right) to enter into the discussions of the 10,000, to try to persuade them to adopt various policies and to treat you and themselves in a certain way. They then go off to vote to decide upon policies covering the vast range of their powers.In appreciation of your useful contributions to discussion, the 10,000 allow you to vote if they are deadlocked; they commit themselves to this procedure. After the discussion you mark your vote on a slip of paper, and they go off and vote. In the eventuality that they divide evenly on some issue, 5,000 for and 5,000 against, they look at your ballot and count it in. This has never yet happened; they have never yet had occasion to open your ballot. (A single master also might commit himself to letting his slave decide any issue concerning him about which he, the master, was absolutely indifferent.)They throw your vote in with theirs. If they are exactly tied your vote carries the issue. Otherwise it makes no difference to the electoral outcome.The question is: which transition from case 1 to case 9 made it no longer the tale of a slave?"

6	1525868191	1	Anywhere 200 nautical miles from the coast more or less.
7	1525870765	2	Try imagining a world where you don't **need** to travel 200 miles off the coast in order to enjoy freedom

8	1525875940	0	You can imagine any perfect world you want. That doesnt make taxation theft *in the world we live in now*.
9	1525879409	1	It's theft because it's taken by force, against your will, with or without your consent. If it were voluntary, I would be inclined to agree with you. But the fact that you are not able to opt out of the system (opt out of taxation AND give up access to all government services. You would then have to pay for everything on your own.)**That this is not an option, is how you know there is something very, very wrong with the system.** 
7	1525871642	1	I don't know about other countries...  but if you are an American, you are expected to still pay income taxes every year even if you have been living beyond its borders.
3	1525888832	1	I never said it was anyone's motto. It is something Libertarian people say quite often, though. I mean shit, here's a [T-shirt](https://lpstore.org/product/taxation-is-theft-t-shirt/) they're selling in their store with those exact words on it. Head over to /r/libertarian and see how many times you can find "taxation is theft."
4	1525890538	0	Sure, there are whole bunch of libertarians that believe it. They just like the term and don’t understand what it means.
0	1525829586	25	It's not just obedience to perceived authority but to perceived peer pressure as well. That Blockstream is pursuing a strategy that benefits the bankers is trivial to grasp intellectually. But to suggest that same idea in public exposes one to mockery from one's peers which makes the same idea very difficult to understand. God forbid you are called a conspiracy theorist!

2	1525844174	6	“Ultimately, the Luciferian plan is to enslave the masses. Humanity is the victim of an occult conspiracy of monstrous proportions.” – Henry Makow“The inexplicable part is our great reluctance to look reality in the face and at least make some plans for what promises to be one of the greatest economic and political discontinuities of all time. Time is of the essence. It is later than you think.” – Colin J. Campbell“As the history of Standard Oil by any author, pro or con, clearly shows, Rockefeller was of a deeply conspiratorial, scheming nature, always planning years ahead with a clarity of vision that went far beyond anything any of his associates had to offer.” – Ferdinand Lundberg“The faster the present generation draws down the fossil energy legacy upon which persistently exuberant lifestyles now depend, the less opportunity posterity will have to live in anything like the same way or the same numbers.  Yet most contemporary political proposals for solving problems of economic stagnation or inequity amount to plans for speeding up the rate of drawdown of non-renewable resources.” – William R Catton, Jr“I think people ought to just think about the consequence of having someone like Bush in the White House and the danger for the future that these sort of individuals pose. This is not just a historical event of the past. This is part of the plan and the camera is still rolling. They have an agenda. These individuals are extremely dangerous. They are armed and dangerous. They pose a clear and dangerous threat to every freedom-loving person not only American but in the whole world.” – Stanley Hilton

1	1525828581	29	Anarcho Capitalist.  Unfortunately some people calling themselves anarchists like to wear black masks and throw bricks through windows of peaceful businesses that are serving happy customers. That’s why it can be useful to distinguish between an Anarcho-capitalists, and Anarcho-communists, or other flavors of fake anarchists.
2	1525833078	13	Thx for the explanation. I guess that makes me an AnCap, too.
3	1525834263	6	Greetings fellow abolitionist!
4	1525852474	3	I really like this word for use in this context. Taxation is not only theft, for those unable to escape it long term it is also slavery.I am also a proud abolitionist./u/chaintip

5	1525873082	2	Wow-I thank you!I learned of this more recent use of the term *abolitionist* from Bill Buppert and his site [ZeroGov](http://zerogov.com/). I couldnt find where he first discusses why he uses it  (may have been on a podcast), but this [article](http://zerogov.com/?p=1781) is close and is specific to the taxation/theft issue as you so rightly mention! Buppert's [about](http://zerogov.com/?page_id=3020) page is a good condensation of his thought processes. There are a LOT of gems there!Greetings fellow abolitionist!
2	1525830977	3	> Unfortunately some people calling themselves anarchists like to wear black masks and throw bricks through windows of peaceful businesses that are serving happy customersAre these brick throwers calling themselves anarchists? Or is it just Dino-Media calling them anarchists to discredit the name/word?My definition of anarchy: **No Rulers!**And in no way do I associate myself with brick throwers or other violent (non-defensive) behavior...
3	1525833931	10	It's both. There are people who call themselves anarchists because they hate the state and feel the people should be in charge. Not in charge of themselves, but in charge of their workplace and ultimately society. They fail to realize that means they aren't against the state - they just want to BE the state.
4	1525834126	6	> They fail to realize that means they aren't against the state - they just want to BE the state.Agreed!*THEY* want to control the GUNS!
4	1525854745	0	Says they hate the state, and refuse to pay taxes, but thenExpects to be provided with water, sewage, garbage handling, road maintenance, a power grid, fire department, etc etc."sovereign citizens" are also super funny. "Your laws don't apply to me, so you cannot arrest me". Bitch, if they don't apply to you, then neither do they protect you, and to you, I'm just a dude with a gun, and can toss your ass in jail forever
5	1525860881	3	> Expects to be provided with water, sewage, garbage handling, road maintenance, a power grid, fire department, etc etc.I don't if I could get all of my stolen money back.
5	1525867945	2	>Expects to be provided with water, sewage, garbage handling, road maintenance, a power grid, fire department, etc etc.Yeah, not really. I'd rather pay private contractors for those services on an as-needed basis instead of having my money stolen from me in order to be provided with shitty subpar infradtructure and "public servants" who can't get over their own egos.>"sovereign citizens" are also super funny. "Your laws don't apply to me, so you cannot arrest me"What's funny is believing that the state/law is on your side. It's been designed from the ground up to give the state as much leverage as possible so the best approach is to not get caught up in that system in the first place.>I'm just a dude with a gun, and can toss your ass in jail foreverBut maybe I'm also a dude with a gun, and you'll have to take it away first. Now is it worth the risk to you just to put someone in a cage for not agreeing with you? Is that even a moral action in your view?
6	1525869028	1	> I'd rather pay private contractors for those services on an as-needed basisWould you really? Just like you prefer to go bankrupt on medical bills in the case where you get really sick?> What's funny is believing that the state/law is on your side.Like, why do we even have minimum wage laws, traffic speed limits, self defense laws... Nothing in that book work in your favor ever?> But maybe I'm also a dude with a gun, and you'll have to take it away first.> Now is it worth the risk to you just to put someone in a cage for not agreeing with you? Is that even a moral action in your view?Take a look at the people killed by cops/cops killed by people ratio. Is that a risk *you* would be willing to take? Everyone believes they are the ones to win The Purge. You're not John McClaine, you dead.The context here is that you already did something to warrant an arrest, but refuse because "sovereign". 
7	1525871643	1	>Would you really? Just like you prefer to go bankrupt on medical bills in the case where you get really sick?Medical care is not a right. I don't have a right to force anyone to work for me. That's called slavery.>Like, why do we even have minimum wage laws, traffic speed limits, self defense laws... Nothing in that book work in your favor ever?Minimum wage laws keep people poor, traffic laws make drivers complacent and the roads less safe, and I'm not sure what you're referring to with self defense laws because no, they typically don't work out in the defendant's favor because people like you don't believe in the natural right of self-defense.>Take a look at the people killed by cops/cops killed by people ratio. Is that a risk *you* would be willing to take?Well I guess it really depends on the situation. All I know is I'm not gonna put my fate in the hands of a judge who works for the state when I haven't done anything to harm anyone.What you seem to be implying is that if a cop is arresting someone, it must be for a good reason and therefore justified and any attempt to resist should be met with deadly force.>The context here is that you already did something to warrant an arrest, but refuse because "sovereign". You need to be more specific. "Did something to warrant an arrest" is not enough to determine whether an arrest is justified. Cops frequently abuse their power and arrest people for petty "crimes" just to fuel their egomania. It's not about being "sovereign", it's about living in a world where we are all free and equal human beings who don't abuse each other for petty reasons.
7	1525872161	1	> medical billsThe major problem with this argument is that the reason why healthcare in the US is so expensive is BECAUSE we don't have a free market system. So yeah...if we had anarchy and a true free market, healthcare would be affordable

2	1525840780	2	Anarcho Capitalism and Anarcho Communism are utopias. There is no such thing as a **society** without rulers. Self-sufficiency is only possible for nuclear Dunbar communities. Those self-sufficient **communities** of the paleolithicum  have been destroyed 10'000 years ago by organized violence and **societies** emerged. **Patriarchy (church and state) replaced anarchy**. 
3	1525851473	9	It's hardly utopian to believe that free competition between producers of goods and services, no matter what they are, will lead to increased efficiency.It's also not utopian to imagine that one day technology may allow societies to route around the State, in the very long run.
4	1525865299	1	> It's also not utopian to imagine that one day technology may allow societies to route around the State, in the very long run.In the very long rung societies always collapsed. Societies are ponzi schemes. That's the difference to the self-sufficient, stateless communities that dont trade, because they are self-sufficient. 
4	1525853754	1	In the long run, it is very utopian. It only works in the short term, when the actors are small and many. Over time, the larger ones will merge, and force out the small actors, creating a monopoly with fixed inflated prices.See: Comcast
5	1525853991	3	Are you seriously using a corporation like Comcast as an example of a firm in a free market?
6	1525857419	1	You kind of underlined my point.Comcast didn't just out of nowhere take over the market like they did. Short term, no regulation, that works. In the beginning, Comcast were in competition with others. Long term, they took over.Yeah, the state in this case double failed. First, by not regulating competition and monopolies, then again by taking bribes from the big ones.Look at any huge business with too much power. They all have one thing in common. They were once small, part of a free market with competition.
7	1525860676	1	No you are wrong.They were granted a monopoly. All of the cable companies were.Free markets don't create monopolists, but destroy them.
8	1525865499	1	> Free markets don't create monopolists, but destroy them.A 'free market' is an oxymoron.

7	1525872355	1	They wouldn't have been able to do that without the help of government. **monopolies are not possible in a true free market.** 
5	1525859888	1	This has been of recent concern to me.  I am beginning to feel like centralization and monopolies are too inevitable.  I am worrying that me supporting Bitcoin/crypto may be doing more bad than good.  I am beginning to feel like I’m not breaking down the current, broken system and handing it back to the people (what I thought when I began).  I now wonder if I’m just taking power from current governments and handing it over to new powers to be (Bitmain and other large crypto corps).  As much as I dislike my government and the current broken system I’m not sure I trust Bitmain and the likes to become my new ruler.  Both don’t sound good to me but at least I know what I’m getting with the current system.

0	1525829957	18	I wonder if this has anything to do with most miners being Asian particularly Chinese. My feeling is the confucian attitude permeates their culture that they are obedient to authority to a fault. It explains why communism has lasted so long their unlike in western countries.I don't mean to offend anyone I respect the Chinese and oriental cultures but this is an aspect that had led to millions of them being subject to ruthless efficient abuse with very little complaint.Edit. I know I'm simplifying this quite a lot and the fall of communism in Eastern Europe was due to them running out of money and being already industrialised while China was largely an agricultural economy and they could industrialise while holding on to power. 
1	1525832976	12	Mike said that he thought of this as well but the US miners were no different. Edit; not just US miners.

2	1525843261	4	I reckon they were really afraid of a chain split, which was supposed to be the end of the world at the time. And under that assumption I guess they were being actually rational when they tried to exhaust all the possible ways of getting Core to be the ones increasing the limit  (NY agreement, right?)
2	1525835581	1	That's interesting. Where did he say that? Did he elaborate on this at all?

1	1525831662	2	Yes I hear the "chinese miners" brought up all the time ignoring the fact that they are the same miners that mine BTC and the same chip making plants that make ASIC and GPU chips... Are there any production plants in the west that make GPUs or ASICS now?
2	1525832187	4	There are, AMD's GPUs are made in Malta, NY.  The problem is that Intel and AMD\(GloFo\) make consumer computer products, with higher margins than ASIC mining chips.  Perhaps when there is more capacity they will, but not now.  The reason TSMC makes most of the chips, is because they have more of a mobile\-centric foundry business that goes for higher volume parts over higher margins.  The current technology node for leading edge applications is quite expensive, and space is limited, however, all of the major foundries are expanding.
3	1525834947	2	I was under the impression that after AMD spun off GloFo they moved all production overseas. But you are right they still have [3 out of 10 plants in the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlobalFoundries) I stand corrected. I do not however see any of the major players moving production/starting a new plant to the US just to keep bitcoin mining out of the hands of the Chinese.
4	1525843473	1	I think you are correct in that assumption, mining chips are low priority for the industry as a whole, unfortunately.  The demand for these facilities is just too high, and I don't think that if magically two more fabs were built in the US that they could be tooled and staffed with enough machines and people with the expertise to begin production very soon.   Bitmain got in with TSMC at the perfect time, just before the last two big process node jumps, and kept them full during the 2015-2016 slowdown, when everyone else was laying off workers.  China is the go-to place for lower margin chips for the foreseeable future.
5	1525843775	1	So with that in mind, how does that play to the "evil Chinese miner" narrative? Won't the Chinese have an advantage whether they are making asics or gpus?
0	1525833245	5	And a major difference between BTC and BCH is that BCH has decentralized authority (multiple dev teams). This is different even psychologically from having one central authority group. 
1	1525844528	3	How is the [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political%29) spread?  Who has the most influence?I see herd behaviour giving misplaced legitimacy to Blockstream.
2	1525844539	1	**Power (social and political)**In social science and politics, power is the ability to influence or outright control the behaviour of people. The term "authority" is often used for power perceived as legitimate by the social structure. Power can be seen as evil or unjust, but the exercise of power is accepted as endemic to humans as social beings. In business, power is often expressed as being "upward" or "downward".***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
0	1525839177	5	The reason (as a Libertarian) I love Bitcoin is the same reason I love Bitcoin(Cash). 
1	1525851893	0	Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. BTC is something else since the introduction of fundamental changes to the network design like permanent block-size caps and the detachment of digital signatures.
2	1525856177	2	BTC is also Bitcoin, just a crippled one
0	1525829752	8	So convincing people to be pro-BCH/anti-Core may be as hard as convincing the general population to be pro-anarchy/anti-State? This may be harder than I initially thought...
1	1525831693	7	They don't need to be pro-BCH/anti-Core to adopt BCH if it turns out to be in their best interest to do so.  Beliefs may follow actions, rather than the other way around.  In fact the theory of cognitive dissonance suggests this is probably often the case.
2	1525831952	3	In all seriousness, the economic advantages of using BCH over BTC should be very convincing to both businesses and customers. Even companies that decide to add BTC as a payment option due to its popularity always add other crypto options, such as how reddit is adding not only BTC support but also ETH and LTC. It's as if BTC can't stand on its own.
3	1525836496	3	It can stand on its own just fine...up to 5 txs/s.
1	1525831528	4	By definition, many are part of the [Late Majority or Laggards of new tech innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle#/media/File:DiffusionOfInnovation.png). Some just cant/wont make a change (adoption) until the majority already have. Which makes them followers...
1	1525856145	1	> So convincing people to be pro-BCH/anti-CoreNot needed really. Absolute majority of people won't care, they will adopt what works
0	1525828872	3	How do you think you can help change the minds of ALL people when some are so fully rooted in their beliefs or some who, simply, just don’t understand the significance of what Bitcoin BCH is?
1	1525829398	11	He doesn't need to. Bitcoin got mountains of negative publicity for years and just kept going up in price and adoption anyway. The same will happen with BCH for the same reasons. Only this time it will be faster and with more of the environment already in place.
2	1525829556	2	But there will be some who consider Bitcoin BCH a ponzi scheme or rat poison, are you saying that’s good for BCH adoption?
3	1525830179	5	Those are great key words put out there, more than enough for people to become curious and eventually sucked into their own research. I am an example of someone who formed their own opinion based on the curiousity that became mildly obsessive research, all sparked by negativity. 
4	1525830339	1	sadly the vast majority of people are closed minded and will never even start to discover the truth that Bitcoin BCH is the real Bitcoin.
5	1525831760	2	> sadly the vast majority of people are closed minded and will never even start to discover the truth that Bitcoin BCH is the real Bitcoin.Just a matter of time. Even if they are [Laggards](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/DiffusionOfInnovation.png), it will happen!
5	1525831415	1	See I have a mildly ridiculous view on the entire controversy at hand. Truthfully, I think that BTC is the original Bitcoin simply because it had the bigger community and higher following than BCH, and the hardfork left us with what we have. That being said, I truthfully thing that BCH aligns with the original vision drastically closer than BTC in its current state, and that BTC is a business. However again, my opinion was formed following the initial listing on coinbase, where I got my first BCH, and after much scrutiny did not sell, and just held onto my coins for awhile. Unfortunately, I did end up selling most of my BTC recently, for BCH. It’s taken awhile for me to form the opinion that I have, however I got into this for the decentralization, not business. 
3	1525873175	1	I'm saying it doesn't matter.
0	1525839022	2	As you have said a million times before, the name is Bitcoin Cash.  
0	1525842769	2	Mining is physical, not virtual. It is in the reality but not in the dream. Miners need to pay a lot in Fiats every month. They are the one who need to deal with all stupid government regulations and oppression everyday. We have to put a lot of resources in risk and not be paid much. We are the one who secure the network and allow the service running.  We need more respects from the community. We want to see business leaders and developers communicate instead of fighting for their egos and focus to serve to our users (customers).  I am fxxking tired to see that the community is doing nothing to fix the usability problems of stupid address formats.  Some of BCH users still can't even send money to other BCH wallets. Eg. Jaxx to coinbase or Exodus to Bitpay... We can improve hundreds of things without fighting. We just need to focus to serve our users.
1	1525854469	-2	Bcash is an ego fest with corporate leaders. There are no developers. It's centralized and no one else can get in.Maybe if bcash had a few developers you'd be ok to ask for this, but they are failing to gain support because it is a centralized bankster controlled 'crypto'.If you are a miner, you aught to mine the real Bitcoin BTC.Sorry if this hurts, because you believe the lies put out by the bcash overlords, but it's your hash power. Educate yourself.
2	1525861158	3	Projecting much?
2	1525873967	2	Sorry to say that but the BTC community is the worst one regarding about ego driven developers and businesses. Because of the BTC ego driven developers and businesses ignore useability, feedback from its users, BTC is useless as cash thus the worst crypto in my opinion.But I don't go r/Bitcoin to say that. Because I don't care. Because I don't use BTC. Because it is unusable for my business. I can't wait a week confirmation to pay electricity or pay to my investers. I can't afford tens of dollar for transaction fees. Yeah it is not always, but I can't take a risk like that for my business. If you don't like BItcoin cash, just don't use and /or don't come here. Don't waste your time. Just use one you like even if it potentialy costs you tens of dollar to transact and one week of the confirmation time. If you are happy with that, I have nothing to say to you. Every one has rights to waste your money. So Please go away. Don't come back. 
3	1525895288	1	Sorry you are so butt hurt, but it is r/btc, not r/bcash. If it was r/bcash, i wouldn't visit.However, it is my duty to inform noobs who are not aware of the bcash delusion happening here on r/btc that bcash is a scam and has absolutely nothing to do with btcAs much as I'd like to answer every one of these braindead comments, your sub is so heavily censored that i can only post the truth every 10 minutes. I don't have that kind of time. I'm not like you, i din't get paid to shill all day long. I actually have a life. I recommend it. Get a real job, do something productive for christ sake. Taking JP Morgan's money for shilling bcash as if it was bitcoin or even a decentralized alt coin will lead you no where. They are eating your life.Believe me, i wouldn't come here if you butthurt bcash shills had your own r/bcash sub.Oh.... But then you couldn't pretend to be bitcoin, now could you?But i guess a job is a job and you twats are carrying out your shilling directives from your overlords.Sad pathetic sellouts.
0	1525838537	2	Is it me or are you taking a swipe at jihan wu and the other chinese miners? *grabs popcorn*
1	1525841563	6	No.  I'm complaining about all the people in the world who won't think for themselves.  Jihan Wu has been one of those willing to think for themselves the most.  
2	1525845118	1	Maybe they learned not to think through for themselves when they were young; taught to follow instead.  Maybe you believe state government schooling indoctrinates this or deliberately fail to teach adequate critical analysis and reasoning.  Do Anarcho Capitalists have ideas for better education systems for learning?
2	1525856719	1	But isn't this a *feature* of the split now, that it actually "forces" folks to think for themselves?Being *able* to pick and choose between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash also means *having* to consider this choice when dealing with crypto at all.For a moment, I was *pretty pissed* at all of the big block miners when S2X failed. Now I understand it simply as a different approach to deal with it. I am not 100% sure a confrontational approach instead of a "use the enemy's force against him" wouldn't have been better, but the die is cast. Stereotyping a bit, I see this a bit as some sort of eastern martial arts move vs. the use of brute force.One definite upside is that "crypto investors" have to actually think now whether on-chain scaling makes sense, and miners have to think hard about which coin to mine and to sell or keep.And if the selfmade Bitcoin Core box is as airtight and inescapable as it more and more appears to be, leading to eventual fermentation and decay for that coin - then we really just have to push BCH forward and keep on building.
2	1525874393	1	Or the most of miners don't speak English as much as you do and couldn't understand the situation? 
0	1525831179	2	Hey roger great post. Didn’t even realize it was you until I finished reading it. I agree 100%. Fuck authority!
1	1525844750	1	What if authority is reasonable?  What if you agree with an authorisation?  Can't we learn from authoritarian mistakes?
2	1525861411	2	>Does it follow that I reject all authority? Far from me such a thought. In the matter of boots, I refer to the authority of the bootmaker; concerning houses, canals, or railroads, I consult that of the architect or the engineer. For such or such special knowledge I apply to such or such a savant. But I allow neither the bootmaker nor the architect nor the savant to impose his authority upon me. I listen to them freely and with all the respect merited by their intelligence, their character, their knowledge, reserving always my incontestable right of criticism and censure. I do not content myself with consulting a single authority in any special branch; I consult several; I compare their opinions, and choose that which seems to me the soundest. But I recognise no infallible authority, even in special questions; consequently, whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such an individual, I have no absolute faith in any person. Such a faith would be fatal to my reason, to my liberty, and even to the success of my undertakings; it would immediately transform me into a stupid slave, an instrument of the will and interests of others.- Mikhail Bakunin
3	1525864941	1	Thanks for that. Core supporters should understand their lack of recognition of infallible authority is risky.
0	1525831469	2	Excellent points.> This is why I'm proud to be an AnCap, and why I'm proud to support Bitcoin BCH.Me too.And I like calling it Bitcoin BCH.  Bothers some perceived authorities. :)
0	1525833731	1	Testify
0	1525840478	1	>The vast majority of ALL PEOPLE are psychologically incapable of disobedience to perceived authority.I don't think that's true. I think the problem is simply *education*. First, can we start with a fundamental truth? ALL people are basically the same. It doesn't matter what geographic area you happened to be born in, or its climate which likely determines what skin pigmentation your ancestry happens to have. The family of *humans* has a natural aversion to violence. Period. On to the next step. If people want to be peaceful what else do they want? Probably to be constructive. Probably also to be *free*. I think *that's* what's true of the vast majority of people.And when left to their own devices, and having a tool to efficiently trade skills and goods (money) we see people do in fact prosper. In fact they live longer too. There is empirical evidence to support this. The problem comes when the system a group of people live under impedes their ability to: be left to their own devices, be constructive, be peaceful, and efficiently trade skills and goods. Find the system that best allows this and you'll find the most peaceful and prosperous of societies. Again, there is empirical evidence that locations with the lowest taxation and highest amounts of freedom produce prosperous, productive societies with people living longer. We simply need to educate people to show them how and why this is (and has to be) so. 
0	1525851394	1	I know this is completely unrelated, but who are your favorite anarchist thinkers and writers? 
0	1525858641	1	I don't get it, how could BS blame the miners for the fork? They were out of touch with reality.

0	1525875185	1	still is
0	1525834249	1	You don't speak for all libertarians or anarcho capitalists. It is blatantly false to say that the libertarians and anarcho capitalists are the ones who support bch. I've disobyed authority my entire life even to the point of my own detriment, and I support the real bitcoin to the fuckin core. I also support bitcoin cash. We have the best of both worlds with both sides trying alternative scaling techniques. Your ongoing attack on bitcoin comes off as a jealous ex. It really would be better for adoption if you would focus on creating the bitcoin cash brand. Seriously, Bitcoin Cash is a great name. If you really believe the technology is superior, then you wouldn't have to do all of this bitcoin hating because you would prove it over time.And please, stop trying to represent libertarians or anarcho capitalists
1	1525861651	3	Huh...where were you at Anarchapulco?There were like 2 Core supporters out of 1000 anarchists.
1	1525851731	2	If you support BTC, you support a software implementation that no longer resembles Bitcoin's fundamental design. I'd say it's beyond disingenuous to call such "the real Bitcoin."[Bitcoin is not software. BCH is Bitcoin.](https://redd.it/8fa7r0)
2	1525859373	-1	Referencing your own reddit post to support your own tired argument confirms only one thing... You are such a narcissistic fool.   it’s scary because you believe everything you say and think is objectively true, similar to the holy white paper you worship and use to ordain yourself a higher power.    You have every right to believe what you want, but do us all a favor and stay under the rock you come from, the real world may frighten you.  
0	1525834118	1	I have a theory about why this is such a common thing. Aside from modern schooling practices beating submission to authority into people at a young age, i think that the world wars of the 20th century fundamentally changed the genetic makeup of society. We know that personality is to some degree genetic (not to a deterministic level), and the first and second world wars saw millions of the bravest and most courageous people from all across the world stand up to fight against tyranny. And they died by the millions, unable pass on whatever genetic predispositions that allowed them to understand that authority is something to be questioned. Meanwhile those who instead put their efforts into avoiding the wars at all costs survived and reproduced. On a broad enough scale this breeds a populace more likely to keep their heads down and focus on their own lives in the short term.
1	1525845288	2	The second world war also resulted in the [Bretton Woods money management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system).  Interesting point about the wars drawing out courage like a honeypot.
2	1525845297	1	**Bretton Woods system**The Bretton Woods system of monetary management established the rules for commercial and financial relations among the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and Japan after the 1944 Bretton-Woods Agreement. The Bretton Woods system was the first example of a fully negotiated monetary order intended to govern monetary relations among independent states. The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained its external exchange rates within 1 percent by tying its currency to gold and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments. Also, there was a need to address the lack of cooperation among other countries and to prevent competitive devaluation of the currencies as well.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

First is that conscription was heavily used, meaning that people largely didn't have a choice (other than those who worked hard to stay out), second is that joining a military is not exactly going against authority.I will agree is had some effect but I don't think it's quite what you were proposing.

2	1525844844	1	**Legitimacy (political)**In political science, legitimacy is the right and acceptance of an authority, usually a governing law or a régime. Whereas "authority" denotes a specific position in an established government, the term "legitimacy" denotes a system of government—wherein "government" denotes "sphere of influence". An authority viewed as legitimate often has the right and justification to exercise power.
