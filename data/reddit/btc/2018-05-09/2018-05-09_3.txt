0	1525855115	40	I wonder if they get mad when companies accept USD. Or is USD a good thing these days?
1	1525865689	25	Of course. You have to sell your BTC for dollars so you can buy buy stuff!
2	1525868649	8	More correct to say you have to convert your store of value into fiat to buy stuff.If BTC is only store of value, and they reject all other crypto then of course they need fiat to use their stored value coin.
2	1525883597	3	you should not sell BTC for anything, only HODL. using BTC breaks BTC
1	1525875194	8	These are people that go to a bank in Calgary (Canada) with euro notes and ask for some dollars. Then when they get some Candian dollars they go to the newspaper and tell them the banks has defrauded them by giving them Canadian dollars instead of US dollars.
2	1525876611	4	Why mention Calgary? I am from there so just wondering :) BCH ftw :)
3	1525876785	3	I am from Red Deer. We should have some coffee together some day and talk Bitcoin without having to worry the other person freaking out when we say bitcoin instead of bitcoin cash. 
4	1525878432	1	Sure thing!
3	1525878589	2	Calgary ftw/u/chaintipWhen it comes to Bitcoin Cash, the flame might be in Calgary and the oil in Edmonton but the fire will be in Red Deer. 
4	1525883717	2	Calgary needs a BCH meetup
5	1525894518	1	Yeah man, let's make it happen! Maybe join the discord server of the Bitcoin Cash Fund? That's where I hang out, pm me for a link. 
4	1525878746	1	***u/craptocoin has [claimed](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qrelay2vj8dnmgw8umuzl4y5ndnjruw3dv5tvnggzl) the `0.00063367 BCH`| `~   1.00 USD` sent by u/Kain_niaKvia [chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org).***
5	1525878768	2	I love how fast chaintip is. The bot posted this post within a second after me hitting send on Electron Cash. 
6	1525879443	2	Awesome, thanks! Have never tried to use tipping yet, good reason to give it a go!
6	1525880110	2	Holy crap that works awesome! I had no idea!
7	1525894720	1	Yeah Bitcoin Cash has true instant transactions. It is absolutely essensial for people's business model like http://yours.org
1	1525883924	2	Good thing. For the FOMO MoonLambo noobs the USD they hope to get from flipping their BTC will buy the lambo. 
1	1525878717	-8	Companies can accept whatever they want for currencies .IMHO it is merely a priority of where I spend my money with . Thus here is my preference  in order from most to last with everything else being equal:1\) Stores that accept BTC only2\) Stores that accept BTC only and fiat\(Understandable transition\)3\) Stores that accept BTC , fiat , and a few non scammy altcoins \(LTC, XMR, ect\)4\) Stores that accept BTC, fiat , and scammy altcoins \(DASH, ETH, and BCH\)5\) Stores that only accept scammy altcoinsBCH has the potential to being a legit project but definitely is in the scam category with people like CSW and Roger using dishonest marketing to promote it
2	1525893725	1	Lol.
2	1525898015	1	Lol. 
0	1525865030	24	These people are against a free market and against everything bitcoin ever stood for.
0	1525855854	49	True cult mentality. We don't care what businesses wants to accept. They can take btc, bch, eth, LTC, whatever. But people have the right to their opinion and whatever they think helps pay for the business. Boycotting people because they don't want to join your war is like Jehovah witnesses and Mormons excommunicating their members because they do not share their opinion on their cult and religion. Hence, btc hardcore shills are cultist.
1	1525856535	16	they have purposeful puppet masters, and a host of willing obedient slaves
1	1525866590	5	> Boycotting people because they don't want to join your war is like Jehovah witnesses and Mormons excommunicating their members Ever read the policy from Scientology on disconnecting? If someone leaves the church the members are supposed to completely disconnect from them in all ways. Sounds exactly like what core supporters do. It's a form of shaming and social manipulation of both parties.
2	1525878457	2	Its getting more and more ridiculous honestly. I think most people just repeat things they hear and actually have no real knowledge on the subject. But, that is the climate that we live in now.
1	1525889019	-2	Kind of like how agorists and anarchists wish to boycott fiat or at minimum reduce their use of fiat?Would you support a business that undermined your investments and didn't respect the principle of sound money?
2	1525889361	1	The business did not disrespect any principle. They only open up channels to receive multiple currencies. It's like a business who wishes to accept cash, credit card, debit card, check, bank transfer, etc. Those are all various channels, I don't care which channel they use as long as I can pay for my product. Only a cult mentality and a narcissist will get angry at a business who has multiple channels to accept payments. Business has to survive and will do accept any form of payment deemed acceptable to them as long as they get paid. Full stop.
3	1525890029	-2	>Only a cult mentality and a narcissist will get angry at a business who has multiple channels to accept payments.Are you even familiar with FTL? They are anarchists who like cryptocurrencies specifically because they want to reduce usage and eventually boycott fiat
4	1525890187	1	Good luck with that. I hope hospitals accept their currency there.
5	1525890382	-1	I am ok with using fiat now, but the topic at hand is discussing FTL anarchists who are upset someone is preferring to send their charitable donations elsewhere because ethical concerns and philosophical alignments when FTL also wish to boycott other currencies due to ethical concerns and philosophical alignments .Don't you see the irony?
0	1525865524	19	>  If people want to pay with a different crypto - that's evidence of BTC's FAILURE to be the best currency. Mic drop.
1	1525892536	0	> BTC's FAILURE to be the best currency. BTC is the best currency in almost every aspect. Perhaps he meant to say BTC isn't a perfect currency which I agree and why so many altcoins exist
0	1525860242	36	"Fraud" for forking an MIT licensed software and network designed to be forkable in case of disagreement... smh
1	1525873616	-29	Fraud for claiming BCH is Bitcoin. Fraud for claiming BCH is the original chain and BTC is a fork.If BCH is really better it doesn't need a fictional backstory.
2	1525874836	18	I never agreed with  never raising that fricking block size limit from under one floppy disk per 10 minutes. I never agreed with limiting the amount of tx to 2600 per 10 minutes. I have been in bitcoin since 2011 and I have mined a bit on GPU. Where is my right to being free and making my own choise? Blockstream forced a lot of changes on to my bitcoin and in 2017 my bitcoin stopped being my bitcoin. Why? Because bitcoin stood for a payment system that is as fast as using a payment card but with lower fees that visa or credit card or paypal or wiretranser can offer. When that changed Bitcoin became bullshit. Who asked me for persmission? Nobody. So of cource I went with Bitcoin Cash, because that gave me the freedom to do what I want. And what I want is for bitcoin to be like how it was from 2011 - 2016. A payment system that was almost instant (500 ms - 2 sec) and with low fees. (under a dollar cent) You know why Bitcoin Cash exists? Because enough people in the Bitcoin community wanted it to exist. If you try to marganlise that you are comming historical fraud. If you claim that Bitcoin Cash is NOT Bitcoin then you are trying to change historical records. Ironic ... is it not? If you really think that trying to rewrite history is a good idea go and rename bitcoin to Stalin coin but leave us the fuck alone with your slavery. I hope you enjoy licking the boots of your blockstream masters cause you are already licking them, you just don't know it and you are fooled in to believing that what the bullshit you are tasting on the bottom of the boots is the taste of freedom. How sorry of a lot are you? A slave to his masters that does not even know he is slave. That is going to pay more then a cent per tx on the blockchain because: ah well, that's just the way things are .... 
3	1525883539	-6	You didn't agree with never raising the blocksize? That's because nobody asked you, because no-one has ever proposed never raising the blocksize.I stopped reading when you got into the whole slavery narrative.
4	1525894656	1	Good, cause you would not understand what freedom is about if you are in the bitcoin core camp and you are not a victim of propaganda and even agree with their anti freedom methods. Bitcoin is like water, you can't control it or even dam it in. Blockstream will fail and their voice wil go away. The powers that be will try a different approach and we will be ready for them. I don't know if we will survive the second attack but we are going to give it our all. Now please go away. 
2	1525874400	11	Linux Mint devs are also scammers for saying Linux Mint is Linux right?We all know only Linux Debian is Linux right? smh... 
3	1525879767	3	That's Gnu/Linux and you are committing fraud by calling it Linux!
4	1525882538	2	Well...why don't you get $3700 together and sue me ;] hahahahaha 
3	1525884207	-4	Does Linux Mint claim to be the real Linux, and Linux is a just a fork from Linux Mint? Nope.
4	1525887830	2	Dear god lmao...even if that were the **exact** scenario, it would still not be criminal or fradulent in any way. Do some research into what "open source" means.While you're at it look up what an MIT license is:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_LicenseWhen you're done with that, look up the open source 3D printer companies "MakerFARM" and "MakerBOT" compete with each other to produce and sell in the free market, two 3D printers, both based on the same open source "Prusa iv3" design. Then realize that in open source, nobody owns the name, nobody owns anything. Linux to me might not be linux to you. Fine. I might believe that Makerfarm made the original iv3 while you might believe MakerBOT was the first. Fine. It would not matter because open source is open source

As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, an excellent license compatibility. The MIT license permits reuse within proprietary software provided that all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice. The MIT license is also compatible with many copyleft licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL); MIT licensed software can be integrated into GPL software, but not the other way around.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
5	1525889218	-2	Linux is indeed trademarked by its creator, Linus Torvalds.https://www.linuxmark.org/programs/legal/trademark/attributionAsserting that your software is Linux will get you dragged into court, and rightly so. Names matter.
6	1525892865	1	If that were true, then the developers of all other flavors of linux would have been sued by now. 
2	1525878108	9	BCH is bitcoin. BTC is bitcoin. Both are forks. 
3	1525884009	2	Both are bitcoin.  One is a fork.  And the other one (Core) has made changes morally tantamount to a hard fork.  Source:  https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/930276246671450112?s=21
4	1525887127	1	A hard fork has a clear technical definition -- there's no moral aspect to it.
5	1525892523	1	It sort of has a definition, but almost everyone misunderstands what it means and everyone keeps repeating the wrong definition. Both kinds of forks are backward compatible, "soft forks" are forward compatible. Forward compatibility is bad because it tricks old nodes into accepting something they don't understand. It's basically a trick to trick nodes into accepting a protocol change, instead of allowing them to choose whether or not to accept it. I recommend you read and understand this: https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-consensus-and-forks-c6a050c792e7
2	1525895377	1	You guys don't help your case when you get so overzealous.  It makes you look stupid.BTC is Bitcoin.BCH is Bitcoin.Its an issue of flavor.> Fraud for claiming BCH is the original chain and BTC is a fork.BCH is more the original chain than the BTC "fork".  It more closely matches the bitcoin white paper.What you call fraud is actually an attempt at showing people that BCH is the better bitcoin and to let them buy BCH as well as BTC.  It irritates your side, just as the censorship on github and rbitcoin irritates our side.  Grow up and get over it.> If BCH is really better it doesn't need a fictional backstory.Would changing the white paper constitute creating a fictional backstory?Form an objective viewpoint, the only real argument is that bitcoin.com makes it a bit more confusing as to the differences between the two.  But that is being addressed and fixed by calling BTC Bitcoin Core and BCH Bitcoin Cash.
2	1525883949	1	> Fraud for claiming BCH is Bitcoin. https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/930276246671450112?s=21
3	1525884843	1	Keep reading. He immediately follows up with:That said, *right now*, I think trying to claim "BCH = bitcoin" is a bad idea, as it *is* a minority opinion in the "greater bitcoin community".Since we're appealing to authority, check out this tweet:https://twitter.com/jihanwu/status/926076475656126466?lang=en
2	1525874550	-1	Very well put. I agree that this is the main point of contention between the 2 camps. BCH should forget about BTC and vice versa. Both need to live on independently of one another without spending valuable time/energy flaming the other. This is software. Time to get to work!
3	1525875533	1	People hold dual citizenship and may different currencies , why cant we hold support in both champs. ..... If only there was a Big wall or some thing... 🤣. But seriously , the fighting over which is what and who came first is hindering the development of both and niether has the wisdom to overcome this short-sightedness.
