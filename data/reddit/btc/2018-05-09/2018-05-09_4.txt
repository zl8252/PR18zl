1	1525846273	3	Nice!
1	1525849564	2	i actually Lol'd!  it's great how accurate this is. 
0	1525845723	34	On the other hand, isn't the major topic here rBitcoin and their censorship?

1	1525855045	26	its repeated often because people are constantly learning about the extreme censorship and misinformation campaign from r/bitcoin and its puppet masters, its been like this since 2015, people coming over and going "ohhh, r/bitcoin is censored as f*ck, who would've guessed.. oh maybe those people in r/btc who have been saying it for years.. maybe i'll go there and repeat what they've been saying now that i know its true.."its not going to stop anytime soonas others said, the main focus is bitcoin, but because this subreddit is UNCENSORED, you will always get posts going "omg r/bitcoin blah blah.." because of reasons i said above
1	1525853946	11	> isn't the major topic here rBitcoin and their censorship?No, but this lie is repeated often. On the front page of r/btc there is usually 10% or less of posts being related even tangentially to r\bitcoin. Right now is a good example. The major topic here is bitcoin.
2	1525854691	9	I've seen 4 posts from r/btc on my front page in the last week and all of them were links or screenshots of r/bitcoin.
3	1525855091	9	I don't know what algorithm is currently running your reddit front page. That probably has something to do with which posts you most often view, vote, or comment. I was talking specifically about this subreddit's front page.
4	1525855953	1	This isn’t a jab at r/btc but rather humans as a whole. People love drama so posts bashing other posts on r/bitcoin are likely to get a lot of upvote quickly and show up on reddit front pages. Sad but true. 
5	1525857611	3	Everybody's front page is personalized to fit their own use. If you start ignoring posts like these then they'll show up less. On this subreddit they make up a small fraction of the total content.
2	1525886052	-1	> this lie is repeated often.A lot of comments here are bashing BTC. Seems quite a few hyperactive posters in rbtc have some sort of inferiority complex.
3	1525891412	1	You must have replied to wrong person.
1	1525870899	1	Logical debate is good.  Thoughtless bashing isnt. 
1	1525886051	1	Ont of the major topics, obviously. It's the whole reason why r/btc exists
1	1525850948	1	Lol. Well, some time ago it might perhaps even been sufficient to make a similar pic ("WHITEPAPER/SOLDALLBTC/CORETROLLS/SHILLS").. luls. But actually it feels like it has gotten better recently in both subs. Or it's the time of the year. :p
0	1525867217	4	It shows how scared they are of bitcoin cash. That's why they focus so hard on maintaining what they feel is most important, the brand bitcoin. They don't care about the tech behind it, they want to win on popularity and coercion.
0	1525849250	2	/u/tippr 1 bit
1	1525849264	3	u/theodord, you've received `0.000001 BCH ($0.00152258 USD)`!***[^^How to use](https://np.reddit.com/r/tippr/wiki/index) ^^| [^^What is Bitcoin Cash?](https://learnbitcoin.cash/) ^^| [^^Who accepts it?](https://acceptbitcoin.cash) ^^| ^^r/tippr  ^(Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin should be. Ask about it on r/btc)
0	1525874387	3	buuuuutttt bcash is still a scam Fuck you r/bitcoin 
0	1525855032	9	/r/btc is not really better in that regard. Look at the front page
0	1525846796	3	agreed it's a terrible thing to see, but gotta give them credit today, only 2 posts on the front page are roger/BCH related - little improvement is better than none. 
1	1525852824	5	I don't think it's much, you can only post the same nonsense so many times until people stop up voting it. /r/bitcoin will find or manufacture the next ver 'scandal' sooner or later, in which case that's all the subreddit will be about again. 
2	1525853619	-1	every sub is like that though, i stopped visiting r/steam because the mods and the people who were commenting were braindead.comparing today, r/bitcoin has a better front page than this sub - 1 vs 7 posts are attacking the other.
0	1525859102	3	muh...bcash roger jihan btrash....derp herp duhh....bcash... lightning good, bcash baaaad /s
0	1525856329	1	Even... one guy?
0	1525867210	1	I'm surpeised.
0	1525875525	1	Link to original?
0	1525879541	1	I was banned there yesterday for this comment: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8htrce/buying_coffee_with_lightning/dynk8ed/
0	1525897516	1	Is this what it means to go viral? Have I finally made it?! Can I call myself an "influencer" now? A "thought leader" perhaps?Just kidding. But thanks for the unexpected publicity, OP.
0	1525858369	1	We’re fed up here too... 
0	1525893691	1	So you posted some Bitcoin hate in the Bitcoin sub because you own the alt-coin known as Bcash and you think that's evidence the people at r/bitcoin are falling for the same scam you fell for?  Interesting.
0	1525846218	0	lol
0	1525860769	-1	I don't think we are any different lol
0	1525871005	-1	I can't enjoy /r/btc or /r/bitcoin properly lately what with all this fucking hatred between each other. 
1	1525896625	1	We're pretty good at avoiding the infighting over at r/BitcoinDiscussion.
0	1525877438	-1	lol and this sub = Bitcoin Core / Blockstream / r/Bitcoin
0	1525855101	-17	I guess the truth hurts.Bcash is a scam and EVERYONE is catching on.Get out while you can.
1	1525862281	10	Do you have any idea how desperate that looks?
1	1525869556	5	> Bcash Surely you mean Bitcoin Cash, right?
2	1525873791	1	DO NOT FEED THE BCORE CUCKS!
2	1525896079	0	There's many bitcoin forks Trying to coattail on bitcoin, not just bcash.The whole planet calls it bcash.Grow up and get used to it.BcashMuch cooler name, it's why everyone uses it. Bitcoin cash sounds silly, like your lame centralized mining concept and random forks decided by a central authority are not appealing enough to people with brains, so you NEED bitcoin in your name for credibility. Pathetic really.It's not even working. The whole planet knows bcash is a bankster funded joke designed to divide bitcoin community. Well, it didn't work. The vast majority of people who HODL bitcoin and don't come to reddit or twitter, haven't even heard of your sad little closed shop one developer project.Only Umercans fall for it, get butt hurt, pick their team (like ya did in high school) and then stick to their team no matter how asanine the team is. It's an Umercan thing. Sad Fools.Got another few minutes to burn because your over censored sub won't let the truth be posted more frequently than every 10 minutes. That's pretty pathetic too. Truth hurts I guess, better censor it.Hilarious really. 
3	1525896822	1	> The whole planet calls it bcash.I hope you have an extraordinary evidence for this extraordinary claim.
1	1525866063	4	I can't get out, because "everyone is already catching on" but I'm not "catching on" so I must not be part of "everyone" and therefore I don't exist, and people who don't exist can't get out of anything. Sorry Charlie.
1	1525886635	2	really?  I hear that a lot from certain troll-like creatures.  But its funny because the coins I think are scams I don't usually spend my time to visit their communities to post about it, or feel the need to use a different name for their coin to express myself.  Isn't that interesting?
2	1525894570	0	Silly fool. I have been on r/btc since long before it became a bcash shilling ground. It is after all r/btc, not r/bcash
1	1525870127	0	BCORE troll enjoys the taste of THERMOS cum.
