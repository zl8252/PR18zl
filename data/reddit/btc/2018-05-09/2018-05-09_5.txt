I read the first when I was a kid.My wife bought a bunkbed for two of our sons with Bitcoin Cash a day or two ago - should arrive soon.Last time I held BTC on an exchange was December last year.  Converted all to BCH.  Last time I sent BTC on chain was mid-August last year.

0	1525855702	-5	Really dumb move. You bought centralized fake money with leaderless real money ?!?!?!?But hey, it's your bitcoin, well it was your bitcoin. Just rinsing the braindead out I suppose. It's better off with your inability to think for yourself or do research that you don't have any real Bitcoin BTC.
