If this was true the early bitcoin (before even libbitcoin) would be classified as centralised. This is nonsense. This would be like saying the internet is centralised because many servers run apache software. Totally absurd argument.
1	1525866649	34	I never said it shows network centralisation. It doesn't.It shows centralisation of development, which has proven to be far more dangerous in practice.
2	1525867284	5	I don't see your argument. People should develop other implementations of Bitcoin nodes for the hell of it? Are you a software developer
3	1525868002	21	Are you blind? There are 11+ node implementations in the picture and BTC development is still centralized. That's why if Bitcoin Core devs doesn't want something to be implemented in BTC it just won't happen. That's real centralization 
4	1525868947	4	So if I don't like btc core, I can just develop on one of the other 11+ implementations right?
5	1525881244	13	Yes and no. You can develop on one but, if you want to suggest any upgrades/changes to the protocol, you are powerless to actually implement them because the network as a whole will ABSOLUTELY NOT upgrade *unless core implements the same changes*. So there's almost no point.In addition, if you insist on pushing for an upgrade that the core developers don't agree with, your implementation will be labeled as an "altcoin", your character will be assassinated, and you'll be labeled as an enemy of Bitcoin who doesn't respect "consensus". (When all you're really doing is giving people a choice. If your implementation doesn't get any hashpower, only then will the market have arrived at consensus.) 
6	1525887790	5	This exactly
5	1525873101	6	Anyone can be the dictator, as long as they only pass down edicts approved by the actual dictator.
6	1525881875	0	reminds me of /r/nanocurrency and their lawsuit and edict their using to sue the hacked exchange.
5	1525869025	2	No, just run another implementation to promote decentralized development. 
6	1525869988	-5	Yes, that's what I just said.
7	1525871037	6	This thread misses the point of the OP completely
4	1525875629	2	Development doesn't change consensus. Without miner/user support people can develop into an implementation what they want. it will never be part of consensus...
5	1525877048	2	Bitcoin Core consensus = the 5k+ reddit and Twitter fake accounts/bots that they use to upvote or downvote posts on rBitcoin and Twitter to make it look like there's massive support for their narrative while banning those who oppose. But of course when it comes down to real people [only 31 show up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8grxhv/moneytrigz_fails_to_raise_more_than_3700_for/)So in the end, yeah BTC consensus = whatever Core wants.Miners wanted a block size increase (Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited and Segwit 2X). Core didn't so it did not happen. That's why BCH exists. 
6	1525890792	1	You oversimplify to push your narrative. If miners would have wanted they could have pushed S2X. But they didn‘t!Do you think they didn‘t bedause those multi million dollar businesses were afraid of the 32 people with 5000 fake twitter profiles?
4	1525882196	-1	You seem to be confused about causality here. People run Core because it’s developing in a way they’re satisfied with. No one is forced to update their software to new crap if they don’t want, or to stick with BTC if it makes changes they don’t approve. Not to mention that you’re confusing Core as some kind of monolithic unilateral decision maker, which it isn’t if you watch the development process.
4	1525881764	0	Theres 100's of version of linux but I prefer the popular one... am I ruining bitcoin too?
5	1525882070	1	You are either trolling or retarded if you're trying to compare Linux with Bitcoin since Linux doesn't have  centralized development. Or both. 
6	1525882178	0	> retarded if you're trying to compare Linux with Bitcoin.They're both open-source projects "brah". No get back to the supermarket and pack my fuking apples and oranges in a brown paper bag that I'm going to put on your mothers head when I bang her tonight.
7	1525882601	2	> They're both open-source projectsAnd?Just because they are both open source, doesn't mean they're the same. Bitcoin Core has a centralized development team. Only Core have commit privileges on the Bitcoin GitHub. The only one that had commit privileges that wasn't from the Core team got kicked (Gavin) and in fact, Satoshi left him in charge of the Bitcoin development but that didn't matter to them when they kicked him because they wanted to take over the project. At the moment only Core has commit privileges which means that if they don't want to implement a change then it won't happen. Period. Linux repo is not like this. Nice try though. You showed us your complete ignorance and lack of intelligence. Therefore you're now labeled as a Core paid sock puppet shill. Go back to rBitcoin buddy.

It's a centralized team that reviews and pulls in the branches and ultimately has the final say on what code is merged in.

9	1525892490	1	> And therefore I can compare an opensource operating system worked on by 100's of developers to an open source blockchain project.Not at all. You can't compare Bitcoin Core development team to the Linux devs. Totally different. If you think they're the same you're even more retarded than I thought. Just because Coke and Pepsi are sodas doesn't mean they're the same.> I wonder what would happen if you had commit privileges. I'm a developer with 20 years of experience and know how dev teams work. You're just a 12 year old kid that is getting $20/day on your mommy's PayPal account to troll and shill on this sub. I'm so sad for you buddy. Hopefully you'll get a real job soon that can help you bring a real purpose on your life.> Satoshi could always leave a message if he felt strongly about it.

This is why there is many linux distributions focusing on different types of users from hackers to designers. You have the option to fork and create a new linux project to gather supporters. Period (as you put it).Yeah right. That's what Gavin did actually. He wanted bigger blocks but instead of forcing everyone (since he was the lead dev and had commit privileges), he forked the code which is known today as Bitcoin XT. Meanwhile, Core deceived the miners to accept Segwit and they, stupidly enough I could say, accepted thinking that they were going to increase the block size 90 after activating Segwit. That's the difference between Core dev tricks and Gavin and Linux devs honorable attitude. Over 90% of the miners (real consensus) wanted SegWit2x. Over 51% of the miners (real consensus) wanted Bitcoin Unlimited. But Core didn't so it did not happen. So yeah, the point stands. If Core doesn't want it, even with real consensus (miners) [they will just hire shills and sock puppets like you and then buy some reddit and Twitter votes and use bots so everyone believes that their narrative is what the "community" wants.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fl2np/rbitcoin_getting_spammed_by_bots_right_now_they/dqcnkf0/) Yeah because a 10k voted post on rBitcoin is totally normal while all other posts can't even get 500 upvotes unless they're bashing BCH or Roger. They don't even try to hide it anymore. If is not Core supported, it's not included. Period.Anyway buddy. Come back when you pull your head out of your ass. Gotta block you now. Not losing my time with paid sock puppets.
3	1525869095	7	I didn't realise there was an argument.I'm not sure how your questions relate to what we're talking about?However, what the point is, is that the way Bitcoin is *supposed* to work, is developers should be competing to innovate, with the mining community voting on the best rule changes to the protocol, backing their votes with Proof of Work.However, Bitcoin Core have been hostile to any developers with different ideas, using smear campaigns, public ridicule, DDoS attacks, exile and censorship (basically every trick in the book) as tools to control the development.This would not be a problem if there were a spread of competing clients.Prime evidence is the current state of BTC, being that it has an arbitrary blocksize cap in place with no working Layer 2.If development was decentralised, what would have happened (should have) is that Blockstream and their buddies would be pitching LN to the miners, alongside any other proposed solutions from competing teams, *when it is ready*.Instead, they strangled the base layer with no working layer 2 through social and political manipulation, not the least of which was the classic bait and switch that was SegWit2x, where they agreed to a compromise and then renegged as soon as segwit was implemented, effectively getting what they wanted through the use of dirty tricks. A result that every indication shows that most of the community did not want.What they did not count on, was that Bitcoin would split off, effectively decentralising itself again. Now we have development competition, but instead of between clients, it's happening on two different Blockchains.Turns out Bitcoin *is* actually pretty resilient after all.
4	1525870248	6	You are correct on everything you just said. So your chart shows that Bitcoin core is larger than the competing implementations.
5	1525871087	3	Hahahaha.Of course it does. Because of everything I just said.
4	1525875601	1	> However, what the point is, is that the way Bitcoin is supposed to work, is developers should be competing to innovate, with the mining community voting on the best rule changes to the protocol, backing their votes with Proof of Work.Isnt that exactly whats happening here? 93.5% of miners decided to run bitcoin core and vote for it with Proof of Work. 2.58% don't agree and vote for bitcore with their with Proof of Work. 
5	1525876793	6	Not really. Look at how much support SegWit had from miners before the NYA. [It was less than 32%](https://99bitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/miner-support.png). This changed [almost overnight](http://i.imgur.com/rG31m3q.png) when the "New York Agreement" Segwit2x compromise was come to.SegWit was activated by miners. Then the developers of S2X pulled the plug after Bitcoin Core announce that they never even supported the NYA in the first place (a point they were amazingly tight-lipped about before SW activation), followed by a very visible and nasty internet campaign of dirty tricks against any business or individual that supported the NYA. Calls to boycott the most prominent and long standing businesses in the crypto space including [burning BitPay cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6uhhi2/here_goes_your_bitpay_visa_card_you_are_fired/), and an [endless feed](https://imgur.com/W7kwaUg) of [NO2X] handles all 'slipping through' the net of censorship untouched.The miners were not even safe from the dirty tricks with the "Jihan and his evil miners" campaign appearing in the heavily censored feed. Again, individuals and businesses being publicly attacked with memes and fake stories appealing to the new wave of Bitcoiners FOMO buying in 2017 - which they promptly lapped up.So now the deed is done.The only ones left on BTC are using Bitcoin Core, because Bitcoin Unlimited, who had the[ majority miner support](https://i.redd.it/gqndiix97kwy.png) started developing for BCH.But the economic incentive is what drives miners. So hash rate follows price.Now we have BTC with only Bitcoin Core left. That's the best way I can describe how I believe we arrived at the pie chart in the OP.
6	1525878690	3	Version signaling is not an accurate measure of support. It is very easy to play political games with the signaling.
6	1525880435	0	so what you say is basically that voting with POW does not work in reality? If hashrate follows price then its the hodlers which have the final say. They can offload at any time and drive the price down while buying a different currency and rise its value and the miners would have to follow because they need to pay their bills. 
6	1525880520	-2	>Bitcoin Core announce that they never even supported the NYA in the first place \(a point they were amazingly tight\-lipped about before SW activation\)That is a bit of revisionist history . Almost all core devs were quite vocal about being against segwit2x way before and the ones that attended the NYA walked out in protest the day of > Now we have BTC with only Bitcoin Core left. Core \(formerly QT\) has always been a popular implementation in btc and miners still mostly run their own custom implementations . Nothing has changed beside the crowd that use to run contentious HF wallets like classic, xt, bu mostly moved to Bcash
5	1525880230	-4	> 93.5&#37; of miners decided to run bitcoin core  The chart is missing many nodes . A more complete picture is here but also leaves off many mining nodes . [http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/services.html](http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/services.html)most miners run custom implementations and templates , not direct core implementations as well
2	1525881360	1	You're just showing why **open source** is a good model for bringing developers together... You're suggesting nodes should use proprietary software because "decentralization" don't you remember the early 00's when every mobile manufacture had their own proprietary OS ? isn't it much better that an open source project like linux/android won out? now hardware guys can focus hardware and software guys can share ideas, design and build in larger community.
2	1525879976	-1	> It shows centralisation of development Except the process within core development is extremely decentralized. Even strangers or people who hate btc can create BIPs and contribute code. The many implementations all work together and come to consensus with core as well. 
3	1525888653	1	Lol except that's been proven to be false. They are the gatekeepers choosing what is accepted and what is an "alt coin." Don't pretend core isn't calling the shots on the github and community channels.
4	1525888866	1	>please cite an example of a BIP that reached overwhelming consensus in the developer community that was rejected by a gatekeeper
2	1525873146	-7	>I never said it shows network centralisation. >It shows centralisation of development.you fucking what?? its the reference client of bitcoin, u dumbfuck. what the fuck did u expect?
3	1525873156	4	Redditor /u/sumsaph has low karma in this subreddit.
3	1525873486	3	You don't know the difference between a network and the development of a network?Or you don't know what centralisation is?Which one?
3	1525873958	3	That has nothing to do with centralisation of development, you beautiful and articulate master of grammar.
2	1525885297	0	Now show this chart for BCH.LOL.
1	1525868701	8	Software vulnerabilities are found all the time. A critical bug in a single client can lead to a catastrophic network failure, emergency hard forks, loss of funds, shutdown of services. This is why client diversification is so important. Right now it only takes 1 bug to bring the network to its knees.And while many servers do run apache software, there are a wide variety of alternatives people use, so it's not remotely the same thing. You're trying to build up some sort of strawman to make OP's argument seem stupid. Don't be disingenuous.
2	1525869415	5	In this case it is more critical for the miners to be running different clients, as a non-mining node with no Proof of Work cannot enforce any rules, they can only watch.
3	1525869835	1	It's important for anyone relying on a node to validate transactions. While miners are more important, economically critical nodes (exchanges, payment processors, large merchants) are still part of the ecosystem. Even if mining isn't broken, the economy breaking still means the system is broken.
4	1525871130	2	> It's important for anyone relying on a node to validate transactions. While miners are more important, economically critical nodes (exchanges, payment processors, large merchants) are still part of the ecosystem.Totally.
1	1525874277	4	What you've failed to consider is what has happened to people/groups that tried to compete with them openly and fairly. There's a reason they have a monopoly today and it isn't because they we're just better. This sub exists in part as a response to their response to people competing with them. 
1	1525871987	1	> This is nonsense. This would be like saying the internet is centralised because many servers run apache software.I'd say a better analogy would be "the internet is centralized because most of it is hosted by a small handful of cloud providers like AWS".  About that ...
1	1525892558	1	If Apache basically governed the development of Internet protocols, as Core controls the development of the BTC protocol, then yes, the internet would be dangerously centralized.
1	1525876178	0	Time to educate yourself, you clearly don't understand consensus.https://docs.google.com/document/d/15GsvuAXWdcMDft9qtq_6ptY3ZZq-3CXL6OelnlikNso
0	1525857857	28	The bitter irony is that the "more nodes is better because decentralisation" argument, actually centralises it even more, because the only people sucked into that nonsense are Bitcoin Core fanboys, resulting in the client spread you see in the pie chart.If you are thinking about running a BCH node, please choose one of the known excellent clients with the lowest node count. Don't just run ABC by default, or we can also run into the same development centralisation problems.
1	1525865103	10	Worse than that, running a node that doesn't mine is actually a hindrance unless you provide a business service.
2	1525866278	0	Unless you have a super slow PC I don't think it's a hindrance and if people want to run a node, sure go ahead. It's just that you don't have to run a node if you don't want, there is no disadvantage if you don't.
3	1525866562	7	At scale it can hinder your chances of getting into the next block due to latency introduced in propagation, which increases the chance of 2 miners working on the same block working from slightly different mempools because of their distance apart on the network.
4	1525878859	2	That doesn't hinder your chances of getting into the next block. All transactions are equally disadvantaged.
1	1525878892	3	If more nodes do not cause more decentralization, do you prefer a network with only a single node?
0	1525867643	15	>I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.  So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.Satoshi Nakamoto
1	1525869569	9	When Satoshi said this, he failed to consider that control of development would undergo a hostile takeover.If development of Bitcoin Core was truly open, with commits happening from multiple branches worked on by multiple dev teams with competing ideas, then what Satoshi says here seems correct.
2	1525870710	2	At the time and considering the way Bitcoin was meant to function, I don't think he considered it a real risk. Thanks to the design, things will also tend to improve again in BTC as long as the project survives. There's just no knowing when and if it will be enough to stay competitive.
2	1525878994	1	Commit are happening from multiple branches by multiple dev teams. For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8g95yl/during_the_last_50_days_there_has_been_21_merges/What are you even talking about?
2	1525872878	0	>When Satoshi said this, he failed to consider that control of development would undergo a hostile takeover.So you agree that Satoshi wasn't infallible, correct? Because currently this is what Satoshi would've wanted.
3	1525873871	3	Do I think Satoshi was a human? YesDo I think humans are infallible? NoAre humans capable of time travelling forward into the future? NoAfter reading everything Satoshi wrote, and having some understanding of how he intended the consensus mechanism to work (he made it pretty damn clear), do I believe Satoshi would have reassessed that statement after seeing recent turns of events? Absofuckinglutely yes I do.Did Satoshi find it necessary to include a note saying there should only ever be one client in the Whitepaper? No he didn't.
4	1525876115	0	He didn't find it necessary to include a note saying there shouldn't be either. I bring this up because everyone in this sub seems to think the whitepaper is some holy scripture and that Satoshi didn't get things wrong or change things when it came time to implement it in software.
5	1525878510	3	It's interesting how every Bitcoin Core proponent uses the phrase 'Holy Scripture'.I'm happy for that because it's ridiculously easy to debunk. Maybe let your bosses know and come up with a new one?It isn't a scripture. It's a ***technical description***.If you are comparing a technical document to a phrase from the Bible, then your understanding is horribly off track.And yes. Many people want to continue Bitcoin by its technical description, paying attention to the technical and economic ideas it contains, until such time as it *needs* to be revised.
6	1525882247	3	It's a technical *proposal*. The first release of bitcoin didn't match the whitepaper exactly and Satoshi changed his mind on things following that. People compare it to scripture because of the zealotry towards it.

0	1525892054	1	OP does not understand the relationship between nodes and centralization.
0	1525868055	2	This is only shows the decentralised nodes running bitcoin core software... this isnt centralization. Youre getting desperate 
1	1525869676	4	It shows centralisation of development, which when combined with the fact that a small group controls the direction of the Bitcoin Core repo, is extremely dangerous.Thankfully, many of the exiled devs are now working on a fork.
2	1525886610	1	FYI anyone is free to contribute to the bitcoin core code. [There are 541 contributors on the project's github](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors).So I don't see your point. There's no "centralisation of development".

Thanks for making it easy to show that you are lying.> created by jihan&his assclowns like roger Wrong. Roger supported SegWit2x. He didn't even support BCH at the beginning. deadalnix coded the client for the fork. Somebody had to do it, just like Satoshi coded the first BTC client.
2	1525879459	0	> lol, not even right, but ok that's x3 of BTCLook at the picture you posted. There are 11 competing bitcoin clients on the network. Few people choose to use those, but that's not core's fault. From a security standpoint it's the smart decision to run core, it's more battle tested and probably contains less bugs. If there is a bug, it's more likely to be discovered because so many users are reviewing the code. And if the bug triggers, the are reduced chances of getting into the wrong fork because everybody has the same bug. Forks only occur when implementations disagree over a particular bug.
