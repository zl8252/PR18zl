I think its great that BCF is so transparent and publishes all of their information.But when I look at that information, I see about $25k a month going to "human resources" which is the bulk of the spend.  The most valuable thing (imo) that BCF does is to help meetup groups.  But those groups don't actually get that much money.I think the work the BCF does is good, but I also think the scrutiny on them is good too.  Maybe it will make them more efficient or encourage competition.
1	1526291680	17	They don't do that much to help fund the meetups. Most have had to self fund meetups because what they give is so little.
2	1526303939	12	Meetups can be powerful if the people in those meetups are taking big bold actions and signing up merchants.  If they're just a meetup to sit around and talk about bitcoin, its not that valuable.  The real metric is how many merchants are coming on board as a result of those meetups.
2	1526301594	2	We provide $3 per person in attendance to each meetup and allow the meetup hosts to spend that how they see fit \(as long as it is actually spent on the meetup\). Most give this out to people at the meetup or cover the cost of snacks, drinks or the venue. The average number of attendees is normally around 30\-50, but reaches over 100 at some, and we we fund over 70 different meetups around the world. This number is continually growing.Not only do we provide funding but we also provide merchandise to these meetups, including t\-shirts, stickers bags, flyers etc, to help incentivise their growth. We aim to be at 200 meetups by the end of the year in roughly 50 different countries.If you and u/jonald_fyookball would look into the numbers you would see the costs start to add up extremely rapidly. \($3 funding \+ $1 merchandise\) \* 50 attendees \* 200 meetups \* 12 months = $480,000 each year.Our strategy is that we would rather provide 200 meetups with what the need to get meetups off the ground, than provide 20 with excessive funding.We are also provide one\-to\-one support with meetup hosts and provide them with educational content on how to host a successful meetup, and are now providing advertising to drive even more attendance.Could you tell me what meetup you host? I'd like to look into where the issue is.
3	1526310440	3	It's crazy that you're being downvoted so heavily for providing this explanation. Thank you for addressing these concerns and sharing some stats on BCF. /u/tippr $2
4	1526310483	2	u/singularity87, you've received `0.001372 BCH ($2 USD)`!***[^^How to use](https://np.reddit.com/r/tippr/wiki/index) ^^| [^^What is Bitcoin Cash?](https://learnbitcoin.cash/) ^^| [^^Who accepts it?](https://acceptbitcoin.cash) ^^| ^^r/tippr  ^(Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin should be.

3	1526307775	1	>Dude actually provides an honest explanation>met with downvote army without comment
0	1526251900	6	Where do they get the money from? 
1	1526252041	17	The community. I do know they got money from China to do the ridiculous airdrop on shittoken holders a couple of days ago. They’re an investment vessel disguised as a non-profit fund doing Pump & Dump schemes occasionally
2	1526252672	17	Which is why I always said bounties was the better way to fund projects.
3	1526260801	9	its not - good code dev doesn't work that way. 
3	1526293901	-5	And you always have been wrong.
0	1526258322	26	@SharkLaserrrrr what is the gist of your complaint? That they are funding lighthouse and you are too so you want credit for doing so? That BCF would not fund your project which you view as unfair? I agree the numbers look questionable but I don't understand your level of vitriol.
1	1526258621	23	That they all of a sudden want to fund lighthouse just shows their incompetence cause they could of done that before I announced we were putting resources in reviving it. I don’t need credit for it, i don’t care about getting credit, it’s in my best interest to see as many projects get funded as possible an lighthouse is going to partially enable that. What I am complaining about is that none of their initial goals have been chased after, goalposts just have moved. Conflicts of interest arise constantly and now all of a sudden, they aren’t a community fund anymore, they are a fund for funding only their own projects (and lighthouse apparently while there is currently nothing needed, should of knocked on that door weeks ago)
2	1526283715	3	We're can I apply for project funding?
3	1526297891	3	on their website
3	1526302552	8	You can apply but you won’t get it, they only fund ‘internal marketing projects’ they think of themselves so they can pay their buddies and themselves.
4	1526307866	4	People who relentlessly attack BCF tend to not get funded, yes.
2	1526273057	10	> could ofcould have> should ofshould have
3	1526277300	-13	Bad bot.
2	1526312736	2	If you dont like how they are spending donations, don't donate. They have been completley transparent from the beginning. They are not misleading anybody. They have done nothing wrong. 
2	1526262255	-1	> I announced we were putting resources in reviving it. Why are you putting resources into a project that failed when it was helmed by a highly respected dev who had much greater access to meaningful publicity because of his reputation? 
3	1526282192	17	Because it failed on a crippled chain (BTC), it  it limited like that on BCH.
2	1526293658	-7	Like I said, autistic loser.
0	1526259073	4	So what is the money actually suppose to be going towards? Like if you donated money to them, what did you think it was going towards? That like when people donate to charities they expect them to give 100% of their donations to whatever the cause is. These people that run these things are business men and women. They have to be. And on top of that you have to pay people to do things. I’m sorry but no one works for free forever.
0	1526251734	57	I think it is worth pointing out that Ari is following through on his threat to smear us if we didn't post about his business on social media. You'll probably see quite a few posts from him over the next week or so with regards to the BCF. Unfortunately, toxic people pull everyone down into the mud with them.With regards to our spending, we have funded every project that we felt fit our criteria so far. Our initial plan was to simply be an organisation to fund projects that our brought to us. This didn't work out as well as we initially hoped as the number of projects brought to us were low, and most were of a low quality or were simply looking for funding for their business. We made the decision to pivot slightly to do more marketing projects internally to be more effective. This meant using more resources internally, I.e. hiring more people. The outgoings of our organisation reflect this. Spend on admin is minimal. Every one of the team has a specific marketing purpose to allow us to work on marketing initiatives to increase BCH adoption.I'd recommend people go and read the latest update from us.[https://www.yours.org/content/bcf\-report\-13052018\-634e64623ed8](https://www.yours.org/content/bcf-report-13052018-634e64623ed8)
1	1526264205	14	BCF doing a great job on little money
2	1526299099	4	"Great job" on "little money"150,000 is just a 'little money' hahahahahahahaBCH scene is full of scammers. 
3	1526308272	3	If you're running a business or an organization, $150k really is not that much money. If you include payroll taxes and benefits, that's about what it costs to employ one person in a western country for a year. 
4	1526310689	-5	> $150k really is not that much moneyhahahaha whatever scamming ass BCH zombies
5	1526313536	2	You sound like you are really poor. And planning to keep it that way.
1	1526267837	20	What are the payments for "humanresources" [listed here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6WZ0_4uIF80JByduAmI4zphnh3hM_jSgjJEgB2ZoSE/edit#gid=0)?Something fishy here. 
2	1526288714	15	true, lots of "human resource" entries, can we see if it is to a single entity or separate entities
3	1526291187	15	Paying staff
2	1526269823	-29	> Something fishy here.Are you stupid? This sentence makes absolutely no sense.>Something's fishy here.or>There's something fishy here.or>Something is fishy here.Any of the above options would be perfectly acceptable. However, the shit that you wrote as you mashed your keyboard makes absolutely no sense. Learn English, you gigantic moron.
3	1526272930	8	gypsytoy: *I don’t seem to be coming back. I basically have the same story as OP except that I went from investing everything I had (as a college student) to buy 60 BTC in 2013 and holding strong for a solid 4 years. Then having a mental health crisis during 2016 and giving 20 BTC away to strangers online who took advantage of me, never to be seen again. Then in December, days before the top, I learned what margin trading actually was. Mad a tiny bit. Lost a good amount while falling asleep during a drop and then chasing the whole thing (40 BTC) down to 0.02 BTC.**I’m beyond devastated. I’m confident that I’m going to end my life over this and I’ve already begun separating myself from the world and getting my affairs in order. I feel weird revealing and admitting this on reddit, but this post hits home, as does the one of the main sub about the guy’s brother who killed himself over the same situation. I admire those who can weather setbacks of this kind but I’m not one of them. I knew from the minute I read the white paper that Bitcoin was a game changing idea. I poured my savings into it, confident that my stack would be worth a million (20K) within 5 years (I called this almost perfectly). It’s not even like I want to live an extravagant lifestyle, I just wanted to feel financially safe for once in my life and wanted to share the wealth with those close to me and help build positive businesses and a better world. The pump and dumpers and Lamborghini memes are so obnoxious, as if the world needs any more mindless hedonistic consumerism. I grew up pretty poor and bounced from foster home to foster home and from school to school. I barely made it through college and have no marketable skills. I lost my dead end sales job a few months back and can’t bring myself to go back to barely getting buy. I held strong throughout the years, even though I could’ve certainly used the money at times. I always brought my own lunch to work and always took the subway when I could instead of paying for Uber. I invested a few thousand dollars back in 2013 and never saw a penny of it. OP is much more honorable than me because I certainly don’t have the self respect to turn down donations but I’m also pretty certain that people aren’t donating to the small army of people who are in the same situation and I obviously don’t deserve it anyway. When I run into friends, they always ask about how well I must be doing because they know I’ve been a Bitcoin proponent for a long time. Smiling and looking at them in the eye while talking positively about Bitcoin is incredibly taxing and I immediately want to throw up in the nearest trash can afterwards. I know somewhere else in the universe, there’s a ‘me’ who decided against margin trading or stopped after a few losses or didn’t start playing bull at the beginning of a bear market. Not me though, I’m a fool and I squandered the only thing going for me in life. I hope others heed the warnings, but I know most won’t. Either way, I don’t have the type of mind to let something like this go and I can’t stand to watch Bitcoin moon again and be left behind. It’s sad that money can have such power over people. I know many have had their lives dramatically changed for the better but I suppose there are two sides to the coin. I don’t even know why I still obsess over Bitcoin and this sub. I literally can’t think of anything else most of the time. I guess I keep hoping that it will drop to some very low amount and that I’ll be able to buy back in but that doesn’t make sense because I don’t have $10 to my name to put back in. I’m going to lose my unemployment benefits and housing in a few months and really have nowhere to turn once that happens. I know most people would pull themselves up by their bootstraps and carry on but I know that I could never escape my mind. Sorry to rant negatively on your kind and reasoned comment. I wish OP the best and he seems to have a much better attitude towards the ordeal than I do, even with the stakes being that much higher. edit: I mostly regret posting this. I sort of figured it would get buried, didn’t realize that this thread was still pretty active and that I posted on the top comment. Thanks for the comments, PMs and kind words. I’m not in immediate danger of anything and wasn’t trying to start a pity party for myself. Nonetheless, thank you all for your concern.*
4	1526273122	-11	Ah, good ol' fashioned character assassination from H0dl. It's not like you ever have anything substantive to say, so why not just copy paste this irrelevant nonsense. Good work, dude. 
5	1526276266	12	I literally still can't stop laughing.  Did you actually write all that?   I knew you were mentally fucked, but this is unbelievable!   :-D>I barely made it through college and have no marketable skills.lmao...   so much makes sense now ...>I lost my dead end sales job a few months back and can’t bring myself to go back to barely getting buy.Getting buy?   What's that you said to the guy above? .... "learn english you gigantic moron"So you've handled your financial misfortune by becoming the equivalent of a retarded 5 year old who trolls Bitcoin Cash literally all day long?   Weird...
6	1526276378	-7	*checks the BCHBTC pair*Yikes!No wonder you're so upset again. :D
7	1526294294	1	Sounds like you need to refocus on that killing yourself thing, you sound like a dumb ass.Go screech "BCrassshhhhh" somewhere else loser.
1	1526261547	28	Hey thereDo you have some proof of these threats to smear BCF? That would make this a lot more clear-cut if you could please provide it
2	1526262265	-4	[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/412393631912165376/445214228790509568/image.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/412393631912165376/445214228790509568/image.png)
3	1526279135	13	Wait thats it? Thats the “smear threat”?Really?I don’t see any hint towards smearing nor threat.Isn’t he just saying he is on the verge of removing himself from involvement??
4	1526280347	18	I think "going all out" infers something a bit more than that. It's not a direct threat and could mean lots of things depending on the context but there's definitely threat in there.
1	1526265763	16	Just to let you know, I noticed the same thing as Ari, that a lot of spend was going to HR. I don't know the history between you but it is something many would notice if they took time to look at the numbers.Now is 66% on HR a bad thing? Is the BCF staff doing most of the work and there are not many legit projects to fund, that is totally possible. Still I think it is ok to question large spend on staff instead of projects. 
2	1526276678	-6	It's not 66 on HR people. It's 66% on people. People that make stuff.
1	1526306930	5	I don't have time to go thru the spreadsheet on my phone right now, but for some things I think it would be good if you went into a little more detail, like the "human resources" stuff for example, specify at least which departments/projects are involved in each payment.Also, it would probably be good if you documented the selection proccess for the external people you pay; why other candidates were rejected and why the specific individual or group were selected and stuff like that.  Same with the selection of projects.
1	1526251919	17	I think it’s worth pointing out that you perceive FACTS stated in your own report, as a ‘threat’ to ‘smear’ BCF and that makes me toxic? Are you serious?Edit: Building a marketing business with money from donations while refusing to promote a another business which is the best promotion of Bitcoin Cash currently has regarding spending your coins, is not a smart move.Here is the ‘threat’ https://twitter.com/ari_cryptonized/status/995820291589799937?s=21I would also like to note that I went on discussing the spending at cryptartica with George and the promoting of them as BCH merch supplier and not cryptonize.it while we’re cheaper and have what 2 complaints online? He admitted you have a very friendly relationship. Wonder if that’s the reason you acted like cryptonize.it didn’t exist for the past 6 months?
2	1526260162	12	You want his foundation to spend at TOTAL of less than $20,000 on ALL administrative costs INCLUDING salaries?You can't even hire a janitor for that much.You clearly have an alternate motive.
3	1526262235	12	It's 20k in the month not year
4	1526266430	-5	November is 7 months ago, not one month ago.
3	1526260324	6	Wtf are you talking about? Do you know how to read numbers? If so, get that report in front of you and try again.
4	1526261733	6	I think that you are a shill, and I think that I am going to hound you about that for the rest of your time here.
5	1526277232	3	He's moreso a self centered child, who is angry that theyre not promoting his business, because he feels its awesome.  So without even thinking, he's giving ammunition to our detractors, who will use this to "prove" fraud in Bitcoin Cash project.
6	1526294505	-9	I would call him just another autistic loser with too much time on their hands. Probably on "disability" in the US and just sits around playing programmer like luke-jr.
2	1526263348	2	The report doesn't back up your smear campaign buddy. You are not making them look bad when we actually read it. You must be targeting people who read titles only.
3	1526276171	-5	So pretty much every idiot on r/bitcoin then.   He will be highly successful unfortunately.   Blockstream has proven how dumb they are.
3	1526288198	5	You must be a sockpuppet or haven’t actually read the reports.
4	1526302444	-5	You really are trying to make something out of nothing. You may not understand that report, but most of us here do it seems.
2	1526276591	-3	> while refusing to promote another business [mine] which is the best promotion Bitcoin Cash currently hasAre you seriously exacting revenge on them because they're not hooking you up with promotions for your own business?   Fuck off.You know full-well this is going to be used as ammunition against Bitcoin Cash as a whole, and you're actually helping that?Use your brain dude. 
1	1526278947	-10	Don't worry about toxic people. Keep up the good work. Thanks for doing it.
1	1526293818	-7	Are you talking about the autistic loser OP? Got into an argument a few weeks back with that lunatic, the fuck is his problem?
0	1526257959	18	In a typical charity you would compare the cost of admin verses the amount on delivered benefits \(e.g. food and medicine\). However this case is different as they are not delivering food and medicine. Much of the costs which you presume to be admin, is actually work \(salary\) in producing the core benefits for the bitcoin cash community.   
0	1526266352	20	My opinion is the BCF is legit as far as organizations of this sort go. The Satoshi's vision networking event was well put together. I don't think the BCF is a good idea because donations are not a sustainable form of funding. At least they are trying to do something. Anyway if you don't like it don't donate. You can't have a permission-less system and at the same time dictate how they spend their donations.  If they just up and exit scammed with 100% of the donations like the litecoin equivalent did it would just be par for the course. I think Roger Ver is doing good enough promoting bitcoin cash that we don't need the BCF. At the same time I don't feel as though the BCF's existence is detrimental to bitcoin cash.
0	1526303366	3	There is a puritanical double standard with charity. You should be able to profit in the charity space.If we take the puritanical stance we limit the ability to take risks and fail.
1	1526304331	4	Then it’s not a charity, it’s a business.
0	1526250881	27	just 66%? that's pretty good for a charity. Most charities spend 90%+ on bullshit. This is why the only charity I do is directly In the street.

6	1526302601	0	Downvotes huh, didn't know r/btc was into Neo Nazi shit, cool. 
1	1526251711	20	Not sure why you are downvoted. The Red Cross only spends about 17% on actual charitable work. 83% of donations go toward running the show.However, this isn’t a massive organization with hundreds of people on the ground. A fund like this should be run with minimal staff (remotely) and I think more than 40% of donations should make it to the funding projects.
2	1526255859	28	According to charitywatch.org the American Red Cross spends 89% on the program, 11% on overhead.https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/american-red-cross/360To be rated with an A, a charity should spend at least 75% on the program.https://www.charitywatch.org/charitywatch-criteria-methodologyI sympathize with the goals of the Bitcoin Cash Fund and I understand that they are just getting started. Maybe some efficiency goal should be set that they could work towards and update the community on progress towards that goal. I'm sure that would lead to more donations in the future.To be clear, I think that the Bitcoin Cash fund does better than other "charities" in the space that consist mostly of a donation address and social media accounts...
3	1526256086	13	Thanks for the sources. My number was based only on a quick google.I definitely agree that some sympathy is earned, but at the same time I think they could be doing a much better job of putting money to use. 
4	1526261169	12	Charitywatch is bullshit, by the way.  If you have even passing familiarity with accounting shenanigans, going through the public tax returns of the big charities and non-profits will have you laughing at their bullshit claims to spending 90% of their income on direct action programs.   Ex: they parcel out marketing personnel to be officially part of some direct action program, even though they have nothing to do with working on that program.  They hide their actual massive admin overhead inside their direct action programs even though those people aren't working on that program.  It's not fraud or anything, because the IRS doesn't give a fuck how you classify your internal employees into various departments as long as you're complying with the tax code statutes relevant to your organization.  It is incredibly misleading though and basically false advertising. 
5	1526264236	4	This is what I figured.
4	1526257257	12	I've tried to make it as clear as possible in our communication, especially in our major updates, but obviously I haven't done a good enough job of that. Our focus shifted relatively early on so that we would work on projects internally to make sure we were getting enough done. The quality \*and\* quantity of projects that have been brought to us has mostly be relatively low, which meant if we wanted to have more output, we would need to be doing things ourselves. Those human resources costs aren't just admin like in a charity \(we aren't a charity by the way, we are non\-profit\), they are actual functions that do actual marketing. e.g. finding and supporting new ambassadors to host meetups, developing advertising on multiple platforms, building a new informational site to onboard new businesses and people onto the BCH economy, translating our own and community content into as many languages as possible, developing educational video content, and video ads etc. \(not even nearly an exhaustive list\). This all takes human resources. We try and work with volunteers dotted around the world where possible, but sometimes this is just extremely inefficient. I highly recommend reading our updates to see what we have been doing internally.[https://www.yours.org/@bitcoincashfund](https://www.yours.org/@bitcoincashfund)Edit: I should add that we have not  at any time stopped funding projects that are brought to us.
5	1526257973	14	Fair enough. I commend you for your transparency and efforts. Don't worry, donations from me won't stop!
4	1526256148	6	Agreed
3	1526261089	14	Charitywatch is laughably bad because they simply take charities at their word.  They gave the Clinton Foundation a great rating despite the public tax returns showing that they dump almost all of their ridiculously high admin costs into their program expenses accounting lines, allowing them to claim that their overpaid employees in their shiny Manhattan office are part of the direct aid program for Africa, for example. (Their tax return also showed foreign fund transfers, and most of their money wasn't going overseas)
2	1526255092	1	> However, this isn’t a massive organization with hundreds of people on the ground. You're wrong here. They fund resources for meetups all over the world. They literally have hundreds of people on the ground.
3	1526255393	13	Are those included in human resources item?
3	1526255383	8	Funding and charity is against Bitcoin philosophy.Giving money to x devs to develop something is being bad to y devs who were perhaps already developing it.The Bitcoin Foundation of past was full of scammers and pedophiles - not something I would support ever, cause people start to see foundation members ideas and opinions as being more important than others.Don't help anybody with the ecosystem - let the best and strongest devs, and the best and strongest projects survive on their own merits.FUCK ANY BITCOIN (CASH) FOUNDATION.If you really want to be charitable your donation to @eatbtc is as far as I can see helping starving people on the ground. Cryptonerds do not need charity.If you need money for a meet-up you are doing it wrong. The best you could get is maybe some free T-shirts and stickers from Bitcoin.com or something - but they're not really "free" as it is marketing and capitalism at work which is fine. You benefit, Roger benefits. A meet-up should be a sociable event buying beer with Bitcoin (Cash) and chatting. Those requiring funding to further the cause are wankers.
4	1526268957	-1	Don't donate then. People are free to donate to things that they think advances their cause, and are free to judge performances themselves. Don't tell people what to do. 
4	1526261899	13	Oh god. This. Every single part of this. 100%. Thank you for saying it how it is, even though you will surely get downvoted!
3	1526255927	9	Paying someone to go the bar and talk BCH with a bunch of others on Friday night is not quite the same as paying to house, feed, and transport someone 24/7 like the Red Cross does...
0	1526260483	5	Looks like you lost yourself some respect here..
1	1526294688	-11	Idiot op had respect here? The guy is a screeching autist angry that he is losing.
0	1526257398	16	Just donated to BitcoinCashFund. $153K is not a lot of money to run an operation, with all the activities they've completed.  BTW here's the report  https://www.yours.org/content/bcf-report-13052018-634e64623ed8 
1	1526257779	-2	It is a lot of money when you spend 2/3rd on yourself.
2	1526258989	13	No it's not.  There's a lot of people involved, each providing some value. A single good developer costs more than that. I think the issue you are having is the expectation that they are a pass through like most charities. In fact, they spend internally for BCH promotion, and so far that has been a good thing.  Honestly, I'm more suspicious of your overzealous, yet disinterested interest in the BCF fund, than the fund activities
3	1526259663	6	How many people do you think are actually getting paid from that money that are involved? Not many. No the issue I am raising is that this fund acts like a community fund but isn’t one at all. It even acts like a non-profit while in fact not being one at all. You can be suspicious all you want and, fact is that I provided you with a place to spend your coins when you couldn’t do that anywhere. Fact is BCF didn’t mention cryptonize.it once. Fact is they don’t fund any of the proposed projects. Fact is now they got money, all of sudden they only do internal marketing projects. Wtf is that supposed to be? The guy from bitbox came up with a better commercial then BCF, and sure as hell cheaper. Even the job they pretend to do, they don’t.
4	1526261287	4	I don't have an issue with how they operate, how they are executing their mission. Sorry to hear you didn't get support for your project, I know you do good work. In the end it's their prerogative about spending. Look for an alternative, maybe, I know it's a stretch, a competitor, or compete with them
5	1526262167	11	The insane thing is that he didn't even submit a project to us. All of this smear campaign is happening because we didn't make a post on social media about his company. There wasn't some policy to not post about it, and we even linked to cryptonize on the [pamphlet](https://github.com/The-Bitcoin-Cash-Fund/Business-On-boarding/blob/master/Business%20Info%20Pamphlet.pdf) we made for new businesses and users. We printed thousands of copies of these and sent them to people all the around the world. We even had a post queued up for tomorrow for the video he posted about how to use cryptonize.Instead of making a reasonable request, he threatened us that he would go on a smear campaign against us if we didn't post about his business. I do not take threats like this lightly, and I will not let the BCF be influenced by threats, and so we banned him from the our chat group \(he is banned in 3 other chat groups already. That should tell you a lot.\). Following this he followed through on his threats, as is the case in the thread and the multiple other threads and posts on social media by him.I really really wish we could please all of the community all of the time, and I work hard to do that and balance it with achieving our goals, but unfortunately sometime it just isn't possible.
6	1526264011	2	I wouldn't worry about it too much. With all the past history, community is resilient, mostly aligned on objectives, and vigilant for bad behavior. Can't change people's personalities.. Bad publicity can be turned into good publicity.. please keep up the excellent work
7	1526264312	1	Thanks. Appreciate it.
4	1526259877	8	>Not manyIf it's more than one, then they are operating on an amazingly small budget. Most charities don't even get out of bed for less than a million dollars.
5	1526261334	10	We have a team of 9, and work with many volunteers and freelancers on top of that.
6	1526280435	12	7 payments in April:humanresources	$543.75humanresources	$6,000.00humanresources	$1,400.00humanresources	$4,000.00humanresources	$1,000.00humanresources	$2,760.00humanresources	$4,800.00
7	1526287984	-3	One of the team was unavailable for a lot of April and so they did not take their salary, as they understand the need for us to maximise our resources. The other payment was made in May.
4	1526263150	6	If it is more than two then they are not getting paid a lot.
0	1526259729	2	See, the main issue is the community simply isn't giving them enough money.If they got $10 mil, they would have spent only 10% on themselves. It's incredible how stupid people can be. You're not sending money to some tribes in Amazon, for fuck's sake! Everything worthwhile is on Github or at least talked about here.You can donate directly to fucking projects (including the zeroconf PoS project linked here 2 days ago), but people choose to give to a "foundation".... Haven't you learned anything from the Bitcoin Foundation experience?
0	1526250111	21	Haha, that sounds very excessive. 100k in less than a year for how many fte? /edit  there are a few people so maybe it isn't that much but still. Burning through funds so soon and fast. It feels like wages were more important than longevity or effect. 
1	1526255182	2	They are paying salaries for multiple people working in a highly technical field. I'm amazed its not higher.
2	1526257427	-10	HAHAHAHHAHA salaries to fucking marketing people not developers, they don’t develop shit.
3	1526265088	0	Dude marketing is super important in every industry, just as important as the tech.
3	1526259355	3	How dare they not pay below minimum wage!? How dare they not pay illegally low salaries!?Like seriously, how many salaries do you think $100k can pay for?
4	1526259747	2	Go look at their damn report and you’ll see how many, maybe you’ll learn more.
5	1526263241	4	Yeah the report doesn't back up what you are saying. If anything it shows what we are telling you. You are acting like a fool.
6	1526288222	8	Show me where it doesn’t add up? Is that you Paul?
1	1526254729	17	Here is how much https://www.thebitcoincash.fund/about/
0	1526264347	4	How does this post have so many upvotes? $100k on salaries is nothing. They don't need to decrease salaries. They need to increase donations. Hell, *increasing* salaries may even help them do that if they spend it on the right people.
1	1526270285	-5	Agree. For profits are more successful than nonprofits. Higher salaries can recruit more effective workers. BCF transparency is good.  They need more funds. 
0	1526249693	21	If true I would never consider donating.  
1	1526250156	22	Unfortunately it is true. At least they are transparent enough to make it easy to see?
2	1526250285	14	Ya I respect that.  Maybe they have plans to improve that percentage?  Hope they can work that out.  
3	1526263630	0	They can't pay less than minimum wage as that would be illegal. If anything they need more funding in order to lower that percentage.
1	1526249860	18	Go read it, it’s all in their latest report. They Also announced they won’t fund outside projects so basically it’ll be 100% BCF.They also announced they want to fund Lighthouse, something cryptonize.it already is helping get started (use search bar), so people can use that for funding. 
2	1526250233	10	Ari, that's not true at all. We specifically say we *will* fund community projects but that it will not be our focus. We want to get out of the way and allow the community to fund anything they want through Lighthouse, and we can also fund projects through it as well.
3	1526252262	9	Are you doing payroll in fiat?Those humanresources payments at the end are a pretty hefty chunk of the spending each month and the BCH values seem to fluctuate based exchange rate.
4	1526252468	0	No, everything is done in BCH, including payroll. Last month was kind of brutal to be honest because of the massive price drop.Please see my comment below on why humanresources is the amount it is.
5	1526252757	12	Please Paul don’t be stupid, a price drop in BCH doesn’t account for the AMOUNT OF FIAT you’re spending.
6	1526277235	-4	Triple the spends in a month, yes it is.Stop being so toxic
7	1526287997	9	No it doesn’t, stop, think, then comment.
8	1526288708	-5	I did think. Pay a man €500 in bch one month or the next and while price goes down....Really, go away from this community if you are destructive in your stupidity. 
9	1526289602	9	They pay 2000$ this month which is an x amount of BCH. Next month, they pay 2000$ again. If the price dropped, they spend more BCH but their report isn’t in BCH, it’s in fiat. Their spending in FIAT doesn’t increase if the price of BCH drops like their spending doesn’t decrease if price rises.
3	1526250381	15	Right but that wasn’t the story you told the past months while collecting donations was it? Also totally ignoring the numbers.Lighthouse yes, the project cryptonize.it is giving resources to to resurrect. Cryptonize.it yes the company you haven’t supported in any way since it’s inception. 
2	1526276493	-6	So basically you're fucking a good project right in the ass because they wont promote your business, and you're going to become a pawn for shit-hole blockstream to capitalize on and destroy Bitcoin Cash reputation even more, because of your own personal temper tantrum?
1	1526263510	-4	He is twisting facts to create false drama. He actually is spreading this to benefit himself. This isn't some charity for giving things to the poor. So this is how the money is meant to be spent.
2	1526277028	-3	The part that pisses me off is that he knows full-well this is going to be used as ammunition against Bitcoin Cash.
3	1526281927	-6	He does not seem to care about the business that cryptonize.it will lose through his behavior.
0	1526283436	2	All I’m interested in is making sure that people who are volunteering like Amaury, have their bills paid for. I’m not a charity guy so I don’t know how the figures work out. I just don’t want our best talent having to work other projects to pay the bills. Which is why I suggested Amaury gets a patreon. Or bch equivalent.
0	1526267102	-4	OP I can’t even decipher the title of this post. What is your point
0	1526263701	-4	Oh man. Shut your shill hole.
0	1526264997	-8	Its not like they are going to buy things, they are a marketing team, the money is spent on marketing.
0	1526254051	15	The bitcoin community needs to realize that it’s a ruthless system with people ruthlessly competing to achieve their goals. 
1	1526254594	10	You’re quoting me https://twitter.com/ari_cryptonized/status/993397280341397504?s=21
2	1526277314	2	Quick, shake him too!!
0	1526268023	-6	If they are producing valuable assets/materials, why is the fact that so much of their costs are "salaries" a problem? Shouldn't they be paying the people who they get to create the materials they create? Or should everyone be working for free on their projects??
0	1526251105	3	Money report. I do not see such amounts: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6WZ0_4uIF80JByduAmI4zphnh3hM_jSgjJEgB2ZoSE/edit#gid=0
1	1526251257	19	Go add the numbers up yourself if you don’t believe me. Why would I make it up? You can check it.
2	1526251379	21	I agree. We need a more detailed report.
0	1526260647	11	...and not a satoshi to help out the main developers who really need some funding.What use is all the marketing and spreading the good word, if the devs don't have time to put into keeping the system stable and robust, because they have to worry about paying rent or passing the hat around for donations ?
1	1526264411	-8	The Bitcoin Cash Fund have decided to not fund developers. The last time an organisation did that, well, you got Blockstream.Not that I'm against funding devs by any means but it's a huge conflict of interest imo.
2	1526270351	8	and I replied at the time, suggesting how they could _fairly_ support all the 3 main dev teams without showing any bias - namely, allocate funds according to node market share [ using public stats on how many mining nodes run each implementation ] .  This way, their donation is allocated by the votes of miners, so shows no favoritism on the part of BCF.But no, they prefer to hoard the cash and only spend it on Salaries, and internal Marketing projects [ without telling anyone they weren't interested in external or dev projects ]I'm not saying its bad to put funds into marketing..  I'm saying its bad to not put a small amount towards shoring up the stability of the code base, because it really is needed there, and a small amount say 2% of their cash hoard could really alleviate some pain.  An amount negligible in terms of the salaries of BCF employees could help Bitcoin ABC tremendously.
3	1526280419	0	There are no public stats about how many nodes miners run.Devs should get funded based on concrete projects, like Terab, or by sponsors like BU and ABC.
3	1526277412	0	There isn't "a codebase".Abc already has salaries. 
0	1526258805	-10	OP is an autistic turd, please for all our sakes, ignore his dumb ass. 
0	1526270226	11	Really simple, everyone. Don't give your money to strangers to invest for you.I've seen all the BCF stuff on here and I hope they are doing some good, but I know I'm not giving them any money. If you're someone who disagrees, here, I'll invest your money for you:qq3kcn74tz9q3pwfkwjpsp8dcw85j7m7f5rg7hwfwd
1	1526279411	4	Nonsense. If it’s investing, it’s somewhat likely that a stranger can do a better job.But it’s giving, which is why it’s better to take care of it personally.
0	1526270730	-8	This seems good to me? 
0	1526266913	1	Oh you mean the 10%. Got ya, i meant total for this month
0	1526268418	-10	The whole cryyptonize.it team is a bunch of statists
0	1526297610	10	total waste of money.
0	1526274608	-2	Meanwhile Dash has [6176.72 DASH available for funding proposed projects every month, roughly $2.5 million.] ( https://www.dashcentral.org/budget) The allocation of funds are voted on blockchain by the biggest stackholders.  The entire voting/allocation is programmed into the blockchain and funds are issued from a monthly "super block" making the entire process completely decentralized.
1	1526288056	11	Dash is not Bitcoin.
1	1526279307	5	The part I don’t like about it is money always gets spent - too similar to the way government budget works. 
2	1526279862	2	The money is suppose to be spent. That is the whole point.  Bitcoin is meant to be spent. Bitcoin miners spend the emissions also, they have bills to pay. The difference is that Dash  puts 10% of the emissions toward Real Work, not only just Proof of Work mining.  That is why they have $2.5 million a month in development budget.  
1	1526275899	1	sybil attacks much?
2	1526276456	1	Not likely.  One needs 1000 Dash to run a masternode and vote.  There are currently [4,862 masternodes.] (https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dash/masternodes.dws)   Not to mention the financial loss someone would take if they even attempt a sybil attack.
