2	1526287094	1	Bitcoin Core supporter: when name and ticker import more that real network characteristics and incentives.
2	1526269204	-6	Yeah, /u/ShatterDae is either a sock puppet (interesting account age, bro) or just got suckered by the BCash crowd. Real innovation is happening on BTC. BCash is simply upping the limit parameter to hype the project. Meanwhile it's processing less than a TX per second, which is what BTC was doing all the way back in 2013. Anyone who buys into the working narrative here is pretty dim-witted or is maliciously trying to pass their bags along for a higher price. Good luck to OP.
3	1526272766	5	gypsytoy: *I don’t seem to be coming back. I basically have the same story as OP except that I went from investing everything I had (as a college student) to buy 60 BTC in 2013 and holding strong for a solid 4 years. Then having a mental health crisis during 2016 and giving 20 BTC away to strangers online who took advantage of me, never to be seen again. Then in December, days before the top, I learned what margin trading actually was. Mad a tiny bit. Lost a good amount while falling asleep during a drop and then chasing the whole thing (40 BTC) down to 0.02 BTC.**I’m beyond devastated. I’m confident that I’m going to end my life over this and I’ve already begun separating myself from the world and getting my affairs in order. I feel weird revealing and admitting this on reddit, but this post hits home, as does the one of the main sub about the guy’s brother who killed himself over the same situation. I admire those who can weather setbacks of this kind but I’m not one of them. I knew from the minute I read the white paper that Bitcoin was a game changing idea. I poured my savings into it, confident that my stack would be worth a million (20K) within 5 years (I called this almost perfectly). It’s not even like I want to live an extravagant lifestyle, I just wanted to feel financially safe for once in my life and wanted to share the wealth with those close to me and help build positive businesses and a better world. The pump and dumpers and Lamborghini memes are so obnoxious, as if the world needs any more mindless hedonistic consumerism. I grew up pretty poor and bounced from foster home to foster home and from school to school. I barely made it through college and have no marketable skills. I lost my dead end sales job a few months back and can’t bring myself to go back to barely getting buy. I held strong throughout the years, even though I could’ve certainly used the money at times. I always brought my own lunch to work and always took the subway when I could instead of paying for Uber. I invested a few thousand dollars back in 2013 and never saw a penny of it. OP is much more honorable than me because I certainly don’t have the self respect to turn down donations but I’m also pretty certain that people aren’t donating to the small army of people who are in the same situation and I obviously don’t deserve it anyway. When I run into friends, they always ask about how well I must be doing because they know I’ve been a Bitcoin proponent for a long time. Smiling and looking at them in the eye while talking positively about Bitcoin is incredibly taxing and I immediately want to throw up in the nearest trash can afterwards. I know somewhere else in the universe, there’s a ‘me’ who decided against margin trading or stopped after a few losses or didn’t start playing bull at the beginning of a bear market. Not me though, I’m a fool and I squandered the only thing going for me in life. I hope others heed the warnings, but I know most won’t. Either way, I don’t have the type of mind to let something like this go and I can’t stand to watch Bitcoin moon again and be left behind. It’s sad that money can have such power over people. I know many have had their lives dramatically changed for the better but I suppose there are two sides to the coin. I don’t even know why I still obsess over Bitcoin and this sub. I literally can’t think of anything else most of the time. I guess I keep hoping that it will drop to some very low amount and that I’ll be able to buy back in but that doesn’t make sense because I don’t have $10 to my name to put back in. I’m going to lose my unemployment benefits and housing in a few months and really have nowhere to turn once that happens. I know most people would pull themselves up by their bootstraps and carry on but I know that I could never escape my mind. Sorry to rant negatively on your kind and reasoned comment. I wish OP the best and he seems to have a much better attitude towards the ordeal than I do, even with the stakes being that much higher. edit: I mostly regret posting this. I sort of figured it would get buried, didn’t realize that this thread was still pretty active and that I posted on the top comment. Thanks for the comments, PMs and kind words. I’m not in immediate danger of anything and wasn’t trying to start a pity party for myself. Nonetheless, thank you all for your concern.*

0	1526245572	11	Welcome! Try memo.cash and you'll be amazed!
1	1526249675	5	I've been looking at it. Gotta beat bot ridden Twitter. I'll join soon. :)
0	1526248609	18	protip: you don't have to pick a side... support both!I use BCH mostly, but also support BTC. I hope it proves a viable competitor.
1	1526251385	8	Maybe the term 'picking sides' exactly what I meant. But I can honestly say that the toxicity surrounding kept me from buying more BTC. As I see more "BCH accepted here" posts and signs, it seems clear that adoption is ramping up and makes me more bullish. I haven't sold all my BTC, since I think it would be good to keep what I have as a hedge. I'm just bullish on crypto all together, I'm ready for the day when we can just all transact on the blockchain for day to day expenses. 
2	1526256090	7	I agree with adoption of BCH and it’s exciting watching more and more places start accepting it. The Bitcoin Cash logo is catchy and the PR campaign is on point for encouraging adoption.That said, the toxicity and whining I’m seeing is primarily out of /r/btc, not in the other subreddits. If this community could stop with that negative crap, there is no stopping BCH!
2	1526252600	3	cheers to that
2	1526265473	1	If you think the reddit community is representative of the value or utility of a coin then you might as well give up now. This isn’t the console wars. 
1	1526313932	2	You think BTC is a competitor of BCH? For real? I think you are a little bit confused.
1	1526253561	-9	You should also take a look on LTC. It has huge adoption, lower fees and faster transactions!
2	1526255430	9	I haven't seen any good reason to use LTC. Based on my observation the adoption is poor, the fees are not lower than BCH, the transactions are not faster than BCH in any meaningful way, and LTC disenfranchises holders on the original blockchain. For those reasons I'm bearish on LTC.
3	1526264023	2	At the moment, the only reason to support LTC is if you use Charlie Lee as an anti-signal.
3	1526256531	1	> Based on my observation the adoption is poor, popular operating system repositories has litecoin node and wallet included, there are many merchants accepting litecoin, there are many development libraries available for working with LTC chain. Much more wallet implementations compared to BCH. Such services as open-source BTCPay Server for payment processing are available for accepting litecoins out of box.remember, LTC started in 2011> fees are not lower than BCHthey are. i spent today all the day on this subreddit trying to tell folks about LTC. you are third or fourth sayin that fees aren't lower. Where did you get it?Sample tx: https://chain.so/tx/LTC/a98a95f97d9537e4b123fe11b3c046fca438de2efbdc169e6b3f6cb8ee95c030Sent $1, paid in fees $0.00036716LTC fees are lower mathematically for now:Litecoin: 0.226 kb * 0.00001 LTC/kb * $140 = $0.0003668 in feesBitcoin Cash: 226 bytes * 1 sat/byte / 100,000,000 (divide by this to convert satoshis to BCH) * $1460 = $0.0033 in feesfees in LTC ar 10x cheaper than in BCH> transactions are not faster than BCH LTC has instant 0-conf transactions as well as BCH, but LTC block-time is 2.5 minutes, which is 4x faster than BTC or BCH if you need irreversable transaction. When you send LTC to exchange it takes about ~15 minutes, while when you send BCH to exchange it takes ~60 minutes.> LTC disenfranchises holders on the original blockchainlolwhut? what you mean with "original blockchain"? how that affects avarege joe who is using crypto as payment method to pay for porn online?>  For those reasons I'm bearish on LTC.Maybe it time to change your mind, if your reasons are not reasonable.
4	1526260393	3	I'm open to be convinced that another coin has a liquidity / adoption advantage, but I'll have to see it with my own eyes.I should have changed "fees not lower" to also read "fees not meaningfully lower". I can pay any fee and be included in a BCH block, so that's ~$0.I don't consider faster blocktimes to be an advantage, as I haven't observed any significant practical or theoretical differences. The services I use all accept BCH on few confirmations.RE: disenfranchising holdersPart of the reason the average joe (or anyone) holds crypto is because they believe it will retain value over time. If blockchain adaptation primarily occurs via hardfork of the original blockchain, value will be retained very well and holders can sleep at night even as technology morphs over time. If adaptation occurs via flippenings to brand new coins, holding becomes harder and crypto becomes less valuable.I'm open to hearing more - I appreciate the genuine thought you put into your post to point out the merits of LTC as you see it.
4	1526259872	1	JESUS CHRIST. I always thought ltc's minimun relay fee was 10 sat/byte which is normally about 0.0001 ltc/kb. But your telling me we can go even lower! Damn, these guys lied hard.  At what point will ltc's fees cost more than bch?
5	1526261070	1	Actually, if i am not wrong, the minimum relay fee was 100 sat/byte (arbitary limit) before LTC price rised. There was no problem before even with such fees. This year this limit was removed, due to price rise. Also beside fee there are slightly faster blocks and light tx's (1 output & 1 input is about 130 bytes), what matters. You need to use updated wallets to benefit from low fees. I tested with Electrum-LTC v3.1.3 and Loafwallet on iPhone. For sure you can use original wallet with full node as well. The main reason that LTC is non-commercial project without marketing. Many developers are silently working hard on making LTC better every day, but it is hard to hear about new features on newspapers, beause no one has time for this, everyone is focused on work. So you need afford a time little bit  to keep updated and informed.Cheers!
6	1526264972	1	It's sad that they downvoted your post. This sub screams that their anti censhorship but they fling out downvotes to anything that isn't pro bch. That wouldn't be a problem if they didn't add "anti-spam" measures which prevents you from posting a lot and engaging in dicussions if your comment karma is 'too low'. Literally you could not post on the r/btc sub for a full month. Then one day decide to engage in a discussion. Type out a well thought a reply, hit save. But no. You will presented with a message that says 'You are doing that too much. Please try again in 5 minutes.' It's interesting how you will receive a number of downvotes. But the people who downvoted will not even reply telling you why they didn't agree.echo
7	1526294343	3	many of redditors here believe that there are no vote manupulation :D i heard answers, that i am "technically wrong" while bringing purely technical facts with simple math. So there is no actually any chance to begin a dialog. Blind downvoting, forced unvoting. If any such post gets 2-3 votes, in minutes it is downvoted to 0/-1 vote.  You can also see upvoted absolutely pointless posts. Also, i like when redditors here are pushing some idiotic facts without any sources and actual understanding of what they are talking. Example:- BCH fees are cheapest!- LN does not work!- *company_name* is government financed-  BCH has huge adoption and development (while does not understand what development means at all)- BCH has high liquidity!- *respectable_developer_or_computer_scientist_name* is a liar!- BCH is accepted almost everywhere!gs makes me think that and so on.. all these things makes me think that majority is cult-driven. They do not care about technology, just repeating like parrots what their leaders told them. It is absolutely destructive path. While i have BCH and used as well, i cannot recommend it to anyone serious due to such toxic and idiotic behavior in this community, it simply may cause my reputation in real world.
7	1526267744	2	litecoin is headed by a known scammer and liar charlie lee who sold all his litcon and is known to be associated with insider trading.https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/coinbase-insider-trading-litecoin-edition-be64ead3faccfurther litcoin offers no technical benfits over bitcoin and with segregated witness it has a much more complex development and basic uunderstanding which hurts new investors, users, and devs. We have been here for many years, since litecon came out and watched it this whole time, if it really had any advantaged you would have heard about it. 
3	1526258772	0	LTC has a much bigger (exponentially) real world footprint than bch. It also has a much longer history so it is entrenched and more established. Im not sure how you think it disenfranchises holders  as this doesn't make sense to me. fees, transaction times etc are mostly negligible between the 2. 
4	1526267576	3	bitcoin is older than litcoin. Are you trying to say litecoin is older than bitcoin? 
5	1526283551	1	Btc is older than litecoin. Bch started less than a year ago. 
2	1526257447	3	It has a ridiculous supply, the total supply will be 4x that of BTC. LTC is not rare.LTC has no point, they never upgraded the network apart from adding Segshit. It's stuck with Scrypt which now has no point as there are ASICs for that too now. So their original point of forking from BTC is moot.
3	1526257818	2	> It has a ridiculous supply, the total supply will be 4x that of BTC. LTC is not rare.O____________________o man, are you serious? NOT RARE?! Following your logic - tokens are much cheaper, so you can buy more! But this is completely destructive point.> LTC has no pointWith extremely low transaction fees (10x lower compared to BCH) and faster blocks it is perfectly suitable for micro-payments. As well as for everyday spending.
4	1526258105	2	It has no scaling solution and has never hard forked. LN won't work of course and the 1 MB blocks every 2.5 mins will eventually fill up if it ever gains much acceptance.
5	1526261641	1	charlie said he will increase the block size. no smoke
5	1526258698	0	> has never hard forked.So you think hard-forking is something necessary for scaling? Litecoin was created with scaling solutions.>  LN won't work of courseLN is already working and widely tested. Are you in 2018? Even BCH community is open for LN - https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8j5nwe/does_the_lightning_network_require_any_changes/>  blocks every 2.5 mins will eventually fill up if it ever gains much acceptance."BCH blocks will fill up  if it ever gains much acceptance." - this makes no more sense that what you are saying.  C'mon, educate yourself, please.
6	1526261037	3	> LN is already working and widely tested. Are you in 2018? Even BCH community is open for LNEducate yourself, please. At least a valid response to these videos which prove LN can never work:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8NH67_EfEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZOrtlQXWcLN has no valid scaling solution and no scaling plan other than unworkable LN.> "BCH blocks will fill up  if it ever gains much acceptance." - this  makes no more sense that what you are saying.What's going to fill up faster, LN with its 4 MB every 10 minutes, or BCH with 32 MB every 10 minutes. Which can handle more transactions? Plus BCH has an actual scaling plan to continue increasing the block size. LN is Core/BlockStream's testnet lapdog.
7	1526262350	-1	Dude, you are so wrong.. sorry for that..> At least a valid response to these videos which prove LN can never work:1) Why to build a conclusion on some politician opinion? These videos makes no point from technical viewpoint. I've seen them. Actually, lightning works already, even in "bleeding edge"  statues. So why you are spreading misinformation that it cant work? Yesterday was last time i made LN tx on BTC network.> LN with its 4 MB every 10 minutes2) Khm... LN payments has nothing to do with blocksize. These are off-chain. These payments are instant and almost free. What you mean with 4MB? What you mean with 10 min? Originally i was talking about LTC with 2.5 minutes per block. With LN the network trougput is thousands tps (tx per second). > BCH has an actual scaling plan to continue increasing the block size.  3) BCH with 32MB has about 120 tps, but blocksize is not the only parameter that allows such troughput.. it requires 50 Mbit/s connection between nodes (what is nearly impossible now if we are talking about  for connection world-wide between computers) with very high computational requirements. Technically, 32MB blocks cannot be utilized for now.4) On the other side, there is a Litecoin, with ~50 tps already, without LN. LN gives it exponential grow possibilities. But for now even 50 tps is more than enough.Are you buying maximum size hard drives for you computer every time such appears on market, or you add more hdd space when you're existing hdd are almost full?> Educate yourself, please.Are you a parrot? why are you repeating my suggestion? I think i have much deeper knowledge of crypto then you. Cuz i am arguing driven not by videos on youtube but based on my own researches and professional experience in fintech.
2	1526267553	1	I don't think that is factually true, it is hampered by segregated witness, is more expensive than bch, doens't have reliable 0-confirmation txs, and the leader cahrlie just screams scam artist
3	1526299370	1	> it is hampered by segregated witnessDo you at least understand what SegWit is?>  is more expensive than bchIn what? in price? No. In fees? Again no. LTC fees are 10x cheaper compared to BCH> doens't have reliable 0-confirmation txslolwhut? BCH also doesn't have. any 0-conf isnt truly reliable. Have you any exchange that accepts BCH deposits with "reliable" 0-conf confirmations?> and the leader cahrlie just screams scam artisti didn't saw screaming charlie, but i saw screaming roger calling BCH his project - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJT2CbfHTpo&t=42m10sDo you know that BCH by the way has CEO? http://bitcoincash.org/letter-from-the-ceo.pdfThe best part describing majority of community from this letter: "MONKEY SEE, MONKEY DO."

1	1526250818	9	Nothing. Hedging your bets is a smart thing to do
2	1526252899	2	Yup. I'm no fan of Bcash but I hold it in a 1:1 ratio with Bitcoin. Peace of mind and all that.

1	1526261453	3	If you're not really certain there is nothing wrong with having both, most of the space is still highly speculative and anyone's game to become global leaders (though I think BTC itself is a dead end roadmap now however), I hold ETH and a lot of other stuff with my BCH for this reason.
1	1526262677	1	Nothing. But my mentality at first was BCH was a cash grab, etc. That obviously has changed. I'm not anti BTC by any means. It just took me a while to get out of the mindset created by lack of knowledge and from paying too much attention to trolls from both sides. 
0	1526270298	3	I have been on the fence about these two forks. But I disagree that BTC is shit posts and BCH are enlightening ones. CEO Rick makes great YouTube posts but it's the BCH stream on Reddit that keeps turning me off. So many haters here hating on the other camp whereas I see almost no such reciprical hate from the other team. They just go their own way. I think maybe your post is a solicitation for validation to help you cope with mixed feelings you're still enduring after making the BCH plunge. I don't think BCH is a mistake. But I'm not ready to get off the fence yet.

3	1526260989	2	I appreciate it, thank you! 
0	1526258587	2	the smart answer is probably to own both. Roger Ver does as well. If you are holding coins for the appreciation then they are akin to stocks and then the best strategy is probably to diversify a bit of at least the top 5 to 10 coins. I would say with the lack of maturity in crypto, probably only the top 5 would hold merit while anything after that would be much more speculative. My 5 would probably be btc, ltc, eth, bch,  and xmr. 
0	1526259520	2	Welcome. I encourage you to continue questioning and think for yourself. I have found /r/bitcoin can be reasonable if you are reasonable and preface the shit out of it so they don't feel attacked. I recently had a discussion about block size with them and we were able to have an adult conversation. I am relatively new to crypto, so my arguments may not have been that great, but they were at least willing to hear me out. ([here's the link](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8isl58/found_a_helpful_infographic_could_be_handy_to/dyuw83s/) if you care to read).I too have moved my 'investing' to BCH, but hope to use it in real-life in the future as an actual currency.

0	1526254590	3	You shouldn't "pick sides". Crytpocurrencies aren't a religion or an ideology, as some people act like it is.You can support both BTC and BCH, as well as ETH or any other crypto.They will compete with eachother, and the superior tech will become more popular.Also, you mentioned about toxicity surrounding BTC. I can assure you that the majority of toxicity is from BCH fans against BTC. That's just a fact at this point.Support both. Don't fall into the hole.

2	1526292050	2	Aside from the huge amount of financial backing BTC/Bitcoin has, continued expansion of their LN, continued adoption (most recently, German banks are adopting Bitcoin's tech), I suppose there's not much actual reason to support Bitcoin/BTC.But then again, I suppose I'm unlike you. I back multiple cryptocurrencies in addition to Bitcoin/BTC and Bitcoin Cash/BCH. I can sit on the sidelines and see the absurdity of people like you, screaming "BTC ISN'T THE REAL BITCOIN!" and see just how damaging it is to the cryptosphere.Where one would rather engage in stupid PR mantra, rather than engage in and support the tech involved, is hugely lacking in dignity, and it's just very very sad.

0	1526292265	1	Can you tell me briefly why you chose BCH over BTC? I still can't understand exactly everything going on with people saying BCH is a scam etc..
0	1526264894	1	As long as you know that Btc = bitcoin and bch = an altcoin off bitcoin, you’re good. 
1	1526267966	1	really? let's compare the bitcoin whitepaperbitcoin, a peer to peer electronic cashbch is p2p, it's e-cashbtc forced you to use the LN so not p2p, it's a store of value by it's own devs, so not a cash.so based on the very most absolutally basic uses for bitcoin, bch i sbitoicn and btc is something which stole the name 
2	1526314061	1	You should compare the hashrates. The consensus wins the wars not some abstract papers.
0	1526248416	-1	Ouch lol 😕
0	1526264022	0	I am so confused. I thought this was the r/btc sub, yet everyone is promoting BCH. I own equal amounts of each; legit confused. Can someone explain this strange dichotomy? It seems to me both are valuable and usable in their own rights. 
1	1526267898	1	There is a large FAQ on the top of this subreddit that explains the issue, but for most long term bitcoin users the bitocin they joined and used to use is now known as bitcoin cash and what is called bitcoin (btc) is little resmeblance to the bitcoin we learned about, got others to use, used ourselves, and even want

0	1526248790	-13	Brah, You need to buy all the parts. Otherwise you don't really have a bitcoin. > The more I read, the more I became convinced that BTC was no longer the same BTC that had interested me for years.You don't even bitcoin because you trade alts so get out with this pie in the sky talk. It's like saying you don't like the color of my bedroom meanwhile you like in a glasshouse. Like WTF, you have no leg to stand on for an opinion.

1	1526286597	1	[Here's the Bitcoin white paper](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin). Please point out some aspects where BTC is more Bitcoin than BCH?
2	1526290156	1	My untouched cold storage bitcoins are 100% more bitcoin than your stash of BCH
3	1526290208	1	So you can't even point out a single aspect, then?
4	1526292652	2	I'm not doing your homework for you kid, just buy equal amount of each fork and you'll have the true bitcoin again.
0	1526281219	-1	Jesus christ. New guys *actually* fall for it? You own BCH but \*not\* BTC? Sorry, but you're crazy. Right now is probably one of the most important times to own two particular coins than ever before, probably in the ratio of the price. The most experienced minds couldn't guess this. But a new guy comes in, reads Bitcoin. com and thinks he has it all worked out. Just...wow.
