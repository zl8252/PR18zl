0	1526259281	66	I hereby ban the government of Zimbabwe for crimes against humanity.
1	1526305144	3	> I hereby ban ~~the government of Zimbabwe~~ all governments for crimes against humanity consisting of generation upon generation of theft, rape and murder.
0	1526265084	33	the funny thing is : given how unstable zimbabwe fiat is, one of the most likely scenarios is that businesses will adopt anyway and bribe the regulators in bitcoin
1	1526292645	4	It's exactly what will happen. Economics always trump politics
1	1526303164	1	How unstable Zimbabwe currency is?
0	1526266283	19	The article reads that it is only a ban on financial institutions using digital currencies or providing services around the digital assets.
1	1526292597	2	For now
1	1526312022	1	That's effectively removing it from the economy. P2P commerce won't work if you have nowhere to cash in.
2	1526312792	1	Commerce isnt the only use of crypto.
0	1526259324	6	The Zimbabwe government is taking its citizen protection job very seriously.
0	1526288824	3	Isn't this the point of crypto? That it's censorship proof and trustless. This shouldn't make a difference.
1	1526312119	1	No, and that's the biggest argument against crypto. That governments can still ban it at the end of the day and jail you if they discover you're using it. 
0	1526288993	3	... then they fight you...
0	1526274492	4	Now they'll have to ban the internet as well.
1	1526276111	2	hahaha
0	1526262464	6	Zimbabwe money is so much better...[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean\_dollar#/media/File:Zimbabwe\_$100\_trillion\_2009\_Obverse.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar#/media/File:Zimbabwe_$100_trillion_2009_Obverse.jpg)
1	1526284468	1	Looks like something Dr. Evil would be interested in.
0	1526302995	2	And exactly how are they going to enforce this "ban"?. I just watch the AAntop vids and laugh when I see govts try and pull this bs. 
0	1526258690	3	Title translated into reality:> The political/rulers of Zimbabwans declare private property exchanges in crypto of serfs living within Zimbabwe borders will be jacked if they continue after 2-mo.
1	1526296446	1	> jacked
0	1526287255	2	It's going to be great looking back at all these idiot politicians who were anti-crypto when fiat is dead.For those who are unaware, cryptocurrency is the future of money for humanity.  The old way of money is archaic in comparison.  It's not a matter of IF crypto takes over, it's WHEN.  If you're one of the people who can't wait to cash out your crypto earnings so you can buy that new shiny object, you're on the wrong side of history and you will miss out.
0	1526274574	1	So, stealth wallets, then.
0	1526292308	1	Thereâ€™s no stopping technology wether governments like it or not
0	1526296497	1	So we see a trend here. Governments which destroy people's wealth through unlimited fiat printing are moving towards banning cryptocurrencies. So if your governments announces a ban like this, you know that they are doing something dodgy and are about to wipe out your income and savings with inflation.
0	1526307305	1	In the mean time politicians from Zimbabwe start stacking up cryptos. Just like the ones from Venezuela. Screw them all!
0	1526309245	1	Man, I am so glad that the British destroyed Rhodesia. That worked out so well for the blacks there. 
0	1526318011	1	Its funny how government openness to crypto clearly shows which governments rule by oppression and which run with reasonable respect of its citizens. 
0	1526285043	1	Its not gay when its in zinmbabwe
0	1526256794	-15	Haha who cares 
1	1526263620	16	I'm sure you'd care if you lived there.
1	1526266370	6	I think you mean "I don't care" as others certainly do care.
1	1526292547	2	I care about economical freedom everywhere in the world
0	1526278109	-4	[removed]
1	1526287502	3	You know, there are much easier and better ways to earn money than by trying to steal from people.  Just saying.  Good luck with all that.  I trust you'll find true happiness one day.
