1	1526301195	4	Thanks ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ
0	1526303738	6	Does IPFS provide any protection against law enforcement and other snoopers, or can people figure out which files you have accessed from the network or by looking at your HDD contents?
1	1526312154	2	IPFS is not currently designed to be private. By default, you announce all the file hashes you have locally every 24 hours. Anyone can see pretty easily what you have been browsing unless you disable that and use a VPN or Tor or similar. 
1	1526309238	1	If you care about law enforcement or the NSA seeing what you access, you should be using a VPN. Also if you don't want people looking at your HDD contents, use a copy of Linux with at least the home folder encrypted.
2	1526309367	1	Why not something like Freenet?
3	1526310248	1	I haven't tried Freenet myself, so I can't recommend it. If you want to try it out there’s nothing stopping you, as I'm just a random person on the internet out of millions.Edit: Spelling
0	1526310429	3	Excellent. Don't listen to the trolls wringing their hands about muh illegal content. Lack of censorship is just a feature, a tool. If every incredible new technology/implementation was immediately abandoned because someone might do something bad with it, we would all be eating cold berries in the forest.I wager millions of people will soon be able to use memo.cash's lack of censorship to make their lives much better. The people who are most afraid are not thinking of the children, they are thinking of their grip on the minds of their citizens and how easily it will slip away when they no longer control the flow of information./u/chaintip

1	1526311712	1	Hey thanks for the massive tip! : )Let's see how this goes. I'll definitely help with implementing this if it makes sense to the memo guys and the community, and once any problems are ironed out.
0	1526307321	3	btw, I think we're in danger of having multiple, but only slightly varying protocol implementations so I'm collecting all information related to Memo Protocols, proposals and discussion here -https://github.com/memberapp/protocol/blob/master/README.md
0	1526311622	3	I’ve been thinking about something just like this. I think it should definitely be built to support HLS. hls.js makes it really easy to have a web player in pretty much any browser that will pick a good bitrate/resolution for the client. I’ve done a little experimenting with it and made a docker container with ffmpeg and ipfs to make the trandcode and upload easy. Still needs lots of docs, but the basics are working. Very early prototype player: https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipns/ipfstube.stytt.com
0	1526303520	2	Freenet links would work as well if you wanted actual censorship resistance and users to not get in trouble for uploading/downloading the content on their computers as it's anonymous.
1	1526304505	3	Right now it's about which protocol will be the most fit. BitTorrent through magnets with the awesome WebTorrent, IPFS, Freenet links or something else. I think it has to work from an average browser in order to succedd
0	1526310446	2	Sweetness, nice work!
0	1526317565	2	Ipfs is such a great project. Truly awesome. 
0	1526308398	1	WOw this is great
0	1526311992	1	This is truly awesome and a perfect application of IPFS for maximum decentralization and censorship resistance. Filecoin could potentially take it a step further for large files and incentivizing Memo and similar nodes by getting paid to provide storage options.It is this kind of development that will move cryptocurrency out of the speculative doghouse into being a real economy full of services people actually use.
0	1526315665	1	why not store images directly on the chain instead of this ipfs thing where they could get lost
0	1526316289	1	You could host text files this way and extend your memo's max text length.There's of course a bit of a problem with privacy and plausible deniability in this and there's always a chance for stuff to disappear if they aren't hosted on the blockchain. The text and files aren't guaranteed to load at the same time and in 10 years who knows if anybody have a copy left of that image that went with the text.It might be possible to host all files in the blockchain, at no more cost than the fees: https://www.yours.org/content/how-to-put-any-file-s--into-the-blockchain-using-output-scripts-963a484943f3Of course there's not really a need to store every single meme image ever on the chain, so off-chain file references are a good idea. Saves on money to post the thing as well. Though I would still like the ability to put a select few important files onto the blockchain.
0	1526304081	1	Would something like siacoin also work?  What would be the advantages/disadvantages of both?
1	1526304956	3	Siacoin is less sound. Other details are not very interesting. I'm interested at the most immutable ledgers of the world: BTC and BCH. Otherwise, why don't just use a server?
1	1526305446	3	Siacoin sucks. I went all in with it and the app just blows. It takes up too many resources, it is not user friendly, it requires the use of its own coin which is pointless... It just sucks.
2	1526307346	3	To be fair, they aren't advertising it as a finished product.I love Siacoin but I refuse to invest in it because I think it's just a matter of time before someone builds a better version on the BCH blockchain. The same can be said for most altcoins -- these niche purposes are cool, but they would work so much better if they all shared the same secure ledger.
3	1526312340	1	There are quite a few independent coins now that started as BTC dapps. You an thank Blockstream for destroying this momentum and fragmenting the space away from unifying behind one base protocol. Bitcoin originally started out a lot more like Ethereum than people think (Ethereum itself another that became its own chain after being forced away). Its a protocol to build services on, which BTC developers forgot long ago. 
1	1526312032	2	AFAICT, siacoin is more for backups. since content is encrypted, you can’t easily share it publicly without having a public gateway with the decryption keys. 
0	1526304283	1	How are we gonna stop disgusting things like child porn? I like the idea of IPFS but you know that is gonna be an issue if it is not already.
1	1526304645	8	> How are we gonna stop disgusting things like child porn?By not filming it, not consuming it and by having a law enforcement to fight those who film it cos it's not victimless, they exploit children. The same goes for revenge porn and for military, commercial or any type of secretBut! Sharing is not preventable without total control over information flowOtherwise it's a thought crime reality: "u talk about CP in any context, therefore u think about it, u like it, u're a criminal" in response to your innocent commentary
2	1526305545	3	Law enforcement can't stop something that is literally impossible to stop, right? I don't like blacklists, but this seems like a reasonable thing to consider blacklists for. Maybe a voting system within IPFS nodes or something.
3	1526305726	2	The only way. Like AdBlock - voluntary participation. Purging CP hashes from the ledger (and perverts' heads) is impossible
1	1526308153	3	IPFS is not a blockchain, so individual nodes can chose whether to store something or not. In order to avoid legal troubles, most nodes will chose not to store child porn, meaning it will be harder to access. Edit: added explanation on why child porn will not be a problem on IPFS
2	1526308377	1	It's encrypted on their node and they do not know what they are hosting AFAIK.
3	1526311116	2	[I'm pretty sure the only thing that is encrypted by default is communications,](https://np.reddit.com/r/ipfs/comments/3njg9f/is_ipfs_encrypted_by_default_because_it_should_be/cvoo1fe/) meaning that node operators can still look at files stored on their node, unless it's different now, or someone uploaded a file that was already encrypted. Even if they cant view the files stored on their node due to a change that made all files stored on a node encrypted, they can just query the network for the file.Edit: NP link added
0	1526301291	-10	I like memo and all this but please don't be naive.. someone will post childporn or similar stuff, just to discredid the bitcoin cash community..I think memo + imgur&co is just fine
1	1526313721	1	Stuff like sharing CP has been happening basically since the birth of the web already. It doesn't suddenly become different because we start using a distributed file storage system like IPFS instead of centralized services like imgur, because that is not where people go to get disturbing content like CP. There are just protocols, and some people choose to abuse them and break the law with them. We can't really control that without just shutting down the entire Internet or completely centralizing it being overseen by a Ministry of Information to blacklist bad content. To be clear I am in no way condoning content like CP in the slightest, hopefully law enforcement is able to keep up with this tech to catch and incarcerate these terrible people. Further answers to the problem may be found in other areas like mental health and preventing the kind of early abuse that creates the kind of adult who would be into CP to break the cycle. Even AI and network oracles could be used to find and stomp this kind of content. Sadly there are no easy answers here as we march into the unknown. 
1	1526304814	1	It's not up to u. Bitcoin is neutral
2	1526305179	3	I'm not dictating anything, I'm giving an opinion. And this is up to me.
3	1526305229	3	True. Don't like it - don't use it, if u'd said "is just fine for me", there'd be no downvotes. **"I'll stop using Memo if after someone will post CP, memo.cash' owner won't do anything about it"** is much stronger messageWhat all people who will inevitably face this problem will do about it is worth a big separate discussion. I think only non-subjective open source filtering will be acceptable: total control over personal Feed. Ability to create whitelists. Databases of "bad content" u can choose to subscribe to much like AdBlock in order to filter your Feed
4	1526305478	1	I like memo, I also use it. Ultimately I think it's good to have uncensored information and some swarm-like mechanism to vote on hiding certain content. We will get there but right now I fear crypto is still young and very vulnerable.. in this phase I fear this could cause a lot of damage to BCH.
5	1526305937	2	I can understand the viewpoint, but disagree strongly. Crypto is anti-fragile and only attacks will make it stronger. Bitcoin Core's (as organization) actions created Bitcoin Cash, someone's posting CP will create a better Memo ecosystem - wide abilities to filter the noise outNo one solves problems until they hit people in the face. Only minority of people is building the future no matter what, the rest of us are waiting for miracles to happen our entire lives
6	1526306365	2	In some way you're right, crypto gets more robust by getting attacked (e.g. if exchanges are banned, trading will go underground p2p). But on the other hand crypto also gets more robust by getting more spread and used by as many people as possible. If 80% of a democratic population hold and use crypto then it will be almost impossible for that democracy to ban it. This is where we need to go but we're not there yet.So better not draw too much attention while we're not even really getting attacked yet.
7	1526306502	2	And I, on the other hand, welcome all the attacks!
8	1526307934	2	Ok :D I'm alright with disagreeing here
