0	1526249135	7	Here is the original AMA announcement thread found in the sidebar: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8iqx3r/jesse_lund_vice_president_ibm_blockchain_will_be/
1	1526270175	1	That's interesting.Does their Blockchain group overlap with cryptocurrencies?
2	1526271484	4	Yup. They have been actively using Stellar Lumens 
0	1526270463	7	Very interesting. Why on /r/btc? Isn't IBM mostly associated with Stellar?
1	1526288798	6	They did an AMA on r/stellar a few weeks back and then approached us asking if they could do one on r/btc. I'm not sure what their involvement with bitcoin is at the moment. You should ask them in a couple days.
2	1526292353	2	I'm happy that they chose /r/btc over the "other sub"!
3	1526298275	-4	They probably don’t realize they’re in the wrong sub

0	1526295038	1	It smells good
1	1526306148	1	[It](http://contracts.mywish.io/create?utm_source=com&utm_medium=S1405cherry&utm_campaign=redditS) smells even better. Like a cherry pie.
