0	1526287454	17	Haven't read the article yet, but John Blocke is back? Bullish!
1	1526288237	14	You are one of the most insightful and eloquent writers in the Bitcoin space. Reading your musings helped inspire me to start writing more articles again.
2	1526294344	2	Why are you not using yours.org yet? 
3	1526294500	5	I am. You can find the article here: https://www.yours.org/content/bitcoin-is-not-a-store-of-value%E2%80%94yet-f7f6bfd8ac92I posted it to Medium because I already have a bunch of followers there and it tends to reach a wider audience.
4	1526296370	4	When you post next time, just use the Yours.org in the link field and add the medium link as a comment. Medium is full of crypto censorship.

2	1526318484	1	You guys! Talk more to each other, preferably so the rest of the world can read it too! /u/ForkiusMaximus
0	1526293223	6	Great article man. I've been trying to raise awareness of this exact issue using that Wikipedia entry you cited, but your article really hammered the point into place.

Segwitcoin has hit the ceiling and can't go much higher because of the fee and strangled block situation.  While Bitcoin Cash has the potential to reach every person on this globe.  The market cap of all global cash is a lot bigger than the market cap of gold, so people should ask themselves which has more long term potential.
0	1526294061	5	Been too long John! Welcome back, we missed you!
0	1526304297	3	Gold and precious metals have a bit of intrinsic value. For gold, this is not as much as the price of gold would make you believe but it's something. Fiat has no intrinsic value and neither has bitcoin. But they are money systems, that when they work, provide utility and value for human beings. Take the euro for example. Great currency. Is accepted in a whole bunch of countries that decided to cooperate. But you can't directly send it on the internet and it's not a global currency. This is where Bitcoins enters human history. First money you can send directly from a computer to another computer. I know no borders. Its intrinsic value is still zero but the more it's accepted worldwide the greater its utility becomes. It becomes useful and if the network works, there is value in that. Which is why long-term Bitcoin Cash will have far greater utility and thus value then Bitcoin Core will ever have. Bitcoin Core is artificially limited money. Bitcoin Cash does not put an artificial limit on itself. The intrinsic value of Bitcoin Cash is zero but the more people believe in it, the greater it's usefulness for human beings. Same as with fiat. And it has a finite money supply. That's nice because our planet also has a finite amount of resources. The current fiat system has an infinite supply of money and requires an exponential economic growth to remain stable long-term. Which is impossible.

0	1526287021	2	yeah, that it is
0	1526280906	4	Well said and a great job calling out the deluded Novogratz. There is little to nothing unique about BTC (or any other cryptocurency). Either all are or none is, a store of value.A currency does not need be a store of value. They just need to be able to circulate value. If I want to buy you a beer I may need to send you 10 crypto-units today or maybe 12 or 8 units tomorrow. I don’t need to care about the exact amount, and neither do you, as I won’t acquire (and you won’t sell) the currency until the day the transaction happens. This way most users want to hold a small amount of the currency to lessen the inconvenience of acquiring it when needed (which is different from storing value). The value comes from a coin’s convenience for remote, permissionless and (pseudo)anonymous use, not from some inherent value or suitability for other purposes (which I believe is extremely limited, or even does not exist). 
0	1526305913	1	The author misunderstands that a store of value doesn't need to stay stable in terms of USD prices. In fact, for a new currency to displace the old, volatility is unavoidable as one loses value while the other gains and there is all kinds of price discovery in between.
0	1526286678	-12	Not surprisingly, this is poorly reasoned. The 'store of value' that Novogratz and others refer to is a stable store of value at *equilibrium*, not in its current speculative stage. The asset is just begin to burgeon. Yet, here you are mis-defining the value prop because you're willfully ignoring the fact that any emerging market is prone to volatility and nothing goes from zero to a million or beyond overnight. Markets are built, not wished into existence, which is what you're apparently attempting to do.Segwit is a block size increase and it approaching 40% adoption. That alone gets Bitcoin at least 2Mb, which is more than enough for now. Beyond that is a mixture of additional chain upgrades, like Schnorr, along with HF block size increases. Compare that with BCH, which is currently processing minuscule numbers of transactions, with blocks routinely below 100 Kb. No wonder BCH lacks congestion! Nobody's using it and the block limit are about to be about 400x where it needs to be. It's beyond stupid to think that something that is currently processing the number of transaction Bitcoin was **5 years ago** is somehow a superior asset. Look at volume, TXs, TX value, price, etc. etc. etc. Everything looks massively weak, especially for something that shares the same 9 year history as Bitcoin. It's the same age but worth 6 times less *after* a pump. /u/JohnBlocke, your argument is as solid as a straw house. Try harder.
1	1526287924	12	Yes, equilibrium stage BTC aims to be a store of value, and isn't now by the usual definitions. At least not a stable one. But you don't apply this same generosity to BCH as far as its use in commerce. And you seem to ignore the Fidelity Effect. Finally, despite it using the same ledger, its network effect in commerce had to start from scratch in August due to wallet-breaking changes it had to make due to it being the minority hashrate branch of the split. BCH is just getting started, and at "equilibrium" it can process *vastly* more transactions (likely 6 orders of magnitude more just following the normal design and operation of Bitcoin heretofore) without resort to a promised and unproven Lightning Network. 
2	1526289129	-9	>  its network effect in commerce had to start from scratch in August due to wallet-breaking changes it had to make due to it being the minority hashrate branch of the split. BCH is just getting started,Bullshit. It benefited from the existing distribution and wallet/exchange infrastructure was implemented quickly and is definitely in place at this point. There's no excuse for why BCH hasn't flipped BTC at this point in time. I mean there are plenty of *excuses* but none are valid. There's simply no demand because it's a terrible project, which is front run by con artists.
3	1526304364	3	The search continues...https://acceptbitcoin.cash/adoption/?skipToListings90% of merchants that accept BTC accept BCH now. The cashening is coming.
4	1526310872	1	That doesn't mean anything. Look at merchants talk about how much business they've gotten from Bitcoin or crypto over the past many years. Most will tell you it is and was extremely rare for customers to transact with Bitcoin or anything else (and I'm not just talking recently).Look at what BCH is putting out for blocks. Less than 100 kb. If 90% of merchants are using both coins and BCH is only putting out tiny blocks. That's a terrible sign for BCH.
