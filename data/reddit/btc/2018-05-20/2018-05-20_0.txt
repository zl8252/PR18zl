0	1526807286	48	This should have happened years ago with BTC, if Core had been funded by miners instead of banks we never would have been in this mess in the first place.
1	1526826858	12	It kinda did happen, years ago, look it up it's called Dash
2	1526833595	7	Part of the block rewards going to development of Dash has been one of it's strengths. Would be great to see in Bitcoin Cash. Learning from other coins and adding their better features is a good thing.
3	1526833908	3	No protocol change however please. Bitcoins protol was laid out in the whitepaper any major departure from that is no longer bitcoin. 
4	1526834029	2	The contributions could be voluntary and allow for voting by consenus on how the funds are spent.I'm sure someone will come out with a good balanced proposal.
2	1526833107	2	And still is.
1	1526838093	1	I disagree. The Core devs would have been assholes no matter who funded them.
2	1526842870	2	I disagree, if miners had been contributing you’d see people like Gavin and Mike well funded and at the very least able to compete with the likes of Greg, Pieter, Luke and the other Blockstream chucklefucks.More likely many of the devs would probably have just taken miner money to continue supporting big blocks.
0	1526809153	19	Without a governance system to decide how funds are spent, how can this system fund third party & community projects?
1	1526818223	24	No central governance is needed. Miners decide who they want to fund. Miners fund conflicting interests. Upgrades get implemented based on consensus regardless of how it was funded. If something doesn't have consensus the chain splits and the free market decides which fork will reign supreme. In theory, miners must fund upgrades that benefit everyone at risk of wasting development time/money on upgrades that wont get common consensus.Isn't this more or less what Satoshi was aiming for?
2	1526819217	15	When you say miners, you mean a few large mining pools. That sounds a lot like central governance to me. The only way this could become decentralised is if the pools created a way for individual miners to vote on how the pool they belong to allocates its funds.But there's still a problem with that. Miners are invested in their mining hardware, not the coin itself. They only care about making as much USD profit as they can before their hardware becomes obsolete. What incentive is there for miners to get involved in the voting process, and what incentive is there for miners to make decisions in the best interests of the network as a whole?It's a different set of people with a different set of incentives to Dash's Masternode owners, who are large holders of the coin itself, so are incentivised to make decisions that will grow the network for the long term.Am I missing something here?
3	1526825830	8	>They only care about making as much USD profit as they can before their hardware becomes obsolete.  Literally how capitalism works. 
4	1526834146	7	And literally how Bitcoin was designed to work.  It’s a hard pill for some to swallow but this is exactly how Satoshi intended it.  
3	1526822652	8	Individual miners vote by pointing to a pool that they support. "Miners" as a whole are not a central governance.>what incentive is there for miners to make decisions in the best interests of the network as a whole?Keep in mind "the best interests of the network as a whole" is a subjective perspective. Miners will typically do what is most profitable and that could be argued that *that* is in the best interest of the network. I believe Satoshi envisioned that the ecosystem benefited most when all players behave as selfishly as possible (which people do naturally). Chasing profits selfishly in a system where everyone else is doing the same thing should theoretically create a system that is completely decentralized. This assumes that no one group of miners controls more than 51% of the network, of course.So with that theory in mind what stops miners from raising fees to profit selfishly? I believe people who mine Bitcoin Cash are here for the long-game, based on their past and current actions. The long-game is to attract users and developers to build applications, keep blocks from filling, keep the network secure, and the users will follow all of that. Everyone profits when the value of the coin goes up. Note: this is just the theory as I understand it. It's hard to say exactly what will happen because I don't believe a system like this has ever existed in human history. 
4	1526823165	9	What incentive is there for miners to participate in voting at all? There's a lot of effort required to evaluate funding proposals, and the marginal return to miners for performing this work is approximately zero.Look at Dash's system - Masternode owners have ~50 proposals for funding each month (dashcentral.org/budget), it takes time to read all those and decide how to vote on each one. Even with Masternodes getting paid to do that job and having a large stake in the coin itself, total participation isn't very high.Using miners for this role would be far far worse - they have no stake in the coin so why spend time and effort evaluating proposals if it's not profitable for them to do so. You can argue that there's a very tiny profit incentive, but it's nowhere near enough to outweigh the burden of doing the job you are expecting them to do.
3	1526820354	3	>The only way this could become decentralised is if the pools created a way for individual miners to vote on how the pool they belong to allocates its funds.They could do that and probably will. 
4	1526820428	4	Then I refer you to my point about the lack of incentives for miners to participate in voting, or to vote in the best long term interests of the network. It takes time and effort to evaluate proposals for funding, I don't think miners are going to bother doing that job properly without a strong incentive to do it.
5	1526820634	5	Those things have always been a problem. I am hoping that it will improve when the miners are actually voting on where their money is going in the short-term
6	1526826761	4	No they have not be a problem for a long, Dash solved it ages ago
7	1526833031	4	Except dash has other issues like proof of stake. 
8	1526847956	2	It's not really proof of stake because you have to provide services to the network in exchange for your rewards, just holding coins isn't enough.The Masternodes must host the entire blockchain, facilitate InstantSend and PrivateSend transactions and with Evolution they will need to store user/DAP data and service requests over the decentralised API (DAPI). If they don't do these things then they don't get paid, so it's Proof of Service (PoSe) stacked on top of Proof of Work.As the network scales and the hardware requirement for full nodes becomes more and more expensive, it will be more and more important for the operators to get paid for providing these services to the network. They are also being paid to evaluate and vote on proposals, which as the network's budget grows and the proposals get larger, become more and more important.
8	1526848241	1	the POS protocol works totally different form POW, Dash is POW\+POSe \(proof of service\)
3	1526824605	3	> When you say miners, you mean a few large mining pools. That sounds a lot like central governance to me. It's not. Keep in mind that's only software development. The ecosystem always has been about more than software. In reality there are: miners, economic full-nodes, coin accepting merchants, users, software developers. What this does is allow miners (which are not centralized or at least not completely) to co-support software, which has *always* had an under-funding problem. This doesn't mean miners can stop volunteer (unpaid) devs from doing what they want, and the community following them. So if miners are not ultimately looking out for what the community wants they still lose.No one group rules completely. Core had centralized and overstepped the software side of Bitcoin BTC governance. Miners wanted a higher block size. Many users wanted a higher block size. Core said no. Bitcoin forked. Anybody who says BCH shouldn't exist and pretends to support decentralization is the very definition of a hypocrite.
2	1526824721	2	isn't that just called donations?
1	1526838551	1	Now I understand a lot better why Core wanted to divorce from the Blockchain.    
1	1526817271	-10	At least they aren't trying to hide the centralized aspects of BCH anymore.
2	1526817900	8	Please do explain how this has anything to do with centralization?
3	1526817957	-16	LOL
4	1526823376	11	Sound argument, sir
4	1526833724	4	censorship supporters like yourself never have any actual arguemtns or facts
5	1526835854	-3	LMAO
2	1526820653	4	Better than a bank-funded Trojan development.
0	1526802030	36	Ok. I’ll believe it when I see it.  I highly doubt he gets his information from birds.  
1	1526823075	14	He was recently at the Coingeek Conference. Also Jihan Wu confirmed in the BCH telegram chat.
2	1526824875	3	Hi do you have a link for the telegram BCH group? rBTC community info only shows the slack one.
0	1526810333	13	Miners afraid to individually fund or hire developers they like and instead resorting to some organized scheme. What could possibly go wrong?
1	1526826029	8	Well if 1/3 invested in Devs while 2/3 invested in faster rigs, the 1/3 would lose. Therefore community organization of sharing costs works. 
1	1526826215	-1	Spot on as always.
0	1526810977	14	That's the most douchebag twitter pic I've seen yet

0	1526802563	16	Great move, mining pools.
0	1526804674	9	Who's this guy?
1	1526823382	3	We're trying to get more girls in this community. Jihan ain't gonna cut it.
1	1526805497	12	The creator of CoinText.
2	1526815697	24	And the innovator behind the short-sleeved V-Chest hoodie. 
3	1526821737	3	We have the best v-chest hoodie innovators, believe me.
2	1526817413	4	And a Gigolohttps://youtu.be/ZnWFEoLbfUs
0	1526833595	3	There seems to be a retarded decentralization fetish pervasive in the crypto world. A complete lack of understanding of incentives and disrespect for capitalism and how rational self interests can benefit many also is evident.This mining led investment is great news and will likely speed up innovation. 
0	1526810833	5	Thank you for doing this.
0	1526809529	8	Smart move. Whats good for bitcoin cash is good for the miners
0	1526802181	19	Huh 🤔 Looking more and more like Dash every day.
1	1526823514	5	Nope. Dash'es masternodes are protocol-llevel. Here we've a discussion how to spend mining rewards the best. A pool can't force a miner to join. Some pools will choose to not participate
1	1526806339	11	Not at all. This is voluntary, Dash has the model embedded in the system.
2	1526820002	1	So Dash is better?
3	1526821973	-3	100% 
2	1526807071	0	Voluntary, but also more centralized. But a good development for BCH! 
3	1526823710	7	> but also more centralizedHow so? Miners never had obstacles to fund code writers or write code themselves and never will. I think looking at developers as a must-have independent party is a big mistake. It's not a constituency with whom miners have to reach consensus despite Andreas' thoughts on thatU can write code, a miner can write code, a miner can pay for code, there's no guarantee that a miner will run your code. Bitcoin is all about mining
4	1526846122	1	More centralized, because you have to trust that the miners fund the right projects and even whether they continue with funding at all. Thats a lot of power to have.If the treasury is baked into the protocol with a working governance system like Dash, that dependency falls away and less trust is involved.
3	1526812892	-4	BTC is centralized (Blockstream).
2	1526821011	-2	Participating in the Dash ecosystem at all is voluntary.
3	1526822661	0	Lol dash trolls.
4	1526848351	1	I don't think you know what the word Troll means.
1	1526803200	8	I don't know why you got downvoted.  I love BCH.. but we have to admit that DASH has an interesting approach to governance.
2	1526803431	7	Not sure, but I love BCH. 
3	1526804889	19	Depend how it is implemented,But the lack of development funding was certainly one of the reason BTC got blockstream’dGot if BCH can avoid that.
2	1526813585	-5	No it doesn't. Their governance model is easily Shremable with the Shrem attack.
3	1526819693	0	1. Shrem is returning the money he received to Dash Core Group after being harassed on social media by the Masternode owners.2. Dash's DAO will soon be able to receive equity in companies it funds in exchange for the funding it provides. Legal contracts solve the issue you are highlighting: https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/8kdwoh/dash_ventures_a_daodirected_venture_capital_fund/?ref=share&ref_source=link
4	1526819972	0	Do you have proof of point 1? I'd like to see that. Fair play for paying it back but he shouldn't have had to be harassed into it.
5	1526820897	4	I don't have proof, but Mark Mason from Dash Force informs me that Charlie signed a legal document 2 weeks ago and that Core is now waiting for the wire transfer to be received (he is paying back in USD not Dash). I expect there will be an official announcement once that happens.
6	1526831974	3	> (he is paying back in USD not Dash).Sounds like a typical Charlie Cryptoscammer Shrem move, still I won't trust any of it until we hear from Dash he has given them the stolen money back.He did the same with our very own /u/memorydealers (Roger Ver)...."Borrowed" crypto, enjoyed the rises.... paid back in fiat (or the equivalent value of the fiat rather than the initial "loan")So much for being a pioneer of crypto - don't know which Charlie is worse, this one or Dump My Own Coin Lee.
3	1526817533	1	Everyone is susceptible to fraud
1	1526805750	3	I always liked Dash despite all the criticism. They got many things right and have a community that is both positive and pragmatic.What they don't have is market share. 
2	1526809429	11	The entire crypto market is tiny compared with its potential so it remains to be seen which crypto will capture all thse important untapped markets. My money is on Dash because their treasury doesn't just fund development like BCH is doing here, but also adoption efforts in high-inflation countries and industries where going cashless represents a big cost saving (e.g. Alt36) etc. Relying on 'organic' growth can never be as effective as funding that growth imo. BCH needs a decentralised governance system to oversee its treasury if it wants to compete.
3	1526810990	1	I think BCH is actually being adopted more in high-inflation countries. Take a look at @eatBCH for example...
4	1526820174	10	Not so sure about that. Dash has now had 8 conferences in Venezuela, set up a support desk (dashhelpme.org) and has over 70 merchants accepting Dash in Caracas alone (https://discoverdash.com/). That's on top of current projects like https://www.dashcentral.org/p/DASH-MERCHANT-VENEZUELAIn Zimbabwe there's www.kuvacash.comThis all highlights the importance of funding for community projects.
5	1526846498	1	> [Dash] set up a support desk (dashhelpme.org)   Link doesn’t work for me. > over 70 merchants accepting Dash in Caracas alone (https://discoverdash.com/)Not bad! (Would be interested to see how that compares to BCH). > In Zimbabwe there's www.kuvacash.com It isn’t there *yet* though, is it? Judging from the website that thing is still in it’s infancy.  Nonetheless, I think Dash is pretty good. When I saw the BTC tx costs skyrocket I believed it was the best alternative, but now (ever since the fork) I believe BCH has a better chance to become mainstream. 
6	1526847335	2	dashhelpme.org does appear to be down right now, but check again later cause it has always worked before.Re: Kuvacash they haven't launched yet but they just got their money transmitter license. I saw a demo of the app which looked like it was close to ready. And they just signed a deal with the 2nd largest telecoms company in Zimbabwe, it's under NDA so I don't know anything more than that. Expecting great things when it launches soon.Alt36 is another big project for us, making Dash the currency of the legal cannabis industry, saving everyone money including customers who pay with Dash by eliminating cash handling costs all the way through the supply chain. They just launched in Arizona, California is next. www.alt36.com 
2	1526810862	8	I was invested in Dash before but it became really ugly to see how they kept wasting huge amounts of money on failed marketing projects and clear scams. I also don’t like how their masternode model only benefits the very rich. And how time seems to stand still over there. (I remember Evan talking about Evolution, reoccuring payments, interest accounts... many years ago and they still don’t have any of that...)   They used to be promising with their instand send and privacy (mixing) features but now BCH does this just as well, and with better wallets. And many of the Dash Evolution features are being built now faster on BCH.  Both try to be electronic cash and it seems clear that BCH is winning the race. I’m surprised some of their figureheads (like Amanda) haven’t realised this yet...
3	1526819822	7	You need to read this development: https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/8kdwoh/dash_ventures_a_daodirected_venture_capital_fund/?ref=share&ref_source=linkAlso note that Evolution backend is well underway from the progress reports, and front end demos have been getting released every month for the past 3 months.
4	1526826815	1	Please explain how Evolution backend progress can possibly be well underway when the MVP has yet to be finalized (due to unsolvable issues with namespace land grabs and Zooko's Triange).VCOs (Vote Controlled Offerings) like Kuvacash have put Dash Core and Masternode owners squarely into HoweyCoin territory.Unfortunately for Core and MNOs, Kuvacash's VCO didn't do required things like disclose the risks, compliance with US emgargo, etc.Source: https://www.dashcentral.org/p/VCO-KUVACASH-VOTE
5	1526828549	2	Kuvacash should have been dumped as soon as it became clear they created  their own ERC20 token, let alone trying to offer that token to Dash MN..  Hopefully they will be defunded in the future.
3	1526815608	2	Hand waving. A lot of it. But it's still interesting and people around that coin also want a digital currency for the world.Personally I cannot commit to cryptocurrencies with block supported treasury. At least not a permanent one
4	1526821406	3	> Personally I cannot commit to cryptocurrencies with block supported treasury. At least not a permanent oneI'm genuinely interested to hear why you're so opposed to this idea
5	1526827974	2	I have an humanist take on technology. What I mean by that is that, at the end of the day, transactions are between people. The network, and the network effect, exists due to the interactions between people. As such, in all cases, I believe support must come from the network participants. Each participant must protect their interests and if there is no interest in keeping the network running it must be allowed to disappear or morph into what serves those interests. Embedding a treasury in the protocol is a attempt to self perpetuation. As if the network was an entity, by itself, and must be protected. People (developers, in this case, since they bootstrap the network) seek assurance where, in the long term, none can be given. Besides that, a treasury creates a dichotomy between by the treasury and not by the treasure which is unneeded. It's not black and white and a slowly declining treasury could be useful as the miner reward is useful. But I'm not convinced. The miner reward is given to miners without judgment. It's a property the treasury does not have. Edit: fat finger, posted before finished
3	1526814773	1	You could have bought a Dash masternode 18 months ago for $8,500.  That's not "very rich". You obviously didn't understand it then, and you still don't, so spare us the sour grapes.Please tell us what Dash Evolution features are being built faster on BCH? Dash marketing has been extremely successful - try to keep up.
2	1526821672	1	Their community is both positive and pragmatic *because* they don't have market share.
0	1526812572	7	The best part: "I just got the inside scoop from someone who attended the meeting in Hong Kong where the agreement was made"How is this not a centralized scheme?
1	1526818427	14	> How is this not a centralized scheme?Dear Mr Redditorforlessthan60days,Because this wasn't decreed by a King, it's just an idea that's being tossed around by someone big in the mining space. We're literally talking about voluntary distribution of block rewards.
2	1526819360	7	Why would miners choose to join a pool that gives away a portion of the mining reward? The rational thing to do is join a pool that isn't participating in this scheme, and get 100% of the mining rewards.
3	1526820751	3	We saw what happened when no mining rewards went to development.
4	1526821210	5	Yes but the 'we' you are talking about is not the miners, it's the users and holders of the coin. Miners only care about making a return on their hardware before it becomes obsolete so why are they expected to care about the long term prospects of the coin enough to voluntarily donate funds to a treasury and spend their time and effort voting on proposals?
5	1526821727	7	You won't get your answers because there are none.  The funding is 100% controlled by a few and will it all go toward their own pet projects.   You are right.  Dash has a vastly superior model for decentralized funding of developments. They always have.  It's funny how far ahead of the game Dash is.  There are coins with a lump sum for development, like Nano, but that will ultimately turn into a party slush fund.  Developers need to be accountable to the stakeholders, simple as that.  
1	1526816853	1	How is voluntarily donating money contralization?I demand banks give money to a single (and the only) development team. That’s Decentralized right? :p
2	1526827100	1	Because they get to decide how the funds get spend
0	1526819566	2	awesome
0	1526833226	2	A hand full of miners decide where all the funding goes. This is a rather embarrassing solution to funding when compared to others like Dash. A miner can jump to any SHA256 algo blockchain a dash masternode is more incentivized to make good decisions for it's own blockchain than a miner/pool will ever be.
0	1526814609	4	Who gets to decide how this money is spend? Miners? In that case they (miners) will have absolute control over protocol.As far as I understand Dash has master nodes which are run by any large holder who gets vote on where thing are going. That seams more fair than this. On the other hand, no one can stop miners to lobby or pay developers.Not sure what to think of this...
1	1526817592	7	Miners have absolute power over their own damn money....why is this surprising?
2	1526828518	1	It is not. Problem is should we trust our money to a coin that is fully controlled by small group of people.
3	1526830128	4	Have you ever read the white paper?
1	1526834566	4	Miners, i.e. the people who produce blocks, have had absolute control over the blockchain since the genesis block.
0	1526822757	4	As long as anyone can opt out and join another pool. If certain miners want to give their money to devs thats fine with me.
0	1526801904	5	Amazing!
