0	1526786069	37	Hey!  Lawnmower seller reporting in here.  I was wondering if this might get posted and logged on to check - was not disappointed.  My first in person purchase/sale as well.   I had a few cryptos listed in the ad more as keywords than anything else.  I'm an original big blocker - traded through the "Hearnia" ran an XT node and then a 2X node when it wasn't getting ddos'd offline.  Even though I support big blocks I'm not a zealot.  I'm much more of a pragmatist and I own both BTC and BCH as well as some other coins.   I've bought a few things with crypto online, but after striking out trying to buy firewood and furniture with crypto locally last fall I was happy to sell a lawnmower for any kind of crypto.  I'm currently underweight on BCH so was happy to trade a mower for a bit more :-)
1	1526790189	17	Ha, such a small world!Thanks for a pleasant transaction!Cheers, man!
1	1526790742	3	Beautiful
1	1526788702	3	Cool
1	1526803086	1	r/tworedditorsonecupNot too unexpected though
0	1526762941	25	I saw the cryptocurrecy ok checkbox on Craigslist (not default when I did it) and figured I'd even offer a 27% discount for crypto. Long story short, I told buyer I preferred BCH, ETH, BTC in that order and we ended up transacting in ETH. A few people were surprised how easy it was.
0	1526761564	15	We should have a BCH lawn mower day lol !! I'll get mine out tomorrow and we can have BCH dudes around the world mowing lawns in unison ! Take pics :-)
1	1526770303	5	What an idea. 
0	1526771143	5	I’m doing my first trade on localbitcoins this Friday I’m going to let him chose to receive BTC or BCH. I think if the person is not very technical he might still say BTC but I’m afraid we need to be drinking beer for 3 hours unless we pay a high fee.
0	1526764558	3	Congratulations with this big step!
0	1526761072	7	cragislist defaults to \[x\] cryptocurrency ok
1	1526769731	6	No it doesn't
2	1526770021	0	it did for me.
3	1526772112	6	it knows...
4	1526772647	3	maybe they changed that. i think when they first released it it was checked but now that i think about it when I listed a few days ago it was not.
5	1526835865	2	Maybe you posted in your ad that crypto is accepted and then it checked it automatically
1	1526788457	2	I’m the lawnmower seller.  I checked the crypto currency ok check box, but I also had some coins listed as keywords in the text of the ad as well...
0	1526780349	2	I'll be moving homes in another year, most likely.  I plan to sell all my used things for Bitcoin, if possible. I'm looking forward to that experience, too. 
0	1526781801	1	good on ya
0	1526784195	0	Probably within five years all major payment processing service providers will allow payments with any of the top five cryptocurrencies.
0	1526764712	-21	FYI BCH is bitcoin and no need to add Cash to it anymore.And make sure you note the time and date for your taxes.
1	1526766274	6	Signed, The IRS
1	1526771329	2	As if THAT won't confuse the shit out of people, not even talking about noobies who by and large are well put off of the bcash thing when they experience the intensity of the misinformation, disinformation and downright lack of integrity of bitcoin cash corporation and it's CEO, CTO and CFO.I'm pretty sure the other bitcoin forks don't suffer from similar delusions of grandeur.
2	1526771576	-2	Just send the newbies to bitcoin.com and tell them everything else is a scam. They'll soon learn.
3	1526775204	-1	Yeah right. As if that would work.A relatively lame web site that offers no real information, has terribly written amateur 'news' and is constantly discredited as it is so utterly deceptive.Good one.Did you forget the /s ???
4	1526777927	0	I doubt he forgot the tag. That’s what this sub is like a lot of the time, unfortunately. Well either that or shitting on BTC. Never seen a sub so focused on something else lol. But there are good threads. Sometimes 
5	1526791732	2	Well, there's /r/bitcoin which has a minimum of 3-7 Roger Ver/CSW/Jihan hate threads every single day that gets upvoted to the frontpage. I've never seen a sub so focused on threats, brigading and character assassination as that one. But there are good threads. Very rarely, but sometimes.
6	1526797933	2	There’s that “something else*. I never made a statement about the bitcoin sub and there it it again. So who cares if the r/bitcoin sub is utter shit. You wanna make this one the same standard? There’s some pretty knowledgeable ppl here in this sub but topics are so frequently focused on talking shit about bitcoin and it’s sub and leaders that it detracts from the good content on this sub. I mean do we really need 20 twitter quotes from bitcoin lovers, or developers or even sometimes just a random supporter, showing how wrong they are, a *day* ? 
5	1526794557	-2	Really?  You think he forgot the tag?Are there really people that stupid to actually believe that in this space?
1	1526791517	-1	How did this get 19 downvotes?
2	1526797910	-3	I guess BCore trolls came in here and downvoted it.
3	1526798972	4	No, he is a troll himself and just trying to make us look bad
4	1526817847	0	get out of here BCore trash.
5	1526818657	2	Thanks for confirming
0	1526771481	-21	Its called bcash. Bcash is not bitcoin.
1	1526787134	5	Have a Snickers and go back to r/bitcoin mate, you do not belong here.
0	1526774723	-19	Don't you think it's quicker just to say bcash, instead of Bitcoin Cash?
1	1526784543	-3	It is and that is what I say but people around here don't like it.
2	1526791393	0	It's even quicker to say BCH. The reason no one wants to call it that is because that's not its name and the only reason bcash exists is because Theymos and co came up with it trying to devaluate BCH. It's the historical equivilant to calling black people coons.
3	1526801406	1	I see what you’re saying but calling bch bcash is nowhere near as bad as calling a black person a coon...
4	1526801611	1	It all boils down to respect. 
5	1526801726	1	How is calling a year old cryptocurrency the wrong name equivalent to mocking hundreds of years of slavery and oppression? I’m a white dude and this is not a personal thing, im just saying it’s a hell of a stretch to compare them.
6	1526802548	1	Because it's offensive to some people. Sure, I don't care if someone calls it bcash, or if someone calls me cracker, but if it's offensive to someone why not leave it be?I know a black guy that doesn't mind being called the word starting with N, even so, I wouldn't feel right using it.That said, they aren't even close to comparison on a deeper level. The lesson still stands.
7	1526802590	1	Okay.
