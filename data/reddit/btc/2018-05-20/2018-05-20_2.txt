0	1526832867	38	Daniel is the guy who coined the term "hyperbitcoinization". Everyone should read every single post on Nakamoto Institute written by Daniel (which is like 90% of the site).Talking of hyperitconization, ironically this term somehow turned into the most effective terminology being used nowadays by the BTC propagandists to convey to the cult followers the idea that Bitcoin price will rise without actually having utility. Yesterday I saw some random tweet by a BTC puppet saying something along the lines of "BCH idiots will never get why Hyperbitcoinization is much more important than getting adoption", or something like that. It was hilarious and sad at the same time because the guy who literally came up with the term "Hyperbitcoinization" is that "BCH idiot" who thinks adoption is important. (Even though Daniel is not a 'BCH-only' guy but instead has a very convincing investment strategy of "Bitcoin Index Fund", most BTC people will never hesitate to label him as BCH just because he's not full-on BTC maximalist)p.s.Everyone should watch all of Daniel's Youtube shows, the more you understand about Bitcoin, the funnier his videos are, and they are extremely helpful and funny at the same time.p.s.2.Anyone know why he "resigned" from the organization? I feel really bad about this because personally I think the nakamoto institute website is the most educational website about Bitcoin ever, and the founder walking away from it is a huge loss to the entire BTC + BCH community combined.
1	1526838326	5	Your answer should be clear from the back and forth going on here and Twitter
1	1526844126	-1	They should also read this: https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/speculative-attack/
0	1526830597	22	Someone needs to turn the Nakamoto institute website into a blockchain app before someone gets the idea to "revise" it.
1	1526843526	-7	Knock yourself out: https://github.com/NakamotoInstitute/nakamotoinstitute.orgYou can call it the Craig Wright Institute
2	1526844397	2	Troll harder.
2	1526847993	1	I'm surprised by the buttpain being expressed, would have expected a more professional stance from the SNI...
0	1526829405	37	The partnership was doomed from the beginning.Pierre and  Michael were not capable of producing an equal amount of value as Daniel, but had no qualms about claiming an equal amount of credit.
1	1526836951	-20	> A more liquid currency has an advantage over a less liquid one because it can support more trade. Furthermore, liquidity in a currency is self-reinforcing. The more that people buy a currency, the more liquid it becomes. This naturally tends to promote the success of a single currency over all the rest. https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-coming-demise-of-altcoins/#selection-113.4-116.0BTC is far more liquid than ETH. ETH is far more liquid than BCH. I still agree with exactly what Daniel wrote back in 2014. Few in this subreddit do.Daniel had an altcoin foisted upon him which he happened to like, so now he's in the uncomfortable position of having to find increasingly implausible rationalizations to reconcile his past writings with his current views.Daniel was one of the co-founders of the SNI but he decided to resign a while ago.I've never claimed credit for Daniel's writings, in fact I've always gone out of my way to point out that he's the one who coined the term hyperbitcoinization. Michael put a lot of work into creating and maintaining the website, it's disappointing that you would disrespect that.The SNI doesn't have a view on forks, but it's quite clear to everyone outside of this subreddit that BCH is just another altcoin and not a fork per se. This dinner is not for altcoiners, it's for Bitcoiners.
2	1526838057	13	The only thing foisted onto Daniel and the rest of us was the 1mb crippling with its high fees and delays which wiped out  hundreds of Bitcoin businesses. You should be ashamed of yourself. 
3	1526845178	-4	The economics of monies is orthogonal to the economics of payment systems. And there's no such thing as a "Bitcoin business" - businesses are agnostic as to what they use for payments, they just want revenue.
4	1526846222	4	Orthogonal and no such thing as "Bitcoin business" huh?You are scum. Do the world a favor and jump in front of traffic.
4	1526846351	3	You truly are a nut case. 
2	1526837727	23	It's really not honest to call BCH just another altcoin.BTC split into two competing visions, both certainly are Bitcoin.
3	1526839724	7	Putting aside all opinion and malice and looking at it from a purely objective point of view, I just can't bring myself to see how shoehorning in a copy of a necessarily centralised hub and spoke staked and routed network on top of the original infrastructure of a peer to peer network for uncensorable peer to peer cash is in any way consistent to the Bitcoin vision.There may be the *tiniest* hint of validity in that description, *if* the original scaling plan had been followed, and we had simply reached a natural point where the demand for capacity outstripped the availability thereof, but actually what happened is we artificially capped it at a temporary limit to preference the business plans of a third party interest, the ego of u/nullc and the desire for the banking apparatus of the world to subvert it and use it as a weapon in the war on real cash. It is not only not the original vision of BTC, it is closer to the inverse of the original vision.
3	1526839898	3	No, technically only one can be Bitcoin qua "the" Bitcoin. Even after the fork. Which one it is isn't so straightforward however. But so far Bitcoin BTC aka Bitcoin Core/SL certainly hasn't been very useful for commerce and seems to be drifting away from the original concept. (Arguments can be made that SegWit invalidates the chain, but that's more technical than most devs even go)
3	1526845124	2	> two competing visions, both certainly are Bitcoin.Except that Bitcoin is not just a vision, but real actual software that developers work on. Indisputably, the Bitcoin developers are all still working on the Bitcoin Core software, whereas the BitcoinABC (i.e., BCH) is being developed by a new, much smaller team of developers.Also indisputably, the norm is that “Bitcoin” refers to BTC and not BCH. Trying to claim BCH is “the real Bitcoin” is not going to make it so.
4	1526845507	3	Nope, it only turned out like that because of who had GitHub control.Gavin supports BCH and if he had retained control then indisputably, what is today called BCH would have been what BTC is right now, and to get segwit and keep small blocks they would have had to fork off.The Core team's response to everyone who had major issue with their development direction was to fork off, we did, only because they controlled the GitHub keys and there was no other recourse.Them controlling the GitHub keys is an accident of history and confers no merit or legitimacy otherwise.That's why many call it a hostile takeover. People like Greg Maxwell became the new lead developers, a guy who claimed he had proved bitcoin was "mathematically impossible" and did not work on bitcoin nor own any bitcoin until 2013.I do not agree with you at all. It shaked out like this because of one thing, GitHub control, and could easily have shaken the other way.To ignore this is dishonest.
3	1526837888	-13	I specifically said "everyone outside of this subreddit" to keep it honest.It’s a bitcoin dinner not an altcoin dinner. If SNI ever holds an altcoin dinner Daniel will be seated at the head of the table.
4	1526840387	12	You keep saying "altcoin" as if it's an incantation that will make it true. You seem unaware of why Bitcoin as sound money - the whole basis of hyperbitcoinization - dictates a clean divide between how one views splits that preserve the stakes of holders in the ledger and those that don't. In the article, Daniel explains hyperbitcoinization by contrasting it with dilution of the money supply. Altcoins do that. Ledger-splits like BTC-BCH don't. No one who really understands this concept could be as sloppy as to make a deliberate point of calling a branch of a ledger-split an altcoin. 
4	1526840655	5	You're saying that as if it's true.If you're honest, it's actually a dinner for whatever vision of bitcoin is held by the three people with GitHub commit keys, since they control what BTC is.If tomorrow they removed the 21m coin cap and switched BTC to proof of stake, would it still be bitcoin? Seriously, does GitHub control define bitcoin? Fuck no.What bitcoin actually was built to be, BCH actually is.Bitcoin is not a name, it's not GitHub control, it's not a reference implementation.This sub understands that, and it's dishonest to pretend you don't.
4	1526841318	4	You know very well that **Bitcoin** is a Peer-To-Peer Electronic **Cash** System. The Segregated Non-Cash Settlement System can never be Bitcoin - by definition. 
2	1526837954	8	>>A more liquid currency has an advantage over a less liquid one because it **can support more trade.**>BTC is far more liquid than ETH. ETH is far more liquid than BCH.BTC isn't even suitable for most trade anymore, and this not happenstantial but in fact a necessary, recognized, and acknowledged consequence of the "full blocks" policy.>Daniel had an altcoin foisted upon him which he happened to like,[Who controls Bitcoin?](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/who-controls-bitcoin/) Ring any bells? INVESTORS. From an investor's perspective it is silly to call any branch of the Bitcoin ledger an altcoin; that term should be reserved for alternative ledgers, not alternative rulesets. You read his articles but apparently learned nothing.
3	1526838506	-2	> BTC isn't even suitable for most trade anymoreIt's literally the most liquid crypto-money in existence. Liquidity is not determined by a count of on-chain transactions. 
4	1526839219	3	If you're only looking for that kind of liquidity, I can find you a regular currency or a stock instead. On-chain liquidity matters, because it's only on chain that you have the same benefits Bitcoin is all about.
5	1526846143	0	> If you're only looking for that kind of liquidityit's not about what I'm looking for, it's about monetary economics. "on-chain liquidity" is relevant to the market for payment systems, but not relevant to the market for monies.
4	1526840999	4	>>A more liquid currency has an advantage over a less liquid one **because it can support more trade.**Seeing as you're not reading carefully even after I bolded this, it's no surprise you think these articles say something completely different than they do. You simply chose a view and filtered everything you read through that lens. 
4	1526839194	7	>Liquidity is not determined by a count of on-chain transactions. No, it isn't, but the utility of the coin and its payment network are what ultimately drives liquidity...even if network effects are very powerful and tend towards maintaining a protocol or standard in place. ETH took a large portion of BTC's market share already (and liquidity followed); why couldn't BCH do similarly? None of the cryptocurrencies are yet serving as money or ensconced in such a way as to be completely a function of network externalities alone.
5	1526839395	-2	> None of the cryptocurrencies are yet serving as money or ensconced in such a way as to be completely a function of network externalities alone.So you disagree with Daniel's SNI writings. That's ok. I don't.
6	1526839943	6	I like Daniel's writings, and he sure as shit knows more than me about the technical stuff...but unfortunately, most people in this space remain woefully ignorant about the nature of money (and this has had unfortunate consequences as well for the very small/big-block debate).Objectively, none of the cryptocurrencies are yet serving as money to a high degree...that's okay and expected at this point, if you understand the [coordination problems inherent to producing a unit-of-account money on the market](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6u14b3/why_bitcoin_is_the_way_that_it_is_or_how_i) (I.E. without govt force or fiat). Bitcoin and other cryptos have been exhibiting properties of proto-monies.I think Daniel would actually agree with the nuances that I could offer his understanding if we had the time to chat about it...but regardless...we don't worship people here. We are about ideas that stand on their own merits...and Daniel has lots of them, and we are all wrong from time to time.
2	1526841380	2	Upvoting this for visibility. 
0	1526835405	16	Is the Nakamoto institute pro-Core?That's pretty weird given that Core is anti-Satoshi Nakamoto.
1	1526838548	7	Does the ongoing hypocrisy surprise you? 
2	1526839725	9	I guess I assumed Nakamoto Institute was pro Satoshi Nakamoto. It's also often references by Bitcoin Cash supporters. So yes, I'm a bit surprised.
3	1526840571	7	They seem blissfully unaware that Satoshi's and Daniel's writings - the meat of their website - don't support their views, and are in fact an excellent antidote to their views.
3	1526840029	6	the hypocrisy with which clowns like Rochard & Goldstein behave does not surprise me at all.
1	1526837142	4	Draping yourself in the flag to better shit on it. It's a time-tested tactic.
0	1526831235	35	Pierre Richard is the most pretentious idiot imaginable. He's literally flexing using a access to a meaningless organization nobody actually cares about as a weapon to punish someone for thought crime.
1	1526836091	9	best troll grin ever.absolutely love the fee talk.I wouldn't share the same room with the guy unless I had a severe gastric disturbance and the door was locked.
1	1526840013	-4	I'm not just punishing someone for thought crime, I'm punishing a wide swathe of people for thought crime: https://twitter.com/pierre_rochard/status/997277709012226048This is a dinner for Bitcoin maximalists. SFYL scammers
2	1526840425	6	Funny. Because it is a joke. Right?
2	1526841603	1	You are a Non-Cash-Non-Bitcoin maximalist. 
2	1526841984	1	I look forward to the day BTC changes to POS or whatever they'll do to further distance themselves from Bitcoin.I purposefully never link to SNI's copies of the whitepaper, because of the way that you (and some others there) behave.
0	1526827972	28	All gets solved when Bitcoin finally loses lead status. The market knows what's up and will get there eventually. 
1	1526830250	17	That's why we should just all relax and let this thing play out on its own clock.
2	1526832864	20	Yes but don't relax on adoption effort please.
0	1526829245	8	I don't think vitriol affects Daniel, so he should be alright
0	1526837979	6	Liquidity will actually follow utility and actual use, necessarily.Most people are onboarding into crypto still using BTC, but that use case is certain to die due to high transaction cost and slow confirmations.If BCH communities efforts bear fruit and BCH transaction count explodes, price won't be long behind, and liquidity with it.Pretending liquidity is some magical self-reinforcing quality that can insulate BTC from all of its bad decisions is a fatal mistake. If that were true, BTC would still be at 90%+ dominance levels instead of 30%.
0	1526827947	17	Daniel you're always invited for diner at my place. I don't have a boat but more importantly I love good company.
0	1526832015	5	Dude makes good Youtube vids.
0	1526832259	8	That Pierre guy is such an arrogant douche lol. Too many people in this space have achieved minor Twitter / Reddit fame and really let it get to their heads. Yet to see a comment from this guy that isn't condescending and rude. 
0	1526834770	3	In a movement driven by decentralization maximialists look like pure buffoons.
1	1526838456	7	Hey, I'm a maximalist. One day BCH will obsolete BTC. 
1	1526841310	1	Ledger maximalism is synonymous with sound money. Ruleset maximalism is a different story. Both branches of the Bitcoin ledger split that happened in August of last year preserve investor holdings equally. A ledger maximalist can support both - or either - without contradiction. 
0	1526828689	2	Similar things are going on in other organisations. The king does not discredit peasants... only gets worried about true competition.
0	1526848494	1	They just know that with him in the room none of them can possibly contemplate being the smartest guy in the room.
0	1526830006	-3	Nakamoto institute is globalist scum
1	1526836498	1	fuck off
2	1526836538	2	Triggered cuz it's true
0	1526837084	-3	Oh boo hoo - Ha^Ha^Ha^Ha^Ha^Ha^Ha^Ha
