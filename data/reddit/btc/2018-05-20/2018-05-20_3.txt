0	1526820070	16	If the price of btc ever goes below that of bch, this will happen right away.
1	1526826480	3	Not necessarily.It‚Äôs a ratio of price/difficulty that determines profit parity between BCH and BTC.As a matter of fact, it‚Äôs almost a weekly occurrence that BcH becomes more profitable to mine than Bitcoin...
2	1526833700	3	That's misleading, because the only reason that profitability ever swings back to BTC is because of the price being higher. BTC has no inherent mechanism to avoid becoming a zombie coin should price parity flip and BTC remain largely unmined for a significant amount of time.
3	1526846825	2	>That's misleading, because the only reason that profitability ever swings back to BTC is because of the price being higher. BTC has no inherent mechanism to avoid becoming a zombie coin should price parity flip.Clueless. You describe the very concept of a fee market that will always keep BTC profitable. The slower the chain gets the higher the fees, then the difficulty adjusts and its back to normal. The spammers finally realized that because of this they can't make a "death chain spiral" (after the huge spam attack towards the end of the 20k usd rally that was meant to instigate the "flippening") that you idiots in r/btc used to predict every other day and gave up. Fees have been sub 1USD, generally under 10c since. Bcash believers literally have been brainwashed and manipulated.
3	1526836784	1	Since both BTC and BCH have lIquidity on exchanges; are accepted at major pools, and share he same mining algo, then their profit parity will converge to zero since difficulty compensates for any price fluctuation 
4	1526842503	1	> difficulty compensates for any price fluctuationsWhat? Difficulty algo doesn't give two shits about price.
5	1526846325	1	Not what I meant.Difficulty varies inversely between competing coins of the same algo as miners switch between them based on their profitability 
2	1526827878	-10	>  more profitable to mine than Bitcoin..."Bitcoin Core".... we have to be precise üßê

0	1526845107	2	My guess is most of them are mining BTC to sell it for bch and they'll continue to do so until bch is worth more and then just mine that.
0	1526835968	3	Few days ago I listened an interview with Roger on official podcast. That dude is not so bad....

2	1526838410	8	Nervous laughter perhaps.You wouldn't fight us so hard if you weren't afraid.
3	1526846525	1	Yeah, if certain trolls wouldn't be afraid if BCH, they would just ignore us.

0	1526844667	1	Matter of time...for? Sounds like a hit it and quit it, then back with the one that cooked and washed the dishes
0	1526845183	1	I've already switched from mining Core to Bitcoin Cash. 
0	1526846234	1	The moment you find out that this subreddit is r/BTC
0	1526846385	0	This is delusional. The wider community wouldn't switch to something so centralized 
0	1526847757	1	why bro why?
0	1526822271	-16	This sub is called BTC. Oh, the irony

3	1526838449	7	Go all in short then.
3	1526844137	2	What makes you think so? Seems the ecosystem gets stronger every month. Really really curious if you have any reason at all for this opinion.

3	1526845657	1	You've come to bash on Bitcoin Cash without backing up your claim its a "shit coin." You're only making yourself look bad lol.
