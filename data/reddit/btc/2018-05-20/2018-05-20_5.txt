Use 1 as your hot wallet, use the other which is only connected to your hot wallet as your savings account. When you don't need to access the funds, you don't need your private keys to be online.https://twitter.com/Carsten71071425/status/997923392878727168Uhhh. A proper cold wallet is a wallet that's been created using a device or a computer NEVER connected to the internet - ever. It only exists on paper to be sent to, and when it is spent from it is completely spent. By using 2 LN keys and all that crap you can never be sure and secure. Also there's problem with these piss-warm wallets (as I like to call what this moron is proposing) in that users can confuse things, and it still relies on watchtowers and all that stuff even if off-line.It is a junk, piece of shit piss-warm wallet solution. Less useful than a hot-wallet and without the security of a real cold wallet. It's an in-between piss wallet with a strong stench of bullshit.Do not even think this offers a real solution /u/mccormack555
1	1526774659	12	I didn’t like the suggestion but I don’t have the technical skills to challenge. Just sounds like a shit idea.
2	1526775038	17	Ask him if he'd put $10,000 in one of these piss-warm wallets.Maybe $10,000 to him is the same as $100 to someone in a poorer country.They should turn off all normal transactions on Bitcoin - only allow LN funding transactions on the chain. This way everyone rich and poor should get to use the trainwreck that is Lightning. It would be amazing how many early-adopters who are BTC-rich would soon start to complain.
2	1526800615	4	The insane thing is that in an alternate timeline where a LN quasi-POS coin was built without Satoshi, the Bitcoin whitepaper would be heralded as the genius solution that obsolesced all its problems and solutions. Just do it like Satoshi said. It works. None of the fundamentals need fixing. 
1	1526825563	2	I think it's a great idea if you're poor: you pay twice the fee for funding a channel =D
1	1526817051	1	This is a serious response so don't go weird on me...but...Actually the entire premise of the Lightning Network is that the blocksize increases to roughly 130mb in size. This would mean that on chain fees of 1-20usd depending on congestion would be the norm and would be sufficient with this size of block to sustain mining on BTC.If the blocksize isn't raised then BTC is basically dead in terms of a P2P cash system which was its original goal. When I asked about all of this in r/bitcoin and pointed out how a blocksize increase was literally essential I was basically told "yeh obviously, idiot".But, when I asked when we will start to do this or what kind of official plan there was...nothing.Now, I haven't fully made up my mind on this, but given how obvious it is that Lightning will TOTALLY fail with a 1mb block it seems obvious that people would ultimately determine to raise the blocksize.This follows unless one key thing, Bitcoin is changed into ONLY a tradable store of value and P2P gold bars for rich people. This is my main concern at this point. Once the institutional money starts to enter Bitcoin the price would be going up so fast the hodlers wouldn't ever agree to risk anything by scheduling a hard fork and it would end up a consensus change to the concept of Bitcoin.Interested to hear other's thoughts on the above.

3	1526831478	1	doesn't matter bot. Samson Mow says it is digital gold.
2	1526831383	1	Urrr. You need to get with it.  BCore's Bitcoin is *NOT* a payment system. It is digital gold.Did you not get the message from BlockTheStream's COO Samson Mow?He says it many times in his own words - those who ever thought it was a payment system are dumbasses and if they lost business or money once using it for payments and then having to stop due to high fees and unsuitability  it is their own fault and they deserve it for being dumbasses.https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/2018/05/18/wbd-017-interview-with-samon-mow
3	1526846095	1	So you think the multiple companies developing the Lightning Network full-time are in on a conspiracy to waste their time developing a P2P payment system?Quite obviously these groups will lobby for BTC to raise the blocksize at the relevant time, considering the funding these groups have I'm pretty certain their marketing would crush any attempt from blockstream to prevent the blocksize being raised.But...if blockstream are developing an LN implementation, why would they want the blocksize to remain capped knowing it breaks the usability of their own product? The product they tirelessly worked to develop while intentionally stalling a blocksize to ensure it gets off the ground....literally break the only product that they will make that will make them any profit - after all this time?If you have answers to these questions that are not total nonsense I would be extremely surprised. But I'm all ears, time to convince a btc whale why btc is doomed.
0	1526773449	22	Yes, he brings up many serious concerns that others are forbidden to speak of.  This is good for Bitcoin
0	1526775901	9	Doesn't look like the usual "bcash bcash roger" troll army
0	1526770916	17	Tough mental and emotional place to be, especially with as much visibility as he has. I hope he can get over the hump soon and become confident about his realizations.
1	1526772743	19	Strange how The Boogeyman ("I haven't been talking to Roger!") is the thing preventing him from even testing the waters of the BCH POV.Well, not Roger per se, but plain peer pressure I guess. Twitter is brutal. I don't use it.
2	1526773725	11	On the flipside, if he can get to the point of realizing that there is no boogeyman, he will have steel-manned his other positions and be a true p2p cash proponent.
0	1526770825	24	He's a clear thinker surrounded by fuzzy suggestions- "the poor can use two channels!", "Look into channel factories!",  "Someone will fix it but It's very complicated so you won't understand."
1	1526831680	2	> "Someone will fix it but It's very complicated so you won't understand."The beauty of Bitcoin (as per Satoshi paper) was that whilst it had a initial difficult technical hurdle once you studied a little you appreciated just how *simple* it all was, and the genius of Satoshi in that he was the first to put what are relatively simple ideas together.The best things are the simplest things. You can't trust something as important as money to anything but the most simple systems and protocols - this is why banks for instance still use ancient COBOL systems - it works so don't fix it.A 2nd layer is great for pocket money and small change (small change for a goat herder might be $0.10 whereas for Samson Mow it might be $100). After all the 2nd layer runs on top of the simple protocol so nothing greater than the amount in your channel can be lost or stolen as the simple protocol of the 1st layer will protect that. Now to put substantial money ($10 for a goat herder, $10,000 for Samson) and trust it into just a 2nd layer is complicated and crazy. 
0	1526784810	12	I was thinking *but nothing pro-BCH!!* about how LN *dont get me confused with Roger - I love Core, I love BTC please - leave my kids out of this.* actually keeps poor people from using Bitcoin *oh god please don't hate me, I love BTC and LN and would NEVER question core - I am just thinking out loud.*The dude put like 4 disclaimers in the tweets - so much fear.
1	1526794859	1	It’s no fear. Just a disclaimer.
2	1526796391	4	That's the impression I got - since in the BTC Core communities like r/bitcoin saying anything that doesn't align gets your banned, I can totally see how wanting to ask legitimate questions could come across as 'shilling' therefore a healthy level of disclaimers is needed for padding.  
3	1526813108	3	That whole debate was interesting.Not sure if my comment below will be lost but my interview with Roger is the only one which has not been shared by a guest on Twitter, despite agreeing to. Is that censorship or moderation?
4	1526813431	3	Perhaps it's forgetfulness? Maybe for Samson Mow being invited to interview is a really big thing? For Roger it's perhaps just another day?Hey /u/memorydealers why not share both interviews on Twitter - Yours and Samsons :D ?
5	1526815052	2	I ask all guests if they will share and we agreed it would.
3	1526807988	1	This works both ways for me. I would disclaimer against either side of the debate coming to conclusions which do not exist.
4	1526829255	1	It's  bullshit to even make any disclaimers. Having free thought is what matters. This tell you how toxic your community are. As an early adopter, I'm glad I left that shithole "community" with thought police army.
0	1526781280	12	It's great to see a revelation unfold.  More BTC hodlers need to start questioning Core's propaganda.
1	1526781431	9	this has been thought/known about for years. the problem is with too many angles to attack the Coreons we end up fighting too many small battles. This is the main angle of attack, a two-class Bitcoin rather than a two-tier Bitcoin.
0	1526784127	10	Even if BTC raises their blocksize, I am sticking with BCH - BCH is so much more than simply blocksize.
1	1526794427	2	Guess who will start up their powerful "N0HF" nodes.Guess what betrayed miners will do.If you think BTC can get rid of the blocksize limit without a PoW change you are delusional. To much power \(especially from oldtimers\) already shifted to BCH. Only noobs \(for them it's an expensive lesson\) will burn. Everybody else in the ecosystem is "rich" enough to stomach a bad investment choice.
1	1526795590	2	Same. Reminds me of [this snippet](https://youtu.be/PqFyhxMwpRU?t=4187) from an unofficial debate at the recent anarchapulco from a former r/Bitcoin moderator
0	1526799228	6	I like price Smith's reply. "I mean if the fees get too high itll be bc the network is swamped and then solutions will be put in place like raising block size worst case"Cause that's totally what happened last time. 
0	1526783578	10	Now _this_ is a good post.
0	1526799433	3	Ugh, it's so weird seeing core supporters policing his tweets and scolding him for asking a simple, genuine question. His points just reinforce how the LN is a Rube Goldberg machine.
1	1526808014	1	This has happened with Bitcoin Cash supporters too.
0	1526811461	1	Roger is the only guest I have had on my show who has not shared their interview on Twitter.
1	1526836324	2	ping /u/MemoryDealers
1	1526834255	1	I can read that in many ways. For example1) Roger was embarrassed of the interview.2) Roger didn't want to direct a legion of trolls your way.Care to clarify? 
2	1526835215	2	1. Shouldn't be - BCH fans had no issue, BTC fans, many said they liked it and saw a different side to him2. Doubt it - I can handle it
