0	1526795749	2	Indeed, yours is great!!
0	1526801310	2	The Yours.org category pages in the menu bar at the top (e.g. "music" or "photos"), and "new" tab are also interesting places to start, in addition to the "hot" landing page. Thanks for the plug!
0	1526821531	2	I am kinda busy from the last "freaking addictive" thing that was recommended to me, opiates.   /sYour headline sends me the other direction.  I definitely don't need another addiction!
0	1526829269	1	You know I've never been more excited about earning a fiew cents. I think when you tip 95% of the tip goes to OP and 5% to yours but when you **vote** the first vote goes to the OP and when others tip you get a little bit of everyone who votes after you.You can earn money by voting for content that becomes popular by identifying it early. There is a little bit of gaming involved.
0	1526830917	1	From reading this subreddit I thought most people are using memo.cash instead of yours.org now, is that not correct?
1	1526840753	1	They have completely different use-cases.  You cannot yet do in memo.cash what you can with yours.org
