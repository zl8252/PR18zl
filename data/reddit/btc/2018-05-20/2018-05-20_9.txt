0	1526798293	8	Wow. You guys should do a show together every week. The dynamic between you sums even better than the individual parts.Top notch.
1	1526830895	3	Ditto, would watch every Sunday at breakfast. 
0	1526799932	5	/u/MemoryDealers  /u/ryancarnated Thanks for showing https://bchpizza.org That was so cool to see [that pop up in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGZUXsnd_xU&feature=youtu.be&t=686). We have collected over a 1000 dollars worth of Bitcoin Cash as bounties for the cities. So find a pizza place and tell them about the bounties. And if you have bitcoin cash that you would like to spend on pizza in a local shop then go to the website and place the bounty. Our highest bounty is around a 100 dollars. Maybe a year from now that will be a 1000 dolllar bounty? 
1	1526821191	1	Amazing to see all 100 cities have a bounty now! Now it's about outreach and getting them claimed. Go bchpizza! Thanks Kain for your work in driving this forward. 
0	1526811011	3	Subscribed! Great video once again ! :)Ryan is great for BCH
0	1526769367	7	Thanks for fixing the sound Roger ;)
1	1526780026	4	The video with the bad sound was using $300 microphones.  The video above was just with the laptop internal microphone.
2	1526798499	2	Haha.$300 microphones also need a $300 sound guy. Pro tip number 2 when you have a dynamic background like a sunset turn off auto exposure
2	1526781299	8	It's like BTC and BCH right now... the most expensive option is not always the best ;)
2	1526806462	2	I would like to speak with your audio guy. 
0	1526797967	3	Awesome vid!I am super exited by moneybutton!!!
