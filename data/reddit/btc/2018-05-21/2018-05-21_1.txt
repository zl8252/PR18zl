0	1526889207	2	The other day i saw a guy posted same licenced vehicle, I wonder how many vehicle are there with **BCH PLS** number? Or all of you just using photoshop? 
1	1526889473	1	Different countries ;) the other was from USSA, this is EU
2	1526892558	2	> USSAThe United States Ski and Snowboard Association have their own license plates?
3	1526892921	7	The United States of Socialist America
4	1526906135	2	Are we more socialist than europe now?
5	1526906852	1	EU is also showing communist tendencies but I didn't come up with any good way how to indicate it by adding letters :PBut most of the EU countries also belong to NATSO (North Atlantic Terrororist/Socialist Organization)
3	1526898757	1	There is a United States Ski and Snowboard Association ??!!

0	1526901212	1	When Hyundai?
0	1526918968	1	But it‚Äôs a Hyundai....bcash hodlers are NOT being properly rewarded lol
0	1526893277	1	This looks photoshopped to fuck. 
1	1526893401	8	how much are you willing to bet?
2	1526894626	2	1 karma 
3	1526895098	7	For 100$ worth of BCH I will bother to provide proof. I've got hundreds of photos taken that day from different angles.
4	1526895612	3	not sure where you want this to go...
4	1526905592	1	( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
5	1526906052	4	yes, that angle too :P although she wouldn't probably approve uploading THAT photo
2	1526907122	1	It certainly isn't registered as [BCHPLS](https://i.imgur.com/L1QkHuB.png). Not a real license plate. 
3	1526908227	2	Oh the plate is very real. Costed me 20 euros to make :D. Should be quite obvious from the photo too, if you look at the reflections. I sort of expected "photoshop" accusations so I uploaded it in high resolution.
4	1526908370	2	Not real as in not registered as BCHPLS and not recoqnized by MNT. 
5	1526908692	3	Real as in "not photoshopped"
0	1526866906	1	yes pls
0	1526886155	-1	Who advertises anything on a fucking Hyundai
1	1526891776	6	For the record, it's her car. She received it as a gift from me last year when I took some profits off the Bitcoin's rise. In retrospect, I would say that this car turned out to be a perfect match to her driving skills :P
2	1526892962	-13	So, her driving skills are equivalent of hatchback, so just a basic woman driver. Come on could have got such a cool used car why on earth would you get a Hyundai 
3	1526893829	4	I got several strong omens directly indicating that it has to be a Hyundai. Go ask the heavenly father, I'm just following orders :)One of the omens was a dream I saw during the time when I was trying to figure out what kind of car it has to be. In the dream there was a Hyundai in the front of my house. The other day I went to work and saw the same exact Hyundai model with a licence plate 999 BAV. My gf's previous car had BAV in her licence plate so it was a confirmation for me that the car has to be it. Without telling about any of these omens to my friend, I asked him to find me a car suitable for a woman and he came up with this Hyundai. There are no coincidences ;) the Hebrew language even lacks a word for it.
4	1526896623	2	Ignore the troll... Always one on every topic
5	1526897651	2	Yes they have become really easy to detect. Not sure if they're getting sloppy in their techniques or I have become better at spotting them. Nevertheless, I sometimes deliberately talk to trolls to troll them back. It's easy to troll the trolls if you know who you are dealing with ;)
4	1526894490	-1	Deluded Hyundai owner. 
5	1526894970	3	Those "delusions" have made me rich ;) so which one of us is really the deluded one?
6	1526895562	-1	A: I have done perfectly well myself but don‚Äôt feel the need to brag about it to others and B: You drive and or bought a fucking Hyundai
7	1526895848	1	Interesting. If you've done perfectly well yourself, then from where comes the urge to criticize others?
8	1526896155	0	I‚Äôm not criticising you or your views am I. A Hyundai, is a fucking shit boring car, its not a criticism, they suck. The used car market is a gold mine, you could have got something cool instead you bought a Hyundai
9	1526897471	6	I think I somehow sympathize you. Cars are obviously an important part of your persona and intellect, so you have developed a fine-grained taste for them. I, on the other hand, know nothing about cars. In fact, I despise them and I've never understood why so many people take them as an intrinsic part of their lives. It's as if you've grown up but you have taken the toys with you, except the toys have also grown up.That said, from a purely practical experience gained mostly from being on the passenger's seat of this car, I have nothing bad to say about it. It drives reliably, it doesn't consume much fuel, it doesn't allow you to drive dangerously fast, its size makes it convenient to park and it looks cute just as my girlfriend. So, to me personally, your arguments are not convincing.
1	1526892388	9	What's wrong with a normal simple car? 
2	1526892907	-9	It‚Äôs a pile of crap
1	1526888634	0	I love BCH but the hyundai makes this almost satire. 
2	1526889602	-1	I know, why a Hyundai, it‚Äôs so small, pathetic, if you want to sponsor a car put it on something meaty.

2	1526889107	4	I understand your frustration, but for the record, my girlfriend knows perfectly well the difference between SegWitCoin and Bitcoin Cash. She made a conscious decision when she sold her blockstream tokens and bought Bitcoin Cash instead.
3	1526889879	0	Does your girlfriend often make payments in a field like that?  The whole thing just strikes me as odd.Didn't mean to come off like that if that's your girl but it just seems like a paid BCH shill about a sticker, or you just wanted to show off your gf (and I would respect that way more than a paid shill....)
4	1526890918	3	She uses BCH from time to time to pay for some bills via piixpay.com but generally she is a holder. The stickers arrived just recently and the guy who sent them did it for free, so I felt an obligation to give something back to the community. The photo has been released for the public domain ( https://forum.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-discussion/public-domain-bitcoin-cash-user-photos-t79824.html#p185095 ).
5	1526892241	2	In all honesty it's a beautiful picture.  Don't get me wrong it's nothing personal.  It's just if I like Pepsi, and my girlfriend likes Pepsi, we get a couple bottles of Pepsi and get free pictures taken of us drinking the Pepsi (which is warm and flat by now), I'm not going to post it on Coke-a-Cola's sub.Because what if someone who's never had a soda in their life has researched and decided that they want a Pepsi.  So they check out Pepsi's sub only to be tricked my nafareous actors into buying Coke by a bunch of people who call it pop or soda and have minimal details, if any, of the difference between the two.Make sense?
6	1526893179	2	Yeah, and I'm not even a hobbyist photographer :D so I'm quite amazed by the accidentally good composition myself too. Your following Pepsi reasoning is not very convincing though, sorry.

5	1526899026	2	You're feeling insecure and threatened.You have a good reason for this. bitcoinCash will destroy your pathetic cult.
2	1526888126	5	im sure if she doesn't care if it's BTC or BCH she just wants it to have the lowest fees and the quickest times. whichever bitcoin that is...
3	1526889281	0	Ok, so she could recieve X amount of BTC, X amount of BCH, and she could also pick up X amount of blades of grass.She could pick her own grass from right under her feet for free before either #BTC or #BCH gets a confirmation.  But does that make X GRASS any better or more valuable than X BTC or X BCH?Edit: and the answer is: security and anominity, I think.
2	1526885167	3	Found the triggered virgin
3	1526888678	-1	Lol. Further from a virgin than most, maybe that's why I see through their sexual advertising and focus on actual substance.  And I see no substance here, did you catch something in this post that I missed?If so please share.
2	1526886812	1	Stick to the rhymes bud. It was much better than your rant about being woke because you want to pay 50$ fees for a tx. 
3	1526888007	0	Lol  but I've never paid more than a few dollars at most for a BTC tx, transferring a hundred or two USD or so.For me, Satoshi Nakamoto's vision is way more important than a few bucks.  Tx fees and network congestion is temporary, the coding is permanent.
