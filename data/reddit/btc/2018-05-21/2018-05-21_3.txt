0	1526894839	44	No need to talk about LN again and again. Focus on bitcoin cash. Everyone has the right to pursue their own goal. Let the time tell.
1	1526895941	10	Rememeber there are always new people around that are interested to hear both sides. If the topic is worthwhile it'll get uovoted
2	1526902470	2	It’s such a failure that you guys need to upvote it to say what a failure it is everyday. 
2	1526911645	-1	"LN is a proven failure" is not helpful towards new people, it's a hitpiece, not a opinionated argument.
1	1526895708	-3	Won't fit the agenda
0	1526880779	37	By the way, this article is from 2015 by Chris Pacia
1	1526883437	27	It's amazing that all the short comings and flaws are already understood by Chris Pacia years ago and still all small blockers think the LN is a silver bullet.
2	1526886183	29	Not to take away from Pacia, but several people have been warning about the shortcomings of the LN since the start, they were very obvious, but the Cult of Core pulled a big con.
2	1526883846	19	Chris Pacia is underestimated
3	1526919792	3	Saw him speak. I enjoy the reassurance of being in the same boat with him.
1	1526881527	26	"Which is why it comes across as irresponsible to go “all-in” on lightning at this point."It's still irresponsible in 2018
1	1526902707	2	This is 2018, LN in live on main net and OB1 is going to have an ICO.
2	1526918028	9	and the decetntralized routing problem is *still* not solved!
2	1526903765	1	what is OB1
3	1526908769	1	Open Bazaar?
4	1526910113	1	Right

5	1526918414	6	Probably banned.  
3	1526929660	1	Good bot
0	1526900768	16	Maybe it isn't lightning that is a failure. It's a cool technology and I'm sure it will find it's usecases. The bad thing, as I see it, is that it has been put forward as a solution to a problem long before you know if it's capable of solving it.
1	1526910918	5	I doubt it's even capable of solving it to be honest. Even if LN was fully deployed Bitcoin would need much larger blocks on the long run.LN is only for frequent transactions between two services and has a lot of inconvenients
0	1526888919	13	Predictions are a proven failure
0	1526886324	15	adoptation rate will be parabolic. its just working and doing what it should.
1	1526929999	2	> adoptation rate will be parabolicShoot up quickly, level off, start falling, them plummet? Sounds about right.

2	1526914565	1	RemindMe! 18 months
0	1526900835	10	Proven failure?   Seems to me it succeeded in its mission, to freeze BTC development, cause massive defection and market confusion, etc.
0	1526882067	10	Given the speed of development and implementation of LN I would think a tapestry would be a better format to report on it.
1	1526882482	10	The best I can understand is that there is no adoption except for those who want to test it
2	1526884911	15	Not surprising for something that is still in development and only suitable for testing.
3	1526885181	6	Then it make no sense. How can you promote fast, easy, safe, cheap, and reliable transactions if only suitable for testing ?
4	1526885293	8	I don't think anyone's promoting it for the general public to use yet. I don't understand, you are criticising it because it's not finished? 
5	1526885378	8	on-chain is ready for mass adoption 
6	1526885517	3	Yep.
6	1526885645	1	What does LN have to do with it? The two are orthogonal.
7	1526885856	4	without LN there is no fork, no need to rush a second layer, nothing is hard to understand, basic math
8	1526887343	4	LN would have been developed in any case, fork or not, because it is useful application of bitcoin smart contracts.Fork happened because there was no consensus on how to scale bitcoin.
9	1526887816	10	explain to me how you can have a consensus when the main debat was censored 
6	1526902188	-4	No it's not you fucking moron.  Onchain transactions for mass adoption needs at minimum gigabyte blocks.  Really terabyte blocks. 
7	1526904115	4	"mass adoption" is a subjective term. To you, in your ideal case, it evidently means the entire population of the earth making 50\+TX/day. No problem with that, and no... we are not there yet. To others, it just means Pay\-Pal level throughput, which is about where we're sitting. No need for name\-calling.
4	1526895662	4	That article is OLD, look at the transactions bro... BTC is moving right along. Bcash peeps stick to this Satoshi white paper is law. What makes you think “satoshi” hasn’t moved on to work on other ideas like lightning network or Elastos or whatever. When a protocol works it works no need to bash the competition. Your better functioning product will speak for you. If ... it is better 
5	1526936336	1	No way Rong Chen is Satoshi  
3	1526895978	1	So why is it on live environment then?
4	1526897153	3	Some people are a bit impatient and like to jump into things early. It's a distributed system with open source implementations so you can't really stop people. I think it's kinda nice that people are so excited, but it may be a bit counterproductive.
2	1526899503	1	Can’t that exact thing be said about bitcoin and the first 1000 blocks or so
0	1526907464	6	Shoutout to Chris Pacis for having the foresight 2.5 years ago. 
0	1526910262	4	Moronic biased title op
0	1526924838	2	2011: bitcoin has existed for 3 years and nobody uses it. Multisig for even less, and wallet cannot be encrypted. What a failure.Some people are gifted with vision. Some are not.
0	1526909609	1	Interesting article. Some comments that should clarify the current situation.>Which is why it comes across as irresponsible to go “all-in” on lightning at this point.Nobody is going "all-in", not at the time nor now. The "off-chain scaling" plan is to have different solutions for different use cases: On-chain for very large txs, LN for "coffee", specific sidechains for other uses (say Blockstrem's Liquid for large and frequent merchant-to-merchant payments; Rootstock for smart contracts, ...), drivechains and whatever else people will come up with.  It's not "LN or nothing", never was, never will be.>My main concern from the beginning was that, as a hub-and-spoke payment layer, there would be very few hubs and the network would be quasi-centralized and a regulatory sitting duck.A valid concern.>This network topology would be OK if there are many small payment hubs (like hundreds or thousands), but would royally suck if there are only handful of large hubs. It would be Visa, MasterCard, and Amex all over again.Yep, very true.>**How many hubs?**>the high cost of running a payment hub is likely to serve as a severe barrier to entry and create centralization pressure.This is a valid argument, which is true in general. Luckily, LN hubs *don't* have high cost of running! There's now >2,000 hubs established on main net already, and this is after ~3 months of live beta. How many after a year? I'll certainly start one in the near future, doesn't even seem to be necessary to beef up my RasPi3!>If Charlie didn’t have at least 0.5 BTC ($220 at today’s price) pre-deposited in Bob’s channel, then the payment could not have been made.>#Now this money does not constitute a loan of any sort. Charlie would retain 100% control of it.Emphasis mine, as the opposite is often claimed in this sub. >But the money at least needs to sit there in these channels to facilitate these off-chain payments. We know that the time value of money is a thing, so there is a very real cost to operating a payment hubTrue, that's why LN hubs get some tiny fees, to compensate for it.>Not to mention you need to come up with a lot of money up front just to get started.This is a false premise... as mentioned above, LN is for "coffee", not for downpayments on your house. $100 into LN, and you could already be a mini hub. Say $1,000, and you can start earning some regular fees. Now $1,000 is not chump change, not for me anyway, but that most definitely does not qualify as "a lot of money". Very many people can afford it, all over the world.>Some redditors I’ve run into seem to think people will be able to run payment hubs from their bedrooms. I’d like to suggest that’s not going to be the case.Well, looking at the statistics on main net today, it absolutely seems like redditors are running hubs from their bedroom.Even better, people who are not very technical can run a hub!!! Remember [the guys who can't get money out of LN](https://www.reddit.com/r/lightningnetwork/comments/8ir6d5/how_can_i_withdraw_my_funds_from_my_lightening/)???>So at the end of the day centralization is a major cause for concern if the lightning network ends up with a hub-and-spoke topology.Agreed... **if**...&nbsp;There's more... can't go through all of it now. But more or less every point above has been countered by the live demonstration of LN. Looking at it today, live on main net, the future is pretty bright.&nbsp;Additional thoughts. The argument "high cost is a centralization pressure" equally applies to running nodes and mining. If "a handful of large hubs" is "AMEX/VIsa/MasterCard all over again", why is this not true when there are only a handful of miners??? Why are large LN hubs different from large miners? (Rhetorical question, it's not.)On the number and size of LN hubs/nodes, my guess is that we'll end up with a Pareto law kind of distribution. ~20% of the nodes will have ~80% of the capacity, which is a natural distribution of wealth in a healthy society. (The problem is 1% have 90% of the wealth... ) That gives plenty of nodes, all over the world, to make a completely decentralized network.&nbsp;cc /u/chris_pacia 
1	1526912369	2	> It's not "LN or nothing", never was, never will be.For a person in Venezuela confronting US$50 on-chain fees it very much will have to be "LN or nothing" or perhaps a much better "LN or Bitcoin (Cash)"
2	1526921561	0	Oh please stop the virtue signaling. That same person in Venezuela will have to rely on huge server farms for their "sound money" because they will never be able to afford to validate the entire chain, or every txs. So instead of the government printing money it'll be the miners printing money, without being able to do anything about it. Once the situation recovers for them, they'll be able to afford the $50 fees as well.
3	1526923447	2	Why the need to validate the entire chain when we have SPV wallets? Do you accept the results of football matches because you see commentators and TV were there and they stake their reputations on always providing true scores, and you can watch the highlights to get an idea what happened - or do you only accept the results of football matches that you personally attended, therefor do you accept the winner of the league as it would be impossible for you to of witnessed personally all football matches at the same time?> Once the situation recovers for them, they'll be able to afford the $50 fees as well.Urrr. I think you'll find in the most advanced central/South American countries $50 is a heck of a lot of money still, and in Africa and heck for many in Europe and USA $50 is notable sum, certainly not something to write off as loose change.

And since an SPV is like an ATM, trusting what others feed them and powerless against the central bank's money printing, that is the reason why I want to validate every tx. So one day I won't wake up to the unpleasant surprise of miners printing money. If that doesn't concern you, we have different goals for cryptos.
5	1526925196	1	Isn't one of your non-mining nodes pretty powerless against miners if they printed money? What's the most it can do? Pack up its toys and go home - it certainly can't fork.You clearly don't understand the tech, if you don't trust SPVs and the ability to quickly confirm a recent block hash to know you are participating in the one true chain, then clearly how can you trust even basic concepts of any crypto such as public/private keys and how the heck can you trust complicated 2nd layers such as Lightning?The analogy with a football match was the simplest I could think of. Only miners are the ones playing football who can change the outcome of the match - even you with your Raspberry Pi node are just a viewer and don't participate in anything.
