1	1526869917	3	Find your own BCH
2	1526870215	1	That's right. Tell'em
1	1526870147	1	Yeah dude.
0	1526887054	14	Some quick reality for you:1) It's not Florida, it's Seminole County which is in Florida 2) It's "coming soon" as in, Seminole county currently does not accept bitcoin.3) You can't send Seminole county bitcoin directly. You send Bitcoin to **Bitpay**'s wallet, then **Bitpay** gives Seminole county US dollars, not bitcoin.Seminole county is just another **Bitpay** registration, albeit it is Bitpay's first city/county registrationDoes Seminole county know what "Bitcoin Cash" is or how it's different from Bitcoin? probably not. If Bitpay accepted Dogecoin, then does Seminole county accept Dogecoin? No.  **Roger Ver** was an early investor in **Bitpay**, Bitmain has a strategic partnership with **Bitpay**, and obviously Bitpay is a strong proponent of Bitcoin Cash. https://blog.bitpay.com/bitmain-agreement/https://news.bitcoin.com/bitpay-partners-bitmain-multi-million-dollar-agreement/  Not surprising.

1	1526924943	1	Oh, all right. Thank you. The site where i found it says literally "Florida Accepts BTC & BCH for Tax Payments" and in the article says quiete the same. It was a clickbait a guess.
