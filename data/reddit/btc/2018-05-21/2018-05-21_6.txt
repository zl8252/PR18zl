1	1526902627	12	Technically, as far as I understand (but please correct me if I am wrong /u/adangert), this seems rather closer to a desktop wallet than a web wallet.But your point of course is valid. Don't keep lots of money in insecure wallets, and that goes for any wallet with keys saved on a computer connected to the internet.
2	1526915505	2	I would say it's a nice mix of both, since you control your own keys completely, and it natively interacts with the web. But yes it is closer to a desktop wallet, than the other "web" wallets out there.Also, since this is a browser based wallet you should keep a smaller amount in it that you would want to use on a daily basis, like a real wallet. However there also is the ability to encrypt the wallet with a password as well for extra security.
1	1526913500	3	Especially in a browser wallet. 
0	1526894812	7	Awesome! I've made a few posts recently about the lack of open source wallets, so this has settled my jimmies :) will check it out later today
0	1526887876	7	Is this a new wallet? Is it open source?
1	1526887939	23	relatively new, I've been working on it on and off for the past few months, and just updated it to work on firefox (its been enabled on chrome for a month or two now).The idea is that it turns bch addresses into hyperlinks you can click on and send funds to easily, hopefully it will also work with bitpay links soon.Here's a video of the web-wallet in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXGEL-mEXhYThe source code is here: https://github.com/adangert/BitcoinCashWallet
2	1526902380	7	> The idea is that it turns bch addresses into hyperlinks you can click on and send funds to easily, hopefully it will also work with bitpay links soon.I would go even one step further - allow a website (with a blacklist / whitelist) to call your wallet and pop it up when it wants a payment.And then you should totally go and implement the other end (a point-of-sale) and go to the news orgs. like washington post and others who have paywalls now and offer this as an option.I think it can become *extremely* smooth: A site could open a 'pay with credit card or whatever' kind of pop up and still allow that pop up to be paid silently with BCH.*Without even having to mention BCH anywhere!*And, given that some seem still to avoid cryptos because of the 'illegal drugs' stench it carries, this would be a great way for people who want to sell stuff to offer BCH as an option without that being in anyones face.Just an embedded 'will pop up wallet' payment code that then prefills all the data so that I can use your wallet to smoothly pay, popup disappears, boom done. And on the next time, maybe even a 'pay if amount less than X and same site' kind of automatic setup.Would that make sense in your opinion?By the way, /u/tippr $20

3	1526915946	2	Oh wow! Thank you!Also yeah, any method that makes payments easier online would probably be a good idea to work in. I think the easiest at this point is to get it highly integrated with the existing point of sale bch buttons out there, like bitpay.Take it a step further, and I think a mobile extension like this could be used as a way to login to websites, or even have some subscription based method that accompanies that login method. (i.e. 5 cents to access the Washington Post for a week, and they can verify that you paid simply by clicking a button online), similar to what you were talking about, although I think keeping website solutions for payments, wallet agnostic, is probably a better idea at this point, that is, payment buttons and the like, should also have the ability to pop up a qr code for non web-based wallets to interact with.
3	1526922343	1	This is a really great idea, we could start using that now
2	1526903081	3	Ok, I just tried it out. Yeehaw. This indeed looks great. Small suggestion: Also display the old style address when clicking on receive, for software that isn't updated yet. :)Is there already a way for a website to generate a payment request that your wallet will answer?
3	1526916456	1	I think it's probably better to just stay with the new format for now, make it less confusing in the long run for users, not to mention removes any possibility of the btc problem, plus one can check what their legacy address is with a tool such as https://cashaddr.bitcoincash.org/If you have a hyperlink with a bch address, and an amount specified, than clicking it will just bring up a large Pay button, the next step is to get documentation and examples of buttons you can put on your website for users to interact with.

2	1526915795	1	Nice job. Similar to rush wallet 4 yrs ago. 
0	1526900212	6	Awesome!I'll have to check this out, this is exactly the kind of stuff BCH needs!
0	1526897794	4	Nifty.  How is the fee calculated?
1	1526916613	1	https://blockdozer.com/insight-api/utils/estimatefee/Although I think this may be in KB or something, which is why fees are 1000 Satoshis at the moment. There is an open issue to look into this, and have reduced fees.
0	1526902079	3	Awesome! This is exactly the kind of stuff of what we need more.I have to still try it out, though :-)Does it also have some kind of potential interaction with the website, so that a website can embed a special code / payment request to call the wallet with a pre-filled destination amount and address?
1	1526916958	2	yes, right now if you create a hyperlink with a bch address, and an amount specified, then clicking on this button will bring up a large and easy pay button to click. The next step will be getting out documentation to make it very easy to add to your website.
0	1526903601	4	Hey /u/ryancarnated, please integrate this/allow this to be used with your money button :D
0	1526905802	3	This looks great! Is it possible to back the wallet up? 
1	1526917542	2	yes, there is a button to show your private key in the options for the wallet. 
0	1526912310	2	Interesting wallet proposal.It has a side effect however ; since it is analyzing any bch address in text forms and replace them on the fly by inserting a "bitcoin-address" class div, in firefox at least and in some textboxes instances (typically wordpress editor), it blanks it completely. You should have a look, /u/adangert ...
1	1526917034	2	Oh interesting, do you have an example of that? I'll add an issue about it.
2	1526923358	1	I've installed the plugin to my firefox ; I have a wordpress opened ; whenever the text form contains a plain BCH address, upon reload of the page (by saving a post for instance), the text form is blanked (the text is replaced in full by the div + bch address).It probably has to do with the way the plugin analyzes the page and modify the DOM to insert the div for the bitcoin address class.
0	1526922782	0	> Add Bitcoin Cash Wallet? It requires permission to:> Access your data from all websites.Uhm ... no, thanks.
1	1526923855	4	Apart of the reason for this is because it turns all bch addresses into clickable hyperlinks, so it requires similar permissions to an adblocker.The source code is here of you would like to take a look: https://github.com/adangert/BitcoinCashWallet
