0	1526925443	7	the only problem i had yet with that combination was:i've funded my bitcoin.com wallet (thus only one input), then paid a merchant (using bitpay), then tried to pay another merchant using bitpay again, but the wallet did not want to send the funds, because the only input remaining had no blockchain confirmationsno idea if this is a bitcoin.com wallet issue or something with bip-70 / bitpaybut after a bit of searching i found this: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/wiki/COPAY---FAQ#why-creating-a-transaction-proposal-lock-my-balance-and-is-significantly-higher-than-the-proposal-amount

So in your case, you need to wait for a number of confirmations on the change output from the previous transaction.Per default, the bitcoin.com wallet is set up to use unconfirmed outputs, which work ok in the non-payment-protocol case, the unconfirmed output and your new transaction will be confirmed in the same block, the next block.
0	1526926101	4	Yep, I used the bitcoin.com wallet recently to pay for food [just like with the copay wallet](https://gfycat.com/FrequentSadDinosaur), it's great! Maybe you could make a quick demonstration video yourself?
0	1526928039	4	Totally agree. Time & time again, I keep coming back to the bitcoin.com wallet because it is clearly the best wallet for Bitcoin Cash. The only feature that I wish it had is a feature that the btc.com wallet has: the ability to see how much your transaction was worth in fiat currency at the time of transaction vs. right now.
1	1526931699	2	Yes. a better display of past txs including memo field and Fiat value as of the tx would make it fab. Extra points for being able to export this table.

0	1526927423	2	**Honestly this is exactly why Bitcoin was created.** *Before someone says it, obviously we wish the companies would accept the crypto themselves.* But we're not there.  Bitpay is an amazing fantastic company that allows you to join the crypto future TODAY.  Absolutely awesome.   I actually spend and replace so these tools are so awesome.

0	1526932106	0	Agreed. They really work well together. Also in conjunction with Gyft. I go to to Whole Foods without money in my pocket, shop around, enter the checkout queue, and while standing in line I buy a new whole foods gift card with the Gyft app. It automatically launches my Bitcoin.com wallet. Couldn't be smoother. I've run into timeout or error about 1/10 times, it has already worked by simply trying again.
0	1526932286	1	Woah! I see youâ€™re a fellow dutchy and I wasnâ€™t aware this worked for us in the Netherlands! Awesome! 
0	1526933258	1	Since i discovered I can order food online and pay with bch here in Germany, I've done so at least a dozen times. I always leave a message about the advantages of BCH vs. Visa, MasterCard and PayPal for the restaurants and have had 2 delivery guys ask me about Bitcoin Cash :)

0	1526928323	-7	Speaking of scams. https://m.imgur.com/a/ydbmVVY Roger Ver is actively misleading people into believing things that are are not true.   Overwhelming consensus in the crypto community is essentially the foundation of what cryptocurrency is all about. As it stands, overwhelming consensus in the cryptocurrency community states:  1. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are two separate cryptocurrencies.  2. BTC and BCH are the ticker symbols representing Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash respectively. Because of this overwhelming consensus, it is reasonable to conclude anyone who wishes to honestly pair the ticker symbol along side the name of a cryptocurrency would do so in the way the overwhelming majority has already agreed upon. Which is: Bitcoin (BTC)Bitcoin Cash (BCH) The methods displayed by Roger Ver are clearly fraudulent and deceitful. "Bitcoin Core (BTC)""Bitcoin (BCH)" The overwhelming consensus has not agreed upon the names continuously being published by Roger Ver. Because of the facts I have stated above, I believe it is reasonable to conclude the names Roger Ver regularly publishes to identify the two different cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, are not only confusing but dishonest, deceitful, and fraudulent.   Edit:  lots of downvotes.   No one capable of refuting my facts?  
1	1526929022	5	**Bitcoin** BCH is Peer-To-Peer-Electronic **Cash**The segregated non-cash settlement chain is not anymore, by definition. Deal with it. 
1	1526928474	0	You keep stating this is all about Roger and his tactics. It's not, you fucking idiot. 
1	1526928748	1	i would agree that there is nothing positive from information being displayed as it is in this screenshot and only results in negative outcomes.
1	1526931262	0	You're essentially saying, "Most people disagree with you so stop trying to convince other people of your cause," denying a perspective shared by many simply because it is a minority opinion.  
2	1526935666	1	I mean...  That ***is*** how consensus works.  Literally how blockchains works.   
1	1526931692	0	r\bitcoin is the only one scamming people here.1) BTC and Bitcoin Cash are 2 seperate currnecies, 'Bitcoin' is either both of them of neither of them2) BTC represent BTC-COre and BCH represents Bitcoin Cash3) only one of the above is a p2p electorni cash, therefore is only  one of BCH or BTC are bitocin then it is BCH.So either BCH is bitcoin, bch and btc are both bitcoin right now, or neither are bitcoin.this really isn't very hard to understand is it?
