2	1522682130	1	That will be the bottom. I'm still 100% on that
3	1522682174	1	So you confirm our bet? 2:1?
0	1522681575	1	My opinion on how we got here is on October 31st CME announces futures trading.  Institutional money knows they can exploit this feature on a major platform.  So they started buying up bitcoins until the FUD starts for segwit2x in middle November.  Segwit2x was an attempted takeover of the development team by major businesses in bitcoin such as the DCG bitpay and coinbase.After that fud passed the institutional money continued to buy.  This happened until a little after futures started going live on December 11th.  Later that week we hit the all time high and in my opinion this is when big money shorted bitcoin on CME and sold what they bought on the run up to 19k+.  This was a big move to make money and manipulate the market with the help of mainstream media and fomo.After a few months of shorts this is where we are.  We are near equilibrium with a lot more users, LN is live, and there's all kinds of great stuff going on in bitcoin.  I don't think the price will go much lower, but it can.  I think we'll start to see some calmness in the market as we grow.  Bitcoin is bigger and better than ever and this is a really exciting time.

3	1522683559	1	it's not an analysis,  it's trying to explain your misfortune as a conspiracy against you.  You did this to yourself.

1	1522684103	1	You are right but you forgot the IRS theft of day trading profits
2	1522686434	1	yeah that too taxes kept me acting conservative 
1	1522682319	1	i would like nothing more than a boring market again  like it was last summer
1	1522685452	1	By its very nature, futures trading tames wild swings in markets.  It's what you want, unless you want to-the-moon performance(swings) out of Bitcoin.  Soon, Bitcoin will join the other ships in this great ocean of global currencies.  They will sink or sail on their own merit and how well the bilge pumps keep each of them afloat.   Some have a lot of holes in them.  Others have a crypto hull that is impenetrable.

0	1522683717	1	I have still some blood in my alcohol stream, so bear with me. I didn't see [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/7N1fZ6pT/) happening in real time 'cause I was busy with bbq ribs but now that I see what happened it looks like all those predictions about 3.5-4k within the end of the month may be utterly wrong by a long shot. We know it's a manipulated market and we got used to pumps but that one looks quite odd to me. And not because of how much it pumped the price, which is pretty normal by btc standards. It's not a matter of how much but *where*. It happened after the long term trendline was confirmed broken [two hourly candles below the line] and it got us back into the "safe" zone. To me it doesn't look like it was an ordinary pump. It was a rescue./back to bbq
1	1522683848	1	imma join that bbq
1	1522684391	1	I could be wrong, but since the recent crash I have seen quite a few beartraps where shorters have been squeezed. To me it appears planned. If some of the most obsessed shorters are economically damaged through a series of clever traps, this would certainly improve the price recovery for bitcoin. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate shorters and margin traders. But shorting at low price levels and hoping for a complete crash just isn't a healthy mindset, and there will be risks with such behavior.
2	1522687413	1	I don't think anything we've seen so far qualifies as a short squeeze.  I would believe that these sharp spikes recently are shorts covering,  but they are in no panic to cover.   Any short positions of significance were likely taken in the mid teens down to maybe 10K,  they are very safe positions.  Every now and then a short decide's they need to cash out,  so they buy, with abandon, to cover their short.Also,  it is VERY difficult to short bitcoin,  no matter how you try,  there is always some very real risk of a breakdown somewhere in the chain.   The fear of getting stuck in a bad trade due to an exchange failure is too much for many.  Shorting bitcoin,  even at 15K,  takes big balls.  
3	1522687758	1	Possibly you are right. Personally I suspect that some of the more extreme shorters work in pools in order to provide security and extra liquidity. While their tactics probably worked fine at higher price altitudes, they have stumbled upon more uncertain terrain down here. This lower terrain is native bullground and it takes balls, or overblown confidence, to bet on dropping prices when another bullrun may be around the corner.
4	1522688781	1	Most shorts conclude the bull runs are over for a long time before they short,  in my experience.  It's the only real risk,  so you have to eliminate it in your mind.  The decision is pretty simple,  which history do you look at to try and decide?   If you use bitcoin's previous history,  you believe a bull run is probably and soon.  If you use the Internet's stock price history,  you believe there are no more bull runs,  just slow (or 0 or neg)  growth.TL;DR  most shorts are not panicking , don't expect a miracle 'short squeeze'
3	1522688629	1	You can short bitcoin outside exchanges and have it settled in dollars on CME.
4	1522689474	1	I'm talking naked shorts,  the CME options are WAY too thin.

1	1522680299	1	Would any dads in this daily consider saving Bitcoin for your children's 18th or 21st birthdays?
0	1522665515	3	Is  **1 Satoshi** worth **1 US dollar**?
1	1522666357	2	Nop.Check the value of 1 Satoshi here:https://99bitcoins.com/satoshi-usd-converter/
0	1522675627	3	We might see a small bullrun soon. Just be careful.
1	1522675871	3	The fomo train is scheduled to arrive in 15 minutes. But it could also be a trap.
2	1522676165	1	Right, could be a false signal, but I'd stay alert anyway since I saw a whale flashing a stack of 200 bitcoin in the bids at Bitfinex for a second. Sometimes this is a bluff, sometimes it is shown before a bullrun. Hard to know.I would interpret it somewhere along these lines: "I understand that you might want to short at this point. My suggestion is for you to consider it very hard, because just maybe, we are a bit hungry today. I could be bluffing, but are you feeling lucky today, right now?"
3	1522676338	2	Here's the schedule.https://imgur.com/a/5LnxzBut a fourth time in a row might as well be a trap...
4	1522676870	2	Sure, can well be a trap in either direction, but I'd be cautious either way.
5	1522678918	1	It's a trap!
6	1522684945	1	Bear trap! :D
7	1522685144	1	Indeed. In moments like those, I'm happy to be a hodler and not a trader.They would steal all my money with ease.
8	1522686362	1	True indeed!I hold with my main stack and trade with a smaller stack, so if price goes up I make most profit and then I have some general fun with the trading stack in regards to fluctuations.Yesterday I made a smaller misjudgement and got hit by a sudden bullrun with a minor loss. Today I corrected that mistake and got back on track. I guess I learned a lesson to not cross the bulls when they are out for blood. :)
4	1522680366	1	true, how much longer can they keep these shenanigans up?my guess is by the end of the week we will be past the 7.2 barrier maybe the middle of the week actually. 
5	1522680485	1	Or down to 6k. We're still in a huge bear flag...
6	1522680838	1	I'm beginning to belive that 5.8k is as low as we will ever get so, maybe. who knows though, damn bears have been toying with us for days. just when it seems they are running out of steam, they come back with vengeance.
1	1522686389	1	We may, but I’ve read it will dip again.  Then the bull run. 
2	1522686456	1	Sure, anything is possible.Bulls also contribute to controlled dips at times when they generate liquidity by selling before a coming bull-run.
0	1522679483	1	seems like start dumping 
0	1522680737	1	I have one problem, I can't buy any bitcoin.Because all my money is already bitcoins since 3 years ago.
1	1522681017	1	> Because all my money is already bitcoins since 3 years ago.Let me see I guess that means you are sitting pretty then.
0	1522683198	1	Wow, quite the rise, welcome back 7k!
0	1522683679	1	$7200 would be nice. k thx
1	1522685923	1	$72,000 also welcome
2	1522687684	1	Ok we're off to $72
0	1522685044	1	Today I got my paycheck and quarterly bonus for the first quarter2018. Waiting for a big  dump. I wish it will come before rocketing up. 
0	1522691235	1	[Totally organic, no pattern, no manipulation btw](https://imgur.com/a/VPowu)
1	1522691449	1	Not only manipulation, but suppression.
1	1522691712	1	the recent pumps are just people closing their shorts with market buys. you can check the BTCUSDSHORTS on bitfinex and will see that its almost 100% correlated. nothing to do with manipulation
0	1522666698	7	I would be careful with selling at this point if the goal is to re-enter at a lower price. Sure, you might luck out, but you also might not. If you sell for profit and don't plan to buy in again then that would be a different matter.The market is different at this point than when we had a continuous downtrend. There is much more confidence and buying pressure at this level and point in time. I wouldn't be surprised to see occasional sudden spikes, which have already happened a couple of times, even during the night when everyone thought the buying volumes were low.While sudden drops could happen, they might also be cancelled out by quick bullruns, resulting in squeezing shorters and bears. A higher price altitude would be a safer terrain for those that plan on selling and re-entering at a lower price point. Plus, better margins for gains.After the worst crash this year to 6k at February 6th, we didn't see the 7k level again for weeks after the market had recovered and passed that price point. This doesn't mean that we can't see a worsening of the market, I just wouldn't bet on it.This is merely my humble opinion. Stay safe and avoid risky bets.
1	1522668465	2	Just looking at the rsi you can tell we really are in the oversold area. That alone should give good odds of the price going up. Besides that, lately weve seen alot of pumps before dumping again. No way im selling at this point. 
2	1522669282	2	Right. Plus, when whales play poker they keep most of their cards hidden.After a crash, some whales have a tendency to buy low, sell at a chosen high point, wait for the price to drop and then push up again with force to a new higher peak, confusing the market with a sudden burst that catches people off-guard when they were thinking the price was dropping.When whales battle, the smaller fish, such as most of us, may want to wait out the results before making drastic, rash decisions. Small fish like myself tend to have better odds at higher altitudes where the market is generally easier to read.
3	1522669407	1	Some small fish have sharp teeth.
4	1522669782	1	Sure, but in poker you only see the cards on the table.It takes volume to move the market and the piranhas sometimes miscalculate how much buying pressure and buying volume there really is at a particular level. Altitude matters in risk-vs-gain calculations.
0	1522678914	1	Now some action begins, will be interesting to see how it plays out.
0	1522684732	1	I think the fact we didn't get as low as we did in the first week of February is a good sign. However, I still think we haven't really reached the capitulation/ despair levels yet. 
0	1522689494	1	[fomo hodlers be like](https://youtu.be/cIwTYL1fwJk)
0	1522664538	3	Is there an optimum amount of nodes in a blockchain network? How many is enough? When do blockchains become "secure" (maybe robust is a better term here)? Do the number of nodes give diminishing returns on a chains robustness? Is robustness a word?Cheers. Just some thinking. I'm  sure many of you have had some of these thoughts and there is good literature out there, so looking forward to learning a bit today about node network mechanics. 
1	1522666469	2	The thing about the Bitcoin algorithm is that it self regulates its own parameters. Theoretically 3 nodes could sustain the entire network. It wouldn't matter, although more nodes means more security and descentralization.
1	1522672034	2	2 is enough
0	1522680386	1	We had 4 big pumps and zero dumps and downward trend, think its not that hard to conclude its pretty good time to sell before big dump comes. 
1	1522680603	1	On point. Classic bearish flag. 
0	1522685326	1	It looks like bear trap, pretending like bull trap
1	1522686367	1	Advanced trapping
2	1522686624	1	Or a bear trap that looks like bull trap pretending to be a bear trap
3	1522687910	1	Or the price going up and down.
1	1522685713	1	I hope so. The lowest 24h price is about to rise, forcing the market to take a decision: pumping hard to 8k or to dump to 6k.
2	1522688289	1	Why would the market feel forced to make a decision?
3	1522688560	1	The pressure emerges as far as the lowest and the highest 24h prices aproaches from the other.
4	1522688690	1	Wut? O_o
5	1522689495	1	It's only about trending analysis About the last 24hrs:High: 7125Low: 6740Avg: 6900-7000The distance between H and L can get even lower, what can sounds a kind of stabilizaton. But we still at a downtrend, what may sounds like a trap (bear or bull).
1	1522685485	1	Haha. I can't complain about lacking excitement in bitcoin prices recently.I just saw 300 bitcoin sums in the bids at Bitfinex orderbook a few moments ago, seems to be some hungry traders around. Will be interesting to see what they are up to.
0	1522669218	4	Will BTC pass and hold above $7100 today before a potential rally to $7500? what do you think.
1	1522671413	4	The market has been hard to read lately and while I don't want to speculate on particular price levels right now, I would be careful to bet on dropping prices. It may happen, we just don't know the likelihood and it would be a pure gamble. Not all cards are on the table and the market is still in recovery mode. Unexpected bullruns can show up instantly and reverse a drop when people expect the market to sink.Those that have already sold without exiting the market will generally predict low prices with absolute certainty since they seek to re-enter at a lower price with profit. This is understandable. However, when people make dead certain predictions like that, I tend to call bluff. A more nuanced observation is generally more realistic.
1	1522670688	3	I'm still rather pessimistic. This will change if we break through 7200.
1	1522669700	2	Perhaps. But this could be another *rinse and repeat* where the clever non-hodlers jump out and push it down towards $7600. Am also reading armchair analysts on Twitter predicting a drop to $6000.  So who knows?
2	1522670011	1	$6600 you mean, i agree with you. the pattern is so similiar to the last weeks, the pumps were just a bit bigger and in one turn. anyway, if we hold 7k today, then it might be a good week since the public holidys are over tomorrow and people might spent a bit 
3	1522670987	1	Those that are trying to move the market upwards are hoping FOMO kicks in and in the meantime are happy to rinse repeat $6400-$7200 and back and forth until FOMO or positive crypto news takes the market and BTC higher. 
4	1522675059	2	I mean, I'm good with it. Gave up on hodling for short term gains years ago. If I can make some profits in the meantime, who cares it btc ever gets to 100k?
1	1522671884	0	It makes sense to jump to 7500 and then drop to 6k
0	1522664009	2	we need a 2nd layer solution to avoid the taxes of an on chain transaction. I was thinking LN could give you the option to settle your channel with newly bought BTC and then return your original BTC escrow.
0	1522672633	2	I am so happy to wake up to some green today 
1	1522678979	1	I'll only believe it after I see 3 straight days of green.

1	1522680762	1	We'll see, it all depends on how the bulls have planned. If they sold over 7k and gained extra liquidity from that they might have extra surprises up their sleeves. It's far better than sports in any case, regardless which way it goes.

0	1522687584	1	Bitcoin adoption is lagging. CME Futures was a big hit, but now that price has crashed to the max who is actually interested in adopting this thing?So i guess what it comes down to is the hodlers. If they continue to hodl and defend some kind of low for the next year or so, then a new bull market can start, and maybe people will be more keen to adopt it then.

1	1522675173	1	You said the price would drop drastically during the night and it didn't happen. Sure, I have made incorrect predictions myself many times, that happens. Also I understand that you want to reinvest at a lower price point than you sold at. Though perhaps you should be upfront about it when you post links.
2	1522680559	1	who are you talking too? I know I never said that, as of late the prices have been going up at night - american time and going down in the morning.tho it was doing that fairly regularly a month or two ago, so I can see why one would make that prediction.
1	1522675249	1	As unstable as things have been, I feel like any moderately negative news, Even if relatively insignificant like that may push us lower.
2	1522676367	1	Why negative? Maybe they plan to shut Tether doubts once and for all and to open up to US citizen.
3	1522679888	1	I'm actually hoping for it. but not trying to be negative, just with all the margin traders these days that's kinda just how it goes.if you've ever wondered why everyone sells at the moment of bad news, well a big part of it is the people shorting. at this point it just seems to be the name of the game, whether or not youre on the margin.

2	1522681545	1	I was carefully watching the Internet bubble unwind in this timeframe 18 years ago.  I remember that starting on april 1 the NASDAQ's volatility rose until after tax day (15th).   The shorts were launching enormous FUD missiles,  carpet bombing the yahoo message boards.  The FUD missiles were armed with 'tax deadline' warheads.   Whatever the last trading day was before taxes were due,  was a total dud,  nothing much happened.  But the swings BEFORE taxday were wild,  I remember that for sure!EDIT: wild in 2001 is different than now, wild then is meh now.
