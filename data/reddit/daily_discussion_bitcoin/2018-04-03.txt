0	1522761948	6	The bottom was back in the first week of Feb. Onward and upward! We're just a month away from Bitcoin having been worth at least 2k for a full year. 
1	1522763227	2	i know right great point.  this year could secretly be epic...
2	1522763566	3	And then a month or so after that, Bitcoin would have been worth at least 3k for an entire year. If we get to September without dipping below 4k, Bitcoin would have been worth at least 4k for an entire year, and so on. 7k is to 2018 what 1k was to 2017. 
3	1522765736	1	i like the logic lets hope it pans out 
3	1522774386	1	And then a month after that probably 300k.
4	1522780196	1	Name checks out!
1	1522763678	2	Interesting perspective
0	1522773528	1	The silver lining in all this is that despite Bitcoin's price struggles Bcash has done worse.  All these months later and it is worth less than 10% of a Bitcoin.
1	1522776054	1	BTrash.
2	1522776911	1	Can you explain why it‚Äôs trash? I‚Äôm not saying that it isn‚Äôt I‚Äôm just genuinely curious to know what‚Äôs the problem with bcash since it‚Äôs following thinks it‚Äôs so much better then Bitcoin 
3	1522778242	1	I think it is mainly its following, with their toxicity, dishonest, manipulative marketing, conspiracy theories and tribal mentality which gives it a bad rep. There's nothing inherently wrong with the coin itself. Technically it's essentially Bitcoin with no Segwit, larger blocks, less adoption, 10th of the hashpower, twice the centralisation and fraction of the value.
3	1522777913	1	You think that probably because he has blocked most people who speak out against bcash. 
0	1522750119	4	Whats on the menu today ? 
1	1522750294	6	Cheese and whine probably
2	1522751615	6	No whine today. Have had enough over the weekend. 
2	1522753884	1	Classic! :-)
0	1522755890	4	Just found out about the conference Deconomy on #cryptotwitter - what an awesome speaker roster. If I had known about this conference beforehand I'd have gone; how do I stay abreast of leading conferences and events in the blockchain/crypto space? 
1	1522756520	3	Eh?  That wasn't a Bitcoin conference.  That was a tiny bunch of lying BCashers being either ignored by the audience, or mauled by ETH's developer.Did I miss some irony here?
1	1522760427	2	Google alerts? 
0	1522760900	4	Bulls are awake
0	1522761036	3	Pump them green dildos yeah
0	1522764725	3	Many experts on this sub change clothes and their opinions, twice a day. 
1	1522768651	1	I think you vastly overestimate some of these guys personal hygiene 
2	1522768899	1	They change their clothes, maybe, because they shit their pants every time bitcoin goes against their opinions ? 
1	1522765792	1	Is that your expert opinion?
2	1522766144	1	My observation. 
3	1522767092	1	mmhmm
0	1522766483	1	People getting all excited for 7400k. Claiming moon etc. Gosh : ‚ÄúDo you even bitcoin?‚Äù
1	1522770428	1	When it goes from 11700 to 6500 they cry. When it goes from 6500 to 7400 they act like they won the lottery despite being so much down.
2	1522776993	1	They? You were happy when your Bitcoin went from 11700 to 6500? Or you don‚Äôt have any?
2	1522776512	1	*Laughs in $3500*
1	1522767378	1	It's a start. 
0	1522769543	1	insane resistance close below 7.4k 
1	1522769679	1	Will be broken soon...
2	1522769783	1	Looks like its gonna pass the resistance soon. 
0	1522769864	1	considering McAfee might have been paid to post his bet, do you think he‚Äôd really eat his own dick? dudes insane but idk 
1	1522770087	1	I always wonder who will cut his dick for him ? Will he cut himself ? 
2	1522770200	1	and how would we know if it was really *his* dick?
3	1522770349	1	Yeah, many unanswered questions. Lets hope bitcoin stops at 999999 to avoid everyone trouble. 
2	1522770139	1	hell break a few ribs and then gonna eat it
3	1522770598	1	Then how would he grill it ? 
3	1522770509	1	I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he‚Äôd already had a few removed 
2	1522774414	1	I've heard he's going to hire a private investigator, kill him and eat him instead.
2	1522780190	1	Dtheyll call Lorena bobbit
0	1522771086	1	People worried about calling the bottom right now:https://imgur.com/gallery/JvcMBei
0	1522778182	1	I don‚Äôt think this is a pump this time.  Growth looks organic for a change.  If we make it over 8k I feel like this thing is going to really heat up 
1	1522780257	1	Problem is: Bear flags and bull traps look very organic, too. Until they break down. Let's hope this one won't break down...
0	1522759759	6	Moon time
1	1522762840	2	with lambo ?
1	1522764218	2	Will buy the Dip when the price goes below 5,000 lol
1	1522778383	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loz-t9Bt9Lo
0	1522769568	1	I just know as soon as I buy in it will dip again...
1	1522769955	1	Happens to me all the time. Think long term and it won‚Äôt matter 
2	1522770101	1	I agree, I'm a buyer for all bitcion under 10,000, then in December I will re-evaluate, but you have to give a stock/coin a chance to mature or fail.
1	1522770037	1	so true
2	1522772626	1	fml
1	1522778300	1	average the buy so the pain is spread over two streaks of bad luck
0	1522772853	1	The Bit is surging!
1	1522775113	1	It ain't. Not yet. 
2	1522775966	1	argh....
0	1522776905	1	This little rise is a blip on the monthly chart. 
0	1522775593	1	Rise you bastard. 
0	1522752028	6	You have to love waking up to all that green in the morning! 
1	1522754444	10	You can still buy one of those old monitor that shows everything in green.
1	1522757074	2	It‚Äôs green compared to 24h ago. Compare with 7 days ago and cry
2	1522766910	1	Shhhhhh, one day at a time homie
0	1522752120	2	I am on such a hang. 
0	1522766812	1	Expert opinion - Puke and Rally
0	1522772907	1	hang tough $7400
0	1522773976	1	Well played bitcoin xD $7456.89 xD but god its not 4567.89 ;)
0	1522778328	1	another pump coming
1	1522778427	1	Are you betting on it? ;)
1	1522778845	1	i bet 100 BTC a pump will come
2	1522779617	1	Don't jinx it!
0	1522778737	1	How come that xxx123abcwhatever guy never shows up when btc goes up?
1	1522779475	1	When btc is steadily rising they give the fudster goof troop the day off. 
0	1522750442	3	Great news, but for what ?
0	1522774284	1	Experts say 12k end of the week.
1	1522774916	1	Which experts ?
2	1522775444	1	All
3	1522775488	1	lol
3	1522775478	1	So you‚Äôre just talking crap then 
4	1522776634	1	Top. Minds.
0	1522749712	3	Wohoo first comment May the god of crypto now bless me with riches 
1	1522771000	1	moar lambos!
2	1522779467	1	üöò closest I could find for a Lambo emoji :(
0	1522765588	2	Bears are back from Easter holidays, they just get up
0	1522754110	1	Important point reaching around 7.6K. We need to break it, and stay around 8K consistently to come out of this short term bear trend.https://ibb.co/e0SgzxIf we go down from here, it is not a good news unfortunately folks...
1	1522760501	2	lol
1	1522760964	1	On point.
1	1522778499	1	After the first 6k I expected a 8k range month, but there was the double 11k ceiling (which caused me much fomo and much lostees). I still think a 8k range/band will be the norm for the next monthes, even though bitcoin being wilder, surges can be expected earlier.
0	1522757726	2	Now that the dip is gone I‚Äôm glad I bought it. Haven‚Äôt seen that 10k never again guy in a while.  We‚Äôre probably heading past that in the next couple of days. Still good buying opportunity. 
1	1522763937	3	[deleted]
2	1522765700	2	It‚Äôs wishing dude relax didn‚Äôt mean to piss you off.  You don‚Äôt know it could be 6k next week....Nobody knows what they‚Äôre talking about when it comes to predictions. My comment is poking to the user who been posting ‚Äú 10k never again‚Äù in this discussion. I believe it be over 10k again but I don‚Äôt know when exactly but I have an idea and opinion. 
3	1522766508	1	[deleted]
4	1522767763	1	I don‚Äôt get how you can make a prediction that it could be 6k next week... 
5	1522767884	1	[deleted]
6	1522767939	1	Probably 
7	1522768394	1	[deleted]
8	1522768584	1	Yeah, you‚Äôre getting upset by other‚Äôs opinions that don‚Äôt matter to you. 
5	1522779336	1	Anybody can make predictions man, be easy on the guy. And it's just as likely it will be 6k next week as it is that it will be 10k next week. Bitcoin hasn't had a solid pattern of late. All the big investors are kinda just watching right now figuring out what to do. Him, like you,  like all of us Block chain lovers are excited and sometimes a little nervous of what is going on. It's only natural for us to speculate. But in the end it's important regardless of our speculation to trust and have faith in Block chain, because in the end... we all üåâMOONIN‚õºüòéüòéüòé
0	1522765985	1	I picked up the Nadex Bitcoin {weekly} trade 5cons thinking it will close above 7300 by EoW. [Stocktwits Screenshot of trade](https://stocktwits.com/Avede/message/118569557)
1	1522777307	1	Can you explain the trade? What‚Äôs your break even price?
2	1522777465	1	The platform currently has a pricing issue showing like tens of thousands profit/loss right now, but it's really max loss 890 max profit 1934. My break even would be if Bitcoin lands near 7300. The setup is either I trade this into the end of week above 7300 btc or lose $70-890 if it closes under 7300. 
0	1522772071	1	So if my small business starts accepting btc, how do I facilitate the transfer? 
1	1522774232	1	I accept BTC on my Shopify via bitpay. Not the best, but it was surprisingly easy and I doubt many of my customer base will use BTC. 
2	1522777804	1	I sell crystal specimens, mostly in a music festival setting, but I also live near silicon valley, I think my customer base might have a decent percentage of crypto users, and my father is a hodler for a few years now, I'm a more recently onto the scene but am enthusiastic and really want to incorporate it into my business. What info do I need to have ready to offer crypto payments into my current account or do I need to have a shopify to do so?
0	1522776943	1	Waiting for the next signal...
0	1522778684	1	I am short at 7000. but I'm glad the price goes up ..... for the rest
0	1522778761	1	My analysis is showing an [up trend towards the moon](https://imgur.com/XR7o26T)I have been doing this for a good month now and you should trust me:* The red line predicts the direction of the blue line (price).* If red is above the blue, we are getting some air.
0	1522780281	1	Are we hungry for 7.5k?!I think we can reach it soon.
0	1522750482	0	Buy on dips, sell on peaks.  Don't be a sucker. Hold until 8000+
1	1522753742	2	RUBBISH!  I'm holding till 9K.
2	1522775508	1	I'm holding till end of year, give the coin a chance to run its progressions 
1	1522751714	0	I just saw a fast drop to $7280. Is this the day traders cashing out?
2	1522755770	2	Traders won't cash out. They'll trade all the way down or all the way up.  Traders gonna trade.
0	1522768632	1	[deleted]
1	1522768699	1	https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/16rCmCmbuWDhPjWTrpQGaU3EPdZF7MTdUkThat aint an Mt Gox address. It's Bittrex.Im curious though, whats your source on thinking it is?
2	1522769034	1	Sure he posted same earlier today and deleted it, as I was typing same response earlier today and post disappeared before I replied pointing out error or deliberate FUD attempt.
3	1522769145	1	[deleted]
4	1522769277	1	I am not lying as you typed exactly the same earlier today and I also added the same wallet address to my favourites that I copied from your deleted post. YOU ARE LYING and motive must be FUD.
4	1522769170	1	[deleted]
2	1522769515	1	So if it‚Äôs bittrex no reason to be concerned?
3	1522769857	1	Hard to say.It's almost certainly them moving coins from cold storage to the exchange hot wallet. So you could say its a good thing because it's a sign that a lot of people are buying.
4	1522770030	1	Hope so. Seems bullish 
1	1522768845	1	That is incorrect, and that is not a Gox wallet. Gox wallets still have same 162k BTC balance see https://www.cryptoground.com/mtgox-cold-wallet-monitor/
1	1522768944	1	695,863 BTC moved in the last 24 hours
2	1522769820	1	Goxers wouldn't have sold this low
1	1522768990	1	actual MtGox wallet (multiple addresses)  https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/wallet/MtGox-wallet
0	1522753186	1	any news??
1	1522753695	3	The best news so far - BTC survived the death crosshttps://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/940608/Bitcoin-price-news-BTC-vs-USD-why-is-bitcoin-rising-today-what-is-BTC-bitcoin-price
0	1522764698	1	**Come on Bulls, we want some good progress today!  Ideally above $7800**
1	1522764766	2	500$ per day wouldnt be healthy tbh 
2	1522765907	2	But 500 drop is fine? It went down faster than its going up
3	1522767430	1	The 500 drop wasn't good either. Any jump one way or another is bad. Slow and steady growth leads to less rubber banding. The 20k btc end of last year was waaaay too much waaaay too fast. Now we're are seeing the correction and leveling. Nothing has happened negatively for btc lately. The mass media attention we received and subsequent block size/fee fiasco kicked segwit and lightening in the ass finally and btc is healthier than ever from a tech stand point. The major negative we face now is getting the mass public to understand it won't take 60$ to transfer money anymore. 
4	1522767850	1	I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why they lost interest
2	1522765817	1	$500 every day would be unhealthy but today I think it would be a very good sign.
0	1522764533	-4	Trading volume is low, due to high resistance looks like bulls doesn't want to take risk, retailers start selling on top, doesn't look good option for bulls
1	1522765957	1	Volume is fine, stop being annoying. 
2	1522767387	1	Leave him alone. He's losing a lot of money right now. Poor guy.
1	1522767197	1	You are just the type of person the "ignore" button was made for.  Bye
1	1522771583	1	You must be shorting now. Haaaaaa?!
0	1522752010	-7	This shit was a bust. I'm waiting on it to go back to 8k so I can get out of this shit even.
1	1522755023	1	Sounds like you sold the bottom or you‚Äôd be happy to see some gains. If this breaks and holds 7.5k you‚Äôd be a fool to sell @ 8k. 
0	1522752946	-1	any news??
0	1522764579	-1	All these bears getting raped. Maybe we need a crisis hotline? Bears are people too right?
1	1522768948	1	I hate bears
2	1522769166	1	because we took your lunch money ü§ë
0	1522772854	1	Does anyone, even whales, know what's going on with the price last couple of months? 
1	1522773153	1	Yes, more people are selling than buying.
0	1522777324	1	Is there anything bitcoin news related that is causing the green spike?
1	1522777473	1	News have been pretty irrelevant for the price in the recent past.
2	1522777668	1	So basically typical bull market manipulation?
3	1522777731	1	It was a huge spike and just got on and haven't done any of my block chain news research so figured I would ask reddit. I mean that's a huge bump!
4	1522777897	1	Might have been a short squeeze. Many traders expected the price to fall lower, now they have to cut their losses.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze
5	1522777904	1	**Short squeeze**A short squeeze is a rapid increase in the price of a stock that occurs when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock.Short squeezes result when short sellers cover their positions on a stock, resulting in buying volume that drives the stock price up. This can occur if the price has risen to a point where short sellers must make margin calls, or more loosely if short sellers simply decide to cut their losses and get out. This may happen in an automated manner for example if the short sellers had previously placed stop-loss orders with their brokers to prepare for this possibility.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
5	1522778148	1	Selfishly I want it to stay low for a bit longer so I can invest big
5	1522779484	1	Might of been a handful of shorts covering, but it wasn't a short squeeze.  In this market a short squeeze would be more 9k to 11k in a day
0	1522773217	1	Its Bear Trap, pretending like bull trap, It will drop badly
1	1522777537	1	Sounds like someone made a bad trade. 
1	1522773392	1	Right on there ‚Äútop trader‚Äù bill. You clearly don‚Äôt understand either term
