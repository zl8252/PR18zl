0	1522852942	1	It’s really very funny to see folks moods change sooooo drastically over 500 swings.  Yesterday: this is awesome. I’m so happy I bought. Look at all this green. It’s going to the moon!Today: omg I’m going to kill my self. It’s dead. China to blame! Get out. Run for the hills. Lol. 
1	1522853357	1	Well people tend to panic when money is lost, it's sad. Making money is good . Losing it is bad. Did you expect different 
2	1522859811	1	This should not be unexpected when investing in something as volatile as bitcoin.  Have these people panicking never looked at a long term chart?  Bitcoin has had many large "crashes" in the past - and yet people are surprised by a 70% decline.  Very short sighted thinking. 
1	1522853794	1	this is man that look graph at minute....open eyes and tale a look at 1d or 1w....
2	1522854651	1	Thanks bro. Appreciate the advice. I’m not happy it’s dropping. It’s demoralizing... however, I also watched (without buying) it go from 1,000 to 20k and finally bought in at 8k. I’ve no doubt it will be above 8 k in 2018. But these dips can and will control your whole day if you allow it. No one has ever been buried with dollars or digital coins. Aaron Rodgers: RELAX
1	1522853422	1	Bro imagine some of us who are now down 12k since December. You wake up every day to see 500-1000 down, hoping for just 3 days of green back to back.Nope, wake up to a gigantic red middle finger.
0	1522851524	7	wow, down almost $200 during my shower lol
1	1522851860	11	Please never shower again
1	1522852995	1	lol, same.  Went into my shower at 7k came out like WTF?
0	1522837059	6	It seems bulls and bears have shaken hands and now everyone is confused. 
0	1522845342	7	Investing in bitcoin rn is like taking care of a sick child. You just wait until its done vomiting and having diarrhea then show it a little love without too high expectations. 
0	1522850666	7	And down to sub $7k we go :(
0	1522848746	4	Would you rather be a prisoner in jail for a year and come out being a billionaire for the rest of you life or only a millionaire? Honestly that guy is richer than Roger Ver now. At age 32, people die trying to become a billionaire at such a young age.
1	1522849198	3	Who?
2	1522849798	4	We'll never know... 
2	1522850885	3	Mark Karpelès
0	1522849292	5	Hoping we can rally after that China tariff news.
1	1522850078	2	I was just wondering about the same thing, and not just the tariff but on Mar 26 China started trading oil for gold back Chinese Yuan (futures contracts) that was in the the works by China for over 20 years and kept getting delayed and now it’s happening, this is big news.I want bitcoin to rise but not at the expense of the North American economy....Hope everyone can win, said the eternal optimist
0	1522850669	5	RIP 7k
0	1522850828	4	Any news on why sudden drop?
1	1522850928	2	did you read the Mark Karpelès AMA?
2	1522851211	3	I thought that was good news?
3	1522851359	2	it's not. Imo it adds even more FUD after reading all his posts.
2	1522851105	2	Not yet I will now though.
1	1522853089	1	DOW Jones down 500 points, and yes bitcoin is tied to market health whether people like it or not.
1	1522852533	1	Moving averages game
0	1522858494	1	Meh. Lambos are overrated anyway.
0	1522843720	12	I think general trend looks positive - strong support at 7k.  I wouldn't be surprised to see 8k within 48 hrs.
1	1522851341	3	Feels a bit tense in here...no, lol.I’m a long term holder too so I don’t really care the next 48hrs.But I am watching to see if we stay above that Feb 6th low....why would a long term holder care, because even if those of us who bought over a year are still way up I absolutely do want to see that Feb 6th support level hold, and as we all know, it’s likely that “if” we break below our Feb 6th low, the odds are it will be within the next few weeks. Every week we stay above that support level the law of permanence creeps into investors minds.For many of us, we still have a hard time buying because we remember buying at cheaper prices. Every week this price becomes more part of what is consider the normal price and the memory of buying $2000 Bitcoin becomes  farther and farther into our memories and replaced with the new norm.Respecting the support level of Feb 6th is a pretty big deal for me. Because if it doesn’t hold then we need to rebuild the permanence of value at the new price.Gratitude for the people who haven’t sold. It’s a sign of solidarity that I admire.
2	1522862314	1	Although I've held for a long time, I'm still very interested in the day to day prices.  I'm absolutely confident that people who bought at a relatively high price will get their returns - and that the major coin will be BTC.The big question of course is how long this will take.
3	1522863742	1	Agreed. I’m able to be patient 
1	1522845059	2	trend looks positive ?open graph 1days and repeat this...
2	1522847068	0	I assume you are still watching the chart - genius.
3	1522849667	3	lol
1	1522845206	7	Redditor for 2 weeks
2	1522847010	6	And so what?  BTC owner for 5 years - arrogant dolt.
2	1522847616	2	Such a stupid comment
1	1522843854	-2	General trend isn't positive, it was negative, the rally to 7500 was brief and the hour candle looks like it's reversing back down.
2	1522844247	4	OK, but I disagree.
3	1522847714	2	He's a known troll
4	1522850032	3	If it's known, why did you have to say it? Obviously you're a troll projecting your own self. Based on your comment history, it's obvious.
5	1522853564	1	Lol
0	1522858416	1	How to become a millionaire with bitcoin - start with 2 million. 
1	1522861275	1	Thanks for the chuckle 
0	1522836106	13	What is the difference between a hodler and a pigeon? A pigeon can still make a deposit on a Lambo... :D
1	1522836321	1	Been on this rollercoaster since 2011. I could easily make a Lambo deposit if I wanted one... Try harder, son. 
2	1522836349	4	Learn to laugh
2	1522837604	1	Being a long term roller-coaster rider. What you view on recovery for rest of 2018? 
3	1522838312	4	> What you view on recovery for rest of 2018?It'll go up or down or sideways. Noone knows.However... Wider bitcoin adoption (either as means of exchange or store of value) should push the price up.
4	1522842115	-1	Very useful insight, smh
5	1522842776	2	What's the last useful insight on bitcoin that you've seen?
6	1522843248	1	The one from kodaplays. 
0	1522863793	1	Quilt sales are decreasing due to anticipated hot weather in coming weeks. That could explain this big drop in price. 
1	1522864731	1	Thanks for making me piss myself.  Now I need a quilt incontinence pad (QIP for short).
0	1522837392	3	My 12 year old son could make a deposit on a Lambo. 
0	1522845750	3	I have found an old 12 word seed in some files i thought i lost. I cannot get the seed to work anywhere except in electrum, and in electrum its an empty wallet with no tx history. This doesnt make sense as i have tx written on my same paper that should be from this seed. Ive tried a multitude of things and searched online. There was a discussion about a guy finding a 2013 seed and there was a list of words that not all his words were on, but another list that they were, but after he says that the conversation ended there. Nothing about how to gain access to it
1	1522855637	1	did you search the tx transaction.
0	1522847595	3	Got a feeling we are gonna see a juicy rallye now
0	1522850925	3	Large red dongs
1	1522851049	2	new pornhub category in 3..2..
0	1522851803	3	FUCK ME - I've just learnt a lesson! I had a limit buy set up which I had forgotten about. It ended up buying a little bit of Bitcoin as it was coming down. What a waste of a few hundred dollars!  Learn from my folly! 
1	1522853930	1	That sucks, but unless you think the end is nigh, hold onto it for a day or so and you'll have made a couple of dollars.
0	1522851923	3	Personally I now think do not buy as the drop has surely not finished yet. Sunday was $6400 and Friday was $6600 still opportunity to buy cheaper later today or tomorrow.
0	1522840012	3	Silly Bitcoin doin that down thing again. Other way now thanks. 
0	1522846167	5	**Lets go Bitcoin!**
0	1522851835	5	last chance to buy under 7k boys!!! Lmao
1	1522852045	1	sub 4k very likely....
2	1522863204	1	Nah, it will be hard to even reach 5.8k
0	1522854241	1	Rise you magnificent bastard. 
1	1522857246	1	That is what I say before I am about to have sex with the wife.

1	1522846918	3	did it died again?
2	1522847694	3	More like marriage 
2	1522848424	2	It was waving at $7k.

1	1522849397	1	*PERSPECTIVE*
0	1522855544	1	The the moon with lambos, we are above 6900 USD
0	1522855958	1	Seems like there is nearly zero correlation between traditional stocks and Bitcoin. A year ago I thought that if the stock market experienced a correction, Bitcoin would do well. That hasn't been the case though.
1	1522856093	1	Bitcoin went crazy due to shitcoins getting insane returns, now that the pyramid was completed Bitcoin price will return to its still fast but not insane climb to the moon.
2	1522857888	1	On point.
1	1522856145	1	A lot of people say that Bitcoin follows the stock market closely.  When stocks are doing well so does Bitcoin.
1	1522863041	1	Totally incorrect. If I have 10k to spend, I want it to make money. When things are going up, that's where my 10k is going. If things go bad, sell sell sell. Now, if you are a small time guy like me, and you have bills, seeing you lose your 10k when you have bills suddenly becomes a big deal. If you got 5k in the market, and 5k in bitcoin, loss is loss and you panic and pull your investments out because it's sinking, regardless of the status of bitcoin.You are making the assumption that people are buying for HODL and really they are buying to make money today, because bills are due today. Does that make any sense? My point is TLDR that investors are investors, and it doesn't matter what the stock or currency is. They invest to make money, and if the market bears, so does the currency. The whole concept of 'if the markets tank currency will not' is complete fallacy. The first thing someone does when they need money is sell crypto to pay rent. If the market crashes, crypto will head right there with it.
0	1522857628	1	don’t worry guys, you can still get your lambos. You’ll just need about 59BTC is all 
0	1522859847	1	Is McAfee still considered a crypto believer if he’s getting paid $100,000+ for each tweet about crypto? https://mcafeecryptoteam.com/effect.html
1	1522859958	1	McAfee is considered a dick eater.
2	1522860240	1	unless that bet was bullshit and he’s already been paid lol
3	1522860331	1	Whatever it was, that tweet didnt do anything good for the bitcoin. Everyone knew it was BS.
4	1522860918	1	Think of this what you want, but I like to use this as an indicator of how well the Bitcoin price is doing. Not so well, lately.https://fnordprefekt.de/
0	1522860143	1	My tax return came back but my wallet didn't come in yet. I've only ever made small a couple small purchases on coinbase but I'm looking forward to using an actual wallet with a decent chunk of cash
1	1522861947	1	Do you have any recommendations? I'm going to research on my own and I'd like to have my own wallet but I'm not really sure where to start. 
0	1522865819	1	🎤🎵When you walk through the storm, hold your head up high.... 
0	1522851904	4	Dropped straight into the golden pocket and rebounded out.  Should go up from here, wave 2 here we come to around 7900 with a 1:1 extension
1	1522852073	1	Ok so what's a "golden pocket"?
2	1522852182	1	Between 0.618 and 0.65 retracement.  This is where you should be buying on the dip and hence the name, the Gold Pocket.
3	1522852626	1	Thanks
1	1522853317	1	That is what I was learning about today. Saw opportunity and shorted till fib retracement. Hopefully well go up now. If yes that would be a nice lesson for me 😄😅
0	1522863457	1	Hold on to your hat boys...100k imminent.
1	1522864846	1	I am totally ready to buy 1 BTC for 100,000 Pennies.
0	1522855765	1	That was a prime example of a bull trap.
1	1522856330	1	That implies that there's about one entity pushing the price up or down, and that they're the bulk of the movement meanwhile the mass (and probably not so massive) of individual investors/traders are like guppies with their 0.005 contributions to price fluctuations.
2	1522857074	1	No, it doesn't.
3	1522857401	1	I just can't see a trap being set up by thousands of people at one time. Then it would just be a "natural" movement of the market.
4	1522858170	1	No one sets up traps. Are you positive you understand what bear and bull traps are? 
4	1522859158	1	A bull trap can be a collective effort of false expectations.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bulltrap.asp
1	1522857861	1	If that was a bull trap then it was quite elaborate.  That did not look like a typical pump and dump at all.  
2	1522859489	1	Pump and dump is something different than a "bull trap".
0	1522846916	2	lol bitcoin dropped because Mt Gox CEO did an AMA on reddit, would you look at that rofl
1	1522847556	3	Yeah that must be it
1	1522847607	4	It dropped because the moving averages crossed.  Its about to begin the next bull wave.
2	1522848353	-1	nah, look at the timing of the crash and the reddit post
3	1522848556	3	No, it crashed because the moving averages crossed on the 15m and 1h charts.  Look at the charts.
0	1522853711	1	It’s been a rough couple of months but I have a feeling things are going to turn around for bitcoin soon.  Last few days of bullish activity was a good sign.  This sudden drop back to 6k range won’t last long. 
1	1522853933	1	hashtag denialstage
2	1522855737	1	Nope. I was watching the uptrend over the last few days very closely.  There is significant organic buying interest again I think because some people were expecting freefall below 5k. Didn’t happen.   Bottom is somewhere in the 6k range.   The reason we are lower today is due to the irrational reaction to sudden FUD of the Chinese tariffs and stock market volatility. This is temporary and really has nothing to do with bitcoin.   I think once this passes bitcoin will continue its steady upward rise until 8k. Then it will accelerate.  I’m hoping for a slow steady rise after that but could start spiking as fomo kicks in.  
3	1522856129	1	I don't think Chinese tariffs and trade wars have anything to do with bitcoin, that's only with stocks. 
3	1522856335	1	Your "thinking" and "hoping" are nothing but pure speculation. And you are basing your confidence that the price will go up on the hope that it will since you want to see bigger returns for yourself.I'm not sure that's useful for anyone.
4	1522856487	1	That’s my gut feeling due to my observations. Take it or leave it.  I don’t really care.  
4	1522859585	1	I would rather buy “hope” in this market. Charts and all shit TAs have proven wrong time and again. Everyone is sending random TAs in every direction and changing opinions literally as bitcoin moves from red to green and vice versa. 
1	1522853962	1	Not to be a party pooper, but whatever momentum bitcoin had the last few days is gone. 
2	1522855034	1	“Not to be a party pooper...” -> poops all over party
2	1522854586	1	I don’t believe that for a second 
1	1522853885	1	source?
2	1522854402	1	Future (rich) me.  😛
3	1522854938	1	gl
1	1522856407	1	I feel that right now is very important moment, if this goes back to 7k, many ppl may believe it's recovering and invest more. If it falls farther, everyone may start selling.
1	1522857464	1	No offence, but you are so deludedly bullish, and have been for a while. Just yesterday you were posting that we definitely wouldn't hit $7k again (it looks as though you've deleted the post/s). Wise up, man. 
2	1522857621	1	Untrue. Have never made nor deleted any such post.  You must have me confused with someone else.    And time will tell how deluded I am with my bullish attitude. 
3	1522857703	1	If that is true then I apologise - and I hope you're right, I just doubt that you are. 
4	1522858456	1	Not a problem. Apology accepted.  
0	1522851506	3	Fuck bitcoin. This is so laughable it's pathetic.
0	1522841068	2	what is the news for today?
1	1522842163	3	price went up $500.- in the last 4 days! 
2	1522842631	9	price went down $400.- in the last 1 hour! :D
3	1522846563	3	...which doesn't make my first statement wrong. 
4	1522851932	3	 just outdated 
3	1522851633	1	lol :D
0	1522851274	2	Look 👀 at me closely. eye to eye. FUCK MT GOX. now lets move forward.
1	1522860391	1	They pumped that btc with empty tether very nicely - now they have slowly deflate this bubble in order not to get busted....I cant wait bitconnect scenario with tether :) shit will be juicy
1	1522851515	1	Once simply does not move on from MT GOX. We will all keep getting fucked, over, and over, and over again. Or grandchildren will know the plague on humanity that is MT GOX, and their grandchildren, and their grandchildren and so on and so forth. Now and until the end of time.
2	1522851674	3	I am starting to believe that. I reinvested at 6.5k and I had a feeling that these cocksuckers would come crawling out of their hole to fuck us all over again but didn’t anticipate so god damn soon.
3	1522852809	1	We are currently above 6.8k so there is nothing stopping you from taking profit and buying in again at a lower price if you believe MT GOX will have any effect on the price
4	1522856057	1	No.
0	1522853343	1	Oh dear!
0	1522858368	1	what a great $50 run. TO DA MOON 
0	1522863302	1	Here's some good news: BCash 8th by trading volume today.  That is terrible.When Bcash finally dies, the cryptomarket will take off again.  I'm convinced of it.
1	1522863843	1	I hate Bcash just as much as the next guy, but I don't see how its demise will spur on the market.
1	1522863666	1	Why? That is completely illogical
2	1522863766	1	Just let him have this...
0	1522836287	3	So it was “mooning” at 7400. What do you say now?
1	1522836883	6	Ya'll get so caught up in the ups and downs. It goes up a bit and everyone thinks it has to keep going up. Goes down a bit everyone comes on here like it's the end of the world. In the words of a great Australian hero, just fkn relax aye 
2	1522841499	2	Wasn’t that Ali G of the Staines massiff?
3	1522842461	2	Could well be. I was thinking of Trent from the Punchy massif
1	1522839515	3	I just banked on the dip. Thanks I guess.
0	1522844306	1	[removed]
1	1522844321	1	This article is a special kind of stupid
0	1522848690	1	So who is it now?..Don the Con?..China?...Cartel?
0	1522856789	1	I'm so bored with bitcoin lately
0	1522857830	1	Bitcoin: 39. My portfolio: 0.
1	1522858457	1	Maybe I am thick, but what does that mean? You have 39 bitcoin and no cash?
2	1522858755	1	Means bitcoin fucked me over 39 times with it's nice dipppppssssss
3	1522859610	1	39 times must be understating it, surely? Yes, hurting me too, I am down about 8% - but is only on around 10% of my investments.
0	1522858033	1	Are we going lower than 1 April dip?
1	1522858258	1	No one knows. There's a strong case for under $6k levels. 
0	1522859652	1	Testing the 2017 pre-euphoria uptrend again. Will it hold? I hope so, but I'm uncertain...https://imgur.com/a/IEUEvEdit: This is where my trendlines are coming from...https://imgur.com/a/KJ0ymEdit: Price is getting squeezed now between moving averages and the trendline.

1	1522859816	1	This chart looks like a blond with open arms and legs. Seriously, have a closer look, or I am way too horny. 
2	1522860594	1	I really don't see what you are seeing. But maybe that's why I would be a bad trader.
3	1522860810	1	This chart looks like its inviting me to invest. 
4	1522860973	1	I want your drugs.
5	1522861231	1	Just some Chivas 
0	1522861812	1	I heard a cryptocurrency ad on the radio this morning in Quebec from financial advisors who say it is risky and to do research before investing as you risk losing it all. Was fun to see how it is slowly reaching out to the world. 
1	1522862033	1	You mean how this message is reaching out to the world ?
2	1522863196	1	Haha, no not this particular message, I suppose else where in the world on a remote radio sation someone is also advertising about Cryptocurrency.
3	1522863388	1	At first I thought the message about risky investment was reaching out to the world. 
1	1522862037	1	So did I listened to these so called financial advisors 3 years ago and missed the opportunity to be a millionaire. lol 
2	1522863244	1	These messages were mostly warnings on how to be careful about your investment. But its the first time i hear them mention cryptocurrency in their ad.
3	1522864220	1	I heard some similar ads few years ago and accepted their "too Risky" idea. And should have known that more risk means more profits back then...

1	1522863501	1	Wait till you graduate to trading in the nude!
0	1522865750	1	Can we get it over with, please?I'm not selling, but I also can't buy anymore. So this price level holds no interest for me...
0	1522865760	1	Inevitable decline as expected to $6400
1	1522865936	1	Then back to $7200-$7500 rinse repeat, perhaps or down lower this time.
0	1522866027	1	The people will still believe in bank system until their money is not available anymore 😂😂. Then its the time for us. 
0	1522866129	1	I have a buy order ready at 5940. I have no idea why, I just do.
0	1522851629	1	As expected, the China tarriffs will make it go down, especially since it's on a downtrend now that it couldn't hold 7000. Just look at the 1 hour candle on gdax, there couldn't be a more obvious down trend signal, at least short-term.
1	1522853547	1	But,but,but,but,but. “Bitcoin is free from governments”
1	1522851820	-1	Probably heading towards $3-4k now based on the trend
0	1522853315	1	Let the downfall begin boys. 
0	1522850967	1	Thanks bitcoin for ruining beach 2018, I will be fat from eating all slaughtered bull meat :S
0	1522856483	1	failing to break 7k about ten times. pathetic.
1	1522862837	1	If you purchased at $6500 6 months ago, you would have exactly $6500. Breaking even is a win at the casino. 
0	1522857074	1	Would be nice if today was all just one big bear trap.  
1	1522857717	1	A bear trap on a long decline is very unlikely, sadly.
0	1522857493	1	WE ARE SINKING!
1	1522858475	1	WHAT ARE YOU SINKING ABOUT
2	1522863125	1	He appears to be on a boat and in distress
0	1522861344	1	everybody please dump there shit and drop to 1k.... sick of this shit
0	1522863722	1	I would like to sink this ship lower honestly, then start the water pumps.
1	1522865622	1	I think there’s a lot of money on the sidelines thinking the same thing. 
0	1522841953	1	ridiculous 
0	1522842378	1	Anyone think we will see a big green candle in the next couple of hours? 
1	1522843291	2	I think it’s more likely we’ll see the $6-7k region before that happens.
2	1522843957	3	I think we'll see 7.2 - 7.3 in the next few hours. Then down.
0	1522843714	1	Uhhh... So a huge Russian celebrity (Olga Buzova)  just announced her own cryptocurrency (BuzCoin) and I am scared it's going to take people away from BuzzCoin :(. https://youtu.be/jqFg5JGHIjg
1	1522846514	2	That bitch) 
0	1522850466	1	Question, is this true? Or even partly true?Wallets like exodus and Mycelium are all running “on top” the Bitcoin Core wallet. Does that question make sense? I’m considering making a tutorial on the core wallet and a teacher of mine said this, but I’m not certain. (Maybe the tutorial will stay really simple)Are all the Light wallets running bitcoin core wallets behind the scenes, with the core wallet doing the work and exodus just being a nice user interface on top of it?Thanks
0	1522862507	1	Was Binance hacked?https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/binance-users-cant-log-speculation-abounds/
1	1522863365	1	March = Yes (API), April = No
0	1522862847	1	Ok, this got to be the last dip before the pump. Or this is truly being suppressed by the so called “Cartel”. Makes no sense. 
1	1522863344	1	It's the Stock market, People are taking profits from crypto to cover losses simialer to what happens to when altcoins go down following Bitcoin. I think the Cartel is reavaluating their next move since they were recently caught by a very brave exchange who stood up to them.
2	1522863873	1	Just checked the Stock market, Looks like it will not end the day that bad so this shouldn't be affecting Bitcoin
2	1522864604	1	Really? Source? Sounds like awesome news
1	1522863049	1	is it really easier for you to believe a conspiracy theory than believing there’s just not enough interest in BTC right now? 
2	1522863249	1	The question is what made people give up bitcoin ? 
3	1522863719	1	The value dropping 70% in a couple months
4	1522864578	1	Yep, with plenty of opportunities (and signs) to get out.
1	1522863170	1	if whales and the cartel are suppressing BTC a lot of people will never see gains and have to file a loss on tax return and forget a new ATH.
0	1522864193	1	What are your thoughts on where Bitcoin will be price wise and apoption wise in 5 years time? 
1	1522864319	1	5 years is too far. I cant even think where it will be after 5 mins. 
2	1522865264	1	exactly every single drop concern me lot now onward.... price drop significantly and still going down that really bother me a lot 
1	1522866050	1	175k per coin in 5 years.   Adoption wise you will start to see it accepted by major online retailers like amazon. Probably see it being accepted at Whole Foods and target and Walmart type retailers as well.  People will just pay using the bitcoin wallet bar code on their smart phone.    The prices will still be in local currency (e.g usd) but you can pay the total bill in bitcoin.  Similar to Apple Pay.       Bonus: in 10 years bitcoin will be 300k+
2	1522866332	1	I hope you are right, I would be very happy with $25k per Bitcoin.
1	1522865014	1	Bitcoin may no longer exist in 5 years. There could be a massive war in 5 years.You could use basic inflation theory though.
0	1522852140	1	Under $5000 in 2 months.
0	1522842974	-2	Bitcoin down this morning due to China announcing new tariffs on the US in retaliation. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/04/china-new-us-tariffs-including-soy-cars-and-chemicals.html
1	1522843383	7	I rather not associate bitcoin with political news anymore.  Ive realized btcs ups and downs have nothing to do with holidays, news, politics, stock market, etc..Bitcoin is its own roller coaster ride non associating with others, therefore NOT PREDICTABLE.
2	1522844294	1	Bitcoin is corelated with fiat apocalypse. Every abd news, market colapse... bitcoin rises
3	1522845453	3	If that were the case, btc is just acting like precious metals. The value doesn't inherently change, it just adjusts for a drop in the purchasing power of your currency. Also, calling a potential tradewar market collapse is getting ahead of ourselves. 
4	1522845873	3	Look at every big corp - 1 bad news = -9% of share price. Look facebook, tesla, uber...
5	1522846201	2	You're naming the 3 tech companies who had massive problems in the past two weeks. Using them as the focal point for the market as a whole instead of seeing they are the exception is your call, but I wouldn't recommend it.
5	1522851276	2	Look at dow jones, nasdaq, whatever and unzoom to 5 years or to max. It looks like bitcoin at 30. Dec. 2017. Everything is going downward. https://www.google.cz/search?q=dow+jones&gws_rd=cr,ssl&dcr=0&ei=193EWoX0LKvU6ASa9amgDA
1	1522845274	3	But when you read the actual news on here it says that’s NOT the reason. Hmmm 
1	1522843302	1	3....2.....1 and bammmm, deleted. 
0	1522840334	0	I am a HODLer and optimistic on long term but let's face it, the bear trend continues. No need to fool ourselves around with small ups and downs.https://ibb.co/gK15uxI keep my stance that we need more lava building, more adoption, more development, more pressure from people and more people waiting on sidelines to enter.....So far that pressure is not big enough to break through.But the question is that will that pressure be big enough to be sustained and take us to all-time-highs again in 2018?
1	1522841118	3	I wouldn't bet on it
2	1522841403	4	I wouldn't bet on anything right now.
3	1522855493	1	I'd bet that it's a bad time to bet on anything right now. 
0	1522858696	1	$6500, here we come. Just like 3 days ago.
1	1522859490	1	Just like 6 months ago. Your money has been effectively wasted if you HODL for 6 months.
2	1522860082	1	He never invested any money. He is a paid troll.
3	1522860572	1	How would anyone here know how much some random person on the internet invested or not? This very statement speaks volumes about who the 'troll' really is. Besides on what planet would someone get paid for trolling?
4	1522860720	1	Personally, I believe you're a volunteer troll.
5	1522862615	1	If you are talking about me, I am not a troll. I am actually someone who invested, but to be quite honest, none of the stuff people say here, makes any sense to me. It's all hypothetical and not real. When people say that it's going to be 100k in 6 months, I am like, it was 6k for the last 6 months, so what is different? That more banks in China said so? I agree that the technology is amazing. But you are asking people to give up two things: CASH which they will never do, and PAY EXTRA to convert their paychecks into Bitcoin which it MORE difficult to buy things with. There is zero added bonus, and well, people are lazy. Just as Apple Pay failed to gain enough marketshare, but was a great idea, so too will be bitcoin. Everytime I watch the videos with people talking about global currency, one thing strikes me as odd. They keep talking as if the United States and global economies are going to suddenly collapse, and go to war, and dollars will be worthless. Here is the thing. If I am in America, and the thing collapses, Dollars will be very valuable in America because nobody will have any. We will all be on bread lines and looking for spare change. Electronic currency will be of little to no value because the first thing people do when there is a problem is allow "ONLY CASH". Not Credit, Bitcoin, or any other currency. I think the same fo the Euro or Brit Pound. If you are living in those countries and things go bad, having Pounds on hand is where the wealth is, not electronic currencies. So while I don't disagree with the premise of Bitcoin, I think it will take a revolution to get it to where it makes millionaires out of the guy who bought $1k worth. By that time, Governments will either outlaw it, or find some way to tax it because the Banks control everyone.
6	1522863261	1	No, I was answering to and talking about goldbergger. But maybe this is your other account?
7	1522863601	1	no. I am not jewish. I thought you were talking to me.
4	1522862780	1	.75 an hour in Indonesia
4	1522860739	1	Who makes two vastly different statements over a period of 5 mins and then deletes them ? 
3	1522862163	1	uh, I just lost $300 thanks. I lost it because I was listening to all the nonsense about how great it's going to be. IN order for it to be great, it really is one step short of a banking revolution, and it's highly unlikely that banks will allow it.
4	1522863039	1	I agree. Dont listen to any expert in here. Just do what your own research tells u to do. Many people are here just to create FUD or FOMO or they have this hobby of making bold statements.
0	1522852004	1	BTC is dead. Its time to move on.
1	1522852252	1	is dead for you...many people are in earning mode
2	1522852378	1	It's just a pump and dump playground now. That's all it's good for.
1	1522852151	1	Bye. 
2	1522852455	1	Prepare to see bitcoin drop even further and never recover. Be smart think about your mental and financial well being.
3	1522853123	1	Thanks so much for your concern :)
3	1522853212	1	Lol.
0	1522857589	1	At least for the time being, Bitcoin seems to be little more than a plaything of daytraders who are trying to set traps for each other. Unless some *fundamental* of Bitcoin changes drastically one way or the other, it looks like the price is going to continue to meander sideways for a while. Food for thought at https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/regulation-and-apathy-hit-bitcoin-market/articleshow/63546481.cms
1	1522862804	1	So , you are saying it won't go up drastically because there is little use right now for it, and that people are both slow and lazy to accept bitcoin at small businesses across the country?
2	1522863872	1	Yeah, exactly. 
0	1522862181	1	Where are all the “mooners” now?
1	1522863491	1	don't worry we are still going to the moon. Just small delay in launch. Happens all the time. 
1	1522862622	1	Their rocket crash landed. Just after taking off. 
1	1522863065	1	Those of us that bought several years ago have seen multiple moons already. At this point it's house money to play with. 
1	1522862958	1	They forgot their space suits before taking off
1	1522863688	1	Oh, we're mooning. Just have to pass through this here door. A moon door if you will. ^^^Mooooo^^ooooOOOO^^OOONNN ...splat
1	1522864810	1	Yep, just a bunch of FUDers like yourself!
1	1522865436	1	The term moon recently switched from an astronomical body to getting caught with your pants down.
0	1522863482	1	The big drop will have caused doubt in the market. Tonight I think Bitcoin’s value is more likely to go down. 
0	1522851747	0	red dildos!!kkk
1	1522851790	0	Racist red dildos?
2	1522852966	1	Or Brazilian ;]
0	1522855075	1	How low?
0	1522855599	1	A scammer could get over 2k likes, why can't bitcoin go under 6k? Only the good deed suffers.
0	1522866033	1	This is not feeling good.  perhaps capitulation in a scary way will come.  Confidence could get destroyed.  It certainly is getting close for me.
1	1522866129	1	>Confidence could get destroyed.This is what we might actually need. Another panic sell-off, so we can restart the market cycle for good.But I'd like it to be over already. It's no fun.

3	1522848271	1	Are the coffee shops everything they're hyped up to be? Would love to someday buy a joint there with BTC 
4	1522848543	2	Oh god yes its the best Weed I ever had, and You can buy super strong edibles too. Didnt See one that accepted BTC tho

0	1522850922	-4	6.5k has not been able to attract new investors.... nobody wants to buy now, only wales pump and daily trading action....I love the btc and for a healthy and lasting climb I want sub 4k price
1	1522851045	3	you said this already
0	1522852264	1	What is your low prediction before we return to ATH?
1	1522853525	1	This same question was asked 3 months ago and people were saying 9 or 10k - look what happened.
1	1522853082	1	I feel that we need to test the early February lows before the market will be happy to go higher. So around 6k then bounce upwards. However, if we stay around 6k for a few days, we could go lower to 4.5-5k
2	1522853119	1	6k meme is getting boring.
3	1522853518	1	It might be boring, but it's the level I want before I'd be willing to buy a few more bitcoins
4	1522853576	1	So your prediction has just been pulled out your arse? 
5	1522853683	1	Aren't all predictions?
6	1522853869	1	Not really, a prediction is based on some sort of data/theory that backs it up. Not saying your wrong, and my predictions are right. But In your case I might as well just close my eyes and put my finger to the screen.
2	1522853704	1	at recent 6.4k 1apr no one is happy ....i think 4k or sub4k is where people is happy to buy
1	1522854665	1	My low prediction is July (or as late as July, maybe some earlier).  Not sure what the price will be, but I think it will be another 3 months before we really start recovery.
1	1522860205	1	ATH... Roflmao
0	1522863864	1	Hope the value gets more down.
