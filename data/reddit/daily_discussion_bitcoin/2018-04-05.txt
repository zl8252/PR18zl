0	1522925084	10	Hm.Sorry to let you holders but i'll sell and jump in later, tired of this and i consider it will drop further.Good luck.;(
1	1522926417	2	I'd wait till we test 6k again. Maybe it won't go further than that and you'd have sold near the bottom.
1	1522925682	2	Be patient! , unless you bought ATH or above 15K levelIn next two month BTC would be upto 13K level at least
2	1522926448	6	Based on what?
3	1522926984	9	On his dreams. There are the same chances that it could be at 3k
4	1522930394	4	I think 3k is more likely actually. 
3	1522926982	5	Magic. Bitcoin Wizard would be making an appearance soon again. It's known as magic internet money for a reason all these years
2	1522933070	3	I love coming into this sub once a week and reading all the comments like this. 
2	1522944611	1	Ok lets wait and seetime would tell
1	1522926362	1	See you later, buying back in at 10k.
2	1522926709	2	Ooohhh! Got em'!
0	1522937925	8	Just exited from all crypto.. 😣 from India
1	1522938150	3	Please see this thread, you can still use Bitcoin....https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89ysac/india_bans_buyingselling_of_cryptocurrencies_with/
1	1522938803	3	Bro, you can't give up. Gotta fight it, go around it.We need you and we're all rooting for you.
1	1522939023	3	That sucks, dude. Surely there has to be a away. Binance account some foreign bank that will let you create an account. Then you can cash out to the foreign bank and then wire the money to your bank in India. They will never know.
1	1522940049	1	IMO its a bad idea to sell everything.  The value of 1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin to anybody in the world regardless of anybody's government.  Lets' say you hold on for 4 years and Bitcoin becomes worth 100k.  Perhaps by then the Indian Government will change its stance, or worst case you could go on an awesome vacation to Crypto friendly countries.  They can't stop you from going to another country and spending your Bitcoin
2	1522941179	1	So 1 BTC is 1 BTC but also 100k?
3	1522943689	1	what i mean is it has the same value globally whereas 1 dollar does not equal 1 rupee and there is no exchange of different types of Fiat
2	1522946914	1	The value of 1 bitcoin is not one bloody bitcoin. Its what you can buy for it in real world terms that's the value. I'm tired of hearing this dumb mantra over and over.Such a retarded point of view and only recited over and over to get other people who are losing real world value hand over fist to hold onto theirs. When it hits zero don't worry fella, because your 1 bitcoin will still be worth 1 bitcoin.Pffff. 
3	1522947558	1	The Mantra means that 1 Bitcoin equals 1 Bitcoin whether you are in USA or Japan or Australia or wherever.  Whereas 1 Dollar does not equal 1 Yen or 1 Rupee etc.  
3	1522947462	1	If you think Bitcoin is worth 0 then why are you here?  Just to make fun of everybody?  You should do something more worthwhile with your time
2	1522942362	1	Or he holds for four years, and what was worth 10k, is now worth 0.
3	1522943597	1	haha i guess I'm not one of the ppl who think Bitcoin will go to 0
4	1522944307	1	Keep the faith.
3	1522946982	1	Exactly. 
1	1522938157	1	Have India stopped regulating Gold yet?  - they always seem to be regulating something.  Didn't they also pull all fiat notes over a certain value from circulation?Indian finance is frankly chaotic - everybody knows that, so I don't think it matters that much.
1	1522940311	1	Big mistake!
0	1522930942	7	Friends I am sorry to being out the news --India's Central Bank today barred any banks or financial institutes to offer financial services to crypto exchanges !! How to go about it ? I am firm believer of blockchain tech and financial freedom but when there won't be any btc to fiat conversion then the prospects will diminish in short run.What do you suggest , how to go about it?
1	1522931328	3	See this thread.....https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89ysac/india_bans_buyingselling_of_cryptocurrencies_with/
2	1522931505	1	Thank you !
1	1522948195	1	This is good for Bitcoin!!!
1	1522931156	1	Indian people should then swear off fiat and do business with BTC wherever possible. Cut the banks out of the loop. I know it's easier said than done, but let them slit their own throat. They made the choice.
2	1522932925	4	That's what we all should do. I'm tired of this corrupt asinine system.
0	1522925062	5	So... buying the dip? Again? Getting broke..  
1	1522925732	1	Why need to buy more?You should have BTC already! be patient till BTC reach 13K level again!
0	1522923168	3	Do you guys think the mods on this sub are all millionaires from Bitcoin?
1	1522923264	8	every single one of 'em.They wipe their bottoms with $100 notes.
2	1522923643	3	I knew it, those crafty bastards.
2	1522931377	1	I doubt it, I heard mods don't have any fiat money at all
1	1522923786	4	millionaires ,dont have damn time , you know!
1	1522929545	1	Wonder how ppl get to become a mod in the first place
0	1522923799	4	Who's buying in at $6k? 
1	1522924835	1	Mostly institution, you won't find the average peeps buying when it's low
2	1522926233	2	Except for myself.
3	1522926781	2	Didn't you buy in at 6.8k?
4	1522927036	-1	Yes. Every dip. Since ATH. Slowly reducing my average cost.If it goes down to 6k, I'll buy a little more.
1	1522925575	1	March month passed, its end of the 1st week in AprilSo I dont think , BTC would ever come to below 6K level!6.5K? might be :|
0	1522924013	4	How low will it go? We don't know! Especially John Snow. 
1	1522925792	1	Would not break 6K USD level at least!
0	1522941766	1	How many times do we have to pump and dump up and down $200
1	1522942595	1	Don't know man but am getting sick of these shorting fuckers
1	1522943965	1	Until every weak hand has sold their bags.
2	1522945245	1	Until all the new people ( aka weak hands) no longer want anything to do with the crypto market and never want to own them.
3	1522945426	1	Oh, *they will*. Just wait for the next bull run.
0	1522948589	1	Indian residents can no longer purchase cryptocurrency through their bank accounts, according to new measures adopted by the country’s central bank.https://www.ccn.com/india-bans-banks-from-processing-cryptocurrency-purchases/
1	1522948723	1	That eliminates 17% of the world from buying cryptocurrency  through their institutions.  I am sure more will follow.
2	1522949107	1	People are comparing cryptocurrency with shares of AT& T in 1920,shares of Apple in the first year of its launching etc, however they flourished in an optimal environment with advancing technologies as well as legal support from governments. With countries banning crypto currency one after another like China, India, korea I wonder if we are turning our White money into Black money by investing it in crypto??I am not talking abt the Blockchain technology, its there and it will develop but the Bitcoin thingy is all I am getting worried about day by dayAnd yeah I am a redditer for two weeks. 
1	1522949319	1	They may have to buy usd or other internarional currency and through international services (if any) buy crypto. If the tech evolution is real, nothing can suppress it
0	1522939324	1	Seems there’s strong support in the $6K range. This type of pullback may be good for a potential trend reversal. As the fundamentals haven’t changed, and in fact are stronger every day.
1	1522939854	1	don't get my hopes up
1	1522942289	1	What fundamentals?
1	1522942686	1	The fundamentals haven't changed in two years since it was in the $400 range.
2	1522953345	1	Segwit, lightening. Gtfo of here with that. 
0	1522927746	3	Whats the weather forecast today, folks ?Clear?Tornado?Hailstorm ?Please feel free to add. 
1	1522928619	3	The current forecast: Mass extinction Armageddon meteors falling from the sky
2	1522928928	2	Thats probably better than daily bleeding and slow death. Let it come. 
2	1522929473	2	Lovely day 
0	1522928826	3	Anyone know if the news from India this morning is going to affect the markets?
1	1522930331	2	Well I don’t think anyone can say for certain. Definitely likely that some Indians will start selling off their bitcoin assets
2	1522930793	1	Still holding strong. I don't know what to do though.
3	1522932174	0	Sell some and buy back later at lower price.. That's what I'll do :(
0	1522929515	3	Anyone know if there is a .50 store in the states?...my rations are getting low
0	1522935652	3	Just Tethered...exited several Alts.  See you in a few weeks guys
1	1522935936	3	Thx. Now the price can finally go up.
2	1522936132	2	^ i like this guy
1	1522937664	2	Good timing. 
1	1522935799	1	No! You can't leave, everyone really likes you!
0	1522936471	3	Who just got short crushed?JUSTED.
1	1522937336	1	Rollercoaster'd
2	1522939525	1	Who shorts under 8k lol?
3	1522940053	1	Literally heaps of people. 
3	1522940263	1	Do you really understand what shorting is?  It's about the *range* and whether it's going up or down, it does not depend on any particular value. 
1	1522939082	1	How? You never can lose in that situation.
0	1522944642	1	Crypto "$25 billion capital gain hit" see https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-05/crypto-rout-driven-by-25-billion-capital-gain-hit-tom-lee-says
1	1522944753	1	I like Tom Lee. He always makes me feel good.
1	1522945155	1	I like Tom Lee as well, thanks for posting.  I hope he's right with his end year target price. 
1	1522946224	1	Lmao this guy is crazy. It is impossible that 20% of ALL capital gains are from Crypto only.
1	1522945648	1	about 2 months too late Tommy:https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7sf0ow/tax_selling_season/
2	1522945905	1	Selling pressure in cryptocurrencies could ease after tax day.The April 15 income-tax filing deadline is contributing to crypto’s falling prices as investors who won big betting on the digital tokens sell some of their remaining holdings to pay $25 billion in capital-gains levies, Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in a note Thursday. Bitcoin dropped more than 40 percent over the past month, including a 2.4 percent decline on Thursday to $6,664 as of 9:39 a.m. in New York.“This is a massive outflow from crypto to dollars,” Lee wrote. “Historical estimates are each $1 of USD outflow is $20-$25 impact on crypto market value.”Lee says that $25 billion prediction -- derived from his estimate that U.S. households had $92 billion in taxable gains from cryptocurrencies in 2017 -- would represent 20 percent of capital-gains tax receipts to the U.S. Treasury. He estimates total capital gains receipts will hit a record $168 billion for tax-year 2017.A crypto bull who maintains a year-end price target on Bitcoin of $25,000, Lee sees the selling pressure passing.“We still like Bitcoin and large-caps,” he said, adding that “while we believe the bear market for alt coins is largely over, we do not see upside for alts until mid-August.”
3	1522946523	1	If Tom Lee is such a genius,  why didn't he talk about this 2 months ago,  when bitcoin was 12K?   It was easy to see coming,  all you had to do is remember back 18 years!But since Tom Lee still won't give you the bitter truth, I will.  April 15 WILL NOT end tax selling pressure.   What will happen is a fair amount of true believers WILL NOT sell now to pay their taxes,  they will pay the non payment penalty,  and pay the interest , hoping that their crypto will recover.  In 2001 that created the tax hangover,   look back and look at NASDAQ from April 2001.  My friend was just such a hold out.  He finally sold 7 months AFTER April 15, unwilling to pay the interest any further.
4	1522947353	1	I will also tell you something, my friend 50 years ago made £3 million.  My friends story is about as relevant as your friends.  
5	1522947672	1	My friend's story is about what happens when a asset bubble and the IRS collide,  what's your friend's story exactly?
6	1522948885	1	I'm just saying that 18 years is a long time ago.  No one knows what will happen for sure with the Bitcoin market, it's all totally new.  Already it has managed so much that no one would have believed could happen, to go for fractions of $1 to nearly $20 thousand.  Time will tell.
7	1522949501	1	All I've really done since I started posting in any crypto sub was to compare it to the Internet bubble,  because I was sooo deep into that fiasco it's burned in my psych.Crypto is new,  but valuation bubbles are not,  If I've proven anything with my posts of the last three months,  it's that crypto is behaving almost exactly as the Internet bubble did 18 years ago.
8	1522952028	1	At the moment things are far from good if you compare everything to the ATH, I prefer to look at it from the perspective of it being nearly 7x higher then the $1k price it was around 1 year ago.  The next year will tell us a lot.  Like I say we are in total virgin territory.  Humans like to look back at the past and try and find similar examples, the fact is that this is 100% unique.  If anything it would make more sense to compare crypto with the early market for Gold.  That was very volatile in it's early years and took a long time to become stable. 
0	1522945284	1	CNN Quest Express is covering Bitcoin’s current tanking. With  claims that bitcoin is worthless.
1	1522945858	1	Its been tanking for months now. Where have you been?
2	1522945927	1	I’m not stating my opinion. Just discussing what’s been said on public TV.
1	1522945780	1	And with that MSM commentary it’s bye bye to any adoption. Back underground for another 9 years.
2	1522946970	1	Because the MSM has been fueling widespread adoption? It's looked on it as a quaint curiosity that kids these days are flocking to when they're not playing those games.If it goes underground for 9 years = something that had its time, and is now gone. Happens to things, even if they're valuable. Looking at you, Beta Videotapes.
2	1522945879	1	I highly doubt that.
3	1522946275	1	Then you are way too optimistic.
4	1522946615	1	I doubt that, too. The ecosystem has evolved massively during the past 9 years. Now there are well funded companies developing solutions to advance adoption. Just think of Lightning Network and all the surrounding APIs which have been released lately.We are on the brink to step into the next level of adoption.
5	1522948675	1	Holding up LN as a success story shows that your optimism is boundless. 
6	1522950059	1	Why is that in your opinion?
5	1522949925	1	You WERE on the brink. Effed that up with the dumping in December. Prove me wrong in time, I sincerely hope you can though I also sincerely doubt it. Which is a strange and foreign mindset for me since last year I was preaching crypto. Venture Caps are also fleeing the space right now in droves. Denial is strong on both sides of the fence.
6	1522950182	1	I believe you are mistaken *price* with *adoption*.
7	1522950990	1	No. I’m equating interest with price. There is no interest so there will be no adoption. There is no interest because the general public has seen that bitcoin can drop by $14000 and not quickly recover. Which is extremely dangerous for those who would adopt it. They are scared away for many years, if not permanently.
5	1522947458	1	We really aren't. I see no signs that the world is on the brink of switching over to digital currencies. That would involve people getting paid in the digital currencies. This will not happen as long as the volatility remains high. You would be a fool to elect to be paid in such a volatile way.My average day typically concludes with not a single person speaking of digital currencies.
6	1522947773	1	I wasn't saying that "the world is on the brink of switching over to digital currencies". This will take a long time. Many years. And yes, volatility has to be reduced for that.But we're close to the next level. Baby steps.
0	1522948002	1	Wake me up inside 
0	1522940655	1	"Bart Simpson" pattern confirmed.https://imgur.com/a/4SKxX
1	1522941304	1	Shorts how ironic
2	1522943284	1	Eat my shorts. Love it!
0	1522923706	4	So in this week end BTC price would drop to 6K?I don't think so
0	1522931750	4	Bloody hell!  When are we going to get some good news?  Just seems relentless at the moment, everyday there is something to put a spanner in the works.  
1	1522932882	1	I thought we would be good for a while post G20 and perhaps a recovery may still happen before then. The next potential negative could be around June/July Re South Korea taxation framework and G20 countries aim to have a plan on how to tackle crypto both could spook crypto markets, stifle market cap and wider adoption.
2	1522933001	1	I think the stock market doing poorly is really hitting Bitcoin hard. 
0	1522939770	1	That amount of open shorts... Market about to punished them.
1	1522940296	1	Is there any way to see how many open positions are at a moment on a particular exchange?
1	1522950698	1	Where are you seeing that data?
0	1522941729	1	Back to normal or lower.
0	1522950297	1	Stay cool.  All will be fine.  Bcash is dying.  BTC will be 10k again shortly.FUD has a short memory.
1	1522951282	1	I hope you're right on Bcash.  Lot of interesting data to watch as it withers out (if it happens that way).
2	1522951547	1	It is already dead.  De-fib from Ver will no longer work, there needs to be some sign of activity.
3	1522952075	1	It's got nearly 11 billion dollars in it as of right now. You can claim it's on its way to dying, but no way you can declare it dead.
1	1522951337	1	BCrash isn’t dying. The crypto market in general however, is. Bitcoin would have to go to $30k and then drop to ever get the general public reinterested in crypto. They would need to see that any ATH can eventually be surpassed so they can confidently hold through the downs.
2	1522951673	1	so the previous all time highs don't mean anything 30k your weird.
3	1522953388	1	The fact that bitcoin is worth a third of its ATH is what the public cares about. 
3	1522952513	1	Not a thing to the public at large. The only thing they will see for years without another ATH soon is that millions of people lost most of their money by putting it in. So they won’t be interested in putting in a cent, let alone a dollar.
2	1522951467	1	Of course Bcash is dying: by value, interest and trading volume.  It is almost dead.
3	1522952334	1	It’s still listed on major exchanges. Until that changes it isn’t dying. When it’s $100 it will be a much better buy than Bitcoin and will surge past in value. The whole idea is counterproductive.
1	1522952624	1	I remember the good old days when bitcoin was $200. Perhaps we'll relive it...
0	1522939189	3	Anyone have a good feeling about the summer? Like July/August, feel like with all the heat rotting peoples brains combined with the futures trading we might actually see 12k again by that time.
0	1522939736	1	Lol what a panic here. If you dont believe in Bitcoin then sell and take your shitty system paper money. 
1	1522941082	1	I'm OK with "shitty paper money", as is 99.9999999% of the world.   That is why bitcoin is going nowhere and people are here panicking like crazy every day.
1	1522940938	1	word looks like everyone is uere to make their shitty fiat im not selling ever im exchaning it for goods and services once it gets up fuck fiat
2	1522941691	1	You will be waiting forever to "fuck fiat"!
2	1522943512	1	I actually hope it will hold in the upcoming American recession and that more property owners will accept Bitcoin because of us instability.That's when I'll swoop in and buy up some property on the cheap and with my profits.Then take those profits and flow them back through Bitcoin and so on and so forth. Kinda the best of both worlds and basically still avoiding fiat.
3	1522945467	1	What profits? Your fiat? 100 BTC is 100 BTC. Property is USD to BTC, at least for next several decades. So if your BTC to USD is down, you have no profits.
0	1522922568	2	lets break 7k again. dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives
1	1522923668	4	Probably not going to happen. My guess is that it's going down. 
0	1522929755	2	Im not a millionaire, I thought I would be by the time I was 30 but I wasn’t even close and then I thought by the time i was 40 but by 40 i had less money than when i was 30. Maybe by my 50s idk - Michael Scott- hodlgang
1	1522931376	1	I believe in you Dave, I know you can make it happen so long as you never give up!
0	1522939300	2	it is really starting to look like we have reached a turning point
1	1522939746	1	Not really. A turning point is usually a hard crash down, closely followed by a rally up. With lots of volume.
2	1522940359	1	it seems as if the strength of the sellers is beginning to decline in this region
2	1522941765	1	How is this not a hard crash down? Look at the charts. 
3	1522943424	1	I'm looking. There was a crash down on March 30th, but it wasn't followed by a rally up.This is more like a strange extended bear flag.Look at Feb. 6th. This is what I'm talking about.
0	1522943914	1	I bought in at 10,700 a month ago and just sold it today for 6,830.  Need the money unfortunately. Owned it for less than a year obv. How does tax work for this?Do I do anything besides write it off as a loss in TurboTax? Someone is trying to tell me it’s considered income because I invested and sold it all within a year. 
1	1522944191	1	I bought it when it was 11500. Fortunately I didnt have to sell so far and I can afford few more months but I feel for you. 
2	1522944493	1	Well, I bought at 11,500, then doubled down to get it averaged at 10,700. $8300 of my investment turned into $5300 in a month LMAO. Going to try to make it back in the stock market. Will take a long time for sure but I have more faith in recovering the 3k in established companies than I do in btc tbh. Hodl at 1k loss. Hodl at a 2k loss. Not sticking around for the 3k loss to turn into a 4,5,6k loss.... which I half expect it to. Also I’m incredibly tired of checking the price every 20 minutes just to be crushed over and over and over again. Not worth the stress. 
3	1522944715	1	Good luck man
4	1522944780	1	Good luck to you!! I’d like to see btc recover even if it means I lost 3k even when I didn’t have to. But I can’t handle it anymore I’m weak!!
5	1522945128	1	I believe one day it will.
3	1522948577	1	This is why they say invest what you can afford to loose and forget about it. That way when it goes down, it goes down and no pressure to pull the money out but only curiosity as to what future will bring 
4	1522948726	1	I lied a little bit, I can afford to lose it... But my faith in it has shaken tremendously. The bottom is where....... 2k? Where does it stabilize? It’s so volatile that it’s affecting me mentally. I’m much more comfortable being in the stock market with a more reasonable risk vs reward. 
5	1522949148	1	If you are worried and being affected mentally about your crypto investnents to the point of pulling it out then you cannot afford to lose it.
6	1522949290	1	Ooooookay. -40% return in a month doesn’t bother you I guess. Coupled with the India news as well. 
7	1522949424	1	If you want to wait and see for long term , invest only that you are comfortable leaving in a bear market and  the loss of which doesnt affect you. But if it affects  you ,then sell for your own peace of mind. good luck.
1	1522943955	1	Hmm, I don't think they tax losses - it would be SOOOO mean if they did!
2	1522950123	1	They don't, you can actually write it off.
1	1522944421	1	Technically you do nothing.  Make sure you save any documentation that proves the capital loss.   Then in future years,  if you have any capital gains,  you can subtract your prior losses before you pay taxes the gains that remain.   
2	1522944582	1	Capital gains specifically (1y plus), or any short term gain?
3	1522944929	1	IRS considers crypto profit capital gains.They differential between long term capital gains (1+ yr) and short term capital gain (< 1yr)Losses on an investment are first used to offset capital gains of the same type. Thus, short-term losses are first deducted against short-term capital gains, and long-term losses are deducted from long-term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted from the other kind of gain.

2	1522945989	1	Thanks for that. 
0	1522946130	1	I got verified from Gemini 4 weeks ago. Bought in at 8.8, thought the dip was at 8, bought again. Yesterday I bought at 6.8. What an emotional rollercoaster. Hopefully this pays off in the long run!
1	1522951368	1	Par for the course!
0	1522933071	1	Thanks to one of the worst banking systems in the world, I think we actually might be going sub 6k boys.I'm putting my money on 5.8k but we'll see won't we?
1	1522934292	1	The good thing is that with bitcoin we are replacing the banking system!
1	1522934330	1	i don't know what to think anymore.  going down to 4k or lower wouldn't even surprise me.  even though i think that'd be total bullshit
1	1522935340	1	Yup.
1	1522936380	1	Are you suggesting that the banking system is behind the current bitcoin price? The whole point of bitcoin was to subvert said banking system, if it fails at that than I personally see it as a failed experiment. That hasn't quite happened yet.The current price much more likely has to do with the ridiculous FOMO that the general public bought into late last year. Once that hype faded so did the price.
2	1522937842	1	No, I was suggesting that the market loves to short when ever bad news rolls out and we were already on shaky ground.
1	1522937436	1	India really won't have that much of an impact as you think.
2	1522937767	1	Apparently so, last time it did but I guess the lower we get, the closer we get to Bitcoins actual value and the less impact fud will have.
3	1522937985	1	Its funny that a whole truckload of negative press lowers bitcoin a few k.  But any small good news and it turns bullish.
4	1522938991	2	I haven't really been seeing that lately.
0	1522934176	1	good
0	1522935133	1	this hanging around 6600 is making me uncomfortable 
1	1522935434	5	Dont worry, you'll soon see some heavy dildo's across the board. Probably all red cause red is the new green in 2018
2	1522936045	1	YES!!! I WAS WRONG!!! 
3	1522938752	1	let’s hope it lasts lol 
0	1522935286	1	Welp, my feeble attempt at day trading this bitch has not been going well so far.  Already lost $600 usd, plus I got raped by fees, because I panic traded. I sodl the trading stack and will try to buy lower.  Still hodling my main stack as I think it will go up in long run.   
1	1522935731	2	Didn't mommy tell you? Hold and buy the dips.
2	1522942294	1	Did you start buying that 17k dip?
3	1522943318	1	Actually I started a little before we reached ATH. Now I'm cost averaging on the way down.I'm pretty sure it will pay off in the long term.
2	1522935852	1	I am holding vast majority of my stack, but I have a small portion set aside for day trading because I got bored waiting for bitcoin to rise. 
3	1522936062	2	That's what the market is playing on: boredom. If you get impatient, you lose.
4	1522936423	1	True that.  I bought most of my trading stack in the 8’s and thought I’d be trading the ups and downs between 8-9k. Then as soon I bought it everything started sinking.  Go figure    
5	1522936889	1	Well you could always sell so it will start rising.
6	1522937756	1	Like right now. Make a profit and wait again; that's how the sausage is made.
7	1522940878	1	Told ya.
6	1522943430	1	He Sold? ..... Pump it
1	1522936429	1	Don't worry.  Just keep believing in the tech.   You will be rewarded in the end.
0	1522935829	1	Escelator is going up one level again...
0	1522936111	1	Price 150 lower on cmc than gdax?..never seen that
1	1522936876	2	Is India protecting their banks from a FOMO that could break them?
2	1522937620	3	Based on what I've read, heard, and been told by Indian friends. Combined with my own life experiences I'd say... **NO** they are protecting their own interests.
0	1522936268	1	**COME ON BULLS!**
1	1522936930	5	to the moon ? whith rocket or lambo  ?lol....bull trap 100%5k in 2 days.....
2	1522937521	3	Bull trap..more like bull crap. 
2	1522937640	2	Why do bears even carry on with their behavior? It hurts everyone I don't get it . 
2	1522938238	2	You might be winning the current battle but the war is far from over. 
2	1522946083	1	I'm not saying you think this, I'm really not, but most of the people talking about bitcoin going to the moon seem to not realise that it has already mooned and its never going to reach those heights again.The general public got pulled in at the end of last year and the people that recognised it cashed out around the ATH.Im pretty sure that can never happen again after all of the negative publicity of the crash. It's over. I'm sure of it. 
1	1522938429	4	and ... a red wild dildo appears!

3	1522933371	2	Damn, I was...but now, I, I don't know. :0
0	1522942699	1	the banks have 3 months to stop crypto - does that mean people cash out into Fiat in the next 3 Month?
1	1522943256	1	A claim as substantial as that truly warrants some context my dude.
1	1522943908	1	Is that like in Mission Impossible or something?  That is, if they don't stop it within 3 months the pregnant lady in the lift dies in an inferno that triggers the release of a dangerous virus and also a leopard from the local zoo where the local schoolchildren are visiting?
1	1522943167	1	What makes you say they have 3 months to stop crypto?
2	1522943867	1	I think he is talking about that India thing. 
3	1522943986	1	OK, tiger then
2	1522943905	1	I believe he's talking about India.
0	1522944189	1	I put my buy order in on gdax for $6725. I feel like I'm yelling at my cats when they jump up on the counter as it's hovering around $6738. BITCOIN GET DOWN!!
1	1522944937	1	Congratulations! From now on you're losing money.Just kiddin'... I believe it will all be good in the long run.
2	1522945014	1	ehh, already in the red. lol
3	1522945820	1	It'll go back up. I have no plans on selling for several years (at least until 2024). By that point I expect the price will be higher than what I bought in for. I don't really watch the price unless I'm buying and then I want the price to be low so I can add more coins to my bags.
4	1522946000	1	That's the right mindset.
0	1522945323	1	I am interested in bitcoin, it reads great..THANKS
0	1522946897	1	Anyone read this article from WIRED? "A 200-Year-Old Idea Offers a New Way to Trace Stolen Bitcoins" https://wired.trib.al/0EEDq8W. This is like an equivalent of asking people to keep track of where their cash might travel to because it might had been tainted 1000 transactions ago and the law wants those exact tainted coins from them whether they know it's tainted or not.
1	1522949587	1	Imagine if they did that with dollars. There would be no currency left in circulation.

0	1522931813	0	My 2 cents worth with Indian banking mandate and tax season this month the selling pressure will surely drive price down. The question is how far down and to what extent Bitcoin will recover. So many waiting for the bottom. Perhaps now is a good time to sell and buy back later as Bitcoin is unfortunately failing to hold above $7000 and is getting very close to testing February lows.
1	1522937587	1	I don't think India will have an impact.  Clealry they want to launch their own shitcoins.
0	1522934677	0	Quick, sombody post that 300 meme, it pushed us from 6k once!

0	1522937062	-1	**VERY IMPORTANT PSA**: Dear friends, please stop worrying about BTC price in terms of the useless fiat that we are going to replace quite soon.   Remember this is about freedom from governments and corrupt thieving banks, and about a technology that is going to change the world!    As a first adopter, your reward will come when BTC is the global currency.   You will be rich beyond your wildest dreams.   So stop panicking.HODL AND WAIT FOR MOON SPACESHIP!    
1	1522948438	1	Pathetic attempt of trying to make bitcoin holders look like a greedy and delusional sect.
