0	1523029873	1	Meanwhile, over in the naughty corner:- Bcash perilously close to declining further to ฿0.09- Bcash is hard-forking itself to a 32MB block size, even though its volumes are now so poor it doesn't even need 1MB.- There could potentially be 2 versions of Bcash after their self-imposed and silly fork.  Let's call them Bcash Core and Bcash Cash.
1	1523030267	1	I think we are entering a phase, where we don't even need to mention Bcash. It's just fading into obscurity...
2	1523030591	1	Yeah.  It still bugs me, but maybe time to forget.Forgive me if I post something every once in a while to subdue my anger.
1	1523031703	1	Is it really? I stopped following up on bcash. Lol what are they doing over there?Can't help but notice the redditor for a day tag btw
2	1523031760	1	Look at my name.I am one of Ver's poorly disguised sock puppets gone rogue  :)
3	1523032290	1	Old Ver's loosing it eh? Well that explains that MrManHimself psychopath, he went rouge too but now just hates all crypto.
4	1523032568	1	As Ver knows, 'to love oneself is the beginning of a life-long relationship.'
0	1523009511	4	When the US wake up and see the Bitcoin for $6580, will that make them buy at a perceived good bargain or panic sell?
1	1523009812	6	Sorry bro, We went to sleep at 6530 -.-
1	1523021074	3	Lol what bargain? It's a biblical level pump and dump scheme. You are out your mind if you seriously believe Bitcoin has any relevant future right now....it's a massive manipulation tool for the rich millionaires that understand this game...Hardly anyone is using this crap as currency.  No one gives a shit about decentralized crap. You are holding a ticking time bomb.Rich players drove this up to 19k...guess who drove it down to 6k? Those same rich players. Good luck convincing them to hodl lol. They understand what this is. A get rich quick scheme. Anyone of you hodling Bitcoin for moral reasons is delusional. Get your profits and cash the fuck out. That's exactly what the millionaires did.
0	1523018474	5	Is this Black Friday?
1	1523018543	-2	This is going to be the best Friday of your life! 
0	1523016481	7	Who fell for the bull trap at 7.5k btc few days ago, and what was your thought process for buying in?
1	1523018070	7	The hindsight award winner goes to....
2	1523022255	4	There were plenty of us saying it was an artificial pump at the time and you simply chose to ignore us. The market manipulation has become so obvious you have to be blind not to see it. 
2	1523018452	3	I didn't claim to know anything. I bought also at 7.4k. Check yourself before criticising others.
1	1523024679	1	It was simply when my deposit arrived to the exchange. I don't try to time the market, I'm not convinced I have a competitive advantage. 
1	1523035874	1	Only buy dips where your own personal misery index is high. Buy low and hodl. 
1	1523016711	1	Those mooners
0	1523018821	7	I am contemplating the famous saying "be greedy when there is fear in the market" ....So simple yet so unnatural to act upon...
1	1523019264	7	Exactly. It's so easy to say buy the dip when the price is going parabolic but much harder to pull the trigger on buys when the price is on the way down. I remember in December people were praying for little dips here and there. Now bitcoin is almost 75% off and people are scared to take advantage. 
2	1523026012	1	the best thing about buying the dip is that losses are minimal, but gains, oh god.Buying ATH at 20k, need to reach 40k to double your money, but if you buy at 7k, the gains when bitcoin recover 20k will be about x3.
3	1523033406	1	There’s next to no chance we ever see $10k bitcoin again, let alone $20k...
4	1523035914	1	says redditor for 4 days
2	1523019583	2	exactly, and you know what, every single successful crypto money-maker I have listened to, they are saying that best buys come when there is blood in the street.They call it accumulation phase.And still what do most of the people do, buy when euphoria is high :) but I guess this is a zero-sum game, someone has to lose to make other win. They key is study and skill.
3	1523019875	8	Not just in crypto, in stock and investment in general. Even in real estate - you don't buy the best house in the worst neighbourhood, you buy the worst house in the best neighbourhood. You buy cheap and ugly. You buy when buying isn't sexy. You vulture the stock when nobody wants it. When people call you an idiot for doing so. That's when you know it's the right time to buy. When I bought more in early 2015 after the big 2014 crash my friends laughed at me for buying something which had just lost 80% of its value. Bitcoin was dying. Dead. A lost cause. That's how I knew it was the perfect time to buy. 
4	1523021982	2	so true and can't argue with somebody who's been in way longer than me.  3 years ago I was a newbie to investing in general.  I finally had some extra money and bought great stocks Amazon 350, BABA at 70, Apple at 90, Facebook 75, Visa 64, Boeing 125 and a few others.  Unfortunately i panic sold after 6 months and wound up losing about 4 grand.  Since then I've watched those stocks go on to double and more.  After learning that lesson I decided that any extra money was better spent on paying down my mortgage as stocks were getting too high and i thought pre-paying my mortgage was the safest bet (even though I know many ppl disagree).  Anyway fast forward to May 2017 and Bitcoin popped up on my radar.  I didn't understand it when I originally heard about it in 2013 but for some reason it started to interest me last May and i dug into the tech, significance etc.  It became super obvious to start accumulating and I swore to myself I will not panic sell and my time frame is a minimum 1-4years.  Who knew the first year would be the hardest, but i don't see any reason why it won't eventually surpass last ATH, perhaps its this year.
5	1523027497	1	> i don't see any reason why it won't eventually surpass last ATHHere's a reason: the last ATH was the result of a greedy FOMO rush by all sorts of suckers; painful lessons have been learned; so won't happen again.
6	1523028866	1	you really believe we won't pass ATH again?
7	1523029267	1	Sorry, will not happen again.   With the near-collapse of bitcoin and the scams of ICOs and other cryptocurrencies, the general public will stay out.    And without substantial new money, forget any serious rise in price.    The long-term trend for bitcoin etc. is a slow, painful ride to the bottom.   If you are smart, get out now; don't be the kind of fool who believes in "look it has gone down before, and then look at how much it rose after that!".   
8	1523030637	1	once i get my taxes paid id be willing to do a bet.  maybe we could use a smart contract?  Or are you a No-Coiner?
6	1523029231	1	markets go through cycles.  Ups and Downs'.  The next up will be bigger and the next down will be bigger and repeat.  Most ppl won't start adopting the technology though until the market is much more mature., at that point you will get the benefits of the technology but not so much the financial gains
7	1523029396	1	> The next up will be bigger and the next down will be bigger and repeat. On what basis do you say that?  Because bitcoin has gone down and then up in the past?    That's simply dumb; the world is now more aware that it was in the past.> Most ppl won't start adopting the technology though until the market is much more mature.What does "market ... more mature mean"?
4	1523020701	1	You are so right. Boy does history keep repeating. 
5	1523021882	0	Except that the conditions of any time in previous history are no longer the same. There are no easy entry places in the US for onboarding fiat. Banks around the world are starting to prevent crypto transactions and ceasing services to anyone involved in crypto. Tax laws are taking any potential profits and the disdain for crypto in the general public is palpable. No one outside of crypto is interested. In fact quite the opposite now. I’m guessing if everything stays just as it is today with no further preventative / prohibitive regulations this will eventually go to $1k bounce back to $2k, down to $500 then $0.1, there will be no December bull run. If the regulations come, it will be the same, only faster.
6	1523022994	3	>No one outside of crypto is interested. This isn't true, in my experience. I'm just a boring mid 30s soccer mum. Though I have an IT background I'm no tech whiz. A lot of my 'mum friends' are asking me about crypto now. I know 2 who have since bought some. Regular people are getting involved and I think we'll see more and more mainstream adoption.
7	1523027660	1	Use your head.  Obviously he doesn't mean literally nobody.   What me means is that the number is negligible.
7	1523023210	-2	To lose 80% of your money put in? Dont be stupid. Give them stern words of caution. Take it from experience, it sucks.
8	1523023735	2	I don't advise them either way. I just explain blockchain tech to them the best I can and tell them how buying it works and about wallets. I leave their investment decisions up to them in the end.
8	1523026049	1	you must of bought on pure speculation.  Only buy once you understand the tech and potential.  after that continually do research to justify the long term viability and watch as many interviews of ppl in the industry.  Otherwise you will indeed think its going to 1k and lower and is worthless and panic sell.  This correction is coming to an end, it will slowly rebuild.  The Point is if you don't think Bitcoin is awesome and have a general understanding of it, then don't buy.
8	1523028620	1	I'm sorry if you've lost 80%, that would suck. I'm still very much in front and have made sure not to put in more than I can afford to lose.
6	1523022086	2	Once it hits the floor (if it hasn’t already) after a cooling off period it will rise again. 
7	1523028716	1	Sounds like my dick after a vigorous round of in-out/in-out!
8	1523031982	1	Based on what I've seen so far, I don't think that has ever happened.
7	1523022683	-1	You’re thinking that the US regulators won’t start preventing people from buying it legally. I tend to think they will make it illegal as soon as a digital dollar is available. So there will be no cooling off period, only further cooling until completely frozen. Crypto will be back underground permanently. Blockchain companies will flourish on the equity markets. Cash settled futures markets Ike CBOE and CME will see increased activity. Further interest in cryptocurrencies will go the way of the fidget spinner. Not gone, but quite pointless.
8	1523025587	1	So far the SEC has been friendly to crypto for the most part.  One thing going for us is the younger generations are far more open to crypto than the older generations.  In the long run the young is likely to put pressure on regulators to allow it to continue.    A dollar coin wouldn’t be embraced unless it is decentralized and capped, which wouldn’t even make sense for the govt to do. That is the whole point of bitcoin. It should not be controlled by any entity. And if it’s not capped then more can be created just like fiat.   
6	1523023747	2	I wonder if you actually believe the garbage you just posted, it has never been easier to buy crypto and the tax issue has been around for years.  Anyone who thought that crypto would never be taxed is a moron. 
7	1523025580	1	There's a lot of them, they suffer from a pretty bad case of learned helplessness disorder and it's accompanied pessimism. They think everything is hopless and no one will ever succeed at anything. Best to just move on, they have a high probability of being "alt right" and you don't want to go down that rabbit hole.
6	1523027570	1	This is very true, but it is very painful for bitcoin zealots (who hope to get rich) to accept it.   So expect a lot of angry, negative responses and downvotes.
3	1523020500	3	My experience in Bitcoin is the best time to buy is when its correcting/below its last ATH.  There is no good reason to think this time is any different.  If I had any disposable income left i would at the very lest DCA right now on a weekly basis all the way up to 12-15k lets say. 
3	1523020747	1	Lets see where it go’s 6.5k is where I put in at on Easter so either we approach the double bottom of the February dip or it go’s down much further. 
3	1523028653	1	Well, there is blood on the streets right now and hardly anyone is buying, which is why the price is not going up.   So, where are the "every single successful crypto money-maker" you have listened to?
1	1523023895	5	No one knows what the future brings but I would rather buy in at $6600 then what a lot of people paid around December. 
2	1523036094	1	If it goes to zero you will lose just as much as the people who bought in December.  
3	1523036454	1	Nope, give yourself a few minutes to think it over.  Let me know if you need any help working it out.
1	1523020685	5	Im waiting for more fear
2	1523025108	1	good point..
1	1523022238	3	This isn't fear. You'll know when it's fear. Honest opinion from my experience.  
2	1523025098	1	valid point.
0	1523030002	1	Once the reality that we are at or close to bottom sinks in there is going to be a rush of smart money back in that’s going to shock a lot of people.  The question is, how soon. 
1	1523030315	1	In one hour.
2	1523031958	1	Two weeks.
3	1523032504	1	Two weeks, one hour.
4	1523032568	1	...and 36 seconds.
0	1523015813	12	Man this last few months sure have cut down on hodl posts, last time when it hit 6k there was so many of them.I guess many of hodlers sold or are so bummed out they don't even bother until there is 500$ pump than they squeal to the moon few times and go silence again. 
1	1523022569	3	This is a really hateful post I don’t understand it. 
2	1523026878	1	agreed, very racist post!
1	1523016155	2	To the moon!
2	1523017921	1	in LAMBO :)
1	1523017359	0	If everyone HODL's then the price has nowhere to go but up. 
2	1523022430	6	That is assuming there is actually new money coming into the market and not just a bunch of bots ran by exchanges and whales gaming to the system to make money on both the upswing and downswing. 
1	1523027553	1	This post is horrible! How could you ?
0	1523023058	3	easy baby don't wake the bearss
1	1523024278	1	Geeeerrrrr
0	1523024998	1	It's still in the wedge and has yet to break.
0	1523030511	1	We can't expect new money till we at least get back to 10 K I would imagine. Unless we raise the money on our own to attract new adapters I certainly don't expect change.
1	1523030743	1	There will be no new money; too many people got bitten in the backside.   What will continue to happen is that whales will keep pumping and dumping.   And since only the "hodlers" are determined to stick it out (i.e. no new money) the price will continue to go down.
2	1523030939	1	It's silly but I do often feel like a group of us should save up and then buy at the same time. Make it s group effort. Not a kickstarter but gathering money to go in on one particular date. Make it a movement.
3	1523031498	1	Been thinking this for awhile. Why are we not working together? Seems like the big banks are...
3	1523031163	1	Have you ever tried to make 10 libertarians agree on something? OK, now try organizing thousands... I wouldn't hodl my breath. 
4	1523031531	1	I disagree.:)
3	1523031513	1	Fishies Unite!  That’s what I’ve been saying for weeks.  I just don’t have the time nor energy to organize it unfortunately.  But I’d certainly join the cause. 
4	1523031631	1	I mean it worked in finding nemo lol 
3	1523036514	1	This is basically what's already happening. The problem is that the majority would jump ship and take their profits with them.
3	1523031370	1	Why would people in that group buy?   Because they believe in the tech? If so, then the price of btc should not matter.   Because they hope to make money from it?   From whom in that case?   Other members of the group?   
1	1523031187	1	My phone needs adapters, too.
0	1523030668	1	welcome aboard Mr. Taxman's wild ride,  keep your seatbelts fastened,  keep your hands inside the cart at all times,  here we go.............
0	1523012491	10	we’re getting real close to my breaking point. This is absolute bullshit and I am getting ready to walk away and never look back.
1	1523015149	5	take the loss and move on, nothing wrong with it, you tried, didn't work, don't make this into a more painful situation as it is already
2	1523015823	1	I am not at a loss.
3	1523022820	3	Take your profit and get out now while you still can then,what are you waiting for, until you are in a loss? 
4	1523022941	1	No. I set fundamental cutoff’s to give the chance that it could go up again. When it reaches my trigger point I cash out. Besides its gotta go down a real long ways before I am at a true loss. I am protecting my gains.
5	1523026935	1	You are confusing greed with protecting your gains, you are clearly not protecting your gains. 
1	1523016971	3	I'm with you bro
1	1523013518	9	What's absolute bullshit? You thought this was a guaranteed money maker? Or are you calling the tech bullshit?
2	1523014230	6	Lets just put it this way. I’ve been in the game since 2013. I bought, I’ve held and I’ve sold and bought low. I am real about the speculation. If we don’t break out of this -we’ll be falling into another bear revival. When 200 sell volume takes out 3000k+ bitcoins on a constant basis one loses hope. Thats the bullshit that I am talking about and besides I am getting real tired of hawking the prices as I watch all my profits chip away. Its fucking exhausting.
3	1523022667	3	Holding ain’t easy
3	1523014723	6	All these new Redditors who've been in the game for years suddenly registering to tell us they've reached the end of their tether and selling.
4	1523015206	6	yes and looking at the price, it seems to be correct too. 
5	1523015333	1	If you're intent on selling the bottom, sure.
6	1523017688	3	Yep, why do people buy stocks, commodities, and bitcoins at the top of the market and sell at the bottom? That's not how you make money with any of this. FOMO screws so many people. 
4	1523014787	-2	Fuck tether. 
3	1523015126	2	lol if you've been in the game since 2013 and haven't made enough money not to give a shit about what Bitcoin does at this point you've done it all wrong. I've been here since 2013 too and you should be playing with house money at this point. You say you've been here since 2013 but you sound like somebody who got in last December. 
4	1523015317	1	Yeah ok. Because you really know how much Ive made and how much I hold. I don’t need to prove anything to you.
5	1523015441	2	Your replies are dripping of despair and capitulation. You don't sound at all like somebody who's accumulated wealth. You're right though you don't need to prove anything nor am I asking you to. 
6	1523015710	-1	I am not in despair- far from it. I am tired of seeing my earnings shrink. I sold all my BTH at the highs and bought at 6500 during the last dip and now theres talk of another bear revival. 6200 I am out and Ill still walk away with a huge profit. Its matter of getting out completely or staying in. 
7	1523017590	3	This is the way the market works. Things go up, things go done. Be a trader and don't get emotionally attached and you will be ok. No need to capitulate. You can't always win, you just need to win more than you lose to get ahead. 
7	1523015952	7	> I don’t need to prove anything to youProceeds to try and convince me. How are your earnings 'shrinking' if you've been here since 2013?! Why didn't you sell in 2015 when Bitcoin tanked from $1200 to $200? Why is THIS the breaking point? Bitcoin lost more of its value in 2014 then it has in the last 3 months. See how you can tell who's really been here since 2013 and who hasn't?
8	1523016083	-4	Hey asshole. I DID sell in 2014 at 900$ and I bought back in  at 200$ after it flattened out.
9	1523016349	6	If you timed the market so perfectly then - you wouldn't give a flying fuck about the price today because you would be a millionaire by now. Keep stumbling over your own lies it's entertaining. 
9	1523017584	5	You sound like a fucking liar.
1	1523015182	2	Just remind yourself how many times bitcoin has crashed before and after a while of consolidation came roaring back to a new ath. The hardest part is to have patience on a scale of more than a few months. 
2	1523020669	7	You folks need to understand the big money game. These players with millions of dollars can manipulate the fuck out of this crap. You are absolutely delusional if you believe the main big money investors are "hodling". They are driving it up and cashing the fuck out.Their is only one goal here - get rich quick.Spamming "hodl, future of currency! Decentralized!!!" Is absolutely meaningless to these millionaires playing this game. 
3	1523022247	2	I agree with you as I’ve been real about this from the start. That is why I set absolute cutoffs so I don’t get trapped into the HODL philosophy if the ship sinks. I always have an exit strategy to protect my gains. This is the point of my conversation. But being called a liar by the above reply’s just go’s to show how emotionally invested most people are on this commentary. A realist I am a liar I am not.
4	1523023163	4	Ya anyone with emotional talk is automatic ignore.This is purely business. Profits and losses. I don't care about your morals or philosophy about Bitcoin and how it's gonna save the world or whatever else dumb shit people spew.This is simply price action...the trend has been set since the manipulated run up to 19k...and it's clearly been a down channel but proven support and bounces have established in the 5-6k range...so play the tight range and exit on the bounce when it happensIf it breaks under 5k and goes toward 4, good night. 
5	1523023874	1	*exactly and thank you for sounding off on a real conversation that actually is a realistic and a very valid point.
1	1523036230	1	Let us know when you break. It would mean we go back up again :) I hope
0	1523009063	4	Another day, another drop. Time to get my buy orders ready.
0	1523015077	4	So i sold at 7800 on the way down. How much longer do i wait before buying back in?
1	1523016142	4	When there's blood on the streets
1	1523016806	4	I personally feel that the markets won't be happy until we test the 6th February lows again so around $6k.But if you are unsure you could start to buy back in stages. So some at 6.5k, 6.25k, etc
1	1523017321	2	Waiting game for now. I’ll wait until under $6k. But even then, I would keep my eye on the volume profile at those levels. There you’re in the pool with true investors. Pre-December money. 
0	1523011221	6	LPT: it's less convincing if you're writing an essay convincing people why BTC is undervalued. If you're so confident about it eventually going to the moon, you want it to fall so you can accumulate unless you just trying to pump and dump. I really don't understand why people who are so confident that something is undervalued would want to pump it up so quickly. If anything you want it to stay undervalued. Then again...how does one value crypto...But frealz..why is BTC $6k and not $1?
1	1523014505	3	I am so confident in Bitcoin that I want it to stay undervalued forever? Makes sense right?
1	1523020593	1	Because their is a finite amount of btc. The US treasury can print off as many 1$ bills as it wants. (inflation... Kinda)
2	1523024214	3	There's also a finite number of 1992 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme's, why aren't they worth $6k?
3	1523024705	1	Intrinsic value. And if you can't see the value in bitcoin why are you here? Don't spread fud. 
0	1523011732	2	What experiences do people have with buying from BITMAIN?E.g.  How long did it take to ship (preferrably Europe), how much import tax did you pay, some problems to watch out for? Thank you :)
0	1523021171	2	Anybody know if there's a site that shows large buy orders or sell orders? I'd like to eliminate a lot of the noise with these .001 orders.
1	1523021221	1	Orders that have executed, obviously I can see the orderbook and buy walls and sell walls. 
1	1523024384	1	Would love to see a site that's able to display all of the relevant pertinent information from the top exchanges in some organized, easy to read graphs.
1	1523033539	1	Bitcoin Wisdom
1	1523033802	1	http://whales.cracklord.com/
0	1523027733	1	Whales aren't going to make much money if it keeps dropping. I'd not be so sure about 4k. 
1	1523028341	1	Except when they're shorting...
1	1523029544	1	What if their goal is to get out and the way they’re doing it is slowly, with the occasional pump to maximise the average price they get out at? I’m no expert, but that’s what seems to be happening to me.
2	1523029874	1	Yep.   That's exactly what's happening.   And they know that the "hodlers" will stay to hold the bag.
2	1523031468	1	If that was the goal why did they let it spike to 19,000. I think its part whale but part people are now all spooked. 
3	1523033588	1	Yeah, I agree it’s not just whale by any means. Also, I’d imagine it’s only been their goal to exit the market since the bubble started popping
2	1523029682	1	Yeah, but is it to ultimately get out, or to reinvest and lift BTC to ATH
3	1523030647	1	It’s to get out. This time the problem is that everyone that’s underwater is going to bail out at breakeven and put a mad screeching halt to any future bull run. Then never return to crypto. That’s 3/4 of everyone in crypto now.
4	1523031196	1	What about the many institutions that missed the train and are about to get their chance. Or those who sold high and are there ready to reinvest once low enough. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE xD
5	1523031526	1	> What about the many institutions that missed the train and are about to get their chance. Or those who sold high and are there ready to reinvest once low enough.Why would they get in now?   To make money?   From whom?
6	1523031923	1	What's your problem lmao. The answer is in my previous post + their own investment.
7	1523032341	1	No, it is not.  The only reason for investing is the hope of making money in the long run.   From whom are they hoping to make that money, and on what basis?
8	1523032532	1	...
6	1523037413	1	You should check out Elliott Wave Principle that should answer your question.
4	1523031485	1	Very succint and accurate analysis!
3	1523034450	1	Many finance leaders from all around the world say that crypto currencies are here to stay. BTC is the leader of that technology. The current BTC market cap is ridiculously low for the leading crypto. If you believe that the future of crypto is bright, there is no reason to get out of BTC long term.
4	1523034826	1	The fact that they are "here to stay" does not necessarily mean that they will be a big part of the financial system, all it means is that they will exist.   Moreover, since you have no basis for determining the "fair market value" of any crypto, you also have no basis for stating that "BTC market cap is ridiculously low for the leading crypto". The future of crypto is actually very dim, and that is very evident in the continuing downward trend.  (Please don't say "it has gone down before and then gone up!".   There was very little awareness of such things back then.)
5	1523036223	1	120 billion dollars for a global currency is ridiculously low. Canada alone has 70 billion in cash circulating. Canada also makes up 2% of the world GDP. You get the idea. 120 billion USD marketcap is the tip of the iceberg.
6	1523036582	1	> 120 billion dollars for a global currency is ridiculously low.You still haven't given a basis for such a statement.   A simple belief on your part is not enough.   What's more, to most wide-awake people, the current market caps are ridiculously high, given that it is solely based on speculative greed and not on the production and consumption of useful goods and services, as happens with whatever cash is circulating in Canada.    
7	1523037152	1	BTC is a currency, and as a currency is used to purchase goods and services. A country can't have say 1 million USD in circulation because the demand requires much more than that to handle the flow of goods and services. My argument is that the global economy's sum goods and services requires a much higher market cap. It has little to do with speculation, unless you're speculating that BTC will become that global currency. Do you think a global currency would have only 120 billion USD marketcap?
8	1523037950	1	Bitcoin is barely used to purchase goods and services anywhere.   To the extent that it is (very very slightly used), it is more like tokens in some specialty environment or gift cards or ...> 120 billion dollars for a global currency is ridiculously low.Bitcoin as a global currency?  LOL!  You people are serious dreamers!> My argument is that the global economy's sum goods and services requires a much higher market cap. A much higher market cap for bitcoin, which is mostly used for only greedy speculation and criminal activities?   I don't think so.    **What's more, as it becomes less useful for those activities its market cap will inevitably drop to zero or near-zero.** When you look at it a year from now, remember I told you that.    
5	1523037131	1	Please take a step back and look how the price moved on a broader scale.The market goes down for 100 days after going up for around 900 days, I would not call the future very dim just yet.
6	1523038050	1	You have forgotten one little, awkward fact:   the tremendous rises in the past will not be repeated, because people are now more aware and will not be FOMO-scammed.   If you are hoping for a repeat of the past, you are in for a very rude shock.
3	1523030112	1	I don’t know, but I don’t think they could do the latter without their dollar cost average being significantly higher than the current bitcoin price. 
4	1523030530	1	Hence why they're eating money now that is still "low", to make sure they will have their ass safe once BTC will be let catching up again
5	1523033366	1	They wouldn’t be coming out of bitcoin now if they thought it was going to sky rocket up massively in the near future 
6	1523033806	1	Are you MrManHimself alt
1	1523028865	1	What if they are shorting? Whales dont need moon to buy lambo with fiat
0	1523031796	1	Just looking around at the markets in full on a 1 yr chart:  Volume up in gold and silver, crudeVolume down in bitcoin, stocks (or flat depending on chart).The tide might be changing.
0	1523037167	1	Shorts at ATH's.  cmon ppl this is gonna be epic get the popcorn ready
1	1523037418	1	Forreal dude bears are about to get rekt. Whales might let it hit a lower low just to sucker more in. Then, FOMO :)
2	1523037895	1	i might get suckered into buying a little more...
3	1523037940	1	I’ve been putting all my side money from my gigs into crypto the past few weeks. Hope we both make it to the moon :) 
4	1523038431	1	hellz yea and the odds are you invested at the best time.  
1	1523037490	1	I'd love to see those shorts busted. That would be some bull run.
1	1523037627	1	Is there a way to check ? I mean how would u know. 
2	1523037728	1	www.tradingview.com"BTCUSDSHORTS" on Bitfinex
3	1523037942	1	Thanks. I am bit thick on this but would you please elaborate how the number of shorts are being calculated ?
4	1523038006	1	No idea. 
2	1523037869	1	Carter Thomas's new video on youtube mentions it.  i don't know how to check it but he does and says how. 
3	1523038614	1	Will check. 
0	1523022292	5	this is the bottom. BUY BUY BUY!!!
1	1523026065	1	If you haven't noticed, every rebound occurs with diminishingly high volumes. And the current floor does not even coincide with a volume increase. Looks like a hodler capitulation to me. Nobody in their right mind will buy today when they can wait a few weeks and get it at 4K :(
2	1523027265	1	The smart holders realize that it is time to bail out or be left holding the bag at the end.    
3	1523027797	1	So you really made a new account just to shit on Bitcoin huh?
4	1523028050	1	How am I shitting on bitcoin?
1	1523026042	1	to the moon with lambo in rocket ? lol...5k next week, sub4k next month....btc is in downtrend from 100 days...hilarius is : every pump (wales false,trap pump...)there is a call for the moon...lol
2	1523028538	1	The moon boys and lambo types have gone AWOL these days.   Reality is a bitch!
1	1523022612	6	I doubt that.
2	1523025313	1	Looking like it might be an opportunity for a quick long. Maybe make a couple hundred or so per coin after fees
3	1523025584	1	Good luck with that.To me this looks like a bear flag.https://imgur.com/a/a6Ydv
4	1523026418	1	yes,bear flagand any pump now is bull trapI do not understand "hodl at any cost"the btc is in clear, affirmed downtrend...not everyone knows that earn is possible even when btc go down ?
5	1523028701	1	> I do not understand "hodl at any cost"Give it a few years. You will understand my young padawan.
5	1523027379	1	If you bought at 10K+, what do you do when you see it going to the  dogs?   Bail out at a loss, or keep dreaming of a rebound?   "Hodl at any cost" is just a natural psychological reaction to fear and tough times.
6	1523030440	1	Bail out before you lose it all.
4	1523026430	1	Yup, It turned around. I haven't looked to much at the charts today, I wasn't actually going to buy. Not feeling it yet, but if it does jump up to 6800 that could be a 2k profit on a 1 btc leverage. 
4	1523027082	1	If it goes lower than 6k it’s a bear flag. It could very well also be testing the February low once more before moon
5	1523027945	1	Sure, not everything that looks like a bear flag turns out to be one.
1	1523022539	-1	looky looky, big green dillllllldooooooooooo!!!!
0	1523009985	6	sub 5.5k by the end of next week
0	1523009653	2	Friday = pump day right?
0	1523011635	4	Hi friends! I'm Bitgur.com developer. It's modern and useful cryptocurrency price index site.  We added night mode. Could anybody take a look and tell me impressions? Thank you in advance. :)URL:[bitgur.com](https://bitgur.com)
1	1523014708	1	Looks nice! Having an issue with the 7d price graph hover tooltip bubble. When I move my mouse off of the graph slightly side and then move my mouse back onto the graph again (from the left side) the tooltip doesn't show up. This only happens on the left side, and only when moving the mouse less than 50ish pixels - more than that or moving off to the right both work fine.
2	1523014950	1	Thank you. I'll see how to fix this bug. 
3	1523021402	1	Site looks great otherwise! Very clean and nice UI. Would be great to be able to have more customisability on the dates for the price charts on each coin's page too so you can see slightly more specific date ranges, as that's something I use a lot on CoinMarketCap. 
0	1523030775	1	If you look at the chart since December 15th, it's heading straight into the toilet.
1	1523031070	1	And if you look at the chart since July 2017, it's still heading up.
1	1523031014	1	It's like that like that last turd that don't flush...It keeps coming back from 6500
0	1523010209	2	What is lowest and highest amount you paid for Bitcoin. To start myself I) LOW = $6590 II) HIGH = $9425 or III) Waiting to buy first bitcoin (waiting for bottom) Note no need to post BTC amount just price paid in USD for comparison. 
1	1523010887	8	Low: $35 High: $18,800
1	1523011701	5	Low: $60High: $19,100 oofHolding: 0 BTC, but I've got plenty of Fiat ready to buy back if it gets sub-$5k.
1	1523010428	3	low: 200high: 8500
1	1523011184	3	Low 950High, 12,000 :-/
1	1523011143	2	Too much.
0	1523013578	2	Pumpity Dumpkins!
0	1523018473	2	Lets have some opinions.....how long until we get to over $10k? 
1	1523020575	5	JULY
1	1523020739	3	June. 
1	1523020789	2	Next week friday
1	1523019189	4	Never again.
2	1523021570	2	What I don’t get about people like you is if you don’t believe anymore (if ever) in bitcoin then why are you here?
3	1523022007	5	Bitcoin functioned perfectly well for 8 years rarely even touching $1000. "Believing in bitcoin" doesn't require it touching $10,000 ever again. The past year has given many of you massively unrealistic expectations. Bitcoin never even touched $5000 for the first time until a bit over 6 months ago. Those of us who have actually been involved in bitcoin for more than a couple years we understand these prices are far from the traditional norm and are not required for bitcoin to be bitcoin. 
4	1523022237	4	Believing in bitcoin means believing it will be adopted and used by the masses.  Being adopted leads to higher prices. So no, you do not really believe in what bitcoin should be. It is not meant to be a niche technology. 
3	1523030955	1	If you really believed in bitcoin you wouldn't care about what it was worth in dollars. I don't check the value of my dollars against the Euro every day.  
3	1523022275	0	There are two sides to a market....  
1	1523018697	0	2 months max but likely to be within a month
1	1523018831	0	Few hours
2	1523029154	1	Bs, it’ll be a few days at least, maybe weeks.
1	1523018613	0	3 months at best. 
2	1523018812	2	I can handle that although I must admit these last three months have been very hard to take.  
3	1523018927	3	My heart goes out to people who bought in late fall/winter. I daytrade this shit so for me there's money to be made even on the way down but if you're holding and playing it safe this must be torture. 
4	1523019656	2	It is. In the past three months I reduced my avg. costs from $15000 to $10000 by buying the dips.That's still a loss of over 30%. It hurts.
5	1523028046	1	I mined and a traded most of my holdings still if I counted equipment cost, I'm basically at break even right now. If I just consider electricity, well then I'm good down to 1k
4	1523023413	1	Mine too, thankfully I am still in profit but it was a lot more when we were at $20k
0	1523034405	1	The interest rate on unpaid Federal tax is determined and posted every three months. It is the federal short–term interest rate plus 3 percent. Interest is compounded daily. There are certain hodlers that are crunching the numbers right now,  trying to decide to eat the non payment penalty and start paying Uncle Sam daily for the privilege of hodling.    It will be a bit crazy until the 16th or 17th,  but afterwords,  look forward to continued selling pressure,  the WORST kind,  slow, drawn out, maddening!
1	1523034650	1	What do you mean by certain hodlers? If you hold and do not make any taxable transactions you don’t pay on capital gains. Am I missing something?edit: disregard I see your point.Basically you’re saying that certain people made taxable transactions and are now either holding hoping that price of BTC go’s up to pay taxes or neglecting to report their obligations to pay taxes or both.
2	1523035569	1	neglecting to report is an unknown to me.  In the US,  because the exchanges were compelled to turn over a list of their top transactors,  and the IRS is so omnipotent,  my guess is compliance will be 'normal', only the crazy fringe would try and get away with not reporting.  So what I'm referring to are those that sold some BTC in 2017,  and because of the crash,  have to sell more BTC to pay taxes.
3	1523035922	1	yeah, I figured thats what you were referring too. I usually am thinking tax forward. So I cashed out some when the prices were up in late Feb to settle out before the rush.
3	1523035691	1	I don’t get this logic. If I sold and made 30k, I’d pay the taxes on the 30k. Who in their right mind would try to get away with that?  Also, how the hell could you spend 30k that fast. 
4	1523036689	1	>I’d pay the taxes on the 30k. Who in their right mind would try to get away with that?There is nothing illegal about not paying your taxes so long as you pay the penalty and interest to the IRS.  It happens a lot in bankruptcy proceedings,  large estates that go to probate,  weird stuff like that. |Also, how the hell could you spend 30k that fast.Here is a scenario illustrating to don't have to spend a pennyYou buy bitcoin early in 2017 worth $1000Later it is worth $10,000,  so you do what a lot of early 'traders' did,  sell 10% of your holdings to recoup your initial investment,  and you now have $9,000 in bitcoin profit that is your 'further investment money',  (you think).  So you take your bitcoins and start trading them into alt coins.  Before 2017 ends,  you have a diversified portfolio,  %25 BTC,  10% ??? ....   whatever.So that means you sold 75% of your bitcoin when you traded it for your alt coin portfolio.Uncle Sam will tax those sales.So Now it's 2018,  and you realize you own tax on more than the 10% sale to fiat,  you own tax on the 75% (of the remaining 90%) to traded into alts.Your tax bill is larger than you expected,  and you don't have the cash to pay those taxes,  so you have to sell NOW regardless,  because you are SO afraid of being in debt to the IRS!
1	1523034434	1	Couldn’t disagree more. 
2	1523035138	1	Well,  yea,  of course,  because I have no idea, I can't accurately predict the future.  BUTThat is what happened the last time I was involved in a highly speculative bubble that popped very close to the end of the tax year.And if ya need to somehow try and determine what will happen with the current situation going forward,  why not look back and see what happened in the last similar situation?  Those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it.
3	1523035201	1	 Agree that we in a bubble but far from popping. Not gonna happen that fast. 
4	1523035864	1	It wasn't a pop either in 2001,  more like a long greasy fart.

0	1523032871	1	**George Soros set to trade cryptocurrencies - Bloomberg**(Reuters) - George Soros's $26 billion hedge fund is planning to trade cryptocurrencies, Bloomberg reported on Friday, months after the billionaire investor called the virtual currency a bubble.Adam Fisher, who oversees macro investing at the New York-based Soros Fund Management, got internal approval to trade digital assets in the last few months, though was yet to make a wager, the report https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-06/george-soros-prepares-to-trade-cryptocurrenceis said, citing people familiar with the matter.A Soros representative declined to comment.The financial world has been divided about betting on bitcoin <BTC=BTSP>, a digital token.Billionaire Warren Buffett and JPMorgan's <JPM.N> Jamie Dimon have said they will not invest in cryptocurrencies, while Wall Street banks Morgan Stanley <MS.N> and Goldman Sachs <GS.N> have been open to clearing bitcoin futures.Last year, Soros's hedge fund took an 8.99 percent stake in Overstock.com Inc <OSTK.O> to become the third-largest shareholder in the online retailer. The shares of the company surged when its unit held an initial coin offering.
1	1523037703	1	So I can get paid in coin when he hires me to protest?

2	1523013633	3	Because "resistance" never "holds." Resistance is every goddamn price now.
0	1523034129	1	at least we can say that 6.5k is finally the bottom. 
1	1523034230	1	How can we say that?
2	1523034387	1	Shorts at ATH, tether market cap at ATH. If we aren’t there yet we are very close. Bears be careful :) 
1	1523034713	1	More nonsense. Not really sure how you can conclude this at all.
1	1523036284	1	Fomo's a good indicator, and yep that could be the price. It might be possible to make some gains on $6,4/$6,300. 
0	1523026174	1	If you boys and girls are serious about the crypto game. We need to bring on new investors. Friends family, relatives, your worst enemies, the gang members down the block. Everyone has a handle, figure it out, use it, and spread awareness.Apparently this is why the gun debate always looses in America, cuz we win on the home front. Now I can neither confirm nor deny, but it sounds palusible.Any exposure is good exposure is good exposure, stickers, posters graffiti, porn. You name it, get on it. Don't worry about what they say or their laughter, if you just keep hounding the point home they will eventually see things your way. (Usually at the next ATH unfortunately)I'm not saying to scam them of course, educate them on the risks and make sure they don't go all in, but make sure they either buy, or discuss it with the next person. That is the only way we can prevail..numbers.
1	1523027995	1	I thought we wanted to get rid of the "weak hands"
2	1523029478	1	That was when bitcoin wasn't collapsing and we didn't need new suckers to prop it up.
1	1523027199	1	> We need to bring on new investors. Friends family, relatives ....Why do we need new investors?  So that we can unload on them and get rich, as in the Dec 2017 FOMO rush?   I thought we were in for the tech, freedom from governments, and the end of banks.  Anyway, sorry; won't happen.   All those relatives already got bitten in the arse and have learned their lesson.My advice: get out now, or you will be among the suckers left holding the bag when it all ends.    
2	1523027899	1	"We were in for the tech" "My advice: get out now" LMAOOO
2	1523028196	1	Agreed. Until its sub 1000 at least. Which it will be. 
1	1523028651	1	Porn stars with bitcoin logo tattoooed right on their asscheek!...Brilliant! LoL
1	1523026616	1	How about we find some more use cases with LN first.I would rather see more utility added before another bull run.
2	1523028483	1	People are interested in bull runs and making money, not in utility.   That is why bitcoin will ultimately fail.
3	1523029972	1	That's just a phase. Bitcoin is experiencing puberty.
4	1523030434	1	And what reason do you have to believe that things will get better?  The rest of the world have no problems with using just their cash and credit and debit cards.  They don't give a f**k abuout anonymous and decentralized and what not.  Nor can they be bothered with tedious business of setting up wallets, keeping seeds and what-not-safe, etc.
5	1523030901	1	I don't know if you remember the early days of the internet. *Everything* was tedious. But it got more easy, yet it is still based on the same protocol.Bitcoin is a protocol. It will get easier to use it.
6	1523031239	1	[removed]
7	1523031503	1	It's not just *some* protocol. It's the only protocol that managed to stay alive, unhacked (except for that one time very early in its history), for 9 years.
8	1523031687	1	> It's the only protocol that managed to stay alive, unhacked ...Seriously?   What exactly does "protocol" mean to you?Staying alive?   That's it?   You think that will ensure its ultimate success even without any real uses?   What exactly has been accomplished with that "protocol" in the 9 years?
9	1523031883	1	Right now, it just has to stay alive. Which means that it is truly secure. Real world uses *will* be built upon it.Lightning network is just the beginning. It takes time. Rome wasn't built in one day.
2	1523027242	1	I would rather see 10k be the new standard
1	1523028166	1	Right now, I wouldn't advise anyone in my circle of friends to invest. It's too risky.
1	1523029445	1	QUILTS!
1	1523036582	1	You're a scummy piece of shit. You want people to bring in their naive friends and family to pump so you can dump.

1	1523023666	3	you are an idiot even a broke clock is right 2 timesca day. I understand you have an opinion but don't make it seem like u just can predict the market. In January of last year when bitcoin was under $1000 did u predict the price to be to be $20000, prolly not you probly waited for the price to crash and it kept going up and when u finally got the balls to get In the coin started to decline and when you start selling your coins the price will start going up.

2	1523032091	1	Well now I *want* to know what he said.
3	1523036638	1	He said “ I assure you bitcoin is finished”. It was the usual username12345 guy or whatever. I can’t even remember his username.  
3	1523033323	1	He said BTC will go up to $10K by next month.
0	1523031237	1	Came across Coindance site today seems to have some good stats, search trends and resources see https://coin.dance/stats
0	1523032050	1	how long until we reach the bottom? I'm sure we are 1k-2k away from it. Everything right now is moving so slow, bear flag after bear flag. I haven't seen two consecutive green days for weeks now.
1	1523032360	1	We had 2 green days in a row literally 4 days ago
1	1523033289	1	I believe that we need at least one more devastating crash.
2	1523036735	1	I have exactly the same feeling. Although I also feel like everyone is expecting it which makes it from actually happening less likely in my experience. For now im just following it from the sidelines and will not buy before a significant drop or until we go above 7500.
0	1523032307	1	[deleted]
1	1523032399	1	There is still a lot of support in the 5.5-5.8 range.
2	1523032853	1	My personal next buy in point would be a little above 5.8k. I believe it's the same for many people, because that's the downtrend line. At least for now.

0	1523024507	1	 BUY BUY BUY
0	1523026633	1	Wow George Soros.  Never thought Id see the day.  100k incoming, then the most scary drop in history - rinse repeat
1	1523027297	1	Why do people keep making such crazy claims? Attention?
2	1523029145	1	no not at all.  I feel confident that at the worst case scenario we will see ATH's by the next halving.  Best case scenario is this summer or by the end of the year.  I personally think we are close to the bottom but of course i wouldn't rule out another scary drop to 5k or below and then epic recovery.  We are witnessing the birth of a new industry.  Tons of money to be made and its also based on a revolutionary new technology that WILL get adopted because its better than our current system.  This is of course just my opinion based on research.  
3	1523029845	1	Honestly, if you’re basing your investment decisions on the assumption that the worst case scenario is that Bitcoin doesn’t reach 20k until mid 2020, you are playing a dangerous game.
4	1523031103	1	when i got involved it was because of the technology, its implications, problems it solves, why its better than current systems, who the players in the game are, what they are saying, what they are doing.  I personally don't think its a scam and feel that we are witnessing the birth of a new gigantic industry.  I don't rule out more pain before gain though.  While i wouldn't recommend taking a mortgage out, i think putting 500-1k for long term few years is a no brainer
5	1523033419	1	I wish you good luck :)
6	1523035169	1	thanks man, its gonna be the ride of the century for sure
4	1523037075	1	20k in mid 2020  is  conservative
3	1523029510	1	My mind agrees with you. My gut doesn't. But I prefer to listen to my mind.

0	1523012161	-13	Did you guys heard about Venmo? it is like a bitcoin but better i every imaginable way.
1	1523013729	9	What are you smoking? It's just a social media version of paypal. 
1	1523013342	6	Bullshit. It’s just a copy of PayPal. It’s owned by a company and not decentralized like Bitcoin:
2	1523014084	2	It's **owned by PayPal**. It's on the first line of their [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venmo) - they're just sneakily rebranding to make people think it's a new and better service when it's exactly the same. The Wikipeda page also mentions the fact that it's US-only, not global. It even states:> The transfers can take one to three business days to become final....which makes it *slower than Bitcoin* too.
3	1523017742	2	Yup, like when Facebook bought Instagram.People are like, "F*ck FB, I'm deleting my account and going to Instagram!"
3	1523014092	1	**Venmo**Venmo is a mobile payment service owned by PayPal. It allows users to transfer money to one another (within the U.S. only) using a mobile phone app or web interface.

2	1523013440	1	how did you buy your bitcoin? from some peer or from centralized exchange?
1	1523014681	2	Yeah except they can ban you for arbitrary reasons and your money vanishes-like buying a product.....They don't allow merchant payments, stupid limits, etc
2	1523023345	1	Exchanges cant freeze your account? And about merchat payments.. You can buy STICKERS and SHIRTS on LN.
