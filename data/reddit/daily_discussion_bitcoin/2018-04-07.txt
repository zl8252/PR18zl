0	1523117112	1	The real test is trying to get past 7.5k, which was the previous high. If it doesn't get past 7.5k, then it's another failed attempted like last time, and so many other times.

1	1523107282	1	Things will get worse, and then they will get better. Then the cycle continues.
1	1523108379	1	Another day, another 12 reports that bitcoin will rise and another 12 reports bitcoin will fall.

0	1523114945	1	Does anybody have any experience accepting bitcoin at their business or paying in crypto at a local small business?  And if so do you know if its easy for the Business owner to convert to Fiat?  And any idea what the fee's are associated with accepting crypto and converting to Fiat ?  
1	1523115548	1	Nobody uses bitcoins to pay for any real good and services.   They are more like gambling tokens in a casino.    So you won't  get any answers, I'm afraid.
2	1523115715	1	whats your opinion on Coinbase Commerce?
0	1523114982	1	>Mods, please ban immediatelyu/MrManHimself is WunderBaah.
1	1523115082	1	The quilt guy ?
2	1523115214	1	We need the quilt guy.  It's his Mom and friends who have been supporting all the buy walls.
1	1523115251	1	I’ve been wondering what happened to him, he’s too anti-FUD to be mrman though lol 
2	1523115367	1	He is just helping his mom transporting the quilts and convincing the unionville town’s brothel to start accepting bitcoins. 
2	1523115724	1	It's not WunderBaah - the quilt guy is enthusiastic and charming.
3	1523115866	1	definitely enthusiastic, not sure if I could agree on the charming part.. 
4	1523117023	1	I liked him. He had some good stories.
3	1523116933	1	I am enthusiastic, charming, and very helpful.   A totally, all-around nice & great guy.   
4	1523117517	1	It must get a bit cold under that bridge.
5	1523117982	1	Not really.  The heat from my computing system keeps me warm.
2	1523120097	1	But it was all a troll, just like this MrManHimself. I mean, look at his fucking name, he's not even trying to hide it. He's roll play trolling.

1	1523095639	2	But when is this 'tax day' in the USA?  I thought that would be 1 April.
2	1523107990	1	Its bullshit anyway.  Not all people are waiting for Tax day.

4	1523098257	5	Wont happen. Same shit as wallstreet bonusses
5	1523115211	1	Actually more chance it will than Wall Street bonuses, if some people took some profit from the recent high , then got slugged with a tax bill, cashing some more out now to cover the bill is very possible. Not saying this is the cause just a very real scenario.

0	1523099809	2	Tim Draper on India's crypto stance see https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-draper-calls-indias-crypto-stance-a-huge-mistake-warns-of-potential-brain-drain
1	1523100510	1	Tech investor Tim Draper, whose recent re-entry to India’s market was prompted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise to crackdown on corruption, nevertheless criticized India’s negative stance on cryptocurrencies during an interview with The Economic Times published yesterday, April 6.Draper had returned to the Indian market in February 2017 - having exited it in 2016 due to a perceived lack of “rule of law” prompting Draper Fisher Jurvetson to sell their entire Indian portfolio - when the Mumbai-based startup backer Blume Ventures joined the Draper Venture Network.India’s central bank had announced on April 5 that they would no longer deal with crypto-related accounts - not the direct government ban on crypto which had been falsely rumoured in early February. India’s Ministry of Finance had also criticized cryptocurrency as a “Ponzi scheme” without “intrinsic value” at the beginning of January.Despite his positive outlook on Modi’s ability to stamp out corruption, Draper calls the Indian government’s denial of cryptocurrency as valid tender as “the stupidest thing,” also referencing China’s similar stance:“If I had a meeting with Modi, I would have let him know he is making a huge mistake.”Draper notes that “Bitcoin and [B]lockchain are the best things to have happened for business,” adding that “countries such as India, where billions of rupees are wasted on inefficiencies and needless paperwork, will benefit most from the ease and security of blockchain.” If India makes cryptocurrency illegal, then, according to Draper, “other countries will raise their hands to get all the [Indian Blockchain] entrepreneurs:”“If the local authorities are banning crypto, then companies in the space should move elsewhere. The government needs to realize that it is stifling innovation and should instead be creating an environment where these ideas can be tested and promoted. They have the choice to be trendsetters and attract the world’s best engineers and coders, or lose their best and brightest to other regions.”Draper, who is a Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiast, said during the interview that Bitcoin “should be the national currency” of India, for Draper believes that its “global” nature and ability to store value will make it “acceptable everywhere for transactions” in a few years.Draper also spoke about the potential for Blockchain to “roc[k] the venture capital business,” creating a competitive virtual environment where only the “flexible and reinvent[ive]” will be successful:“Down the road, you won’t have to physically leave a place to choose a better government. From wherever I am, I can get social security from Chile, healthcare insurance from Canada, education from Russia. The whole system will be much more virtual.”In regards to investments in future Indian Blockchain and crypto startups, Draper mentioned that Blume Ventures and Boost VC had co-invested in Unocoin, and that he will “continue to seek other opportunities.”One of Unocoin’s co-founders, Sathvik Vishwanath, had said earlier this week that the central bank has not taken the “right direction” in regards to cryptocurrencies, citing that the bank’s ban will “cause panic among a few million people in India who are already using [cryptocurrencies.]”
2	1523114135	1	great read thanks for sharing
3	1523114333	1	 “Down the road, you won’t have to physically leave a place to choose a better government. From wherever I am, I can get social security from Chile, healthcare insurance from Canada, education from Russia. The whole system will be much more virtual.”  I never thought about this possibility.  I can't even begin to comprehend how awesome it would be but at the same time I'd be surprised if governments allowed it.  Exciting times to be living through this
4	1523114859	1	That scares me for more reasons than I care to list.(Which is none)
0	1523117797	1	too easy to predict....epic dump incoming....
1	1523118630	1	Nah.  There will be no U-bend blocker this time.
0	1523095541	2	What a drag with this 6800 lull....
0	1523110136	1	This bot that keeps reversing dips is the new hero. Who ever you are out there running this bot, I love you.
1	1523110381	1	Some bears got rekt.
2	1523110650	1	Seriously! They also tried this shit about 8 hours ago and got rekt by this bot then too. It's glorious.
3	1523111341	1	I took this screenshot some 6 hours ago at Bitfinex:https://i.imgur.com/hg9JTAW.jpgWhile the 4 x 400 stacks of bitcoin in the bids section of the orderbook earlier today may have been a bluff in the sense that the cash owner might not use his wealth anytime soon, I did see a stack of 100 bitcoin eat up a fall earlier today, until it was pulled to let the footsoldiers do the rest of the buying. Some whales will be bluffing in the orderbooks but overall there have been some great poker-game quality action with interesting fall-reversals and odd tricks.

0	1523102478	1	Bitcoin’s 24 volume on coinmarketcap is only 3.6B USD which is quite low, and is only around 3% of bitcoin’s total marketcap (116B right now). What does this mean in terms of price fluctuations ? Is it a good thing ? 
1	1523102790	7	People with agendas use thin markets to push things around. Best to wait till there's good volumes going to see what's really going on. 
0	1523109548	1	What was that?"War of the Whales?"
1	1523109768	1	China bans bitcoin.
2	1523109884	1	The market is not impressed...
3	1523114701	1	Is it ever?
0	1523112374	1	Hey, a 24-hour gain...
0	1523113418	1	What is this bs about weekends being dropping time. What about lifting it up and making going to "work" useless xD
0	1523118024	1	Could be because of this anti-FUD regarding India?https://twitter.com/CryptoIndiaNews/status/982522314188242944?s=19I don't know.
1	1523118091	1	I sincerly believe that news have had no effect on the price for the past weeks.
2	1523118686	1	news and politics has never had an effect.  btc is unpredictable except for the big whales and insiders who are manipulating it all.we're just along for the ride.
3	1523118784	1	And quite the ride it *is*.
2	1523118139	1	Yes, you're probably right.  Just posted as a matter of interest.

0	1523118145	1	Pump doesnt last that long or does it ? 
1	1523118568	1	Probably not. But then again, what I've learned from watching the charts for the past months: If it does the same thing three times in a row, it will do something different the fourth time...
2	1523119023	1	Yeah the bots are evolving. 
1	1523119405	1	"Pump" is the first part of "Pump and Dump". Pump up the price with small positions, short the whatever with large positions, and then dump the small positions and try to create downward momentum and panic selling. It's an old, old game, which persists because it is usually pretty successful. BTW, in a regulated market it is illegal (at least in theory) as "market manipulation", which of course it is.
2	1523120046	1	Many here are not very bright and also have extremely short memories.   See the excitement over the "above 7000!"?   Happens every week.   And in between, tears as the thing goes down.   Further, people fail to see a very important trend: in all the down-and-ups, the tops of the ups keep getting lower. From 12K to  11K to 10K to 9K ...  in just the last couple of months.      
0	1523118830	1	Step Pyramid of Djoser pattern incoming.
1	1523118997	1	What should we expect ?
2	1523119751	1	Wrong question. Had to ask "upside down or..?"
0	1523119718	1	I promise you someone here was taking a shower when the price pumped. It always reverses direction when one of us are in the shower. They love phucing with us. Lol
1	1523119930	1	👋. I was
1	1523120333	1	I actually was too but there are around 10k people and it is a Saturday morning so I suppose it isn't anything special. 
2	1523120453	1	Yea I was just poking fun of all the times people posted the fact that they were in the shower and a huge dip happens or something. It's a common occurrence in this place lol
1	1523119915	1	Especially if they were having thoughts pertaining to puberty.
0	1523120078	1	Sell at 7300, rebuy at 6600? 
1	1523120267	1	Opposite. Buy at 7300 and sell at 6600 bro. That's how we do it.
0	1523115489	1	The Sun literally just came out from the clouds at my house and then i checked the priced - could be a good day...
0	1523104194	1	Any predictions on the weekend dip?
1	1523107187	1	It's been so weird. Yesterday hovering around $6600 for nigh on 24 hours. Now at the $6850 mark. It *seems* like there are people playing with the market so I wouldn't be surprised to see another mini pump to $7500 but who knows?!
1	1523107068	1	I predict...that my prediction will be wrong.
1	1523106936	1	> Any predictions on the weekend ~~dip~~ spike?
1	1523107717	1	Its the weekend so most of the manipulators are off.  When Soros is asleep, buy the sink.
0	1523098845	-4	If it hits 7-7.2k im shorting. :)Edit: why all the downvotes? Lol
1	1523100204	0	Joker
0	1523099203	0	Anyone see this going up when America wakes up? 
1	1523099758	2	whats your take on big players like Soros just trading the market and not giving a shit about the Asset itself.  For example they can just play the game of it going down $100 or up $100 all day and make bank doing that
2	1523104697	5	> trading the market and not giving a shit about the Asset itselfThere's hardly any big money player that gives a flying fuck about Bitcoin. They are in it to make money. Most ppl in general are trading Bitcoin to make actual money. Because that's all it is for now. A get rich quick scheme.You think they give a shit about hodling ? Using it as currency lol? About decentralized? None of those things matter. It's a basic pump and dumpGet in low, ride it to +50% or whatever profit range you had in mind and leave a winner.That's what happened on that bullshit manipulated ride up to 19k. Big money pushed it up and sold the fuck out. It would have a sustained move up if they actually believed in "hodling"Only fools are hodling. The minute you are in a decent profit range, cash the fuck out. Don't care about no damn future use as a currency, as a decentralized tool, etc etc. Ppl just wanna make money. Could care less about the morals of this asset lol. 
3	1523112918	1	100% agree with you that the speculative phase precedes the adoption phase.  and this market is a traders wet dream.  But wouldn't you agree then or that logically they will pump up once again pass 19k and then another crazy crash?  I imagine theres more money to be made if it bubbles again versus either going sideways for 1-2 years or even bringing it lower.  But if they do bring it lower i feel like it will still pump up pass 19k
4	1523118205	1	It's too volatile to predict. Who knows if there will be as many big money pumpers as last time on the ride to 19k...maybe it run out of gas at 12k this time and they leave.It's definitely a traders market right now. Even in stock. Volatile markets across the board. Those caught simply trying to time a swing trade can get burned easily so be careful.Don't hold and be greedy with profits. If this dumpsters to 4-5k and you wanna swing it. Go.for it. Just don't say I'm gonna wait till 19k! I'd take profits and run even at 10k. You'll neveer be sad with profitsThose that said BTFD at 12k are getting royally fucked. The first drop is never the floor lol. There's always plenty of room to fall. Just be patient for an entry and don't be greedy on your exit
2	1523101040	1	You can't make money at the scale of Soros with that kind of trading, that's just peanuts to them. 
3	1523101246	2	ahh good point.  so he needs to make it pass ATH's, have a huge FOMO event and then shit gonna get crazy?
2	1523101616	1	Not sure other then if people can see an opportunity to make money they will try and get in on it. 
1	1523101338	1	This is why I hate myself for thinking about pride every day
2	1523101953	5	Gay pride?🏳️‍🌈
1	1523109160	1	Yes, I do.  It's going nowhere.
2	1523114220	1	Sometimes I wonder what makes a cunt like you tick, then I realize I don’t care.

1	1523116106	1	It's a weekend, I'm confident the manipulators are out jet skiing.
2	1523116420	1	manipulation is done we could see huge bounce i m not worried about weekend  
0	1523116427	1	**URGENT PUBLIC-SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: UNDERSTANDING LIMITATIONS OF BITCOIN***Borrowed from*: http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/2122500/why-bitcoin-fever-bubble-waiting-burstThe cleverness of the underlying technology doesn’t mean that bitcoin is viable as a form of money. And it certainly doesn’t mean that the legions of punters rushing to buy bitcoin as an investment for the future can be confident of earning superior returns, or indeed any returns at all.Enthusiasts like bitcoins because their supply is limited. The pace at which bitcoin “miners” can create new units automatically declines over time, with the maximum possible number of bitcoins fixed at 21 million. To converts, that limit means that bitcoins, unlike the fiat currencies issued by the world’s central banks, can never be debased by governments intent on printing as much money as it takes to pay off their debts.Yet despite their scarcity, bitcoins possess no intrinsic value. Unlike hard commodities – copper, say, or even gold – bitcoins have no utility value. And unlike securities such as bonds or stocks, bitcoins do not carry the promise of a future cash flow that allows investors to put a hard figure on their value today.Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that much the same can be said for fiat currencies. With interest rates around the world close to zero or even negative, conventional currencies also offer no income streams, and hence carry no real value. They are nothing more than an illusion, a confidence trick perpetrated by cynical governments on their gullible populations.But that argument misses a crucial point. Fiat currencies do have an inherent value. The US dollar, for example, has value because the US government insists that Americans must pay their taxes in US dollars. And if they fail to pay their taxes, the US government will send them to jail (unless, of course, they are rich enough to employ expensive accountants and lawyers to devise legal tax dodges). That threat creates an underlying demand for US dollars which lends the currency a real value.Without similar backing from a government, bitcoin lacks any inherent value. Yet even if it were to win the status of legal tender, bitcoin would still have critical drawbacks. In particular, the very factor that enthusiasts like most about the cryptocurrency – its limited supply – ensures it will never replace conventional currencies as a widely-used form of money. That is because if the supply of a currency is limited, and the quantity of goods and services in the economy grows, it follows that the price of those goods and services in that currency must fall. And if prices are falling, businesspeople become increasingly reluctant to borrow to invest, because they would have to sell ever more stuff to service their debt. But with falling prices, customers defer their purchases, which means selling stuff gets ever harder.In short, the widespread adoption of bitcoin as a means of exchange, unit of account and store of value would depress demand and discourage investment, leading to economic stagnation and a rising real burden of debt. It would be a disaster.Bitcoin could still have a useful future as a specialist means of exchange for internet transactions. However, no one is currently using it for that purpose. Instead it has become a vehicle purely for momentum-based speculation. But with no intrinsic value to support prices, and with alternative cryptocurrencies springing up by the hundred and threatening to negate the very scarcity that is touted as bitcoin’s chief virtue, the bubble that last week propelled the price of bitcoins to a record high is clearly unsustainable.**Read it again.  Carefully**

3	1523117489	1	bro you is cray
4	1523117939	1	No, I am not Cray.  
1	1523118343	1	I agree with most of these points. But a couple of critical points are left out. I believe Arizona just passed a law that you can pay taxes in BTC. Bitcoin is a world accepted form of currency I believe the first. When people around here tote the line “that you are your own bank” in the bigger picture I believe that it is a way to fight back against the central authorities. To give people the sovereign right to keep them, in-line a check. Now, speculation the artificial belief that BTC is going to save the world and this and that. Its a completely fabricated illusion and as it was stated to me yesterday by another reddit user. This is purely about business.
2	1523118886	1	> I believe Arizona just passed a law that you can pay taxes in BTC. You should have read beyond the headlines and the misguided excitement of the bitcoin zealots.  What was passed was only first-stage legislation.   Know how much legislation reaches that stage and then goes nowhere?   > Bitcoin is a world accepted form of currency I believe the first.People around the world certainly use it for speculation and criminal activities, but it is definitely not a form of currency.  Nor will it ever become "a world accepted form of currency".  > “that you are your own bank” in the bigger picture I believe that it is a way to fight back against the central authorities.The only people who care about such things are social misfits and teenage geeks in parents' basement.   All others are not into fighting governments and banks and what-not; in fact they really a great deal on such institutions.    Even those who are here daily yelling about how they will hodl because they are in it for the tech and what-not are really just after one thing: government-issued money (i.e. real money) in a government-regulated bank (real bank).   That's the  planned end-game for all.
3	1523119125	1	yeah, well I respectfully disagree with some of those points. But lets see there are certain points that I do agree with. Mostly from the original post. That wasn’t written by you.
3	1523119940	1	Tell that to the 3.5 billion people underbanked/without banksBitcoin is for them to join the global economy
4	1523120243	1	Try and use your head once in a while.  How and where are they going to get the bitcoins?   
1	1523119809	1	......also I might add. Really, the intrinsic value of BTC is in the person holding it and the person willing to buy it. It’s people. Now, greed is an original human behavior and THAT is what will drive it to the ground.

0	1523101993	0	Hi everybody, I have a question about the time of transactions. I've sent a little amout of bitcoins on some website, the website says that my bitcoins will be credited after 2 confirms, is anyone knows how long would it take now? And is there any services that helps me to to estimate the transaction rate and time, cause I used to send money by stellar, and thinking about using credits blockchain with the fastest tps, however I'm dealing with bitcoins now. thank you.
1	1523102155	1	Depends on the fees you paid and market congestion.Shouldn't take longer than 15-30mins regardless
0	1523108190	1	Bit of a speculative question but wondering if any of you guys have had this before...Trying to sell my Bitcoin on Bitpay. When I click on Coinbase and Sell then put in the amount it says "Connecting to Coinbase" then "Error. Unknown error" and won't connect. Also, when I try to buy Bitcoin it says "Error. The access token is invalid." I have bought and sold many times this way previously. Any ideas what's going on?
1	1523108489	1	Access token invalid usually has to do with 2fa and the timestamps not being synced.Why TF are you selling tho?
2	1523108941	1	My Boss wants to get rid of his Bitcoin bc he believes it is heading for much lower levels...rightly or wrongly...I said pay me in Bitcoin this month and I'll liquidate same as I always do...Now I'm stuck with it and none too happy! I don't want to get caught holding the Bitcoin at the end of the day, regardless of whether it goes up or down, I just want my wages in my Bank asap!So there is a Server time sync issue between Bitpay and Coinbase and that's stopping transactions at this time?
3	1523109098	1	>  I just want my wages in my Bank asap!Lesson learned.  Next time don't listen to the "be your own bank!" crap.    Take fiat, to a real bank.
4	1523109604	1	Not trying to be my own Bank just doing my Boss a favour bc I thought I could sell BTC immediately as has previously been the case...suffice it to say this is the last favour I do for him bc this is pathetic! Just waiting for feedback from Bitpay who don't work weekends and Coinbase who quoted 5 biz days before a reply but could be indefinite due to workload! The tech and support provided by these exchanges are too overwhelmed by the demands placed upon them clearly! 
5	1523109702	1	Does anyone believe this is an issue which I can fix myself? I have cleared Cache and restarted phone and app. I'm guessing its an issue with them not me but I could be wrong
6	1523113626	1	Dude that Mr man guy is a psychotic shill for JP Morgan. Just laugh and don't engage.I commend you for accepting your paycheck in Bitcoin. Cheapest way to sell is on gdax, just go there, apparently you already have a coinbase account which means you have a gdax account.If you sell at a price slightly above or below market price, that will make you a "maker" and you'll pay no fees
5	1523110245	1	Sucking up to the boss is always to be recommended, but not at the risk of losing your pay.

2	1523115100	1	I’m teasing. It just seems that when it’s been a good day here in the Far East America sells off all the gains when they wake up.

1	1523119150	1	Why should people be motivated to hodl?
2	1523119177	1	Just watch the video, it’s very appropriate for this sub
2	1523119187	1	I like your consistency

1	1523114107	1	Correct me if I'm wrong - but you are not a moderator are you?
2	1523114348	1	I think he is trolling.But if you dont see me again on this sub then it means he wasnt. 
3	1523114440	1	Heh.  The list of Mods is down the side of the page..I respect these boards, and if the mods tell me off - fair enough - I will always comply.  But I won't have trolls telling us what to post.
4	1523114569	1	Roger ver?
2	1523115426	1	No I am not.  
3	1523115528	1	Then how would you remove posts?
4	1523115869	1	The mods will remove the posts.
5	1523116179	1	Are you aware that advising the Mods is against the rules of this board?In attempting to tell your community how to behave, you are breaking clear rules yourself.Anyway, I shall write nothing more on the matter.
6	1523118800	1	Ok, I will behave now :) 
1	1523113770	1	Actually no, I don't think everyone's opinion is welcome. Some days ago some of my posts didn't show up at all and they were merely critical about that ridiculous 'cartel' conspiracy narrative without being offensive. And each of those posts were posted only once. While I think /r/bitcoin is far better than /r/btc, there's still room for improvement.
1	1523114973	1	[pokes with the stick from a distance]Are you a troll ? 
2	1523115140	1	I'm not a troll, I was referring to MrManHimself
3	1523115187	1	Fair enough, someone said he is wunderbaah, the quilt guy.
4	1523120230	1	Dude, they talk in the same way and they troll in the same fashion.I'm telling you, "the quilt guy" was a roll play troll pro Bitcoin.Now he's come back pretending to be "the man".
1	1523113299	1	This is a very timely and appropriate warning.  We have too much in repetitions about hodling and why it is good, reviews of bitcoin history, same stuff about volume and support and "what will happen today", the alleged bright future of bitcoin, and so on.    Do we need all these repetitions clogging up reddit and taking up our bandwidth?  I don't think so.
2	1523114230	1	This is a daily discussion page.  It is for the moderators to decide what is appropriate.Just HODL.  And I predict over 7k by close of play.  I'm waiting for my lambo.  And I think BTC has a very bright future.p.s. and save the babies
2	1523113498	1	We are watching you very carefully, so behave or you will be out the door. 
3	1523114292	1	I dare you to kick me out
3	1523113689	1	Who is "we".  You and your imaginary friend?
4	1523113827	1	Well I commend your commitment to the act.Trolling in character as "the man". Actually haven't seen that one before.
4	1523113975	1	What kind of troll are you lol. You can't even discern an "announcement" from a guessed warning/opinion/hypothesis/possibility
5	1523114664	1	He's the man, maaaannn
5	1523114134	1	Please don't be insulting; I am no troll.   What I am stating are hard facts, given as a publicly announced warning.   I realize that some will not like such hard truths, but they are.     Sensible people act now will thank me later; the rest will shed bitter tears.
6	1523114629	1	Would they be 'bitter tears' of laughter?
7	1523115275	1	Quite possibly.  The insane have been known to laugh even while crying bitterly.   That will be the hodlers.
8	1523115439	1	Now why would a 1200% return make me cry?
6	1523114650	1	Hard facts of the past that you don't know yet if they will be hard fact of the future. Why double "they", don't panic already. Please, don't insult pure sensitiveness with pure ignorance, that's worse than blasphemy lmao
7	1523115363	1	Can't make any sense of what you just wrote.   Please learn to write properly.
