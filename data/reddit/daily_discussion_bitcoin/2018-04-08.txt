0	1523182079	5	Watch out for https://twitter.com/Protafield verified Twitter scammer impersonating Bitfinex.
0	1523185153	6	We're all waiting for the dumps after the last few days pumps. Haha.Although it does at least seem that price has stabilized. Maybe soon we will rise again! :) 
1	1523186581	3	I think the general cue given is that the bulls should walk slowly towards the goal/s instead of sprinting in order to preserve energy and liquidity. :) Possibly selling at strategic peaks to gain extra liquidity and let the price sink a bit before another upwards climb. If the selling pressure is still too strong then the bulls will have to wait for a better opportunity. Both bulls and bears appear to be continuously testing the waters for either direction.
1	1523186910	3	Recent pumps started after a dip at 6.5k which also occurred on april 1. Let’s see what happens when it hits that again, then when/if it touches 6.2k since that was the feb low - my spidey senses say bizniz is boomin 
0	1523201196	1	PSA: beware the dangers of margin trading and phenibut.I don't know ow what the fuck I was thinking...
1	1523202798	1	Buy and hodl! If I had just followed this advice, I'd be ahead still in this bear market.
2	1523203331	1	At the peak of the trade, it cost me roughly 1.5k to mine enough alts to trade for one Bitcoin. Today it's a little over 3k. All costs go to the power company.As far as buy and hodl goes, I good down to Bitcoins lowest likely prices. It's slow and painful but that's where I'm at.But if I can make successful trades, then I start actually makes some real money. And the more I have, the more I can make. How am I supposed to avoid that temptation?

0	1523181821	4	Groundhog Day!
0	1523187444	4	I think we might be about to see the first short squeeze in Bitcoins history.... I would love to see it happen in this markets on low volume. 
1	1523187859	1	I do hope shorts stay short until the next cycle. 
0	1523189349	5	If we could get volume to 20,000 today on GDAX and we move in an upward direction I will be happy.
1	1523189476	2	20k is too optimistic. Maybe by tomorrow
1	1523189916	1	Why get 100% volume of buying and selling, when you can get 50% of buying xD
1	1523190471	0	Maybe there are no sellers, which is why volumes are thin...
2	1523191345	-1	Way too many holders, people not participating just hoping and praying the price will go up.Sadly I can't see this mentality being broken ever, so many people preaching "HODL!!"
3	1523191609	2	I don't agree, look Bitcoin has to reach a maximum value at some point and the HODL crowd will release their reserves, this is the point at which Bitcoin becomes money.We have 1 maybe 2 of these parabolic moves left. But part of it is the HODL crowd moving into something else, most likely other crypto's. How far is it away ? Years. Two maybe three. Till then just work it as it is.  
4	1523192690	2	The Hodlers  of last resort will never sell though 
5	1523193347	0	I disagree. It's on this parabolic move or the next. 
6	1523195540	3	Check the wallets that havent moved since 2012
3	1523193490	1	trOOll
0	1523182553	3	trading voulume so low today bitfinex 29k and gdax 8.5K only, this is why bulls are not taking any risk
0	1523186128	3	I was wondering how different receive address is generated for same wallet every time!! As far as I know it is generated by hashing public key, how can 1 public key generate multiple addresses?!!! 
0	1523193358	3	First, if reports are to be believed, legendary investor George Soros was found to be investing in cryptocurrency. Now, Venrock, a 3 billion USD venture capital firm owned by storied American family, the Rockefellers, have taken to crypto. 
1	1523193768	-2	From what I heard he is not buying Bitcoin but he is going to short it and he has already made 1 billion shorting the British pound.
2	1523199798	1	In 1992!!!
2	1523195851	2	No he's definitely buying. Big investment incoming.
3	1523198204	1	Lol
2	1523198477	1	CME & CBOE order books and daily volume are miniscule compared to Bitfinex, GDAX, Bitmex.If he wants to trade a large quanty of long/short contracts, he will have to do so on either Bitmex or Bitfinex.Wonder what his screenname in Bitmex trollbox will be? ;)
0	1523200911	1	Hi I was wondering about buying 1000 USD worth if Bitcoin soon. Is now a good time, or should I wait? 
1	1523201037	1	Now is a lower risk time to buy.  Notice i said lower.   I would buy more if i could.   Just never more than you can afford to write off!  Then you'll never be truly stressed. 
1	1523201406	1	What chimi said, this market is hard as hell to predict. You could play it safe at there are some signals that suggest we may drop lower before breakout.But there also seems to signs that says the price is about to rise.  There seems to be quite a bit of market confusion ATM.Maybe just buy in smaller increments, that way, if the price rises or lowers you have some profits locked in.
2	1523205424	1	Alright thank you for the tip!
1	1523201466	1	Definitely wait for a few days. After a few positive days a lot of people seem to have forgotten that we’re still in a bear market. Zoom out to the 1 day chart to get some perspective. It is more probable that it will drop more then that it will rise.
1	1523207858	1	For some reason, it seems that every time someone gets paid on Friday, there is an increase after 5pm. It's like all the check to check people drop another 200 in bitcoin, causing the price to go up. It's only a few hundred, but it is technically going up. So, the best time it seems is a Thursday before a Friday payday.
0	1523204748	1	Gdax volume lmao
1	1523205269	1	and I thought it was low yesterday lol 
1	1523210159	1	What's the volume like on the other exchanges today?
0	1523198625	1	If we can go up $150 a day I will be a very happy man. 
1	1523199896	1	lol
2	1523200601	1	Why is that funny? 
3	1523201540	1	Cuz your a moonboy cliché
0	1523200291	1	The new owner of @Bitcoin is as mysterious and elusive as Satoshi himself.That account is a complete shit-storm fuck up right now - what a laugh!https://twitter.com/Bitcoin/status/982987272722186240
0	1523204515	1	6,800 then we're off to 8k
1	1523205604	1	Eh, more like sub 5k before we see 8k again. Moving averages are still pointing down.
0	1523204746	1	BUY!!!  It is the only way to save the babies.
0	1523189987	6	**Hi!, my name is Bob,... and I'm a HODLoholic**
1	1523199992	1	Hi Bob! 
1	1523203656	1	I'll be your support buddy.
2	1523203861	1	;-)
0	1523187230	2	This could be another rally to 11k. Then down again, of course :'''))
1	1523200960	1	That would make me so happy
0	1523200971	1	I want to believe, but the whole movement during the last couple of days looks very suspicious :/
1	1523201636	1	Looks normal to me, no one knows what the fuck to do.
2	1523202002	1	I know: HODL (and buy the dips).
3	1523203484	1	Or mine and trade the peaks. :)
1	1523202848	1	We hit bottom 2 months ago. Onward and upward!
2	1523207779	1	It was 8k two months ago. 
3	1523207815	1	Feb 5th we hit 5.8k.
4	1523207930	1	Huh. My graph says 6.8k. Maybe I am looking at the wrong chart. BRB
5	1523209925	1	It may have closed on the day at 6.8k, but the lowest point on Gdax was around 5,800. 
0	1523183540	3	hmm reading some calls for double bottom being confirmed, possible end of bear market, we'll see
1	1523183611	5	Aren't all bottoms double?  You'd look a bit silly with one arse cheek.
0	1523201587	1	Things are looking up, but we need to break through the $8.3K support point before we can breath a sigh of relief. Below that support point, we're still in pump and dump territory. Pump and dump whales have been operating within those prices, and need the vulnerability of those prices to be able to operate. A rise into $8K territory will take away that exploitable vulnerability, and could start bringing in the bulls.  $8.3K has been the last support we've seen above $8K. 
1	1523203815	1	I suggest we try and get past $7100 first. 
2	1523206061	1	Let's just skip that and move directly to $8300.
0	1523201127	1	Hey whales how about pumping BTC to an ATH again so we can all pull out of this shitstorm. 
1	1523206715	1	They used all their pump money keeping this thing from tanking completely.  All they have now is couch seat cushion money so maybe someday we'll see 7.5K again.
2	1523209656	1	Del
0	1523187185	1	Stay alert and attention please, MrManHimself almost finished his/her morning coffee. 
0	1523191184	1	I've been out of the loop for a while due to real life problems. But is Coinbase still shit? Should I be using something else now? It's been a while since I bought but I got my finances back in order so i'm ready again!
1	1523198043	1	Never had Problems with coinbase. However Use gdax with your coinbase acc
1	1523191946	1	Coinbase is pretty decent if u ask me
2	1523193930	1	Cant buy or sell to coinbase from my Bitpay App...so bc of a comm issue between the two my Bitcoin is trapped in my wallet...add to that the fees that Coinbase charge and the weeks it takes to get any kind of tech support from them, I'd say they are pretty crappy. Stick to Revolut or Kraken imho
1	1523195082	1	I've had no problems with coinbase. 
1	1523203613	1	Depends on how you feel about having you bank account randomly drained.To be fair, it's the cucks at visa, but still, I could have been fucked.
0	1523198335	1	SAVE THE BABIES!!!
0	1523203534	1	Seems that on the 1 Hr. chart someone has been gradually pumping this up by making huge buys.  Looks like slow-and-steady approach.  See if the price "sticks" and then hit it again like 12 hours later.  Of course hovering just inside of 7K they are going to have to fight if they want to keep it now.
0	1523205467	1	Pretty entertaining analysis of BTC here I wanted to sharehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58adTtYb1JI
1	1523211223	1	phooh.... that was like a PHD in charts... good stuff but not for a lazy Sunday afternoon, too much to take in. It will be what it will be :))
0	1523210764	1	PLEASE ITS FOR HW, does anyone have the “is this the top?” Meme? Where a stick figure thinks he has reached the top only to figure out there’s a lot more to go? 
0	1523211320	1	7000 Bitcoin sell wall on Bitfinex 
0	1523203583	1	seems like bullmarket started 
1	1523204447	1	What drugs are you on? 
2	1523206627	1	Apparently the best ones!
2	1523211266	1	Comment of the year :)
1	1523204283	1	It's just the usual pump and dump until we get past the $8.3K support point, then we may start seeing if we're back in a bull market. 
2	1523204494	1	I am not selling just curiousto know  why do you think $8.3k support level make bull run ..
2	1523204515	1	Dude, if all the myths were true then we wouldn't had kept the rise with such low volume. I think we're headed to 7.3k. But of course, no crystal ball. And those who sell aren't zooming out, are they
0	1523206463	1	If we hold onto 7k through Sunday, we might have a chance to 7.5k.  If we fall back to 6.5k before the end of day, it will be another week climbing back to 7k. 
1	1523206526	1	Based on what?
2	1523207490	1	Literally nothing. 
3	1523209155	1	Oh, same reason it went up.
3	1523210935	1	Are you guys serious?  No one knows, it's my personal opinion...Want me to make a youtube video and draw some lines through the chart to make it believable?  
1	1523207703	1	6.9 and falling :-(
0	1523207429	1	The EMA 1600 on the 1m chart has been a real support in the last 2 days. Everytime (3x) the price crashed below or near that, it bounced very quickly.Now it's the 4th crash below it. Let's hope it will bounce just as quickly.https://imgur.com/a/pkaCV
1	1523208771	1	Looking good. :-)I got the feeling that the bears are losing steam...
0	1523209316	1	So Rockefeller's and Soros's fund Venrock is dabbing its toes in crypto with CoinFund. Big killers finally turning around?
1	1523209793	1	Soros' fund will be "trading" which doesn't necessarily mean staying long or short, but sounds more like taking advantage of short term opportunities, i.e., over- and under-valued situations.
0	1523189919	-1	Could be a bluff, but I recently saw 6893 bitcoin on the sell side of Bitfinex. Even if it is mainly shorts, it is possible that bulls might have to retreat a bit to a lower price point. I could be wrong, both sides tend to bluff, I would just be extra careful out there.
1	1523190602	3	Pretty sure it was just a market maker. Someone bought 300 coins which caused an arbitrage opportunity. As soon as the prices from the other exchanges got to that price he cancelled the order. 
2	1523191109	2	That's possible, good point.
2	1523193393	1	What is a arbitrage opportunity? 
3	1523193631	3	Arbitrage is basically buying a security in one market and simultaneously selling it in another market at a higher price, profiting from the temporary difference in prices. This is considered riskless profit for the investor/trader.From InvestopediaSo in this case due to someone buying 300 coins in 1 go on Bitfinex the price on Bitfinex was temporally higher compared to the price on the other exchanges. So big parties which can trade without transaction costs (so called market makers) can make a (almost) riskless profit by selling on Bitfinex and simultaneously buying on one of the other exchanges.
4	1523203812	1	Idk how that can be riskless, it's hard as fuck to get the coins into another exchange fast enough to take advantage of the difference. And if you don't, you're stuck holding the coins. Granted if you're sure the market will move in your favor it's irrelevant. But then why go through the trouble of arbitration
0	1523198155	1	BUY!!!
0	1523197205	1	SELL!!!
