0	1523270812	16	Someone just decided that "nope, Bitcoin shouldn't recover". Impressive drop.
1	1523290642	1	Or a lot of people decided "I should sell at $7100."
1	1523279214	2	continue ze dump
0	1523268255	7	To the moon..
1	1523268278	2	To infinity and beyond!
2	1523268340	5	To a little bit below 7000 :(
3	1523268616	2	Right? Why can't we break free like Freddie Mercury? 
4	1523268705	4	Because one of them is dead, not sure about the other.
5	1523269024	2	And you knocked it right out of the park! 
3	1523268710	2	Whole market going down right now :( https://www.cryptomarketsite.com
0	1523269341	6	Holy crap!! Down $350 in minutes! That was interesting to watch on GDAX.
1	1523269956	4	Well, guess I made the right call to sell at 7120.Will buy again when it hits 6600.
2	1523285529	1	Yea but if it was $7450 today, you’d be in utter regret. That’s why you should have stop orders in a bearish market instead of expensive market orders.
2	1523270248	0	No you are reason why! 
3	1523271201	3	I sold because it was declining.  Why am i the reason?
4	1523272372	5	Because people don't seem to like that there are others who are able to make money on the way down, while they sit like a deer in the headlights - hoping and wishing for the market to make the money for them, rather than being proactive.
0	1523285315	1	Everything will be good in the end. And if it's not good then it's not the end. (read with indian accent)
1	1523285556	1	(read in Morgan Freemans voice)
1	1523286735	1	All izz well, all izz well (in Indian accent)
0	1523270046	4	Aaaand we are down (again)...
0	1523270919	6	Thou shall not pass!
0	1523269637	4	I wouldnt doubt if a large amount or a few millionaire keep buying bit coin. Sell when hit hits 7-8k then all dump at one time and keep doing it over and over to keep it in check.
1	1523281698	2	That strategy only works when enough volume exists selling to them at 6.7k and buying from them at 7k+. It's not happening. What is happening is a few large and longtime whales are divesting responsibly so as not to crash the market. You can tell because there isn't a perfect proportion of identical buys and sells at the alleged manipulation points, and we've only been inside the range you specify for a week and a half.
0	1523279589	4	What has been the longest bear market in Bitcoin?
1	1523280145	3	~400 days: http://www.habrador.com/p/bitcoin/
1	1523279814	1	2+ years
0	1523277255	10	Market manipulation like these are casting a dark shadow over cryptocurrencies market. I saw yesterday on Bitfinex some market spoofing around 6 p.m. UTC time.. why I am saying this? Because first of all, bitcoin came as a result on market manipulation, corrupt banking system and widespread injustice on financial market back in 2008.Recently, it was often heard that cryptocurrencies markets do not need a regulation, and it was raising a red flag to me. Because it is like saying we do not need cops.. well, guess who will come then, and who would rule? Yes, gangs and criminals.Well, with such liquid market and possible high gains, it was a call to those kinds of people.. and cryptocurrency society didn't do anything to regulate itself, but instead of that, YT is full of videos tagged with #Lambo, #toTheMoon, etc..I personally think this is a last call to regulate things properly, or hand over those markets to various sharks and people like Soros, Rotschild, Rockefeller and others. 
1	1523278143	13	-“crypto crowd” wanted unregulated markets, you got unregulated markets-You wanted wild wild west, you got wild wild west.This is everyman for themselves. Your version of free market capitalism. Do not bitch now that you have been taken advantage of. Deal with it.
2	1523278294	-1	I have never voted for this kind of market. Unregulated market means swimming with sharks, dealing with people who could outsmart (manipulate) or outgun the market. 
3	1523279413	10	You voted when you put your money's. Don't blame someone else. You took the decision to do this, no one else. 
3	1523278490	6	Yes you did. You voted with your dollars (or real money) when you entered crypto markets. Nobody forced you to enter this market. 
4	1523278621	-1	I voted with Euros, and in the EU, we are protected by regulators.I do understand that you value your freedom (of being unregulated/unprotected) more than your wallet, but that's you (or, you Americans).Your IRA tax authority will come to collect taxes from you, but you would still not ask for a protection from SEC/CFTC
5	1523278812	1	No cryptos are for fools. I would not touch it even at $1. You seem to be the one complainging about unregulated crypto markets. Obviously uou have been burned.
6	1523279241	0	Then why you are on this subreddit/topic? I presume you are in a crypto market..FYI, I entered into it, when btc was far far lower
7	1523279490	-1	I read newspapers, I follow finance, micro/macro economy, politics, market trends, cruptos etc.  Just because I comment on something doesn’t mean I recommend or embrace it. 
6	1523279792	0	Do you own a Lamborghini ? Nope. Hell of a lot of people who put $1 into Crypto do...
7	1523280301	2	Hell of a lot people won lottery every day by putting $1 into the game.
1	1523277596	8	This is NOT market manipulation. It's individuals following whatever trading algorithm makes them the most money. 100% legit.
2	1523278724	4	This guy gets it.
1	1523278308	9	You think the manipulation is only in Crypto's? It's everywhere. Everything is rigged. Everything is manipulated. 
2	1523278371	4	Which is not a valid argument.. it is called argumentum ad populom.
3	1523278853	3	You want a list of banks and fines for things like Libor ? 
4	1523278974	0	They are fined for that, and libor will be discontinued because of that..But, there was a strict regulation and due process that brought them to paying fines.
5	1523279193	3	Oh please man, HSBC had purpose made boxes so drug cartels could deposit their money easier. And when they get caught they get a slap on the wrist, like 1% or 2% of what they earned from the illegal activity. There is no such thing as strict regulation. 
6	1523279353	0	Seizing the rest of the money from the account was a nice substantial income for the government
7	1523279527	3	No it wasn't. They lost tax revenue, they spent millions on the investigations and they gave a insignificant fine. 
5	1523279388	1	That is a mere drop in the bucket to what is actually going on. Consider this: Do you think its really a personal vendetta that Trump has with Bezos, the richest man in the world, the biggest company not only in America but in the history of the world, or is it insider manipulation? If you were the richest mother fucker ever and wanted to buy some stock of your own company would you do it when it's riding an all time high or would you need some help to drive it down before you bought it up? Don't be stupid. Mr_P_Pui understands - it's all rigged and that's how you can succeed, by understanding the game. Some will never understand and they are the one's who become the cannon fodder for the big guns. 
6	1523279479	2	I am not following Trump's case with Amazon..
3	1523278944	1	http://uk.businessinsider.com/worlds-top-20-banks-misconduct-fines-worth-264-billion-2017-8
1	1523277876	3	Lol manipulation? It was shitty volume someone wanted to sell. 
1	1523277882	3	The problem is your still thinking in fiat rather than bitcoin.If you have one bitcoin out of the 21 million available, it doesn't matter what anybody else does in the market you still have the same one bitcoin.This is why it doesn't need regulation.
2	1523278042	2	Your taxes and utility bills are still being payed in fiat currencies.. USD is a legal tender, while BTC is not..Therefore, in a real life outside of cryptocurrency market, fiat currency is a real money.Which means, once you would need to cash out your bitcoin and pay for the gas, it will be a substantial difference if 1 btc would worth 1000 usd or 10.000 usd
3	1523278790	-1	If you have ever found yourself needing to cash out your bitcoins to pay your bills, your mistake is that you have invested in more than you should have.This is why you probably want regulations to save you from your own mistakes.
4	1523278907	6	yeah, shame on people wanting to use a cryptocurrency as currency!
5	1523281622	1	Yeah, basically."I mailed cash to another continent and my package was lost in transit!"Right tool for the right job. If you know your bills can't be paid in crypto, why would you expect to be able to?
2	1523279413	-1	Dude, there's life outside the basement. Your parents pay their mortgage (hint, including the basement) with their hard-earned FIAT. That's the reality.Most people get into crytos to make money. As in dollars. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3	1523281223	3	According to the bitcoin zealots, it's only a matter of time before the whole world realizes that bitcoin **is** the real money.   LOL!
3	1523280406	1	If your suggesting that I live in my parent's basement, you are mistaken.I've already paid off my mortgage and that of my parents.
0	1523275294	12	To all of you saying these massive dumps that occur within a few minutes are normal market movements, you are wrong. Unless you consider market wide manipulation by groups with deep pockets to be 'normal'. This would be illegal in almost every other market. The same people probably flick through these threads laughing at everyone's stupidity and how easy it is for them to make money. 
1	1523277266	2	Of course its manipulated. That's why it's so easy to make money by thinking like a whale, buying low and getting tf out before a whale shits on your dreams. Bear market= hold CASH. Trade only to sell it all back once things look too good for the bears. Go ahead and downvote me but deep inside you know its true. I love bitcoin, what it stands for and want to see it replace fiat but until that happens, I'll make some money. It's a better strategy then bitching about losses. Nothing I can do about the state of the market. And since very few are willing to weather the storm and hodl at this point (volume speaks volumes) you just have to go with the trends until we reach capitulation and turn this bitch around.
1	1523275517	1	Dude, it moved up strongly as a push to get the 6hr short term moving average over the long term, when that didn't happen everybody ducked out to buy back lower.  I was one of those people.  It's normal market movement.
2	1523275938	2	Well I'm not a trader, so I could be wrong. In which case the market is now totally dominated by short term traders (also a bad sign). Though history tells us if there's on opportunity somewhere for exploitation and there are people with the means to do it then it's almost certainly being done. Surely you can't disagree with that? 
3	1523276394	2	It's not totally dominated by short term traders.  There are enough holders to keep the price above 6000 when all the day traders duck out.  But otherwise I do agree.
3	1523276959	1	Why is that a bad thing?   Bitcoin is about making money, and without FOMO suckers the only way to make money is in pump-and-dump trading.
1	1523276357	1	If you can't handle to risks freedom brings don't invest in crypto. There are plenty of heavily "protected"/ regulated markets to invest in. We're all trying to manipulate the price in our favor. You want to ban the short sellers to manipulate the price to go your direction. What will you say when DEX use proliferates?
1	1523275517	0	If you had deep pockets you would laugh now. Because every deep pocket knows law is written to protect deep pockets from nibling piranas like we are haha
0	1523283001	6	These pumps and dumps are absolutely disgusting. Another reason to hate humanity.
1	1523284460	1	If you're a hodler just relax, it's all good cuz youre in it for the long run. And if you're a trader, than that's great.Honestly, I don't see the problem. Come back in 2 to 4 years and claim your bookshelf full of lambos.
2	1523285305	1	Manipulation can destroy a market no matter how useful the product. 
2	1523285627	1	Can you kill the lambo joke? Please. Not to mention there are other sexier cars like Ferrari’s, McClaren etc..
3	1523286223	1	No cannot kill the lambo joke, this is r/Bitcoin damnit!!Obviously I'd prefer a Ferrari as that have greatly superior handling and I actually know how to drive them and drive for a sport. But that doesn't change the fact that this is r/Bitcoin man.
1	1523285032	1	It's not pump and dump.  It's market fluctuations as a result of the interaction between short and long term moving averages on various time scales.  The market oscillates at different frequencies that can be seen on the different charts.  The base oscillation is on the 1m time scale which is 20-40 dollar fluctuations.  The next oscillation is on the 5m time scale with 40-100 point swings.  The next on the 15m time scale swings by 100-200 points, and on the 1h time scale, you'll see oscillations like we just had around 200-500 points.  We haven't seen an upswing on the 6h time scale (which may swing 500-2000 points or more) for a while, but we're nearing the bottom of the curve on that.  To see the curves, look at short and long term moving averages on each chart.  When the short term average crosses over the long term average on the 1hr chart is the time to buy (this will happen when the short term average on the 15m, 5m, and 1m charts are all above their long term averages).  Knowing when to sell is trickier, but basically it's when it's clear the short term average on the 6hr chart will not cross the long term average on that chart (because if that happens and you sold early, the market will jump 500-2000 points up and you won't ride it).  Now, watch the market for a few days and see if it doesn't all make sense, and if you can't predict if it will go up or down at any given time.
1	1523284557	1	Why? They are disgusting you if you are looking for short term gains without being on right timing. But holding is actually much worse for bitcoin as it reduce circulating supply which makes price even more volatile.
2	1523284977	1	You are hunting down my posts and saying more retarded shit by the second. Lower supply does not equal higher volatility. Bitcoin can be broken down to satoshis. You really need to do some learning before talking.
1	1523285077	1	Hating humanity for market volatility is a sign you are taking this a little too seriously
2	1523286373	1	Manipulation, not volatility. 
3	1523289865	1	People often call it manipulation when it doesn't do what they wanted it to do
4	1523290199	1	"5% drops in 20 minutes are totally organic. It reflects a 5% drop in people's trust in the underlying technology and people's valuation in bitcoin as a store of value"\- you
5	1523290453	1	You invent quotes for people aswell as hate humanity for volatile markets?You may need a hobby :)
6	1523290536	1	So are you honestly attributing 5% / 20 minute drops to volatility? Is that your position here?
0	1523286004	1	Just remember, when someone states that BTC has no intrinsic value- That you the holder of BTC is the intrinsic value as opposed to a group of people putting their trust into another institution which is completely necessary for government to work. BTC gives YOU a way to check all of that.
1	1523290256	1	Just remember, when someone states that btc has no intrinsic value - they are right. 
2	1523290383	1	where’s the intrinsic value in a dime?
3	1523290546	1	It's a form of currency accepted entirely  throughout the wealthiest country in the world? Its also relatively stable. 
4	1523290847	1	Its made of cupronickel and is backed by the Fed. The intrinsic value is trust in the Government. My point is cupronickel isn’t worth shit. But we trust it and use it for trade. If the value of BTC isn’t worth shit then it would reflect the value of it and more importantly the persons holding it. Right now it’s close to being worth 7k. I’d say the people holding it have intrinsic value.
4	1523293755	1	BTC has no intrinsic value
3	1523290802	1	Lol. Keep trying. Answering a question with a question, is not an answer. If I have to explain the history of USD (and it's "intrinsic value") to you, you should definitely stay far away from crypto. 
4	1523293111	1	TL;DR Doesn't know the answer. lol
4	1523294491	1	What question? You didn't ask any question. Keep trying.
1	1523297996	1	well, I am buying through an intermediary brokerage service like Gemini or Coinbase, and technically, I imagine that they really own it? Like, they could take it from us at any time (although illegal)
1	1523291058	1	Wow buddy!   Slow down on all that weed!
2	1523291261	1	I don’t smoke weed. I am trying to generate a healthy debate. But the result is always an insult in one form or another. It shows that you are easily hurt when you can’t justify a strong point.
3	1523292261	1	OK, buddy, here it is, just for you:  **you** are the intrinsic value of the BTC that you hold.    And it's only a matter of time before all those around you realize that.    How's that?But perhaps you could cut out the "middle": since **you** are the value, why bother with BTC? After all, **you** are always **you** no matter what.
4	1523292626	1	Again, you’re missing the whole point. It shows that you really do not have any substantial points to make regarding your views. Again, you’re just as emotional as the hodler that hopes BTC reaches 100k by October- Your no different than they are.
5	1523293700	1	If you say so, friend.   If you say so.   Now I'll leave you to make use of and enjoy your intrinsic value in bitcoin, which should be easy because it just happens to be you!  But don't forget my excellent advice: go easy on whatever you are loading up on.
6	1523293975	1	No worries there. I am real about my investment and know exactly what I am doing. Put all your faith and trust in the Government and hope and pray that they’ll dig all of us out of debt. Because your intrinsic blind faith in fiat currency is what is truly wrecking us all.
7	1523295312	1	Unfortunately, until the day that bitcoin fully arrives to save us, we will continue to rely on fiat to pay for the goods and services that we need.   We will continue to get into debt for some of things (mortages, education, etc.) and the government will continue to get into debt to provide us with numerous services that society need to function.Of course, once we all realize that bitcoin is so much better, and all of us have bitcoins, then it will be an entirely new world.   We will immediately use bitcoins to settle all outstanding debts, get rid of governments, get rid of banks and become our own bankers, etc.  Almost like paradise.  With the bonus that each person will be his own intrinsic bit-coin value.   I can't wait!Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go for lunch.   Sadly, I will have to be for that in real money (fiat), even though my intrinsic value is outstanding (with or without bitcoin).   Later!
8	1523295692	1	Again! LOL! You’re completely missing the point! Not at one point in time have I ever mentioned that I believe that BTC will be the World premier currency. Not at all- The POINT is that the intrinsic value of fiat lies into the trust of the FED. The Intrinsic value of BTC lies with the individual person. Group think/individual think. Now- we are in extreme debt and quickly becoming unsustainable. What happens when it does? WW3. Gold has intrinsic value. it is what it is a fundamental element on the periodic table-nothing more nothing less but what an individual is willing to pay for it. BTC follows these same rules.
4	1523294223	1	Looks to me like **you** are the one who needs to slow down on the weed because **you** are the one who-oohhh, I just realized you're MrMan/WunderBaah tolling. Haha
3	1523293720	1	BTC has no intrinsic value
4	1523294064	1	Maybe so- not one person has explained where the intrinsic value of the dime falls. Besides the Fed.
0	1523271039	8	The manipulation isn’t even subtle at this point. Just an organic plunge out of nowhere with no bad news right? 
1	1523271736	6	Just like the organic price spikes for no reason
2	1523271763	3	Correct. 
2	1523272018	2	Show me where it spiked 300 in minutes 
3	1523273245	7	Like 3 days ago and 2 days before that LOL
4	1523274692	-2	Show me. What day and what time did it spike 300 in minutes. You full of shit fuck. 
5	1523275741	1	lol someone’s cranky
6	1523276273	1	No. Asking for proof for a claim should be a minimal request. Lots of claims with very little support in this thread every day. 
7	1523277956	1	yeah I wasn’t talking about the request lol
5	1523287934	1	You can't look at graph of last 7 days you retarded fuck?
6	1523288052	1	Yes. Nowhere does it pump $300 in MINUTES. Stupid asshole.
2	1523277919	1	What is an **organic** spike?
1	1523278169	1	Yes. The market volume has been pathetic. Didn't take much selling to shave off some. 
1	1523271793	-1	You must be new here...
1	1523271803	-12	A $300+ climb or drop is very common.I was expecting to find people with good experience here.  Disappointing.
2	1523271896	7	A $350 plunge in a matter of minutes is not “common”Yeah its happened before but to say its commonplace without any bad news is ridiculous. Its not the dollar amount its the abruptness of it with lack of any real reason. Somebody or some group are trying to keep the price down. It was gradually rising with what looked like healthy movement then out of nowhere its smacked down. 
3	1523272782	1	Gradually rising? What about Friday where it shot up about as much as it just dropped?
3	1523275739	1	Is this sudden movement/ price manipulation a new phenomena that only affected Bitcoin after the all time high value, or has it been a part of Bitcoin trading for much longer?
3	1523272803	0	Seriously ...?Well, a simple glance at this week alone showed that it has happened a few times.  7 to 7.3, 7.3 to 6.8, 6.8 to 6.55, etc.
2	1523271943	4	Oh, sorry we disappointed you squire.  Would you like me to take your horse sir - when you've finished fucking it of course sir
3	1523273408	-1	Well, your post shows that you are just a novice with money you can't afford to lose and a foul mouth.Grow some balls - if you can't deal with a meagre $300+ swing, don't play.
4	1523274073	2	Heh.  You have no idea do you?
2	1523274951	0	They are around, but there is a reason this thread was made. I thought it was a good thing myself when it started. Now it's a pimple on the face of our subreddit, wasting one our good stickies.Edit: You know what, just because I don't enjoy it anymore doesn't mean it still isn't better than the alternative. I think I'll just start avoiding this thread. It's easy and my own damn responsibility.
0	1523269292	3	ripperoni 4k lets go
0	1523271939	8	I hate to say it because I’ve been in crypto for over a year and believe decentralized currency can better the world’s concept of money but the everyday masses and their money will not return until this blatant obvious manipulation by a few somehow ends. The market is being decimated by it. If some sort of self regulatory body and at the very least a few restrictions on manipulation isn’t put in place the market will not go mainstream and flourish. 
1	1523281248	0	Regulated markets get manipulated by whales too. You seemed pretty happy when the market was going another way, but now that a few large whales are exiting and keeping price suppressed it's a problem?Sounds like someone is frustrated with their investment and lashing out. Just relax and hold on for the ride. This thing isn't a get rich quick scheme and if you got in when you say you did you are up so much that you have nothing to complain about.
0	1523278639	5	I couldn’t lose more money in a short amount of time if I were at an upscale gentlemen’s club. I went to bed feeling upbeat.
1	1523279322	3	Technically you're not losing that money, you're investing in a short period of relaxation and pleasure. 
1	1523285438	1	Lemosine you should be far more defensive. Install a stop order with $150-$200. Why would you go to bed letting the whales in control of your wealth? Place stop orders to cut your losses.
1	1523279895	0	If you went to bed feeling that way because you got to dip your stick, then it was money well spent.
2	1523281780	1	If you are paying for sex, you already lost, no matter what your bank balance says.Winning = paying *with* sex. You may have to take my word on this one.
3	1523283667	1	You're paying for sex on way or another... just give it time and you'll understand. :)
4	1523284661	1	Nah man. My situation is enviable to say the least.From your comment, I would expect that you are paying for sex in some way, but perhaps you have went [next-level on the whole game](https://i.imgur.com/p7kWOUO.png).
5	1523287811	1	Big assumptions there man. XD big assumptions!
6	1523287991	1	One good turn deserves another.
0	1523269688	2	At least the volumes are back...
0	1523282012	2	i've been away on a world tour fudding other crypto sub reddits... what have I missed here?

0	1523283129	2	I don't like to have an upset tummy over dinner with these prices wobbling up and down, so what I do is have a quick look at this 8 year span logarithmic scale before heading off to my club    :)http://www.habrador.com/p/bitcoin/_img/bitcoin-price-log.png
1	1523283306	3	thing that scares me about this chart is that it may correct all the way down to 1k.  even though i feel like that'd be impossible
2	1523283409	2	 Nothing is impossible. I set my sell all at 5.9k if it go’s there I am 100% out and will never look back again.
3	1523283810	2	i find it hard to believe BTC is going to die at this point.  Huge amounts of money has been invested.  Coinbase, Gemini, other exchanges, miners, conferences, etc.  Maybe the price crashes and gets super scary but i see it from the perspective that its the birth of a new industry 
3	1523284199	1	Why be greedy - why not simply hold at this price?
3	1523283660	0	but what if you do look back and its 40k?
4	1523284346	1	He's not going to look back. He's smart enough to know it'd wreck him to find out he could have bought at 40k and then sold at 5.9k instead of 20k.
3	1523286234	1	$5.9K is such a cowardly price. The only reason you set that price is because that’s the Feb. 05 bottom. But do you even realize the total crytocurrrency market cap is about $25 billion less than that Feb. 05 bottom? Technically, you should be out now since overall market cap is far more indicative than Bitcoin’s price. The $5.9K price is completely arbitrary. Bitcoin’s next bottom could be $4.2K or $6.3K. For you, if Bitcoin bottoms at $5.9K again (which it won’t) and then springs back up to $40K, you’ve lost big. This is why there are only 3 types of winners in this bear market: (1) the traders who set buy-stop-orders, (2) the whales and (3) the HODLers. Everyone else will be a loser including yourself who lose faith in Bitcoin once it hits some arbitrary low that was established based on nothing. And I doubt you will be out. You’re an emotional dramaqueen so you’ll definitely be back once Bitcoin is bullish again.
4	1523286450	1	Well, you’re somewhat right. But I will still be leaving with a sizable profit. If it reaches my set trigger point. But regardless, thx for snapping me out of my funk. I’ll try and remain positive and keep from posting personal strategy plans.
2	1523284047	1	Well.  It is a point of interest.  There's nothing to stop this chart reversing.  But mathematically, with such wild swings, there is *some* justification using a chart like this to smooth things out.Who knows?

0	1523296841	1	Trading Analysis:That long flat bit today is a slightly higher than that long flat bit the other day:https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitstamp/btcusdBullish!!!
0	1523296922	1	Is the price in jeopardy of dropping? After having failed to sustain long enough above $7K, and being able to break the $7.2K support point, it's dropped back below $6.8K again. It hasn't broken below the $6.4K support point, but if it can't stay above that support point, it could start a new downward trend to the $5.5K support, and possibly lower. 
1	1523297674	1	Yes. No. Maybe.
0	1523269444	3	large scale manipulation...silly market...
0	1523273371	3	Not sure why most in here are against stop losses. Everyone who had it set at 7k saved themselves a nice bit of coin.
1	1523273584	4	And will have more Bitcoin when they buy in. I seriously think people here don’t know or aren’t willing to learn how to use it.
2	1523274035	1	and if you're unlucky it falls to 6'950 and then goes back to 7'400  resulting in a nice bit of coin loss.
0	1523276383	4	https://imgur.com/a/AEECbMy first TA and price prediction. What do you guys think?
1	1523276931	1	Lol 😆
1	1523277203	1	That's the one I'm going to use :)
0	1523276646	1	Am I the only one perfectly fine with the price staying at these levels? That way I can buy more now while its low. I'm confident that bitcoin will be worth a lot more some time in the future and I'm patient enough to wait for that. The fundamentals have not changed, we havn't even had any serious fud in a while, in fact weve had a lot of good news.
1	1523278187	1	Think you missed India 
1	1523279208	1	So you're OK with the market staying at these levels until you've bought enough that you're ready for it to go up.  Please show me the magic button you plan on pressing so it will go up when you're ready.  
2	1523282493	1	The magic button is called time. We've only been here in this range for less than 2 weeks.
0	1523280646	4	So I just read that George soros is manipulating the market...... Great.

2	1523290413	1	That's prolly why "positively" xD
3	1523291353	1	It is very unfortunate we didn't cross over there, though.
0	1523293101	1	Well my holdings have officially halved. Great. 
1	1523296753	1	You only have half as much Bitcoin? How did that happen?
2	1523297067	1	Half as much GBP as I invested initially if I sell now 
3	1523297515	1	Quick! Sell, or you won't realize your loss.
0	1523286475	1	I'm sick of hearing all this absolute shit about manipulation and "bad news" making the price drop. These pump and dumps is just normal day trading combined with people that have never invested before shitting themselves only to buy back in later, rinse and repeat. You're making it so easy for the rest of us to make money on these swings when you know half the market will panic sell at a $100 drop in price.
1	1523286638	1	Easy there BHSL, it's all going to be ok.
1	1523286938	1	Yeah, its great -- been easy money shorting.
2	1523287914	1	Every time someone writes about easy money trading this market: either they are just talking shit and not really trading, or they got lucky once or twice and will be burnt later. It's not easy money. It's hard.
3	1523293668	1	This is correct. 
3	1523293983	1	True, I always make money on my trades but I feel like I'm just making lucky guesses and not really reading the market which means sooner or later I'm going to get burned.That's all fine, but question is, can I win more than I loose. Idk, just feels like gambling with better odds.
3	1523288695	1	Didn't become interested until after the bubble burst, but, actually, it has been easy shorting Bitcoin since early January. In fact, it's become boringly predictable.
0	1523270546	4	Unless something big happens in Bitcoin, this is just going to keep going down.
1	1523271969	1	Nah... its called a “Bear market”. Normal price cycle, look at previous parabolic spikes in Bitcoin price history. Nothing strange whatsoever.
0	1523276630	4	Ok everyone before you flip a lid we are not done on the down side and on the TA we have not fully formed a double bottom til 6k.  Can't take the heat stay out of crypto
1	1523276857	1	It might stabilize here and make another run at the 6hr moving average crossover.
0	1523273571	2	What just happened to the price? It dropped like $600 in a matter of moments - who sold so much and how much was sold?
1	1523273986	1	600?
1	1523282199	1	Keep an eye on [this.](http://bitcoinity.org/markets/coinbase/USD)The line is the current price.The bars in the background are the volume being sold. You can see that right after the price broke 7100, a ton of BTC was sold (or bought- can't have one without the other), bringing the price down.I don't know who sold. It seems to have happened simultaneously across all exchanges (Bitfinex GDAX Bitstamp Kraken CEX.IO HitBTC itBit, at the top of that page, let you view different exchanges). This makes it seem like a lot of people sold. No way to be sure.You can tell how much was sold from the chart. Around 175,000 BTC moved on GDAX to cause that price drop, if I'm reading it correctly.
1	1523274097	0	Because people are stupid and think if it goes up 400 dollars it will keep going up. 
0	1523273575	2	Bitcoin just dropped by $350 .... any idea what happened 
1	1523273737	6	More selling than buying 
2	1523282367	2	> More selling than buyingHow would that even work?
1	1523273962	1	Bull trap
1	1523277952	1	Selling happened 
1	1523279412	1	it was 6700 a day ago, it's called pump n dump 
1	1523289946	1	The rise was a buy in when the short term moving average on the 1hr chart crossed the long term moving average.  Big buy in at that point because everybody was hoping to push the 6hr short term moving average past the long term, which would lead to a bigger jump.  It didn't cross, so when that was clear, everybody sold to buy back lower.
1	1523274213	1	George Soros has arrived!
2	1523285882	1	It’s not George Soros, you idiot. It’s you being misled by news article that Soros started investing in crypto currency when he hasn’t even touched it. Soros is only worth $8 billion, of which he doesn’t not plan to invest even 1% of that. Most Soros would invest is $80 million which would not affect Bitcoin’s price the slightest.
0	1523278622	2	It failed to break resistance, that's the trigger of all the weak hands. It will be fine, relax.
1	1523279661	5	It's not fine. Since it failed to break resistance, it's going to break support.
2	1523280197	2	So we're all in agreement ? Something is going to break ?

1	1523283881	1	they are trying to test the low we already had and potentially achieve 6200
2	1523285877	1	so, why did they lifted it up to 7,200 during the weekend?
1	1523283807	-1	> Any idea what those manipulators at Bitfinex are trying to do?Uh, make money like the rest of us? Edit: format fail containing hard truths XD
2	1523284157	1	Quote fail! LolEdit: who's the dick that down voted me for that. I was just pointing it out lol. Could it really bother you so much? ;)
0	1523284679	1	See a lot of ppl claiming price manipulation and the may be right based on what we saw on bitfinex.But I'd like to remind people that it's common place for day traders to short following bad news, especially if we're at a Shakey breakout. The news from Pakistan is likely what caused this. plus, India is still in recent mind, all this is probably what's giving the shorters the courage to sell.
1	1523285129	1	Pakistan? I really seriously doubt that. Even if it was the case and people dumped Bitcoin for this reason its a reason to be pissed. Banks banning something they cant control and is against their own interest is the LEAST somebody could expect to happen.Bitcoin makes it so we can transact without having to use a bank or government! What?? Banks and Governments are banning it? OMG SELL. How fucking retarded.
2	1523285447	1	Margin traders aren't selling because they are scared. They are just getting on a price dropping so they can sell and then buy back at a lower price.When a market has a large amount of margin traders, they will have a large impact on the price and then this effect is amplified.Since we lost a lot of the new investors, based on what I see as far as volume goes, a lot of the market movement is comprised of traders right now. Bitcoin is currently a margin traders paradise. That's why you keep seeing 6.6k to 7.2k and then back again. Until we have more people investing again, it's going to be like this.
1	1523285197	1	What news from Pakistan
0	1523286411	1	What are the current transaction times like? I’ve been waiting for over an hour and still unconfirmed. I thought this issue had been resolved. 
1	1523293381	1	Transaction time depends on the fee you pay and how many others are willing to pay more. How much fee did you pay? 
2	1523293431	1	Thx. I worked out that I can increase the fee. It’s all good now
0	1523292614	1	**Come on Bulls, show us you are still alive!**
1	1523297853	1	Don't forget, the banking industry wants this to fail as does the US Government because any sort of global currency is bad for the US Banking system. Fear of change causes us to remain in the Stone Age. I would not be surprised if hidden actors are purposefully shorting it to bankrupt the currency on purpose.
0	1523270825	3	Until I discovered this message board I had no idea the Bitcoin world was in this state. Seems like everyone who hasn't made money in the last 2 minutes is suicidal. You lot should try forex. You wait a week for a 0.5% move at 50:1. EurUsd hasn't moved more than 30 cents in a decade. Or gold, wait 10 years for few percent gain. 
1	1523271886	1	People got recked really hard when Swiss national bank decided out of nowhere to give up the CHF-EUR pegging two years ago.People ended up with highly leveraged trades being executed with hundredthousands of Euros of debt. If I remember right CHF fell from 1,2 EUR to 0,8 EUR. Lawsuits are pending till today.
1	1523271041	0	[deleted]
2	1523271409	2	In the coins you're not 50:1, so you can't get a margin call. I find that quite less risky. 
0	1523273039	2	This is good for bitcoin.
0	1523293504	1	It may not be 5000, but i told yall yesterday to expect another massive drop..  but you downvoted me.  People dont listen, take these crazy up and down swings to your advantage, buy low sell high, rinse repeat..  whoevers manipulating the market is giving everyone a chance to play and make money.  Holding is obviously a bad deal right now.
1	1523298082	1	Well the thing is (Yes downvote me all if you want) many people here just do not understand how markets work.They think TA is bullshit and blame whales for manipulating the price every time it drops. The drop we see right now is just natural market movement. Remember 2013 Price droped from 1200 to 200 and could not get up again until 2015.Right now the weekly chart is showing extremly bearish signals and we are up for another 4 weeks of going down. But eventually everything is going to line up, we are going to hit a resistance line and we are going to go up again. If you want to know we have one at 5k, 3900 and 1300.These drops and then rises are just something you have to be able to deal with if you are trading bitcoin.The fact that bitcoin does not give a fuck about bad news does also mean it does not give a fuck about good news  (i am speaking of long term development the China ban was not able to crash it for long just as the G20 news were not able to bounce it for long) .Or that it is not bound to things like a huge company or backed by a goverment. Long term this is good and will lead to bitcoins success but short term it is one of the reasons we have so much volatility. I am a bitcoin long term believer but in the shortterm there is just nothing bullish to be seen in the bitcoin price. Now you can downvote me and tell me how wrong i am in the meantime i am going to trade and increase my bitcoin stash just how i did very succsesfully since the beginning of the year. 
0	1523274533	1	I normally have it set to only trigger if it dips $300 below the current price.  I would be ok.  At the lowest I would do it at $150 below current price. As a result I was fine on this dip. Waiting to see which way it will go and then will buy back in.
0	1523274859	1	Okay?

1	1523283831	3	lol just scan it with the antivirus or use virtual machine, if you are super paranoid 
2	1523284102	1	Haha antivirus' are complete garbage, who's going to infect a PC with a virus they know will be caught.
3	1523284358	1	as far as i know the whole point of the Nano is you can plug it into Any computer even if its loaded with viruses.  Because of the design  viruses can't affect the Nano.  I could be wrong, but that's what i read and why i bought it
4	1523285026	1	Yes.
4	1523284999	1	I know, but they have been hacked before. I'm sure it's safe, but do you want to be sitting there with the realization that all your coins are gone and all you had to do was find a computer you could trust?$250 at Staples for a shit laptop running a live os like tails and then you never have to worry or question it. Like buying insurance for a one time fee.
1	1523285405	1	I never use my hardware wallet in any computer I haven't smashed to pieces with a sledgehammer, poured gasoline over and incinerated.It's starting to get a bit expensive on the hardware side, but I think it's worth it.
1	1523284330	1	What's the likelihood there is something on that machine that could interrogate a Ledger?
2	1523284678	1	I have never noticed any suspicious activity indicating my pc might have been infected. I know all the softwares I installed. 
1	1523283844	0	No, you should never use anything you aren't 100% certain of for anything crypto related, regardless of how unhackable people claim the tech is.

0	1523290215	1	Lots of good money there shorting BTC. Don't get mad, use this knowledge to your advantage. 
1	1523290630	1	What do you guys mean with "shorting BTC"
2	1523290764	1	Selling and re-buying at lower price
3	1523292570	1	That is NOT what shorting is.   shorting is when you borrow a coin from an exchange with the understanding that you MUST return that coin at some point.When you have possession of the coin, you sell it, say for $15,000 USD.  Two months later,  you buy a coin on the open market for $7,500 and give it back to the exchange.  You sold high and bought lo and made $7,500.
3	1523290964	1	K thx
3	1523291295	1	Is it possible to do this without paying fees? Coinbase charges each transaction from fiat to crypto and vice versa.
4	1523293680	1	It is not, you must pay regular buy and sell fees as well as interest. So you can't just short and long 100 Bitcoin's on the 10$ mark and make $1000 each time. You have to make enough to cover the fees and still make a profit.
5	1523295034	1	Cheers. 
4	1523292375	1	Coinbase doesn't charge for their exchange, only the app and wallet. GDAX uses Coinbase login and if you learn to use it, it's free. Limit orders, at least.

0	1523294578	1	Remember: $180 / $1,200 x $20,000 = $3,000. You ain't seen nothing yet.
1	1523295094	1	Remember: Bitcoin today is not what it was in 2013 nor has the equivalent of Mt Gox happened (yet). 
2	1523295179	1	That's why I weighted it. It wasn't Mt Gox, it was fear of government intervention.
3	1523295618	1	I dunno, I wasn't on the scene then, but from what I heard, Mt Gox was a pretty huge contributor to the crash. It would be like Coinbase taking every bodies Bitcoins today and running. 
4	1523296078	1	I was there and Mt Gox gave an initial sharp fall in price to maybe $800 but the long tail all the way down to $180 was fear of US/Chinese or US+Chinese government intervention plus the idea that nobody was interested in something like bitcoin and nobody ever would.
3	1523295742	1	Fear of government intervention has been here since it started. 
4	1523296322	1	True but we have been extremely lucky with the US government. How the bitcoin price could rise so much after the Chinese government banned all exchanges is still a mystery to me.
5	1523297537	1	Making things "illegal" increases their value. Which is why "banning" things doesn't work.It **creates** incentive. 
6	1523297878	1	Makes sense but I expected first a huge dip in price.

0	1523282856	1	Price keeps re-crashing after a spike because a lot of people are still desperate to get out after the big crash at the start of the year. Look for spikes 'n crashes for the next 12-18 months until the new-buyer community stops fearing bitcoin will go to zero. 
1	1523283035	6	1000 people dont cash out in a 15 minute window. Its obvious price manipulation.
2	1523283912	1	yes, capt. obvious
3	1523284419	1	Did you even read the post that I replied to? Guy claimed that everybody is cashing out vs manipulation. Captain dickface.
4	1523284731	1	Janeway here.
2	1523284327	1	Here's another take: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/09/bitcoin-tanks-below-7000-down-6-percent-in-two-hours.htmlI doubt that it is taxes. Why so sudden?  And if the selling is "manipulation" than so was the buying that made the spike. 
2	1523284795	1	Really? On stockmarket you can have several thousand orders placed in a few seconds. So I do not think you know what financial market looks like to write such nonsense. 
3	1523284895	1	I was a stockbroker. You are a moron. If you think that 1000 people flooded in to sell Bitcoin within a 15 minute window after super low volume for hours with NO news catalyst then you have no idea what you are talking about.
4	1523291742	1	I don't see why people are so up in arms about price manipulation. Of course there is manipulation. It's a permissionless trustless system, it's basically designed for people to try to game it. It happens in the stock market, and crypto doesn't have all those regulations. Whales can only control the weather though. They can't do much about the climate, other than hurting investor confidence. History has thus far shown that bitcoin increases in value, and we don't have a compelling reason to believe it won't keep doing that.
0	1523283161	1	tbh bitcoin was close to breaking 7.5k. It ran out of steam and fell short.
1	1523284055	1	Fell roughly within a lot of people's projections. Needed one more leg down or so the story goes. But lately, word on the street is a lot of big money peeps are buying up BTC from OTC kiosks.  I'm personally holding off on buying anymore Bitcoin as I've exhausted all the fiat I'm willing to put in. But Nick from Datadash seems to think this is a good time to accumulate more. 
2	1523285962	1	Why on Earth would they do that? The fees are terrible.
3	1523286218	1	Buying OTC? If you're some bloke with millions worth of Bitcoin to buy, you're not going to buy it off Gdax. For larger volumes, always better to buy it OTC.
4	1523287888	1	I thought they always had much higher fees doing that. But I guess idk, there's no places  buy OTC here.
5	1523288023	1	It'd be a bad deal for a buyer to try to throw $ at Gdax only to discover that even a $10,000 purchase is causing the price to skyrocket. Ever try buying up a lot of a low cap coin on Binance and gotten really mad at how people started freaking out and raising the price? That's not a situation buyers wants.  OTC purchases mean the price is way more predictable. And the rumors I'm hearing is that anyone who isn't like JP Morgan or Morgan Stanley in having bought back in 2017 when Bitcoin was where it is now is buying it up via OTC sales.
6	1523289483	1	aw yes, tired. Lol forgot the effect larges buys have on the price. Makes much more sense now that you've stated the obvious. Haha

1	1523274404	0	Admitted it's not such a great store of value at the mo.!But there are economic equilibria to be reached - price manipulation cannot go on forever, or nothing would have any value..I'm still up well over 1000%, but I know that doesn't help if you bought recently.  But I'm confident it will be well over 20k by year's end.
2	1523274852	-4	Lol!  Up 1,000% (claimed) but lost your shit when it dropped 5% (fact).You are so full of shit.

3	1523274990	2	Heh - no, read my posts, I wrote nothing about the dip or losing money.Go on squire, read it again and I'll clean up your horse for you.Now stop being so presumptuous try to be nice.Edit: toned down
4	1523275778	-3	Gosh, so in addition to being a loser, you are also a hypocrite.I merely said that a $300 drop is very common and you asked me to fuck a horse for that comment.Well, like I said - if you can't deal with a $300 swing, you are in the wrong league.
5	1523276408	3	You arrived on these boards and immediately wrote:> I was expecting to find people with good experience here. Disappointing.And I still don't understand why you think I can't deal with a swing.  I have said nothing about the swing!  Are you alright?
6	1523276664	-1	And my statement was made in the context of a $300 swing, which you replied in that context.I should be the one asking if you are ok to get so angry over this.
7	1523276871	3	But I'm not angry - I'm a hodler.If you arrive on message boards and immediately state that you are disappointed, do you expect people to embrace you?To make up, I have one of Mcafee's cows if you're interested.
3	1523282587	1	Nothing unusual about wanting to be ahead in both the long term and the short term.
0	1523280552	-4	**Most important thing people are not seeing**: Every time bitcoin goes high after going low, the highs keep getting lower.   If you plot these highs, you will see what the trend is, namely that bitcoin value is heading to near-zero.  Therefore, hodling is a losing proposition.
1	1523281329	7	Thanks.  I've been looking at these charts for weeks, and you know what, I hadn't even realised there was a downward trend.  I think my monitor must have been upside down.  Thanks Prof.p.s.  The lowest point was on Feb 6th, and that low hasn't been repeated in over 2 months.
2	1523281897	-4	You're welcome Glad I could help.> p.s. The lowest point was on Feb 6th, and that low hasn't been repeated in over 2 months.Read again what I wrote; it's not that complicated, and *even you* should be able to understand it.   *It is not about the low points*.   Plot the high points for each week and see what trend you can observe.   
3	1523282209	2	I know it's not complicated FUDer - it can't be if you can grasp it.  By the way, your understanding of elliptic curves is on a level with Faketoshi's.  (Not intended as a compliment BTW)  :)Edit: clarification
4	1523285213	1	If you say so, friend.  If you say so.
5	1523286469	1	Congrats on your first successful troll/shill my friend. What have you got in-store for us next?
3	1523283259	1	I get what you're saying, but are other coins breaking this trend or is this crypto market wide?
4	1523288814	1	No, the other coins are almost all in the same boat as bitcoin, and for mostly the same reasons.
5	1523288934	1	Then there's nothing to worry about. It'd a down trend for crypto, I'd only be worried if it was happening to btc alone, blockchain/cryptos aren't going away and aren't going to die.
6	1523289564	1	In such a context, I would separate blockchain from cryptocurrencies.   The latter (and the blockchains) will die within a few years; the former will find some use in other types of applications.> Then there's nothing to worry about.If knowing that all cryptocurrencies are going to the dogs is something that gives you comfort, then why not; hang onto it.
1	1523281988	5	Have you changed your mind?  Only one day ago you wrote:>**"We are in it for the tech, freedom from government, and being our own banks.**>**Fiat is useless.  1 BTC = 1 BTC**>**Therefore no loss of money"**But you appear to have deleted that.How did you change your mind so suddenly Prof.?  Or should I conclude this is pure FUD for reasons known only to yourself?https://www.reddit.com/user/ProfDingleBerry  (near bottom of page)
1	1523280968	5	If you had looked at the trend a few months ago and assumed it would continue indefinitely, you would have arrived at the opposite conclusion.It's not that people aren't seeing it, it's that it doesn't contain any information that is useful for making predictions.Therefore, the future is uncertain.
2	1523283110	0	> If you had looked at the trend a few months ago and assumed it would continue indefinitely,Only if you are a fool, of which apparently there many here are.  Pay careful attention to this: the trend you refer to was a FOMO rush of lemmings hoping to get rich quick.   It does not require more than a few neurons to realize that such a trend cannot last for long.   
3	1523283797	0	Could you stop stating the obvious please?BTW, that horse you were fucking was only doing it for a bet.I'm puzzled by your cognitive dissonance, especially regarding your previous posts positive towards crypto.  But I can see now.You sold your BTC for Bcash didn't you?
1	1523281163	2	I’ve read so many predictions about where all this is going. The fact is that no-one knows. Including you.
2	1523283723	0	Wrong.  Unlike most people here, I do have a broad and very deep understanding of such matters.   Those who pay attention to what I write will be able to get out before the inevitable disaster.  The rest will be left hodling empty bags.

0	1523273200	0	I’ve just come back from a deep neural net conerence. AI everywhere right now. So it can drive a car? Bet your ass someone has it trading bitcoin too. Bots you call them.  Personally i think its mainly neural net bots moving btc price in random ways right now, squeezing money out of the market by wild manipulation and tricks.  Sadly its seems most of the market atm. The only thing which attributed to the big rise last year was so many fomo chumps entering the market.  The chumps are now gone, uninterested and burned.  Without a big paradigm shift in tech i dont see them coming back.  And thats years away at best...  so i cant see a turnaround anytime soon. And taking it one step further, if we’re this shakey on no news, what happens when some bad news comes out?  I think another tank is far more likely than another moon at this point.I still own bitcoin so not trying to ‘fud’ or whatever. Just speaking my honest mind.
1	1523274578	2	Heh.  That's just what my fridge was saying this morning.
1	1523278081	1	Firstly this reeks of confirmation bias. Secondly news hasn't been moving this market at all, there has been plenty in of great news in the Las two months. 
0	1523273917	0	good moment for buying right now, there is some positive movement not including this dump. Buy and wait for pump than sell. 
0	1523283926	1	oh my gosh, just realized Soros and Buffett are both 87 years old. Why is Soros investing in bitcoin at such an old age. The stress is not worth it and these guys aren't going to spend it all before they die of old age.
1	1523284175	1	Do you really think they will invest in crypto currencies & blockchain because it is a disruptive technology with arguably bright future? Of course not they will short / pump / dump and make big $ out of it. Even more when you have redditers who FOMO in each time you have a 100-200$ price increase. To the MOON guys that is so nice of you to feed old billionaires ! 
1	1523284381	1	He's got people to worry about that for him.  People who understand market fluctuations.  
1	1523284479	1	he isn’t the one who will actually be trading, the stress of it won’t get anywhere near him lol
1	1523284034	1	Perhaps for the good of humanity before he passes away? 
2	1523284473	1	Riddle me this.  Why do people think that George Soros, Nazi collaborator and currency manipulator, has good intentions and is a good person?  He's the devil incarnate.  He supports socialism as a means to wreck an economy.
3	1523286345	1	I have no idea what he is like, I have never met him or spoke with him.
3	1523287662	1	where did this "nazi collaborator" nonsense come from? Soros was aged 9-14 during that time period and pretended to be Christian in order to avoid being killed
4	1523288180	1	From his 60 minutes interview : https://youtu.be/QSyczwuTQfo
3	1523285341	1	There's not much evidence of that apart from internet memes
1	1523285162	1	Grtrjyutrt you sound like a fucking idiot. Let’s assume that Soros and Buffet (which I have no idea where you got Buffet from, it’s Soros, Rothschilds and Rockefellers)...but let’s assume old billionaires want to invest in crypto currency just to end up losing money and be stressed... are you really fucking concerned with the well-being of billionaires who lost a small portion of their wealth? What kind of simp are you? These guys won’t lose money, they haven’t got to where they are by being losers. They only win, which is why they won’t invest into Bitcoin until they see the rock bottom plus stability. Contrary to what stupid articles have been telling you, institutional investors are NOT exorbitantly investing in Bitcoin. They simply aren’t so get that out of your stupid head.
0	1523297686	1	GODDAMN we are attacked left right n center. Wealthy cunts are playing with our lives. This is our fight back, Soros or not Soros some old shit will not fuck it this time.

I am up. Not down on my longs. It's very simple. The market went parabolic. You get out, you wait for the crash, then you buy. It's been 4 months since the start of the crash. We have higher lows. We're testing major resistance. Yeah there's going to be a fight here. But basically it's time for the next move up. If nothing else. There might be a little more downside. It is frustrating. But it is definitely not the end of the world.
