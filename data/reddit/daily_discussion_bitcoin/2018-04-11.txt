1	1523452594	2	Was too steep up there, sareh.

0	1523456544	4	The battle for 7k is underway
0	1523456641	3	This is it!!! All this patience is about to pay off (pun intended)I can't take anymore traps
0	1523451336	3	So many tarot readers.

0	1523453180	3	Hi friends!I added new indicators to Bitgur Customizable Watchlist ([bitgur.com/watchlist](https://bitgur.com/watchlist)). Now you can add ATH and moving averages (EMA5, EMA10, EMA20, EMA50, EMA100, EMA200). Here you can watch screenshot: [i.imgur.com/lpSYF2p.png](https://i.imgur.com/lpSYF2p.png). I hope it might be useful for people who use EMA in trading. 
0	1523454023	3	Everybody all in!

0	1523454150	3	69 dudes.  Whoa. 
0	1523456509	3	LES GO LES GO
0	1523457158	3	I dont know why everyone is so excited. We've slowly seen a lack of BOTH resistance and support. The volume is being compressed which will cause a break out that can take us on a short bull run, or a devastating bear run. Considering we still have a lot more correcting to do from the reckless support of 2017 its most likely gonna break out following the down trend.
1	1523457706	2	Yeah, but..  Good for Bitcoin.
1	1523458276	1	Sad but true, having been through 2001, it feels the same.  But I struggle, I can't remember the actual capitulation.  Only a year later, in retrospect, was it obvious.  All I can say is I don't feel we've seen the true capitulation yet.
1	1523459723	1	Anything that happens is good for bitcoin.
0	1523457779	3	Do y’all see the coming world war as good or bad for bitcoin prices???
1	1523462440	1	rule of acquisition #34
1	1523458276	1	Very good.   Most hodlers will die, and their private keys (And coins) will be inaccessible.  So mine will be worth a lot more.     
1	1523457939	1	If there is a world war, you will be dead so it wouldn't matter
0	1523462483	1	Time for the next pump...
1	1523462523	1	You mean dump...
2	1523462586	1	I believe there will be another dump, but not yet.I could be wrong, of course.
3	1523463198	1	Life is all about pump and dump these days. 
4	1523468573	1	My life is mostly about dumps. Huge dumps....
4	1523463388	1	This will pass. When all the wannabe daytraders lost their money trying to compete with the whales.
0	1523455854	3	Well, it seems that the downtrend is about to end. The dip is raising and the 7200 resistance is easy to break.
0	1523449856	7	My theory for the BTC sideways movement of the last two weeks:Obviously a lot of people (traders, recent buyers, and old hodlers), think the BTC price is going lower and want to sell. They have pushed it downward after every recent climb (on Apr 3 and Apr 9).However, the greater force is the new whales that have been eying BTC since it's newsworthy growth last year. It is common sense to say that anyone looking to start investing in BTC for the first time and who has done their risk/reward research has picked a price point at which to buy in. This includes all the new crypto hedge funds. What is unknown is how much new money is coming in and at what price they are looking to buy BTC.I had previously thought that 1/4 of the ATH price at 5k USD would be the largest support line of new money coming in. But, it's looking like 1/3 of the ATH is more likely, at 6.5k USD. To me, these previous two weeks of support at 6.5K USD suggests that 1/3 of the ATH is the magic support number at which many new whales want to buy in. Consider the quick bounce back during the Feb 5 dip. So why 1/3 of ATH? It is similar to previous BTC major corrections, but it's literally just a mental number that stands out in investors' minds: "BTC will probably fall to one third of its ATH price during this correction," is easy to say, so that's where they plan to buy in.I don't believe in predicting the future, but as a BTC (longterm) trader, I believe in betting on the future. My bet is that there is potential for a BTC 2018 ATL of 5k USD, but I think this recent bouncing off the 6.5K USD line over the last two weeks is the bottom of the 2018 price correction. A slow and steady bull market could follow.This is not financial advice. DYOR. Posting here only to timestamp my estimate.
1	1523452837	5	I personally believe the price drops because exchange platforms have to pull their money out. (That’s when people say “the whales are selling”.)In January is was because China had made Bitcoin totally illegal. And the dip since March it’s because Japan is banning unregulated exchange platforms.China banning Bitcoin is unpreventable.For Japan, I’m not too worried because the government is actually very supportive of Bitcoin. The exchange platforms with licenses are invested by large companies and they are doing well. I believe the buyers (who were kicked out because the exchange platform they were using was banned) will come back to the market sooner or later.Anyways, I’m holding and doing nothing because I’m a optimist and a terrible trader.
2	1523454867	1	That seems totally rational.  I don't think the market moves much based on rationality or fundamentals though.  I think we see the same boom and bust cycles that other industries have, but because its more speculative, the swings are even greater.  We can try to rationalize what the market's doing after the fact, but many times the price moves contrary to recent news or technical developments.  I'm also better at holding than trading.
1	1523450509	2	> To me, these previous two weeks of support at 6.5K USD suggests that 1/3 of the ATH is the magic support number at which new whales want to buy in.I share most of your analysis but I am not convinced about figures. You said it all: these are "magic" numbers. If market follows an unpredicted move then everybody will refresh and modify price perception accordingly. Also if you look at previous crashes we can find value from -60% to almost -85% compared to highest point. Different contexts, different price impacts. We still do not know what will be lowest point and we will discover it afterwards. Those who will say "it told you so" just happen to have right guess and sometimes did not even invest since they had low trust in their gut feeling. 
2	1523450662	1	Agreed. Also a singular newsworthy financial event could disrupt any such price predictions. I am personally acting on my prediction, but that action is definitely a form of gambling.
0	1523462751	1	If the bulls could move it up to around $7500 I think that would make people believe that we are going up again.  
1	1523463715	1	7.5 would be nice, but 8k is needed for true fomo 
1	1523466503	1	We nearly got to $7,500 last Monday until someone crashed the price.
1	1523463158	1	Thats what whales need to dump on them. 
0	1523452599	2	With Dow set to fall up to 300 looks like great time to trade and buy some Bitcoin now 
0	1523453397	2	Who's in for some long green dongs?
1	1523453663	3	When moon?
0	1523453623	2	This is the phasis of the lamest trap, or greatest opportunity (looking at the 6h chart and considering the 1d)
1	1523453898	-5	I am wondering how long it will be before Reddit shuts down the cryptocurrency message boards .... I saw news yesterday that they shut down all of the firearm and gun related boards .... I guess when they perceive that Cryptos represent freedom they will shut them down as well ...
2	1523455474	6	Blatantly not true about firearm subreddits. Wtf are you talking abiut
2	1523455301	4	> I saw news yesterday that they shut down all of the firearm and gun related boardsThats just not true all and can be easily verified, why are you spreading this shit? 
3	1523455555	2	It's the same troll who comes around under different variations of Goldberg.
2	1523454058	2	Most only perceive cryptos as an annoying innovation they will have to adapt to lol is like a resistance before the acceptance xD
2	1523454707	2	Let em’ I only glean useful information from a very few reddit users. Most of the time its a mind suck.
2	1523455179	2	Look at the reddit app listing on the Google play store. They boast about how you can get up to the minute crypto news on their site. So I VM doubt that
0	1523460735	1	Everyone here getting excited about a 100 point move, that's nothing. We need a solid 500 point move in a short period of time to confirm any upside reversal. Still too little volume coming in right now. 
1	1523461610	1	what are we waiting for lets go contribute. 
0	1523461229	1	I know it's probably asked a lot but what's the cheapest way to withdraw from Coinbase? In the UK if that makes a difference, I read something about sending it to GDAX?Thanks.
1	1523461590	1	sepa bank transfer i think its 10 pence 
2	1523462182	1	sorry to be a noob but how do i do that?
3	1523462536	1	I've actually not yet done it for withdrawal only for depositing. but you basically give your banks SEPA information and it takes longer than a usual transfer. ideally you want the money in euros. I'd recommend creating a revolut account and SEPA transferring it to that converting to GBP and then withdrawing to your bank via revolut .
3	1523462620	1	You sell your bitcoins for euros on Gdax, then transfer the euros back to coinbase and withdraw via SEPA using the revolut banking app, the cost for using this method is entirely free if under £25k
1	1523462069	1	Withdrawing the BTC or selling BTC and withdrawing the £?
2	1523463843	1	Selling BTC and withdrawing the pounds
1	1523462418	1	Do you mean withdraw to your bank or withdraw to you crypto wallet?
1	1523465305	1	Dude Revolut, nothing but Revolut. Cheapest and easiest by a country mile. PM me if you need help. Also from UK and successfully done this many times with Coinbase and Revolut. Crypto to GBP and into my UK bank account.

0	1523440894	3	Bitcoin is almost as boring as the game of cricket. 
1	1523442541	4	Do it like cricket, park your pick-up next to the field, break out the BBQ, fill the back with water, get the girls in there, get the beers out and start cooking. That's how we used to do it back in the day.
1	1523441120	0	but cricket is interesting...
1	1523441524	0	We already had enough of this moon & doom stuff.

0	1523464350	1	Lol .... one good thing about the slow pace is that even a $100 jump looks HUGE on the chart :)
1	1523466748	1	Lmao.  So many YouTubers saying the "crash" is over.
0	1523463226	1	Trading Analysis:What we have developing is a classic Mitsubishi Step Pattern, with gradually ascending steps.According to classical TA theory, if there is one more step, it will lock into this pattern forever.  Gradually ascending until the price reaches 100k
1	1523463387	1	Nah, its making a classic gluteus maximus and pubococcygeal pattern and getting ready for a dump. 
1	1523463748	1	Thank god.  I thought I was the only one who saw it.  I just went all-in.
2	1523464735	1	You saw it too, heh?  You need a keen eye and a lot of experience.What you're looking for is a series of steps.  Looking like, steps.That, essentially, is the Mitsubishi Step Pattern.It's not used much in TA, because it isn't useful.
3	1523469572	1	Lol again.
1	1523463784	1	Lol
1	1523468539	1	Bro what is this a car?

1	1523444572	1	Syria and the Russians ? Bitcoin won't matter. Nothing will matter. You and everyone you know will be dead in a matter of months. 
2	1523449655	1	Alright, enough internet for the day.
3	1523450145	1	True story. If that lot gets out of hand we're gonners. 
4	1523453335	1	Yeah, cuz Syria is totally a super power. And it's not like all Russia does is put on a big show and then do nothing or anything right? This is the real deal boys
0	1523468897	1	With more and more companies making better and better ASIC's and Mining hardware will the 21 million hard cap get reached sooner than we originally thought?
1	1523469227	1	No
1	1523469645	1	No, because the difficulty increases based on the hash rate.
2	1523469841	1	If that scenario plays out and the difficulty increases, will the global amount of energy devoted to mining increase? (Assuming these new mining rigs use the same electricity)

1	1523470482	1	Fortunately the attack was short lived. The mods were quick to notice that their privileges had been revoked and a little bit of investigating made clear what happened.  A support request went out and was all resolved in about an hour. Don't think they know who was responsible, only that an old admin account had been compromised.It's all sorted now and things seem to be back to normal 
1	1523470394	1	Who cares? 
2	1523471236	1	Well I was interested.
1	1523470542	1	and..
0	1523471114	1	Do we trust this little bull flag?
0	1523471171	1	Can someone explain the following transaction to me?https://blockchain.info/tx/1e90a49f438b6c872b68e7a74813c54ecec8b210a3df6bb3f4e5605a637fd048
1	1523471480	1	What exactly is your question?
2	1523471821	1	Sending 38 cents is odd. Probably sending it as a test maybe? 
3	1523472215	1	these aren't change transactions?

1	1523451236	1	Just bought me one of the "Antminer" thinga-ma-jigs. Shipped last night. I'll help out as soon as I can. 
1	1523442646	1	Not true, check your source.
2	1523442992	2	What is the "right" source?
3	1523453891	1	https://www.thesource.ca/
0	1523464880	1	Normally, at this point you'd think the worse is over, the crash is done, and we should be back on our way to the moon. Only problem is that damn Mt Gox guy still has millions in Bitcoin to carelessly dump all over the market sooner or later, and send us back down again. 
1	1523468133	1	Just think about when after that happens though and he runs out of bitcoin or decides to stop selling, it will be one less person with a bunch of bitcoin to dump.
1	1523472276	1	im pretty sure the only thing controlling the market now is hype
0	1523466828	1	is there a good explanation for why prices of all cryptocurrencies tend to rise and fall in unison?
1	1523467186	1	Trading between coins is easy. So, many people (or rather: bots) do that when prices fluctuate, to maximize profits or minimize losses. It works similar to arbitage trading.This couples the prices. At least in the short term.
0	1523449110	-2	Low volume. Very small buy orders. I think it is time for a nice red dildo guys ;)
1	1523452748	1	Sorry for you
2	1523453081	0	He was just trying to offer his greased up dildo.
0	1523467115	1	Okay, we're bottoming out.  Now who got in early enough to send me 0.5 BTC and change my world?  Anybody?  Anybody?  Oh okay, back to work then. :(

0	1523446042	0	The Eastern Seaboard is beginning to wake up and she's already starting to turn....down. Hey day traders - definite pattern there! Who knows; maybe a new trend line in the making. Any ideas on what to name it? 
1	1523453240	2	Krapp, taken from the letters in your name since your the only one who can see it. :D
2	1523460536	1	Look at all the activity and wow; look at that! There's someone that say's shit when he does have a mouthful of it.
0	1523452914	-1	I predict a dump shortly in the next couple of hours
1	1523453021	3	You mean you "hope" dump shortly because you didn't fill your bags at 6800?
2	1523453959	2	No I mean I predict a dump, still waiting to buy 
3	1523454953	3	Keep waiting for 6800, I hope you never ever get to see that price ever again in your life 😉
4	1523455181	1	Will do, thanks buddy
1	1523453726	3	We hit "a" bottom yesterday, on the 6hr chart.  It's likely to trend up from here.
