0	1523970315	8	I just bought more Bitcoin. Crash inc. 
1	1523970903	2	You called it right on time. Good job ... I guess.
0	1523968812	13	**It's a great morning and the sun is shining, plus I didn't pay Tax and won't pay Tax, have a great one ;-)**
1	1523970892	3	Respect.
1	1523970051	5	Thanks for telling us so we can track you down!/IRS
2	1523971212	3	**Good luck with that! ;-)** In fact I'll give you a clue re wallet address **1Go74Fuck788Yourse1fppIts676Mine**
2	1523970786	1	He probably just went to school all year.
3	1523970998	4	That's definitely a 12 year old crypto day trader. 
1	1523969674	1	Good morning Ian!
1	1523985140	1	@IRS Here is his wallet: 3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r ;)
2	1523985814	1	Thought I had more than that ;-)
0	1523975309	1	fk those shorters at 8100
1	1523975429	1	Today hodl, moon soon
0	1523975673	1	Today is last chance to load up before take off 
1	1523979539	1	Why? They going to stop selling crypto at midnight? Buy for less tomorrow. 
2	1523980062	1	Because as I have been saying(trying not to be too repetitive), the short term moving average is extremely close to crossing the long term moving average on the gdax 1 day chart.  Once this happens it should increase buying pressure significantly. 
3	1523982128	1	makes sense hopefully we get some fireworks this week
4	1523986581	1	It SHOULD make sense but the last time the one day kissed it the bottom fell out ...3k drop....guess were gonna find out soon
5	1523988030	1	That’s because there was major FUD happening last time, including fears that the mt gox trustee was selling large amounts.  If not for all that happening at once we’d probably have crossed 12k  
0	1523978383	1	**Bullish Outlook at the moment**https://www.coindesk.com/8500-bitcoin-eyes-gains-with-key-support-at-7900/**Bitcoin remains in a bullish territory for now and is looking at further gains, though a pullback is possible if support at $7,900 is breached, according to technical studies.**The cryptocurrency's first attempt to scale the long-term descending trendline (drawn from the Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high) failed on Monday and prices fell below $8,000 as expected at 12:00 UTC.It's worth noting that the Bollinger bands (seen on the chart below) show the volatility dropped after BTC dipped below the psychological mark, likely signaling indecision among the bears. As a result, it is not surprising the dip below $8,000 was short-lived.As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,145 on Bitfinex, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis, but could soon report further gains as the hourly Bollinger bands indicate scope for a retest of $8,400-$8,500.
1	1523979535	1	It seems that 8k$ now is the reasonable price for btc for this time until we have new money to FOMO.
0	1523980785	1	There was a tiny drop back yesturday and alllll the trolls and fudsters were out but.... where dey at doe? 
1	1523986816	1	Maybe they were simply highlighting a weakness in the current rally. A balanced opinion is better than a biased one which is clearly something this sub is yet to fully understand. In fact the persistent optimism feels a lot more like desperation which to be honest doesn't really help your case for widespread adoption very much. Might be better to just shut up and let people think for themselves without forcing the words 'moon', 'hodl' and 'lambo' down their throats every five seconds.
0	1523959309	3	we moon yet?
1	1523959544	1	Funny!No we have to wait for the HODLERS to sell so BTC can drop to $7400 then everybody on the sidelines (including me) who have some hardcore FOMO see this as a last opportunity so jump in, then you have the volume, then we can all go to the moon!
2	1523963535	2	This
2	1523964287	1	There will be no $7400. Maybe $7700, maybe. By Friday it will be $9000 and won't look back. 
3	1523964911	2	You make me remember end of February: There will be no $10400. Maybe $10700, maybe. By Friday it will be $12000 and won't look back. 
4	1523970926	2	How many times has this been posted and not happened? 
5	1523974111	1	17 no's and one yes equals yes.
0	1523962572	3	Maybe this is the time we hit $9k again? Btw the market is going full green
0	1523979791	1	FOMO coming soon...
1	1523979829	1	9k$ is coming soon...
2	1523984052	1	how soon?
0	1523959526	2	Engage moon lambo
0	1523963081	2	Bears are weak
1	1523966650	3	I love the smell of rekt shorters in the morning.It smells like...victory.
2	1523974805	0	you wreaked your shorters last night huh...
1	1523966318	1	GRRRRRR
1	1523964198	1	Bulls not showing much strength either
2	1523968173	1	But we are hodling!
0	1523965667	2	Looks like the Bulls are starting to wake up.....
0	1523971895	2	I see the Bart Simpson patterns are back. 
0	1523986622	1	A lot of doodling around 8.1Come on someone - this is boring.Someone call it and make an ass of themselves.  :)
1	1523987333	1	8300 tnight
2	1523987492	1	I'll raise: 8500+The charts are pregnant for a breakout.
3	1523988016	1	i think we will wake up to 8500... gentlemans wagerrrrr
1	1523988391	1	Yeah its tedious, but yet it's comforting in a way as well.  I think very soon (next hour or 2 hours at most) we are going to see a super duper candle, I don't know which color.  But I'm making my first prediction ever it's green and it will take us back up to mid 8300's within 2-3 minutes when this candle starts.  Final answer I'm locking it in.
1	1523988352	1	8700+ by Friday night 
0	1523965833	1	It's only 7.50am in New York so we have plenty of time.  
0	1523966339	1	Hey! This is my first time posting here so I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this.I have a very low income and every cent counts. I had the idea of investing a really low amount (>30€) in a crypto currency and withdraw something like 5€/week, is this feasible? I have no interest in risking a lot of money for a chance at winning a lot or becoming rich, just a ~~low and steady~~ extra source of ~~capital~~ money.Edit: a friend of mine is really interested in the topic and thus I understand the basics of it, but he's obsessed with becoming rich (he also doesn't have financial problems like me) and I cba to ask him for advice lol. 
1	1523967496	2	And just for a bit of encouragement. Onassis used to sell cigarettes from a wheelbarrow. He became the richest man in the world. 
2	1523968689	1	Thanks a lot for the motivation kind stranger! :) 
1	1523968809	2	You would need about 5200€ to get a steady 5€/week assuming 5% annual return in the stock market (historically, returns have been 7%/year over long periods). Bitcoin is way too volatile to guarantee any sort of steady source of money. If you want to invest in Bitcoin, "buy and hodl" is the only reasonable strategy. 
2	1523971584	1	Thanks for the numbers, that way I can almost objectively see how it's a bad idea to try it! 
1	1523966640	2	You want to do a one time deposit of 30 euro into BTC and withdraw 5 every week while the 30 euro stays the same? Thats a 15% increase every week. Doubt that's going to happen.Besides that, if every cent counts, don't invest in crypto's because you might as well be losing 5 buks a week.
2	1523966760	1	Okay, thanks :)The numbers were just approximate but I guess the point stands. 
1	1523966502	1	"Steady" source of capital. Then crypto is definitively not a good pick for your need.
2	1523967455	3	Steady source of capital.... sounds like a job. 
3	1523971638	1	Well I wouldn't mind having an extra "job" to earn money sitting in front of my PC.. 
4	1523977243	1	So you are willing to sit in front of your pc for 20 pounds a month. You don't really value your time do you?  Go back to school, get a real job.
5	1523979720	1	You're browsing reddit, should I tell you how to spend your time? Jesus fuck people are sometimes so dumb. Also, you know nothing about me and I didn't ask how to improve my formation. Go back to life and learn it's basics.Tell me how successful your life was/is 39 y/o redditor.
6	1523983814	1	I feel successful, but I'm not content, and I'm finishing my nurse praticioners licence. I'm getting paid to browse reddit in between patients. You looked at all my comments, you can see what I do for a living. No reason to get salty. You want a steady stream of 5 pounds a week, go get a job. 
7	1523986846	1	Calm down man. Not everyone is fortunate enough and am sure you'd agree, we can be a lil patient with new folks. He ain't asking for money, is he
8	1523989069	1	He asked me to tell him how successful I am/was/is.... so I did. And I would agree that success is what you make it. I worked (and so did my wife) hard as hell to get where I/we are today. My mom didn't help me, I signed up for the military to pay for my schooling. I literally signed my life away for a chance to go to college that wouldn't financially cripple my mother. Any person over 18 (and under in some cases) can do exactly what I did. No luck, just hard work. Some people aren't willing to do that. That guy, is one of those people. 
6	1523984189	1	You asking for shit advice on how to get a stream of 5 pounds a week on a 20 pound investment? And I'm the one that needs to learn it's basics. Your parents owe society an apology. 
2	1523966662	1	Maybe that wasn't a good choice of word, what I really wanna know is if investing a really low amount could translate in earning something like 20€/month.
3	1523967633	3	no
4	1523968665	1	Okay thanks :) 
5	1523971283	2	it could, if you can continuously trade successfully and make enough to get past all the fee's trading on the margin.this is however, an extremely risky approach and its sounds like even in low volume, you'd be gambling more than you can afford to loose. -and there's a damn good chance you will loose, especially if your new.there are other ways to get a head start in a dead economy but they involve the sale of that which may require jail time.just go fill out surveys kid!
6	1523971537	1	D... Dad?Jokes apart, What do you mean by filling out surveys?And thanks a lot for the insight, I guess my idea wasn't as good as I though! :) 
7	1523974713	2	if you're absolutely desperate for income, and there are no jobs what so ever, you can make a small amount of money by filling out surveys for companies. it wont be worth your time, but if all you would be doing with that time is jacking off anyway, it could be worth looking into.Also, I'm glad I didn't wear the condom that night...son. :)
8	1523980096	1	Okay, thanks. I'll give it a try :)
0	1523971450	1	Market going crazy O.o
1	1523971829	3	Actually this is very standard pump and dump on a 75-80$ price range. Zoom out and you will see one flat day with low volume so far. 
2	1523972099	0	Zoom out too. Market implies lots of dynamics lol
0	1523972510	1	the 1h chart is kinda similiar to that 8.3k - 7.9k drop. we need to break out 
0	1523972621	1	This might be a stupid question, but what is the advantage/disadvantage of investing in a fund like GBTC instead of directly into Bitcoin?My friend does it this way and he says he prefers it this way because it's traded on the stock exchange so it's less shady and it allows you to do it in tax advantage retirement accounts. Only downside he says is that can only trade when market is open but not a big deal if you in it for the long haul.Is he right? Is there something else he's missing?
1	1523974021	2	If you don't own your private keys someone could remove your access to your money.
1	1523973980	1	He won't own any Bitcoin. 
1	1523984329	1	Main advantage would be the ease with which he could have some exposure to btc within a tax-advantaged retirement account. But with a little footwork, he could establish a checkbook IRA with an LLC and hold any crypto or other asset on his own without paying a gigantic margin.
0	1523972921	1	what do the accretions KYC and AML mean? what other acronyms should i know? 
1	1523973069	3	aml = anti money launderingkyc= know your customeryou only need to know 1 more:HODL
2	1523973998	3	HODL is not an acronym
3	1523974236	5	Hang On Don’t Leggo
4	1523976108	1	Hold on to dead life
3	1523975718	1	Says who?
4	1523977226	1	Everyone who knows where it originated from ?
1	1523975482	1	BTFD = buy the fucking dip 
0	1523984090	1	Can I get a list of all current Lightning implementations that work with Bitcoin Core?
1	1523984856	1	I guess you'll find them all here, but I don't know of a simple list:https://www.reddit.com/r/lightningnetwork/
1	1523985373	1	Check out [yalls.org](https://yalls.org/).
0	1523959649	1	Dread it. Run from it. Destiny (9k) still arrives- Thanos
1	1523960518	1	...again.
0	1523974642	1	That escalated quickly from $8,059 to $8,285 
1	1523974921	1	not on my exchange damnit.
1	1523975078	1	What exchange are you looking at
2	1523975450	1	I was looking at the coinmarketcap website. When I hit refresh it showed $8,285.
1	1523975481	1	Don't see it either. You might be seeing the future here. Selling your feed ? 
0	1523977596	1	So far,  tax day 2018 is acting just like tax day 2001,  uneventful.  Tax related selling didn't magically stop on April 15 2001 because  it's perfectly legal to hold off actually paying your taxes,  you just accrue penalties and interest. If we carry the comparison forward,  the low of the year will occur in early May,  as the reality of further tax related selling weighs on the market.  At some point the final capitulation occurs and after that the slow multi-year crawl.   Yea,  history does repeat itself
1	1523977904	1	I wasn't expecting a sudden bull run. But selling pressure should decline from now on...
2	1523978493	1	That's what most think,  just watch....
3	1523979567	1	It is certainly a possibility that you are right. It would be a perfect example of a bull trap.I'm happy either way. If it crashes, I can buy more cheap coins. If it goes up, I'm happy for the coins I already own.
1	1523978097	1	How many more times are you going to repeat this story? :)
2	1523978448	1	probably until it stops being true.
3	1523980563	1	:)
1	1523978264	1	This is not the stock market so I’m not sure if that’s an appropriate comparison. 
2	1523978878	1	It's human beings trading an asset in both cases.  Human nature has much more to do with it than the mechanics of the actual asset.
3	1523979138	1	Yeah but one key difference is this is a global market for one main asset (bitcoin) where many are not even paying taxes.  Tax day ramifications and deferred payments may not be a big enough factor to change the momentum, which in my opinion, is now headed upwards. 
4	1523980567	1	yea I have no idea how to factor that in,  on the one hand the effect is limited to some percentage of the whole market,  but on the other hand that market is so thinly traded,  that trends in a small percentage of the market can move the whole market.  I think it's a wash TBH.
1	1523986418	1	FWIW, the wealthiest investors will usually go on extension and will not pay their taxes until their last extension runs out, i.e., September 15 for business entities, and October 15 for individuals. There are many reasons for this: (1) Their returns are usually much more complicated and can't be worked out quickly; (2) They usually invest in LLCs and limited partnerships, which often have their own complex returns, and thus don't crank out their Form K-1s until late August or September, (3) They like to hold on to their unpaid tax moneys for liquidity, and (4) There is a theory that goes around to the effect that the IRS in any given tax year only has the manpower to audit so many returns (which is true) and thus (this is the theory part) by the time the IRS gets to the returns late in the year their allotment of audits for that tax year have already been used up or substantially diminished, lowering the audit rate further if not eliminating it outright. BTW, this is one of the reasons that U.S. investments markets get weak in September and October (when most of the largest drops historically occur) because entities and wealthy investors are having to liquidate some positions to generate the cash to pay any tax liability they didn't estimate and pre-pay. The upshot is that the April 15 (or 17) tax day is mostly for wage-earners who are not big investors, if at all.

1	1523985926	1	LOL if you wanna troll, you should probably learn the difference in bear and bull trap
1	1523985892	1	Doesn't even know what bear trap is.[–]fan_of_hakiksexydays 3 points 3 days agoUnfortunately, I had to sell my Bitcoins because of taxes. I think a lot of people are gonna be buying again after tax day.Someone sold low
1	1523986602	1	Which day
1	1523987113	1	You mean "bull trap" but it is hard to tell, since trading is still within the channel of the last significant high of 8915 on May 23 and the most recent low of 6603 from a couple of weeks ago. It also still hasn't crossed the 90-day moving average of 8354, i.e., the market has slightly improved for bulls but is largely still mostly just waddling sideways within the high-low channel.
1	1523985404	1	Already shorted at $8112.70 easy money. We're probably heading toward $2-3k range based on projections.
2	1523986655	1	Bollox alert!
2	1523986215	1	Whew that is a relief, I was thinking it was headed toward 1k-1.5k  range.  
0	1523989102	1	My name is stokelycalm and I’m the biggest shorter. I see tremendous optimism in today’s daily discussion. I can’t wait until Bitcoin crashes to a $4300 bottom and all you HODLers are pissing you pants. I’ll watch panic ensue and buy lots of Bitcoin at rock bottom prices.
