0	1525687291	4	morning everyoneÔºÅ
1	1525687791	6	The omission of the word good from your greeting feels apt 
0	1525703819	1	Here we are now. Hung up at the Macafee dick line again.
1	1525705818	1	The *biggest* indickator
1	1525704685	1	the only time to short BTC is in January it seems
0	1525714464	1	Who else is hodling despite the dump on the weekend? Raise your hand -_-/
1	1525715566	1	Lol
1	1525716168	1	üëê
0	1525692809	8	If the price drops below the dickline, all hell will break loose. https://dickline.info/ I am100% certain of my prediction because of my fool proof dickline based technical analysis system.
1	1525696754	3	he's going to have to eat about 0.6% of his dick it forecasts.is self-circumcision a thing and how does one add it to myfitnesspal?
1	1525714756	1	it can go down 20&#37; bellow line, another day \+40&#37; above so not really a good line, just a dickline :D
0	1525702620	1	I heard there is no SEC meeting today. Actually I also didnt find any such official statement. Is it a FUD?
1	1525703850	1	The dump yesterday wasn't about sec and when it is above 10k it won't be because of some news.people took profitsand we are back in action
2	1525704911	1	Makes sense 
1	1525703179	1	I heard it‚Äôs a rumor too
1	1525703449	1	I also could not find any proper info.
0	1525708381	1	Should I buy or should I sell....
1	1525709981	1	Yes, sell everything you own and buy BTC
2	1525710196	1	Now the question is: Would you buy everything I own? Or would you sell me your bitcoins?
1	1525713277	1	"Should" is the wrong word! WANT is the right one.
2	1525713411	1	"Want I buy or want I sell".   That doesn't make much sense.
3	1525715272	1	You still stuck in "should", that's why lol
3	1525714184	1	Was actually reading that in my head before seeing this comment
1	1525708581	1	Booth. 
1	1525710517	1	Should I stay or should I go ?
2	1525715184	1	Yeahp, you got it!!  :)
1	1525713099	1	Buyyyyy, rally coming :)
2	1525715237	1	What makes you think so?
0	1525689148	2	Good morning my friends :)
1	1525691310	1	bonjour :)
1	1525692721	1	Good day.
0	1525713981	1	**Keep going Bulls!**
0	1525689855	3	Hi I'm Greg, and I'm a **HODLoholic.** 
1	1525700534	1	Hi Greg.
1	1525704301	1	That's the only addiction I regret dropping. 
0	1525694685	3	if all goes well with the SEC meeting see you in 10k :P 
1	1525697252	3	when does it start?
2	1525698393	2	3PM GMT 
1	1525697816	2	When is the meeting ? 
0	1525704837	1	I have respect for Warren Buffet, but he really shouldn't comment about a technology he doesn't fully understand. His two cents easily sway a large number of people who buy or sell based on his personal opinion. He already [admitted](http://fortune.com/2018/05/06/why-warren-buffet-was-wrong-about-google-amazon/) that he was wrong about Amazon and Google.
1	1525707931	1	So Buffett was against Bitcoin, and said he didn't see any value in it. And yet, later in the conversation, Buffett admitted to missing out on being an early bird investor on two tech companies: Amazon and Google.  Buffett admitted he didn't understand them as tech companies, so he never bothered investing in them even though he saw the numbers they were doing.  That just tells me he doesn't understand anything about Bitcoin.
1	1525706556	1	Of course he's trying to sway people, he knows his power. He's apart of the system that crypto is trying to beat.
1	1525705937	1	He understands bitcoin (as in the thing you can buy with fiat) well enough. He doesn't understand the blockchain, but bitcoin is not the blockchain.
2	1525708933	1	Pretty sure he‚Äôs intelligent enough to understand as much as most people. He‚Äôs entitled to an opinion just like anyone else
3	1525716068	1	How do you explain jails then?
0	1525697823	1	Good evening from Japan guys. Hope the SEC meeting goes well. 
1	1525698587	1	What time is the meeting ?
2	1525698792	1	I'm seeing 15:00 GMTÔªø here and there, but I don't know how reliable this info is, sorry. Maybe just keep checking twitter, or here.
0	1525702048	1	Does the SEC meeting get streamed or anything?
0	1525706608	1	i was very bearish but with that new bottom im long again
1	1525707548	1	Wut
2	1525711233	1	he thought it would go down, but then it didn't and now he thinks it will go up
3	1525712473	1	And then it would not go up then he thinks it would go down and up and down...
0	1525708252	1	[removed]
1	1525708327	1	Apparently there is no scheduled meeting on SEC website either, they are just trying to crash the markets
0	1525715499	1	Which service could I start delivering to get BTC as a deserved reward? It is easier to be a hodler when you don't know when you bought in lmaooo
0	1525689313	1	Will we dump under 9000 ?
1	1525690462	2	Maybe
1	1525690965	1	Don't think that's gonna happen, the price seems to be recovering already slowly.
0	1525692884	1	I've only been invested with Bitcoin now for about a week, so this is my first major dip. I didn't panic sell, I've all but got the panic screams under control. Onwards and upwards!
1	1525693036	5	This isn't even a proper dip tbh.Welcome to the rodeo tho!
2	1525693613	5	I can imagine. Not like I expected an exponential upward curve and to be a bitcoin billionaire over night. I'm more invested for the technology and the ideology, so whatever happens happens. üòé
3	1525693693	2	That's the perfect way to think about it!
4	1525694004	2	Damn right. I started my research five days ago into Bitcoin, altcoins and blockchain technology. Pretty much fell in love immediately. This isn't some shitty get rich quick scheme, it's something to change the world.
5	1525712441	1	agreed. at least for bitcoin. as far as i‚Äôm concerned, the jury is still out as to what the future holds for altcoins.
1	1525715325	1	Welcome to the other side. No worries, you'll either be screaming for joy or in despair by the end of the year. Word to the wise. Learn about hardware wallets, buy one, put your coinage in it, lock it down and forget it for about 5 years. Really dude. Forget spaceships, spacesuits and Lambo's too. Leave those to the infantile's and feel good in knowing you've taken the negative factor out of the screaming equation. 
0	1525700446	1	Buffet and Gates are some of the biggest Frauds and liars in history.  I wouldn't be concerned about their opinions on Bitcoin.  The SEC meeting is way more relevant
1	1525702274	1	Hahaha yeah what could two of the richest men on the planet possibly know about finance
2	1525702431	1	And everybody knows that Buffet didn't invest in most of the biggest Tech companies that currently dominate. 
3	1525702863	1	Bitcoin is not the blockchain.
2	1525702341	1	They know a lot about Gaming the legacy system.  Crypto is a different game - new rules
3	1525706699	1	lol no
3	1525706849	1	I just find it ironical that there are people who thinks that it's different and that they know better.
1	1525700833	1	Will it be a list? (if they are declared securities).
2	1525701203	2	as far as i read today is just a meeting.  So the market is just going to move based on the sentiment.  Im really optimistic as they've had over two years to make a decision and they've done nothing so far
0	1525694248	1	I prayed there would be a pullback before my fiat cleared and here it is :') stock up people!
0	1525701802	1	I'm looking for any opinions on what effect the BTC wealth distribution might have on the markets should BTC reach anything like what is predicted (say US$50k +). I think this wealth distribution is the elephant in the room myself, but would like to hear any opinion on the matter. Any links to known articles discussing this would be appreciated. https://btc.com/stats/rich-list
1	1525702802	1	I too would be interested in reading more on this. Though...couldn't some of these addresses be from institutions?
