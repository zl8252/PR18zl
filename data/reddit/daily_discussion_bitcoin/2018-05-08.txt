0	1525774341	26	Yesterday we issued a couple temporary bans to accounts who were spreading fake news about a supposed SEC meeting, apparently in a widespread attempt to manipulate markets. Those accounts have been labeled and will be banned permanently if caught doing anything similar. 
1	1525775864	4	Good. Thank you!
1	1525780892	1	Thanks. 
1	1525781388	1	why didn't that happen last week? this sub was blowing up last week about the sec meeting and all it was going to do for the weekend pump.
2	1525781572	2	You are probably thinking of a different sub. Search results for 'SEC' don't return anything pertaining to this supposed meeting. First time I started hearing this meeting rumor was only about 48 hours ago. 
3	1525784921	1	go to any of the daily discussions from last week. in this sub
1	1525786244	1	Thank you for that.  Keep up the good work... it’s the wild west with cryptocurrencies and we need some good sheriffs like yourself.  
0	1525780750	8	For those calling this a sell off. Take a look at the 30 day chart: https://prnt.sc/jf8wygThis is a bullish chart: Higher lows, higher highs... If it breaks significantly down then you might have the start of a point but until then this is still a promising chart in the mid term. Hate to use the cliche but zoom out and don't panic over short term moves
1	1525784025	2	Exactly, this thread is flooded by officially-tagged fud-trolls.
2	1525797290	1	just like it's filled with newly minted fomo trolls.

1	1525791523	1	Bought a thousand dollars at $12,000. Went down to $6,000. Angry wife.Bought $2,000 more at $6,000. Went back up to $10,000. Happy wife.
2	1525795050	1	She'll probably spend it all on fillers and new titties. Profit will be gone before you know it.

1	1525792697	1	Union Maj. Gen. John Pope became convinced that he had trapped Jackson and concentrated the bulk of his army against him. On August 29, Pope launched a series of assaults against Jackson's position along an unfinished railroad grade. The attacks were repulsed with heavy casualties on both sides. At noon, Longstreet arrived on the field from Thoroughfare Gap and took position on Jackson's right flank. On August 30, Pope renewed his attacks, seemingly unaware that Longstreet was on the field. When massed Confederate artillery devastated a Union assault by Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps, Longstreet's wing of 25,000 men in five divisions counterattacked in the largest simultaneous mass assault of the war. The Union left flank was crushed and the army was driven back to Bull Run. Only an effective Union rear guard action prevented a replay of the First Manassas defeat. Pope's retreat to Centreville was nonetheless precipitous.
2	1525794008	1	Pope was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Nathaniel Pope, a prominent Federal judge in early Illinois Territory and a friend of lawyer Abraham Lincoln. He was the brother-in-law of Manning Force, and a distant cousin married the sister of Mary Todd Lincoln. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1842, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the Corps of Topographical Engineers. He served in Florida and then helped survey the northeastern border between the United States and Canada. He fought under Zachary Taylor in the Battle of Monterrey and Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican-American War, for which he was appointed a brevet first lieutenant and captain, respectively. After the war Pope worked as a surveyor in Minnesota. In 1850 he demonstrated the navigability of the Red River. He served as the chief engineer of the Department of New Mexico from 1851 to 1853 and spent the remainder of the antebellum years surveying a route for the Pacific Railroad.
3	1525796457	1	The Pacific Railroad was a railroad based in the U.S. state of Missouri. It was a predecessor of both the Missouri Pacific Railroad and St. Louis\-San Francisco Railway.The Pacific was chartered by Missouri in 1849 to extend "from St. Louis to the western boundary of Missouri and thence to the Pacific Ocean."\[1\] Due to a cholera epidemic in 1849, which was a citywide disaster, and other delays, groundbreaking did not occur until July 4, 1851.In 1865, it became the first railroad to serve Kansas City, after construction was interrupted by the American Civil War. In 1872, the Pacific Railroad was reorganized as the Missouri Pacific Railway by new investors after a railroad debt crisis
0	1525777483	4	Now the NYSE wants to sell Bitcoin.. is this a good thing or bad thing?? Look what happened the bitcoin on December when the futures started..
1	1525778058	8	Good as it will eventually lend some credibility to BTC.But to get there, expect the journey to be really rocky.
1	1525793688	1	considering how hard people were bashing the nyse and stocks in general on this sub, I'd say it's a bad thing. but this such a bipolar place, the logic just gets twisted into whatever narrative fits that hour. so it's probably great.
1	1525777811	0	For the love of god it wasn't the farking futures !! If you do 2000&#37; in a year in a parabolic move it's going to crash. For farks sake. 
2	1525780601	3	no need to sudo swear ;)
3	1525784296	3	Pseudo
4	1525785466	3	Thanks, It’s the programmer in me :)

3	1525781353	1	Can I just swear ? It frustrates the hell out of me. Obviously if your asset does 2000&#37; it's going to crash.  I don't understand this search for a reason. The reason is known. It went parabolic. And that's that. 
0	1525785136	8	I just bought the dip @ $9,120Now i can go to eat with that warm feeling in my heart i get when i'm doing my part.ARE YOU DOING YOURS??

0	1525773880	3	Not many shorts on Bitfinex over the last few days, but an increase of shorting this morning. Something to keep an eye on.
1	1525785194	1	It's gonna be a bumpy ride this time. :)
0	1525781170	3	Hey now! Cheap coins

0	1525796096	1	Is the Iran news good for crypto?
1	1525796980	1	and IranIran so far away
1	1525796370	1	What Iran news?
2	1525798892	1	Dunno... they went so fast...
2	1525801084	1	Donald is trying to start WW3 again, which hardly counts as new anymore. It just means higher oil & gasoline prices, which is good for Don's friends in Saudi Arabia & United Arab Emirates. They'll probably use the extra money to buy more shares of Goldman Sachs and/or bomb Yemen some more, which means they won't be spending it on bitcoin an driving the price up.
3	1525801712	1	He just wants to distract from Stormy. It will be forgotten in a few days.
0	1525803867	1	This fight back from the depths... How long will it last 
1	1525804388	1	Looking good bulls.  Keep it up 
1	1525804718	1	Till 2020.
0	1525781710	3	**Keep going Bulls!**
1	1525783105	0	You want bulls to ... keep on losing versus selling pressure?
2	1525784549	1	He posts this everyday a few times, this is a sign that bitcoin causes people to go mental talking to themselves

1	1525790159	6	How old are you... guessing you are 12 or something. If comments from one person hurts bitcoin then it deserves it. If you actually believe in BTC then just keep holding and stop complaining.
2	1525791947	1	Warren Buffet's comments probably didn't have that much bearing on Bitcoin's price this week: but the point still remains that the words of successful investors carry weight that affects how people invest their money. It is therefore implausible that his words are entirely free from self-interest.
3	1525797895	1	Yes, he was bearish on Amazon and look at them now. Completely destroyed the company. 
0	1525798997	1	I'm of course bullish on BTC long\-term but I have a feeling that Mr McAfee will be eating a sausage dinner come the end of 2020
1	1525799781	1	If his word is as good as the Anti-Virus, I highly doubt it...
1	1525800402	1	He doesn't quite believe what he said, he just wants media attention. But I do believe it will be higher than it is now by 2020.
1	1525802469	1	McAfee will literally tweet about any coin as long as he’s paid enough. I have no faith that that bet was serious, but I’d love to see the loon eat his own dick either way. 
0	1525781989	2	lol got so close to 10k and now we might be heading right back to 8.8k 3 days later, sighh. here’s to hoping this week is better 
0	1525797263	1	I hope you all realize that McAfee's $1,000,000 prediction is backed up by nothing. It's simply an exponential function applied to the price of bitcoin. An exponential function can be applied to anything. Will it follow it? Possibly. Is it a guarantee? Absolutely not.
1	1525797336	1	Hello Captain Obvious! I hope you're fine.
2	1525797596	1	Thanks! You too.
1	1525797958	1	No Shit!
1	1525801223	1	Wait! This shit aint guaranteed? Stop the fucking boat. I need to get off.
1	1525800798	1	Bitcoin is backed up by nothing. The dickline is backed up by a promise to eat a dick.
1	1525797553	1	What's the news
1	1525803069	1	What did you think we thought it was that you needed to clarify it for us? 
1	1525800057	1	It's just a marketing gimmick.
0	1525773958	1	whuds ma bitcoin werf?
1	1525776281	3	Only wertcha willin ta sell it for 
0	1525795194	1	I'd be all over these prices if I had the money, sadly my student loans are due for this paycheck so can't take advantage
0	1525780851	-3	Ready for 5k. I dont think we are out of this bear market yet. We need more pain for a sustainable growth after. Too many kids still in the game.
1	1525781425	2	kids are the demo. can't lose them.
1	1525782494	1	The same person theee days earlier pointing his tail to sky while moaning “mooooon”
0	1525780870	0	The fight for the anal depths of 9k is back on again. Back to 8.8k and if it breaks that then 8k is easily attainable.
0	1525790853	1	Here we go back down to 8k in the next week then back up 
1	1525796464	1	Or we go up to 12k and then back down...
2	1525797918	1	or we just keep moving to the right
0	1525782472	-9	6k here we come
1	1525785187	6	We're not seeing 6K ever again.There, i said it.
2	1525790221	1	Hope that's not true; I'm not planning on buying till it's sub 6k.It's had two attempts; third time lucky?
1	1525782632	2	Why do you even do that ?
2	1525782786	1	If a short, I will regret it. If I don’t short, I will regret it. Whatever I do, market will acr opposite.
3	1525783469	1	Errrrrrr......ooook....But life lesson 1, don't try short something that does 2000&#37; a year. That was always going to hurt. 
4	1525784082	2	You'd think a potential 2000% increase in 1-2 years would be worth* the long hold, especially with tax incentive. Even if it drops down sub 7k, so what. Wait.
4	1525784258	2	Yep, 2000% is clearly not a bubble.
4	1525787176	1	Lol piker!  You just don't learn.
0	1525781894	-5	Back down to sub 9k hahaha
1	1525782020	4	The concern trolls are back.
1	1525783241	0	Enjoy your money markets and CD's pleb
2	1525783351	1	This doesnt even make sense
0	1525781271	-1	And straight down...
0	1525797311	1	 Guys I have question if I understand it correctly, If for example vechain goes to 7 dollars, and I bough it at 3.5 dollars, and then I trade it with etherum which is for example 700, it is logical then to trade it to USDT on binance and leave it there for a while while vechain probably goes down, or should I trade for etherum and send it to GDAX and trade it to eur and wait? what is better option? 
1	1525799022	1	I'd say USDT because of the withdrawal fees of Ethereum to GDAX from Binance
1	1525800473	1	Trade it for USD, not USDT.
