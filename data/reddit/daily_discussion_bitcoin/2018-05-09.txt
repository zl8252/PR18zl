0	1525867064	20	Whew.  I really thought Iâ€™d wake up to 8600.  So for this I am happy 
0	1525871635	15	The support above 9k has been unbelievable for Bitcoin as of late. Now we just gotta HODL!
1	1525874037	5	And buy 
2	1525874469	3	HODL + buy = not sell.
3	1525887353	1	buy + no sell = HODL++
2	1525874399	2	Buy the tip, sell the dip 
3	1525874867	2	I strongly caution anyone doing this to only day trade a small percentage of your stack. I only do 10% for fun. Think how you would feel if you sell a lot of your stack at the tip and then all of a sudden a giant green dildo appears and the price jumps over 1k (it just happened a few weeks ago). Then you miss out.  With institutional investors getting ready to jump on the train this could happen unpredictably and the jumps could be even more dramatic. 
4	1525876598	2	That's how the game works, more risk more potential gain
5	1525882297	2	True, but the same fools that were taking out second mortgages on their house and buying crypto on credit card last year may be tempted to day trade their whole stack.  Good way to lose it all on a dip  I advocate a more balanced approach. 
0	1525855354	9	Good day all, I know it's early but good to see we showed a decent amount of support to get us above $9k very quickly.  
1	1525864526	6	I think bitcoin is very strong above 9k
1	1525869528	3	The weekly MACD histogram is still looking good too
1	1525865458	2	When I went to bed we were flirting with 8.9â€™s, so it was nice to wake up and the price was magically above 9.2k again ðŸ™‚
0	1525863451	7	What is the reason for the big slide this past week? Things were churning upward so nicely. Thought we were breaking 10k easily. Is it because Bill Gates opened his yap in opposition to crypto? I thought he was a good guy. Gotta protect those billions, Bill? After all, wouldn't your software be a 'fairly direct' cause for people buying and selling drugs over the internet? Hypocrite.
1	1525869502	6	Stop panicking over everything. The reason for the slide may be simply because bulls failed to breach $10k. Also don't try to understand every market move, that's a one-way ticket to madness.
2	1525869670	3	Who said Ã­ was panicking? Just asking people their thoughts...I'm not the one going mad here..hehe
3	1525882589	2	Just calm down, bro.  If you calm down we can have a rational conversation.  I just need you to calm down first.
2	1525873332	2	I agree, we failed to reach 10k so there was some profit taking by the day traders.  
3	1525891631	1	what about the day before that? day traders trade everyday, so it shouldn't make a difference. if it's day traders fault, there is no hope, since it will always be day traded.
4	1525893128	1	When I use the term "day trader" what I really mean is short term trader. We saw a 40% increase in a month. If someone put in hundreds of thousands, that's worth pulling out.
1	1525863481	10	My dog farted.And if you have ever experienced my dog farting, you know Iâ€˜m not joking. Dog farts are *not* funny!
2	1525864587	1	LOL!
3	1525893915	1	heheðŸ˜ƒ
1	1525872421	3	Just some healthy profit taking. We rose a little too quickly. 
1	1525872746	2	so are we blaming Henry ford for automobile accidents now? lol.
1	1525875329	2	Your mom sold all her bitcoins at once and bought a dildo machine.
1	1525865532	1	Ha...Thx for reminding me of that.. he did comment about bitcoin being used as a way to buy drugs..laughs which you are correct it convitcs himself because of his software... !! you need 1,000 upvotes
0	1525877567	4	How's the Rat Poison this morning?
0	1525871132	3	Just received my "I got lightning working" stickers,  I really like how well the stickers fit into the remaining space on my notebook cover. Next up in line is the genesis bag and a poster from bitcoinshirts, also payed via lightning.Lightning is real and it works Ladies and Gentleman.
1	1525876331	1	Yep I bought food last weekend using lightning from savoryeats.com food truck it was awesome 
2	1525885256	1	It's just so exciting to see something you truely believe in succeed and having that confirmed by having a physical item in your hand, throwback to buying my first lunch with bitcoin.
0	1525879040	3	Damn I just had to buy another $1k worth - more of an emo buy and messed up my DCA but in light of next weeks BIG meet up in NYC and an expected Bull Run... regardless always a good time to buy - 10k next week Iâ€™m betting on it! 
1	1525896587	1	Letâ€™s bet
0	1525885963	1	Does anyone else feel it coming in the air tonight?
1	1525886080	1	Oh Lord.
2	1525886139	1	And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life.
0	1525852968	5	The Support at 9000 seems to be strong. 
1	1525854136	4	you  mean support?
2	1525854277	1	Yes - edited
3	1525856155	1	But do you mean "support"?
4	1525859619	2	Think he ment support
5	1525862042	3	Did you mean 'meant'?
6	1525865103	2	I meant "mint".
6	1525869237	2	I meant ment 
7	1525869333	1	Fkn lol
1	1525866774	2	You just jinxed it.  Prepare for 8k.
2	1525876262	1	I'm ready for the blast to 20k I just hope I can reach my accumulation goal before it gets too crazy... 
3	1525879638	2	Same here lol. I'm enjoying the low buy in. 
1	1525853538	2	Famous last words
0	1525872374	4	Hi all.  I just popped by for someone to tell me to stop panicking. 
1	1525873211	6	stop panicking!
2	1525874076	3	Thanks guys, I was starting to lose it there.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0GW0Vnr9Yc
1	1525874000	5	Donâ€™t panic and donâ€™t forget your towel!   Weâ€™re going back up now anyways 
0	1525863656	2	My simple suggestion, let the sellers finish their job before catching the price at cheaper price. Never go against the gains.
1	1525872169	2	 Against the GAins... that's where I'll stay-ay.. Swimming upSTREEM, I maintain against-the-gaaiiins!
0	1525884596	1	Capture the dickline!
0	1525886031	1	According to Bitfinex, the dickline has been recaptured. We are back on track! 
1	1525886219	1	30 min volume good.  We may have one worthy of Stormy.
0	1525855807	2	Btc is on the rise again :)
0	1525862257	2	$8500 is the "floor"  :D
0	1525863433	2	To the moon!
0	1525865327	2	SHORTS GETTING BURNT
1	1525866576	1	That's not true.
0	1525867475	2	Wasted aggaaain in Margaritaville...  loooooking for my loooost shaker of 10k...Soooooome people claim that there's a Buffet to blame, but I know...
1	1525871890	2	It's Obama's fault?
2	1525877536	2	Certainly.  Its Obama and the Deep State and the RINOs and Hillary and Stormy.  :-)
3	1525878357	2	Don't forget the white hats! Hats off to them!
0	1525852933	2	Im off to the gun shop this weekend, so if all you bull whales would make some moves in the next few days, that would be swell. 
0	1525865419	1	**Keep going Bulls, please don't let all the hard work of the last few weeks go to no avail.  As always your efforts are greatly appreciated by all of us.**
0	1525863779	1	close 9300 today.
1	1525876285	3	Btc doesn't close 
2	1525889599	1	neither does your momma's legs
0	1525870461	1	It is sometimes hard to ignore such manipulation theories
0	1525881766	1	Should we do the wave? Lets go Bitcoin chant? Read aloud the little Bitcoin that could?
0	1525882630	1	Spaceships w/spacesuits \- going fast people. Dirt cheap
0	1525882821	1	Just put my first big (ish) chunk of fiat into Bitcoin, been waiting for an entry point and I think this is it... I can smell the bulls coming :D
0	1525884723	1	Hmm.  Time for the 9300 meme?...  Yawn.
0	1525888709	1	Do people here use coinbase or is that for noobs like me?
1	1525888872	1	I'm using Trading 212, it seems easier
2	1525892152	1	You don't own your crypto on it?
3	1525893741	1	You can still profit easily from it. I could withdraw Â£10,000, but I'm waiting.
0	1525894842	1	On Coinbase. If you have Bitcoin in your BTC account and have a US linked bank account, you can transfer it in USD's to that account but it takes up to 3 days. You can "instantly sell" your Bitcoin which will go into your Cash USD coinbase account, can you then instantly transfer USD to your USD linked bank account?
1	1525895561	1	No. It's not instant. It will take several days to reach your bank account.Also, transfer your BTC to your GDAX (same as Coinbase) account and sell. Save yourself some transaction fee.
0	1525895377	1	yay I'm back into crypto again
0	1525895834	1	How will Bitcoin evolve as a currency? As of right now, the process for acquiring, storing, and trading Bitcoin isn't exactly straight forward for the average person. Especially older people who didn't grow up around technology. At the end of the day, people want something that's user friendly and convenient. How can Bitcoin achieve this without centralization? 
1	1525897845	1	Bitcoin doesn't need to achieve that. Bitcoin is just a protocol.Other services can and will achieve that, using Bitcoin. Yes there's still work to be done, but if there's money to be made, the work will be done.And it isn't about centralization. Bitcoin is decentralized. Period.Other services might be centralized for a time, but competition will drive the decentralisation of those services.
0	1525897342	1	I sold my coinbase bitcoin and it arrived in my account today so im happy about that
0	1525867762	1	Shouldâ€™ve bought 6 hours ago
1	1525873302	5	the best time to buy was 6 hours ago. the second best time is now.
2	1525876517	2	Should we sell now or 6 hours later?
3	1525876909	3	Sell 2020.
2	1525876371	1	The best time was now. The second best time is 1 minute from now 
0	1525869797	1	Hyperbitcoinatization when? Will it happen?
1	1525876153	3	2020, For sure.
1	1525876386	1	Soon 
0	1525886277	1	**KEEP FIGHTING BULLS!**
1	1525886430	1	I tried fighting bulls, but got a horn through my matador's pants.
