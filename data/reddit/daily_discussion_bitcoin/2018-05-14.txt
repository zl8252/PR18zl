0	1526306137	1	Here we go guys. Don't be surprise to see big pumps during consensus 2018.
0	1526306725	1	Wow looks like this is FOMO time. Glad I loaded up this morning.
0	1526306816	1	Everyone's saying consensus is a dud and then this happens lol.
0	1526308797	1	Let’s get to 10k this week !!!
1	1526311001	1	When Moon? When Lambo?
2	1526313850	1	pffffff  child
0	1526306102	1	Consensus FOMO kicking in. See y'all on the moon.
0	1526307808	1	Did Snoop Dogg just buy into bitcoin?
0	1526311547	1	The f guys what’s up with blocks... been waiting for hour already for confirmation. 
1	1526311810	1	Not sure, same shit here going on 3 hours; the unconfirmed was at 6k when I sent it in now were looking at over 22k unconfirmed
2	1526311963	1	Fu.. that’s what I hate about BTC... even when you put normal fee... it’s still can stuck for hours 
2	1526312086	1	Two blocks in few minutes... without my transaction... guess 20 sat is low again?
3	1526312325	1	Yep idk, not sure what is going on this is really insane though I for sure will never expect BTC to handle my transactions in a timely manner again.
4	1526315156	1	just for info: are you guys using coinbase as a source for your transactions?
5	1526315267	1	Yea coinbase. Will never again, final straw was this. Still unconfirmed, 4 hours or longer now 
5	1526316001	1	I’m not, using electrum on my pc, good old fashion way :)
0	1526311778	1	Happy to see that push this morning. Was honestly feeling pretty down a couple days ago but my belief in Bitcoin will never die! 
0	1526314589	1	6K NEVER AGAIN!
1	1526314974	1	I now own .75 coin.  Not a lot but it’s a lot to me. 
2	1526315834	1	That's not a lot?
2	1526317954	1	Is a lot bro
2	1526318158	1	it's gonna be a HUGE amount soon.
0	1526291389	4	I know you hate this question, but let’s have a meaningful discussion and try to analyze what is the possible answer of this months old question: When moon?
1	1526292795	10	20 July 1969
1	1526304495	3	We had a massive bull run that may not return for a few more years. But the pipes are being built so I wouldn’t expect to wait too long...maybe 2019
1	1526298566	1	If we don't see bitcoin at least around 17k before the end of the year I would be surprised.
1	1526304284	1	Honestly for me since the two, or three failed attemps to make 10.000 a big floor \(and so is becoming roof\). I didn´t expect the moon, so I move Hold to Trade just a month ago, cutting losses and saving profits. I am ok with this situation, of course I prefer moon, but this situation is ok too, but I understand that most of the holders were upset. 
0	1526299691	3	Is anyone here attending the Consensus meeting over the next few days?
1	1526299778	3	No, but perhaps taking a peek into the livestream: https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/live/
0	1526306031	1	lol, wtf just happened xD
1	1526306117	1	wached too xD it will just go down again :/
0	1526306538	1	Anyone else at work and listening to the Consensus live?
1	1526306687	1	Oh I didn't know you could do that. Where can you listen/watch it?
2	1526306910	1	https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/live/
3	1526306970	1	Thanks awesome. I'll be watching it all day lol.
4	1526307050	1	Same here bro.
1	1526307519	1	> Anyone else at work and listening to the Consensus live?Fed shilling the dollar 
0	1526307868	1	Look at that greeeen dildoo!
0	1526311528	1	Live Consensus stream: [https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus\-2018/live/](https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/live/)
0	1526304268	3	This is how it goes: 5% Mt.Gox, 50% fudded from news about Mt.Gox, 10% unaware traders, 35% fudded from the first 55% generated red
1	1526305278	1	Soooooo. you’re saying this is from Mt Gox?
2	1526308148	1	I'm thinking someone exploited the consensus thing to manipulate fomo in xD
0	1526306579	1	Woohoo! 😄
0	1526309886	1	God I love bitcoin
0	1526289248	6	Bitcoin: consistently shitting the bed since 2018
1	1526304067	2	If 6-8k is shitting the bed, and it's "the bottom" of 2018... I look forward to December of 2018. 
1	1526311301	1	"redditor for 3 months"  This is cute. Going down 80% is a Bitcoin bear, this is nothing. 
0	1526311334	1	**Come On Bulls, get us above $8800.**
1	1526316736	1	Fuck yeah!
0	1526311691	1	**West Coast Push!**
0	1526306381	1	https://cryptowat.ch/markets/gdax/btc/usd/2hNice volume, thanks New York.
0	1526308633	1	I just witnessed a lot of broke dick spoofing on both sides just now. Stupid bots...
0	1526310982	1	got a ways to go if we want to get to the 200 day moving average.  looks like the volume has dropped since the bump
1	1526311120	1	Ideally we would get above $9k but $8.8k at close today will be ok. 
0	1526314944	1	I really don't know what to think of this rise. Sure, I'm always happy when the price goes up.But it looks suspicious to me. A return of the Bart times?Anyway, I hold and buy the dips. Everything will be fine in the long run...
1	1526315339	1	Consensus, bub.
2	1526315443	1	I doubt that they all come together in a big hall to press the buy button in the same second...
3	1526317810	1	Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.  Hopefully the event can push it over 10k and maybe we'll see some FOMO after.  I dunno...  I just want my lambo already.
1	1526318436	1	Classic case of self-FUD :)
0	1526298970	3	There’s a good chance that we’ll see a spike after the consensus followed by a massive dump. We will keep seeing spikes and dumps and will not reach 15k until Mt Gox (the giant terd stain) is scrubbed and finally forgotten.
1	1526303862	3	You people continue to give too much credit to the Mt Gox trustee...
2	1526304459	0	I am absolutely sure that the Mt Gox trustee does not have ANY interest in the daily discussion. Its a fact that Mt Gox is and will be liquidating. If that reflects the average cost of BTC so be it.
1	1526303911	2	It's convenient to blame Mt. Gox, but really, moving such a small amount is not such a big deal. 
2	1526304273	0	200k BTC is a small amount? 
3	1526304558	1	I heard he only sold 8k recently.
4	1526304645	1	8k today - 8k next week- 44k in September...........until they are played out.
5	1526304904	1	24 hour trading volume is over 780,000 Bitcoin. So about 1% of the daily market activity is going to make a big difference?
6	1526312957	1	New coins instead of same back and forth.
1	1526301689	1	Do you know how much Gox have left?
2	1526304541	2	$1.3 billion worth
2	1526301826	2	200k. ish
0	1526311773	1	What is going on with confirmations? I sent a transaction 3 hours ago with adequate fees (well over adequate) and we're looking at 22k unconfirmed now when it was only 6k unconfirmed 3 hours ago
1	1526312542	1	woo big spikes todayhttps://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,24h
2	1526312840	1	So what happens to my transaction? How is it that I sent it hours ago and its just sitting around not getting confirmed when it should have been long ago with the fees on it
3	1526313585	1	if you fees had been adequate, transaction would have been included already. I like this block explorer: [https://blockchair.com](https://blockchair.com) it estimates how many transaction are to be confirmed before yours gets included.
4	1526314341	1	Well, I guess coinbase decided to send my transaction with inadequate fees then :( so stupid
5	1526314719	1	Or to the wrong address? Hopefully not.
5	1526315012	1	did coinbase implement segwit yet? what are the first 3 characters of your coinbase address?
6	1526315616	1	1Nv
7	1526316174	1	yup, this confirms it, they still haven't upgraded to segwit.
0	1526307160	1	I said that yesterday would be the last day of $8k BTC, I was wrong.  Today will be the last day of 8k BTC
1	1526308808	1	I’ll save you the trouble.  Tomorrow will be the last day of 8k.
2	1526308850	1	Thanks!!
0	1526295777	2	Are we still expecting a surge upwards as it's Consensus week? 
1	1526303189	2	I don't know, can you repeat the question ?
1	1526297808	1	Yes. 
2	1526300050	1	Maybe
1	1526299527	0	No.
1	1526303000	0	Perhaps
0	1526288876	1	So bitcoiners, how did the weekend treat you all? hands up who was able to use BTC in their day to day activities this weekend?
1	1526300543	2	"Hands up who was able to use BTC in their day to day activities this weekend?"  \- the same order I've heard when police came to my home yesterday
2	1526300726	1	in hindsight, it kind of makes it look like im a really shitty cybercrimes detective  
2	1526303971	1	You should have asked how old she was...
1	1526291486	1	Drug dealers?
1	1526304192	1	It will go mainstream any day now....
1	1526311830	1	Helped friend set up first wallet,  sent some BTC
0	1526305925	1	seems like it's going to be a bumpy ride of volatility/uncertainty until these Mt. Gox coins are flushed out
0	1526306096	1	let it get it..!
0	1526318894	1	as a chinese,watch live all night is so hard,but i don,t want miss btc pull up!
0	1526289574	1	hi when moon
1	1526303904	1	in the monsoon... 
0	1526313730	1	The FUD from shills is like a manual.Price goes down: Haha never another $15.00 buttcoinPrice goes up: Hurr durr muh free tx's 
0	1526310855	1	For people who say blockchain tech is useless read this    https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-blockchain/hsbc-says-performs-first-trade-finance-transaction-using-blockchain-idUSKCN1IF01X
0	1526291134	-2	we need to go to 1,5k again to weed out the non believers and moon boys
1	1526306431	1	as long as anyone under 18 can buy coins, there will be moon boys. gotta take advantage of those that haven't felt the pain of losing real $.
0	1526293352	-6	MtGox moved 44k BTC to another adress. They are getting ready to make next big dump. 
1	1526293484	4	I'm a simple man.  I just hodl.
2	1526301487	1	Winning
1	1526304255	3	This is FUD, show proof.
2	1526306506	1	Yes it's FUD https://www.cryptoground.com/mtgox-cold-wallet-monitor/
1	1526293751	1	OMG I was about to write "Don't forget to open the parachute"
1	1526301982	1	Which, if it crashes the price a bit, would be a good thing for investors, or people wanting to get more. The lower the price the more likely I am to grabbin coinz, like L4D Louis and pills. 
1	1526295650	0	That's less than 10% of daily volume
0	1526297000	-4	[removed]
1	1526298453	2	I thought I read somewhere that address didn't belong to Mt Gox.
2	1526299185	5	I've read Mt.Gox BTC can't be sold till September 2018
3	1526308238	1	I read the Mt. Gox coins were being donated to my pet elephant.
4	1526309239	1	You got my point haha
2	1526302931	1	not a mt gox wallet. but that of a casinohttps://twitter.com/DumpMt/status/995960290914324481
0	1526290102	-16	Dead cat bounce#10kneveragain
1	1526290830	8	God, one little correction and everyone thinks it's all over and bitcoin is dead. This is nothing. The price can't just go up forever, there are always corrections.
2	1526294686	-8	"correction"Bitcoin has reached its ceiling.
3	1526294858	2	Ok, talk to me again in december and we'll see where we are at.
3	1526295328	2	Haha .. Ceiling ! ... Brilliant 
3	1526304015	2	yup, everyone knows that a deflationary currency never increases in value, especially over long periods of time. 
3	1526309251	1	lol
1	1526308538	1	What kind of dead cat bounces several times a day?
2	1526318036	1	Dead cat on a trampoline.
1	1526290206	-1	honestly, i'm using gut feeling and absolutely nothing substantial here, but I feel like bitcoin is gonna retrace to 6k in a few months, hope not tho
0	1526299959	-10	Very happy to see it lose all its progress.
1	1526301719	4	The price rising is not "progress". The price rising is "profit". 
2	1526303576	-2	Progress.
1	1526302497	4	GTFO No Coiner
2	1526303562	-4	No.
1	1526307936	1	Now you can fuck yourself, you crippled pathetic demon!
2	1526310555	1	Nah.
1	1526303573	-1	There’s a real good chance that it will settle in at 7.8k
2	1526306758	1	ahem
3	1526313573	1	yeah, I am happy to be wrong about my prediction.
