0	1526808665	3	wish i had extra fiat to buy more of this tasty dip \-\- this low volume is crazy as welledit: alright... pamp it
1	1526810481	2	Don't worry you have time, this is always the quiet moment. Real trading resumes in september. To move BTC up from here institutional money is needed. Not us, small HOLD'rs.
2	1526810573	1	why do you think september? and as much as i enjoy seeing the price rise, i hope you're right, it'd be nice to have a little more time at these prices
1	1526829616	2	Any theories on why the volume is so low right now? It's freaking me out.
2	1526836524	1	I'm more interested in the downward trending slope in volume \(in USD\) and what the implications are. For example, is that typical for consolidation periods? Is that typical of the bear side of a bubble? etc.
2	1526842200	1	people actually don't care about crypto, except those looking for quick money, and those looking to take that money from them. pretty simple if you ask me
3	1526845964	1	Not true, and you contradict yourself. EVERYONE wants quick money, except for you, right?
1	1526810563	2	Same,but im also exited for another bull run
0	1526832890	3	Nice little pumpity wump wump. 
0	1526835860	1	Let's see this thing cross 9k again! Fingers crossed 👌
0	1526836213	1	I miss the days when bitcoin wasn't under attack from all angles at all times.
1	1526839752	1	If Bitcoin can't handle it, then it's not good enough.But I trust, that it will be able to handle it...
1	1526842807	1	Best thing for BTC is no hype, like lately. At first it will scare, but then it will become normal and people also more confident in it.
2	1526845379	1	A little Hype is good to spread the news but too much leads to Spikes and Dips
0	1526813519	3	Can we get to $8500 today?
1	1526834876	1	There you go
1	1526818590	3	Yes, we can!
1	1526823449	1	we’re not getting any BGDs with this volume lol
2	1526825409	2	The situation can change in 5 mins but I agree it does not look too promising at the moment.
3	1526825549	2	yeah, we’ll see a massive volume increase once it breaks out but no one seems to want to take the plunge first 
0	1526822695	5	Where are all of the psychics and bitcoin wizards from one week ago that were telling us it was absolutely going to be at 12k by now? Just more proof that everything is speculation. Quit pretending you know the future. 
1	1526825733	2	Logic error: Proof that everything is speculation would require that every speculation is untrue.
1	1526831550	2	9,000 today, guaranteed. 
1	1526828895	1	Same place as all the people saying we were definitely going to 6k.
2	1526831282	1	Oh yeah, it can go either way. Just sick of people make "definitive" claims about what Bitcoin is going to do. Let's all agree none of us know jack shit about what the price will do. 
1	1526823058	1	I have seen the future ;-)https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/rstZQtKL-BITSTAMP-D/
0	1526809061	2	Does your Gdax update the price live?
1	1526811383	2	Seems to be lagging a bit, has done for a few days, not sure why.
0	1526809886	2	I have a limit order to sell BTC on Binance. If I don't want to wait for it to hit my strike price, do I have to cancel it before I can sell it at market? 
1	1526810981	2	Yes
1	1526811796	1	Yes. You can't have 2 orders that are selling 100% of the same thing.
0	1526820180	2	so if it stays around $9k until december we get $2k in january?
0	1526820733	2	Are the traders taking the weekends off now?
1	1526823122	1	Last week exhausted them
0	1526829270	2	**CRYPTO QUESTION**:   Yeah I’m new to the world of Crypto currency and I’m learning a great deal and thanks so much to the folks who have been kind to help me out. But I’m confused why if lots of people think that Crypto is going to shit and the bear market will last for who knows how long then why are we or I reading about these institutions and exchanges scaling up and expecting high volumes in the future. I keep reading Coinbase is scaling up. Goldman, JP. Why do all this if it’s bullshit? Thanks for helping!!! 
1	1526841266	1	Right now the the demand for bitcoin to pay  for practical applications like smart contracts, value transfers and payments are not sufficient to consume miners expenses who immediatly sell their block rewards to pay for power. To sustain a steady price or increase the price that shortfall must be made up by new investors and old investors adding to their positions. The motivation for bitcoin buyers without a practical need is that the practical demand will soon overwhelm the amount of bitcoins available leading to a great appreciation in price. A large practical demand for bitcoin is a few years off so now any rise in price reflects the success the pro-bitcoin media is having selling the narrative to ordinary investors.
2	1526841739	1	Thanks so much appreciate the reply!! 
1	1526830034	2	>Why do all this if it’s bullshit?Because it's not.
1	1526831756	2	Institutional money is coming in all the time but it's hard to have any accurate idea of when and how much.
1	1526832020	2	People react very emotionally to changes in price.  Just in the past few weeks, we saw BTC above 9k and people were partying like we're going all the way to 20k.  Then it drops a bit to low 8k's, and BTC is done for, we're going to 5k, 3k, etc.I don't recommend getting involved in crypto if you trade emotionally.
2	1526832208	1	I am more of what you call a HODLer I guess... 
0	1526833379	2	https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt/status/998232926230892545F
1	1526834255	1	I honestly don't know what that even means...
2	1526836363	1	Someone lost a lot of virtual money.
3	1526836657	1	But what *exactly* does it mean?I guess, someone was forced to buy Bitcoin for 8 million dollars at 8421, because his short position got liquidated. But I'm not sure...
4	1526837161	1	Somewhere between 8m and 80k if he was leveraged 100:1, which is quite likely. He probably made way more in previous trades, so he was probably gambling for fun here. It's still satisfying to see such big shorts get liquidated since it moves the market though. There's a reason this isn't allowed in many forex markets, iirc 50:1 often is the limit.  Nothing compared to this of course: https://twitter.com/lowstrife/status/994854901195923456

0	1526834430	1	Are we to feel bullish even with the low volume?
1	1526834527	1	I always feel bullish.
1	1526838321	1	My pet bull Roger is feeling more bullish than usual - so bullish in fact that he killed one of my servants this morning.So yes, there is genuine bullishness in the air.
2	1526838394	1	I thought I smelled fresh bull in the air. Thanks for the confirmation.

0	1526818089	1	* I trade in BTC pairs. Is there a quick formula or a calculator other than the one on CMC for calculating BTC &#37; gain for setting stop sell orders? I get stuck on all being based on the SAT. Doesn't that price always fluctuate because Bitcoin flucuates? Therefore calculating the sat stop at the time I place my order may differ at the time the order triggers. Is that not true? What am I missing here? My calculations work, they're in the ballpark but seems there has to be a better, more accurate and faster way than my number crunching on a calculator and paper.
