0	1526913471	8	It looks like ~$8.5K is the consensus price. We keep coming back to around $8.5k, and we may stay in that area for a while, at least until there's a major change in the market or a very significant news. 
1	1526922634	1	I feel like even significant news doesn't affect the price anymore like it used to. And I agree that we're going to hover around \~$8.5k.
1	1526914622	4	What was the major change or significant news in nov/dec last year?Do we honestly think the markets are that rational? When was the last time you saw any correlation between good news and price increases, or bad news and price decreases?
2	1526915851	2	The market was significantly different last novermber and december, it was a full on wild FOMO market. We are in a very different market now, that's why we're hovering around this price. Unless there's a significant shift, it's gonna be more of the same.
3	1526917850	3	Price stability sounds nice to me. I'm all for it. 
1	1526916759	2	https://bitgur.com/chart/interest  Looks like it's us vs them. Let's show them.
0	1526896996	8	Ver is literally paying news outlets to interview him so he can trash Bitcoin.  The singular method of their attacks are to change Bitcoin's name to "Bitcoin Core".  
1	1526897563	9	Yeah, I'm a fan of letting the two co\-exist peacefully and letting the market decide, if Ver wasn't going around trashing Bitcoin, saying it's Legacy or Core, etc.. not to mention all the other shady shit on [bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com), etc..  but because he is, fuck Bcash/Ver. I am definitely ready to see that dickhead fade into obscurity.
1	1526910603	0	Are any babies being harmed during these interviews?
2	1526915373	1	Every day
0	1526910697	4	If BTC was an equity, I would say that BTC has hit a floor, but BTC is not an equity, so I am not sure.It sure seems like it though.
0	1526922794	1	Lower.
1	1526934667	1	Higher
0	1526923085	1	so, this was the bullshit pump and dump weekend
1	1526926206	1	Does it mean we're approaching a pump?
0	1526903301	4	Bitcoin chart on google trends looks awful.
1	1526910580	4	Google trends reflects new interest, half of the world knows about bitcoin already they don't go on google everyday and type bitcoin you know.
2	1526911333	2	"Half the world" is a bit of a guess. Regardless, no new interest isn't an ideal scenario either.
0	1526895557	4	Can we make $8750 today?
1	1526910793	3	Today we can hodl
1	1526912029	1	Possibly.  50/50.
0	1526906430	2	Bart simpson
0	1526902341	3	**Come On The Bulls, lets go for $8900 today and then have a great week where we go for $10k.**
1	1526909583	0	If you want to get a better idea of what's going on in experienced traders heads and their predictions, head on over to r Bitcoin markets. 
2	1526909843	2	Ok cheers :)
2	1526914366	1	But here it's more fun. üòÅ
3	1526917321	1	It is my dude, glad to see you're still buying the dip btw!
0	1526898195	3	Can't believe I've got nearly ¬£400 squirrelled away in crypto. I've never saved in my adult life before! It's not as easy to spend and 2‚Äîstep security makes it more of an effort to access. I may make it harder and get a ledger on payday... 
1	1526900347	2	I agree, nice one.
1	1526898944	1	good for you!  crypto is a great way to save, especially given low interest rates and depreciation in fiat.
2	1526911951	1	Well, that's a strange statement given that crypto delivers %0 interest and has depreciated 60% this year against fiat.
3	1526912532	2	just zoom out.  bitcoin is up 400% over a year ago today.
4	1526914088	0	Bubble is over.  Deflating since Dec.
5	1526914474	5	Correction is nearly over. New market cycle is about to begin.
6	1526914842	1	50/50 and frankly, I would like to believe you.I cashed out at 8.2, deciding when to re-enter.
7	1526915044	3	Well, you might get another chance a little below 8k, but I wouldn't bet on it.
8	1526918842	1	If I really think it's going to go below 8k, I will be shorting it now.At 8.5, it's most dangerous as my take is that it really is 50/50.
6	1526919614	-2	correct. new cycle down to 2k
7	1526920056	1	You don't know what a market cycle is, do you?
5	1526914270	1	sure.  obviously if you believe that bitcoin has peaked, then it would be stupid to buy it now, at least for speculative reasons.  i don't believe that it has peaked.
6	1526915003	1	I believe that both 2013 and 2017 peaks were price manipulated.So, while it is possible, I think a 3rd peak when all the regulators' eyes are now watching is going to be a tough act.
7	1526915411	1	no doubt that the price of bitcoin has been manipulated.  and that market manipulation will become more difficult as regulation increases.  but bitcoin's steady climb since its inception can't be attributed solely to manipulation.anyway if you don't think it will go up then don't buy it.  are you trying to convince me of your viewpoint?  i'm not trying to convince you of mine.
8	1526918687	1	No, not trying to convince you.  Just deciding for myself whether to short/long or just wait it out.
1	1526900352	1	Nice man!! May I ask how old you are?
2	1526902538	1	30-40 is all I'm giving you! 
1	1526901398	1	is this good or bad for btc? your post confuses me
2	1526902504	2	Good for price. I'm HODL. Bad for adoption, I'm not spending. 
3	1526915698	1	I'm in this boat too
0	1526933566	1	Been thinking about this for awhile, gonna sell my entire position at 9k. Take my profits and go.Consensus took away my confidence in the market. Reddit hates Bitcoin, people who want quick money like Bitcoin. I don't like that. Open to hearing reasons to stay in the market but I'm afraid the technology isn't progressing. Anyone feeling the same way?
1	1526934608	1	Okay, let's ignore lightning completely and say technology isn't progressing.
2	1526934741	1	Lightning is cool, and when implemented for commerce perhaps I'll use it. I don't need to have money invested in the market to use Bitcoin in the future.
1	1526934628	1	You're bummed that Consensus didn't pump as hyped? Do you have any actual fear that Bitcoin doesn't have an absurdly bright future? My recommendation is to not trade on emotion, but rather keep educating yourself. Read books, not Reddit. Research development, not hourly price movements. If you don't have faith in the future and were just looking to make tons of money, you're better off pulling out.
2	1526935064	1	I wouldn't say I'm bumbed that consensus didn't lead to a pump. I'm bumbed at the quality of the talks and presentations. I want to protect my investment, that's all.Edit: One other thing, I wouldn't discard Reddit's opinion on Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is to succeed, it's young people who need to be willing to adopt it. 
1	1526935642	1	You might be waiting quite a while before you can sell at 9k.
0	1526909642	1	is it possible to send less than 1 satoshi via LN ? or 1 satoshi is the minimum requirement?
1	1526914650	2	Technically possible, yes, how that gets handled when you close a channel, I don't know. 
2	1526917825	1	Floor rounding
0	1526924919	1	Where my moon at fam?
0	1526932404	1	Patience is not simply the ability to wait \- it's how we behave while we're waiting.  **Joyce Meyer**In other words.....HODL
1	1526932794	1	Go for perseverance which is not stubborness. It pays off, patience not so much since once you get what you wanted it kinda became meh
0	1526934845	1	We touched bottom. Several times. First time 6k, second time 6.8k, then 7.9k and now 8.4k. Lower lows. Next stop: 10k to 1. of June. You‚Äôre welcome.
1	1526935350	1	Technically, you just described lower highs...
1	1526935395	1	lower highs as well mate
2	1526935527	1	yeah, lower highs as well, but with low lows it makes a triangle and breaking point
0	1526935134	1	The small correction is over. Now moon!
0	1526935151	1	fuck, I lowkey want bitcoin to not rise this fast so I can buy more
0	1526919710	0	Buttcoin UU
1	1526923296	1	Or saggytitcoin
0	1526896827	-2	Ah, it's good to be back! How's everyone doing? How goes the Bitcoin on this fine Monday morning boys?
1	1526898810	1	i'm good and you?  bitcoin is going sideways...
2	1526898895	-4	Doing great! That Bitcoin is always doing something isn't it?Also, who TF downvoted me? Lmao u/bitcoinalways that was you wasn't it?
3	1526901958	2	No it wasn't. 
4	1526907436	1	Lol someone hates me. I know it couldn't be you, you're good people BA. Bro fist ‚úä
5	1526908178	2	:) 
0	1526903644	-11	Is this it? The new norm of price will be what it‚Äôs hovering around or below. I feel this bitcoin fad is dying and we‚Äôll all be left in the red. Sad, wanted my lambo.
1	1526906384	3	Not sure if serious
1	1526914675	3	Sell all your bitcoin and go on with your life then?
1	1526904244	5	 Cool doom and gloom buddy 
1	1526915581	2	Invest it all in alts 
1	1526914535	4	the lack of patience here is astonishing...
1	1526918207	0	Go check the halvening calendar and the future effect on supply, it should pump you up. Unless you're in for the short term, in which case I cannot help.
0	1526926379	1	So, where is this 3k pump :==)
0	1526900782	-10	Ok Bitcoin, that's enough pumping, now go back to the abyss you belong to.
