0	1522676251	19	1. Buy Bitcoin2. HODL3. ???4. File for Bankruptcy
1	1522676872	3	There is a helpline pinned somewhere for option 3. DoNT do it!!! We are all in same boat
0	1522685096	17	I‚Äòm about to go on a shopping spree. Don‚Äôt even care if it keeps dipping after. Waited 3 months. I‚Äòm down 10% on my initial investment in November 17 and promised myself I would throw some more money at it as soon as i‚Äòm in the red overall. I remember all the people who missed this kind of chance (including me) several months/years ago. Not this time yo! Tonight‚Äòs the night. Edit: words
1	1522685764	6	What are you buying?
2	1522686999	3	Mainly IOTA since I payed way too much for that coin on my initial investment. Not interested in investing in ‚Äûnew‚Äú projects atm. Some ETH and REQ as well. 
1	1522685154	3	Let's gooooo
1	1522685225	3	Maybe wait for a day when everything is not green.
2	1522685425	4	Exactly, the green candles look positive, but in reality, it would be better to buy yesterday. I will wait if it is just a good day, or some trend.
0	1522685039	16	Wouldn‚Äòt it be great if we found a stable base at 7k from where we climb back up again veeeeery slowly? No FOMO December-bull run? Just a reversal of the last 2 month streched to 4 or 6?So noone will realize when we are finally back at 20k without any FUDstorms, sudden dumps and panic sells? I know.. thats not how this market works unfortunately.
0	1522682867	31	Capitulation phase initiated. Never ever seen this much negativity and disbelief in the market. I believe that the people selling now to ‚Äùtake profits before btc goes down to 6k again‚Äù are making a mistake. I‚Äôm taking positions in altcoins now. Institutions is soon finished accumilating and a megarally is imminent. I also believe its more important than ever to look on fundamentals. Before this crash it didnt matter what you bought because everything went up. Now however when a lot of people got burned in this crash and will be a lot more cautios where they put their money. A lot of altcoins will not go up from here but the good ones will rally a lot higher than before.
1	1522683729	4	The end of shitcoins were predicted multiple times before. They recovered today just as much as the solid ones. I think the lack of adoption will be the key factor to kill them off eventually.
1	1522683034	3	100% agree with you
1	1522683383	2	Completely agree. Now is a good time to stock up on altcoins.Most, if not all, the coins I am watching have pretty much bottomed out. 
2	1522684445	6	Completely disagree. Bottom is zero. BTC still will lead the way for 98% of the alts. If BTC drops to 5k, lots of alts will be back to their original start price. If BTC hits 3K the alts will be worthless.No one knows for sure, but I would not bet against BTC hitting 3k.Far from ALT season IMHO.
1	1522684261	2	meanwhile one is up 170% üòé
0	1522657959	13	Does anyone see this most recent pump as any more than another bull trap?? So bored of this now. This is when patience is most important
1	1522659431	13	Well, we have no way of knowing if this is the time or not, but chances are the downtrend isn't going to just continue forever. At some point the pump will be real - right when people are so jaded that everyone is just assuming it's another bull trap, is exactly when we'll break out and head up again.
2	1522661121	2	This, i know i should buy now but i will buy more once it hit 20k again, im tired of buying dips of the dips
1	1522658937	10	it will go up to 7,4-7,8 then down again below 6000
0	1522661777	13	Just lost 0.1 eth trying to time my buys in the AMB p&d. Lesson learned
1	1522666243	8	Lost 0.3 bitcoin down the back of the sofa
2	1522669383	1	Ah! A good magnet should do the trick.
1	1522662342	4	Lost like 0.2 btc fomo-ing in on TRON, gotta learn the hard way I guess
2	1522670563	1	Same here. I dropped similar on it at .22...Sun had his clownshoe stream and it tanked to .04..
0	1522663508	13	Was anyone else mildly disapointed that crypto did not, in accordance to the scriptures, rise to biblical proportions yesterday?
1	1522666999	6	It did not die, therefore it cannot rise from the dead.
0	1522679464	12	From being positive $40k to minus $500. Feel numb. HODL! Hodl?.. Hodlor... hodlor. Ahhhhh fuck it :DOn the positive. I have realised that money does NOT make you happy. It makes things easier. But it does not fullfill you. So thanks for this lesson crypto.
1	1522680435	8	I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôd be happier up 40k.
1	1522679810	4	It doesn't make you happy? Bruh, I'd be ECSTATIC if I was +40k what are you talking about?edit: i am one of those people who does believe money makes people happy, makes life easier, and provides people freedom.
2	1522680451	9	Let him have his coping mechanism dude, he lost 40k have mercy.
2	1522680412	2	I was ecstatic. But it was not happiness. Nothing actually changed in my underlying feelings. It makes life easier, and provides you with more freedom, BUT it isn't happiness. 
1	1522681899	3	Money is never an issue in life unless you don't have enough. It is just like sex in a relationship; it isn't important until it is bad and then it is the most important. 
2	1522682786	2	Yes that is true. I suppose I am looking at it from a long term view. $40k would not even buy me 1/10th of a house where I am from so really what was it providing me other than relatively superficial things.
0	1522649801	24	You guys VeChain wtf. 
0	1522658420	24	How are XVG and TRX still a thing? 
1	1522658691	15	How is TRX the second top traded coin on Binance?
2	1522659435	8	It has been for months now. 
2	1522662844	3	Well you gotta keep the mass and the bots happy with a mainstream shitcoin even in crypto eventually.
2	1522664065	2	2nd? i always see it on first. ETH pairing i.e,.
3	1522664239	1	I meant second after Bitcoin.
4	1522667371	3	im assuming its cause of very loyal and active bots. Ive never met anyone who day trades in TRX. 
1	1522671310	1	how are most coins still a thing
0	1522662729	31	So... I got into Crypto so I could earn millions with relative ease, spend all the huge profit on having sex with 1000‚Äôs of sexy bitches, pussy galore, buying big fancy properties to show off to my niggaz and travel the world without any commitments.The aim was to have no worry about money ever again all the while getting higher than Bob Marley every.single.day.  Instead I‚Äôm fucking 85% down on my original investment and only have $15 left.
1	1522663275	21	I doubt investing only $100 will help you get all that. 
2	1522669529	4	I think he put it on flappycoin hoping for it to hit $1000 per coin.
2	1522677045	2	$100 in Ant Shares (NEO) exactly 1 year ago would be worth around 300k today. But yeah, that's a rare exception. :/Edit: $1000 would make it 300k, $100 would only be $30k. 
3	1522688235	2	That's not true. This time in 2017 it was worth $0.21. Selling at $150 would yield only about $71,000 from an initial investment of $100.
4	1522688301	2	You're right, I was mathing half asleep!
1	1522663146	28	*little did he know, he was the one who was going to get fucked*
1	1522664320	2	Buy the dip, you will make me richer.

0	1522650762	77	Nice of the mods to delete the VEN news thread within 5 mins of it being posted, while if you sort by 'new' there is a heap of shit that hasn't been deleted.Nice and unbiased.
1	1522650860	23	This needs to be at the top. Unless, of course, it gets deleted.
2	1522650907	5	Well another thread about it just got posted. Let's see how long until that one gets deleted.
1	1522652152	9	[Here's the new rules](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/85u48v/three_new_rule_changes_on_rcryptocurrency/)  - Specifically:*Coins, tokens or projects being listed on exchanges or having new pairings listed.*Ironically, this has resulted in all mods hating all coins that list on new exchanges (If you listen to public opinion that is) and being "salty bagholders" whenever said posts are deleted.
2	1522652484	21	This is a really stupid rule.. Exchanges accepting tokens is a large part of staying informed
3	1522652562	7	Think the theory is that people talk about it in the daily thread (Like people are doing in the daily thread) instead of standalone threads, as there's not really much to say other than *"Hooray, X listed on Y!"* in those.
2	1522657527	2	Sure, fair enough if it's against the rules.My issue is mainly how quickly it was targeted making it obvious that there is bias. There were plenty of posts against the rules posted earlier than the VEN listing which remained up while that post was removed.Some of those posts have now been removed. This clearly shows that the mods aren't moderating in order, but cherry-picking what to remove.
1	1522663641	2	yes I strongly disagree with this rule, it is south korea now but if a coin I want gets listed on binance I would like to know as fast as possible and without having to look at the daily thread to find out
0	1522684979	9	Cryptos just gained an entire years worth of interest in the stock market in 24hrs. The amount of money to be made in this market is insane. 
1	1522685156	7	How?
2	1522685716	5	I‚Äòd guess because of all the volatility.
2	1522689792	2	unlike any other market... crypto doesn't sleep.you could be trading 24/7 365 
1	1522686622	4	and how about the last week?
0	1522686369	7	[Guys, I just realized it‚Äôs the month of the lambo. We‚Äôre saved!](https://imgur.com/a/O41E6)
0	1522688889	9	I think I'm willing to pay someone to get me break even at this point. Is such a thing even posible? Almost 80% down now. 
1	1522689533	2	Trade all for BTC/ETH. Wait 1 year. You can send me a check when you break even. 
1	1522689697	2	It‚Äôs crypto. Everything is possible.
1	1522689314	3	This isn't a video game. You can't throw $100 at someone to elo boost you.Just be patient. 
2	1522689407	5	> Just be patient. Nice way to lose even more gains. 
0	1522660921	8	i'm rich i'm poor i'm rich im poor i'm rich i'm poor i'm rich im poor..oh look its a whale, it appears to be friendly, back to square one
1	1522662982	1	Looks like a dolphin 
0	1522683810	8	I have $1000 usd to play with but I‚Äôm a noob and always wanted to buy crypto. Been looking through reddit and articles for almost a year on information on do‚Äôs and don‚Äôt and I‚Äôm still stuck on what to do. Once I buy a coin, do I sell it for usd or do I sell it for another altcoin amount? Don‚Äôt know what wallet to use either.
1	1522683890	9	Most of the people that got rich in crypto bought and held for a long time and forgot about it.  Now is a good time to buy again, much better than when it was setting all time highs every day.  But people were fighting to get in then and now you can't make them buy, humans are weird.
2	1522684978	3	Yeh... They would've killed for these prices 3/4 months ago. Well.. Here they are but " crypto is dead " 
0	1522690441	8	December/January: I wish we could go back in time so I could buy moreMarch/April: Bubble? FUD! Sell sell sell!Beggars can't be choosers 
0	1522658810	33	Mined Waltonchain for two days and nothing. Meanwhile, you have paid shills posting photos of 2,4,6 coins earned already. Thanks Walton! Keep on doing the great work! *strong arms* *rockets*
1	1522661047	3	Did you use their new software to mine? I also tried to mine something, but nothing happened, lol. 
1	1522665653	3	Someone told me yesterday the coins being mined arent actually WTC, but just a worthless test token. Can you clarify?
1	1522660125	2	I mean if they mined it on their 16x 1080TI mining rig and you mined it on your 20 year old PC its possible. 
2	1522667773	2	Only 1 gpu is usable at the moment and the 1080ti is about as efficient as a ryzen 1600x.But surely difficult to compete against a bunch of threadrippers.
1	1522660783	1	I mined for like 30 hours on an old I7 @ 2,8 ghz.Got 2 WTC after 13h...but since then the miningdifficulty has doubled. The more people mine it the less frequently the rewards will come fore people like us.
0	1522654599	15	Holy mother of Jesus look at that price increase for VEN. It's going mental. Damn, this is exactly the same as the ICX increase.
1	1522656860	6	still sucks when you bought it at $4
2	1522658351	5	Yeah but it had to be done to get the X-node.
2	1522676289	2	Greeting from 8$ brotha
2	1522658588	1	Or 6....
2	1522670063	1	To be honest any coin you've bought during the bull run will be much lower now. Either average cost down or hold for quite some time.
0	1522652991	25	I miss the memes the most.Any chance we can get a Meme Monday? 
1	1522654436	10	I do too. I get some don't like them but in the current market i think a laugh is needed for most. We've had some rippers over the last few months - the recent "load Korean FUD" one springs to mind. As well as the one with coins flying all over the place in that stunt town ad, and the intersteller "good place to HODL" one. 
0	1522650088	20	I moved 40% of my portfolio from NEO to VEN literally 2 minutes before it pumped then managed to sell it at 43k sats. What a good way to end the day.
1	1522651998	10	Fuck dude, congratulations. Buy a lotto ticket tomorrow.
1	1522650292	5	Nice, I was tempted to sell my stack but I would lose xnode status :(. You going to hop back in? 
2	1522650435	3	Going to wait for this to settle down before I hop back in, I‚Äôve learned by now that these pumps don‚Äôt last 99% of the time. Moved back to NEO for now.
1	1522653640	2	Did the exact same... high five!
0	1522649822	7	Why the vechain pump?
1	1522649888	13	Listed on bithumb 
2	1522650093	1	Can't see it there.
3	1522650196	3	https://www.bithumb.com/event/e20180402_coin_openHere is the relevant information page.
0	1522663630	7	Why green?
1	1522672059	3	Some whale decided to make it green.
2	1522672462	2	Nice whales
0	1522680499	8	Come on BTC, go throw up somewhere to reach 6K and then you will feel better 
0	1522663971	7	One day I saw a TA of BTC price which predicted 100k$ end of year. Please link this because I can't find it anywhere! Thanks
1	1522665260	23	https://i.imgur.com/BjCDvtX.jpg Got you bro 
1	1522664113	15	I can draw you a TA that will predict BTC at 1MM end of year if that will make you sleep at night
1	1522664020	9	That TA guy has been burned at the stake 
2	1522666387	3	He could be right yet
0	1522669636	6	How do you pronounce OmiseGo? 
1	1522669742	12	Oh-me-say Go?
2	1522671447	3	This is the correct one.
2	1522671230	1	You say go I say stop
3	1522673103	1	You say run
1	1522673323	13	OmisoHorny
2	1522674302	2	Ome love you long time
1	1522670577	11	Om-ma-gawd
1	1522669746	7	if it's the Japanese pronunciation, I'd think OH-mee-say-go
1	1522677073	4	Yu-Gi-Oh 
0	1522687609	6	Ronnie Moas on Twitter saying BTC has now bottomed out, he is now starting to buy. A lot of other crypto Twitter peeps saying rebound and final drop to 5800 before the big bounce. Hmmmmmmm
1	1522689602	5	So why would he announce that do you think? Every time I hear something like this in a big downtrend I always think the same thing: he‚Äôs already in, worried he bought high, and decided to try to get people to move it up so he‚Äôs feeling safe. They were calling $7300 the bottom  left and right a week or two ago. 
2	1522689936	3	They‚Äôve been calling the bottom since the fall started back in January, and they‚Äôve been wrong ever since. They‚Äôll continue to be wrong also.
1	1522687705	3	Whales might try to pull BTC down some before the bounce.  But it's exciting either way.  That was a cold winter
0	1522690721	6	Oyster just pushed their airdrop date back by a week and it‚Äôs dumping hard. 
1	1522691484	3	Do you think ublock origin is going to be able to block websites that use PRL?Serious question. I use it and so just wondering. 
0	1522661030	13	Any bearish comments are getting down votes, that's plain stupid market is bearish we shouldn't be deluded by optimism until btc breaks $12k
1	1522661562	3	(Fairly new) What is the significance of BTC reaching $12K? I also see people marking $7,700 as the indicator. What are you/they basing this indicator on if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?
2	1522662146	7	Its not so much an indicator. Its the next big resistance Level, we failed 2 times while trying to break out of the bear. If we manage to smash this resistance, money on the sidelines moves in big time and we got Our Bull market back. 
3	1522662247	1	Thanks
2	1522664369	1	Watch some ta guys on YouTube they all say about the same levels. 
1	1522669360	2	They are? Not sure what you're reading. Might have been the case a month ago but i think it's the reverse recently. Downvotes for either are stupid in my opinion. 
0	1522650462	18	Ven time bois lets go. 
1	1522650511	8	What‚Äôs going on with VEN?! 
2	1522650661	9	Got listed on Bithumb
3	1522650791	6	Ok, that was unexpected.
0	1522651074	9	Lol my new investment strategy might be to choose established coins not listed on the likes of Bittrex, Binance or Bithumb.  The best gains I've had are from the likes of 0x and Icx being listed on these sorts of exchanges.  
1	1522652030	5	Smart. Always a good reminder to set limit sells too so you don't miss the FOMO. 
2	1522666930	1	Can you explain this? Not familiar with setting buy/sell limits etc
3	1522670615	1	Of course. Type it into youtube with binance and you'll see a 7min instructional video that explains how to do it better than i ever could. It's good to set these because a coin might pump and come back down when you were asleep (you miss on profits) or the reverse and a coin might stuff up (WTC and their tweet for example) so you set a sell limit order that stops you waking up with a 10-20% loss. I definitely advise learning how to do this because in a market like this you need all the profits you can get, and you can let the exchange do its thing instead of you sitting watching 24/7. Good luck. 
1	1522652239	3	Any in mind?
1	1522651439	4	It's like Koreans can only buy coins on local exchanges or what?
2	1522653305	5	They can biy anywhere ~  but they frefer to only use korean exchanges because of ease of fiat bank transfers and because korean exchanges offer fiat/coin pairings.
2	1522653353	3	Sorry for spelling mistakes ~ typing on a phone sucks.
0	1522651352	11	Just sold my VEN nice 
1	1522651963	6	Grabbed some yesterday when it dropped under 0.006 ETH. Set a sell order for 0.0075 annd wondered what the hell happened. I'm not complaining. The FOMO for new listings is insane. I'll wait till it settles and set it up again.
2	1522652212	6	Good call, this type of upward momentum can only last so long in this state of the market.
3	1522652582	5	My thoughts too. While bitcoin is shitting the bed i expect VEN to rest back down. A lot quicker than ICX did. If the market was healthier I'd buy back in...maybe.
4	1522653130	1	Do you hold eth/BTC that you got from selling ven?
5	1522653345	1	That depends on if you think the market will go up or not. If yes then hold BTC rather than ETH, if no then tether
5	1522654205	1	At the moment BTC. it seems safer than ETH and after last time i remember BTC outperforming most alts when it began to recover. 
2	1522652151	1	how do you think this is going to play out? slow dive back to normal?
3	1522652595	2	As above.

0	1522691824	5	ven u aight, oh what is you doin
0	1522659327	10	New strategy. Buy coins that are likely to be on Bithump soon. Sell at the top and buy a new Coin that will get listed there.Just buy coins in the top 30 they will get listed there eventually
1	1522659509	2	Where‚Äôs the top? 
2	1522660368	17	On the opposite side of the bottom
3	1522660728	5	We got ourselves a smart guy here lol
0	1522654680	12	Any news yet on the ICX token swap? I haven't seen anything mentioned and unsurprisingly nothing mentioned by the team again. I get teams have delays but is it really that hard to post a tweet or a sub post just to let people know?! The team keeps shooting itself in the foot. 
1	1522655428	5	The team sucks when its about communication.
0	1522673181	24	Relax guys. This happens every april fools day. People are just cashing out to buy april fools preasents. Dont worry about it. We‚Äôll be back soon.
1	1522677028	2	Just wait till Asia wakes up 
0	1522655891	19	not enough people fell for the last pump so they are making it more convincing this time
1	1522656056	8	10/10 organic growth
2	1522656281	8	BTC plummets several hundred dollars in a few hours, no one bats an eye.BTC has an equivalent bump back up in the other direction a day or two later, out come all the comments of "mmm, yeah, looks totally natural, I'm sure this is sustainable" ... Never change, reddit.
3	1522656384	7	Because every time it goes back up a little it comes straight back down (usually lower)...

1	1522655516	6	I've got a good feeling about all this
2	1522655982	5	It's hard not to feel suspicious about these random pumps, but I don't mind them of course
2	1522655690	1	Why so? 
3	1522656379	2	Because I've heard enough princesses complaining and it is time for a positive sentiment to go with the green candles. 
2	1522660491	1	Me too. This extreme volatility happens before a spike. 
0	1522673356	8	The speed tether is moving up in ranking on coin market it will soon come to number 1
1	1522673875	4	>2% of the size of BTCSure is gigantic huh?
2	1522674463	4	Tether mcap is equal to the tethers printed, while bitcoin mcap is not equal to the bitcoin floating around. So bitcoin mcap is inflated, in this context 
1	1522675198	1	Last night in my dream i literally saw tether at number 2 position. BTC 1st and tether 2nd was all i could see, everything else was blurred beyond that.. woke up and was so relieved it was just a nightmare 
0	1522681725	8	I was up 20K till Jan but now I am down 7K from my initial investment. Never saved money for anything before but I did it for crypto. I would have spent that money on something stupid anyways. I am in it for the longterm and I honestly like the ride. 
1	1522682069	7	Healthy attitude, I‚Äôm in the same boat
1	1522683423	5	I've never gone into the red as of yet, but I saw massive profits erased. Like you, part of the enjoyment for me is the ride. I love the volatility. It's enjoyable to research coins and get involved in their respective communities. For those who see it solely as a get rich quick scheme, they are the ones complaining and exiting the market which they never planned on staying in for long anyway.
0	1522680352	5	I think it is very likely Blockfolio and Delta decrease your gains in crypto.  No sane stock person would refresh their portfolio even daily, certainly not on the minute time scale.  It just makes people panic sell and jump around and the whales collect all your profits.  It takes time for your investments to mature in value.  Most big increases happen on just a few days in the year and if you aren't in your investment at that time you miss it.

0	1522684467	4	What happened to the road to 6000
1	1522684852	10	Resistance is 7.1k.Just because we're at resistance doesn't mean we're doing anything positive.We were at resistance at 8k last week and 9k the week before that.Give it time-- road to 6k (and below) is still on.
2	1522685137	3	Thank the lords
0	1522687980	4	Electroneum is under 51% attack right now. it's thought it's done by Bitmain. Crazy shit.
1	1522688250	4	It's a perfect example of why security is the most important element of cryptocurrency.This sub loves to rant and rave about the evils of ASICs and PoW, but there's a reason why avoiding double spend attacks is necessary. You can have a coin that has instant transactions and zero fees, but it means nothing if the network can be attacked.Many alts can be 51% attacked right now because their hashrate is so low
2	1522689412	2	> Electroneum>PoW>ASIC 51% attack
1	1522688583	2	Really ? 
2	1522688937	3	yep. go to their sub. Bitmain developed a cryptonight ASIC
0	1522688483	4	https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/technology/blockchain-uses.htmlStories like this are what should make you want to stick around and at least see where this is all going.

0	1522684852	10	This sub is a dying mess. This thread is the only reason to come here any more just to BS with my fellow bagholders.
1	1522685015	6	Excellent. The bottom is near. I think we're creeping into capitulation territory soon. 
0	1522652786	14	Wow this VEN pump is getting sold off fast
1	1522652983	13	Profits are sparse in this desert.
1	1522654642	14	Check again. Not sold, not even close to finish pumping.
2	1522654932	6	FOMO got me, went all in 
1	1522653245	8	I mean, it's still up 20%. Can't expect it to continue shooting up without people taking profits, especially in this piece of shit of a market.

0	1522681591	7	there goes TRX finally :') been waiting all day for a pump
0	1522665978	7	When everything on your watchlist is green, except the things you‚Äôre actually invested in..... 
1	1522666822	3	Too true. I bought back in yesterday and managed to buy one of the only things that isn't rising. 
1	1522674494	1	About as hard as seeing everything bloody red yesterday, except Verge. 
0	1522677181	7	HELP! Sent 0.5 ETH to Vitalik, that bastard then blocked me on twitter! 
1	1522677535	6	Send me 1 ETH and I‚Äôll blast your .5 back
0	1522689606	7	Looks like we already passed the worst part of the downcycle, the recent buying has shown that we're now bottoming out at around 6K and that new money will come in after the April 18 tax deadline.If you're tethered then its a good time to start getting in cheap again.If you're hodling, then keep on HODL!
1	1522690409	4	I've heard this so many times over last three months
1	1522690126	4	Look at that delusion.The state of this community. 
1	1522689985	1	Wall street bonuses to tax deadlines. I think we have enough reasons to HODL and lose money!
1	1522690516	2	That's adorable.
0	1522650367	3	So what's the deal with tethering? I though people were screaming it was the biggest scam ever and the bubble is going to be due to tether? Now it is ok to tether to short bitcoin? Am I missing some obvious negatives? Why should I not tether?
1	1522651209	10	Tether avoids audits like the plague and could collapse at any time. It's just currently popular because we're in a bear market.
0	1522657945	3	Woahh just checked first time in hours and Ven up 30% what gives?
1	1522659046	12	The Phoenix rises from the ashes. He is never wrong
1	1522658908	3	Bithumb
1	1522660945	2	They got listed on bithumb
0	1522682992	3	just liquidated all my Cryptopia holdings and transfered out NEO..fingers crossed
0	1522685979	3	Seeing RSI on 1D charts of ETH/USD, I see it being oversold. Is it a good time to buy then?
1	1522686067	2	Yes.
0	1522689368	3	Anyone know what happened to Crypto Daily (YouTuber)? He hasn‚Äôt posted in over a couple of weeks and usually does so daily.
1	1522689447	2	I know. Doug Polk and Crypto Daily have been absent for weeks now...
2	1522690048	5	Doug Polk Crypto stopped making videos... shows his true character. He was making 2-3 videos per week during the bull market run in late Dec and January.When crypto investors truly need the support he's not there.Disgusting really.
1	1522689666	2	Yeah where did all the crypto Youtubers go?
0	1522690815	3	I usually purchase BTC/ETH in Coinbase, wait the clearing period and then transfer to Binance.... if there any way I can deposit Fiat USD and get it to Binance without taking market risk during the Coinbase clearing period?
0	1522690905	3	BNB coin question. I heard that having it reduces your fees. Do you have to buy and sell from BND to another alt or sell from an Alt coin to BNB to recognize the reduced fees? How does the lesser fees work? Can you buy and sell with BTC/ETH and just hold BNB to get reduced fees?
1	1522691270	2	Just have BNB in your Binance portfolio and activate the setting. Whenever you trade, the fees are paid with BNB no matter the trading pair. The fees paid in BNB are 50% if what you would've paid in the trading currency.Doesn't work for transferring fees unfortunately.
0	1522685130	8	Most of you don't even realize how early you are...
1	1522685273	4	Sorry :(
1	1522685192	5	Yes, it is early morning where I live, technically
1	1522685621	5	what if i told you it can be better being late
2	1522686257	4	Wow u made my day.. better late than Never and regret later
1	1522685705	4	I realize but I‚Äôm therefore mostly afraid because I think the majority of my holdings are going to be non-existent in the future however I feel they are the best options right now. 
2	1522686060	2	Could be true. You just have to keep in touch with the market and keep learning and researching. 
1	1522685570	7	bitcoin is almost 10 years old
2	1522685780	3	Imagine. being 10 years old, and still early. what a supporting argument to OP's well done m8
2	1522685645	2	But it only gained traction 2014 (correction: 2013) , there is still a long road ahead of it.
1	1522686221	6	I was just thinking about this.  Time in market is everything.  People that bought BTC at $6 or ETH at $6 probably just watch this crash with amusement because it really doesn't make that much difference to them.  I want to be one of those guys some day.   Buy alts, store in wallets, and keep investing fiat.
1	1522685522	2	go on
1	1522686041	1	just no.. that was a privelage of the pre-2017 investors.
0	1522672099	6	BTC below 7k againTether boyos on the rise
0	1522676736	9	Imagine if Chase Bank offered a Chase Bank Coin. Owning said coin would lower fees for all purchases made with your fiat. Not owning said coin would increase fees for all fiat purchases. Essentially they incentivize you to give them more money for less fees. You must buy the right for lower fees, instead of simply lowering fees on all transactions. Would you all be open to this concept? Sounds like a greedy cash grab, no? BNB does this and they are never criticized for it. Don‚Äôt understand it. 
1	1522677095	2	But the market decides the value.
1	1522677092	1	Would the coin go up in value and I could resell it for more money?  If so, sure.People are in it for the money.  They don‚Äôt care who controls the coins.
0	1522688063	11	everything is finally low enough that i'm ready to put some significant money in. now is the time. only problem....is i don't have a significant amount of money to put in. can anybody recommend any legit pyramid schemes that i can get rich quick with so i can afford more cyrpto? thanks in advance

1	1522660903	2	Its called partnership and QLC is awesome thank you very much 
2	1522667632	1	It's called bots that buy any coin detected to be mentioned by CZ thank you very much. And yes, I'm sure QLC is awesome.
0	1522657425	6	Yea guys go chase the pumps and buy high you have no idea how few of these moves will rekt you btc wise in your portfolio value.
0	1522662750	5	so... *looks out on deck* the next gonna be a bail whale or a fail whale? either way, please hodl my hand
0	1522665537	5	Any reason why Vechain went up 25% over night?
1	1522666525	13	Listed on Bithumb
1	1522665784	9	exchange listing
2	1522665890	3	Yeah I should've just scrolled down farther. Thanks
0	1522683982	5	Is it a good idea to sell some of my alts for BNB since there‚Äôs gonna be a token burn soon? So price of bnb should def go up? 
1	1522684098	2	Yes, I did, riding BNB until the coin burn 
2	1522684132	2	Nice. What‚Äôs your expectation of price  and when is the burn? Should I do it ASAP? 
3	1522684435	3	Always dangerous to speculate, but I think +40% is possible from here to 4/15 pending market conditions... At the very least, if BTC gets hammered in the next 2 weeks, I believe BNB will fare better than the alts 
4	1522684546	6	Awesome. I‚Äôll go ahead and do that. Thanks 
5	1522684783	5	good decision. BNB has a future.
0	1522685588	5	Is it weird that I have wet dreams every night of the market recovering and slowly gaining traction for the rest of the year, then as bitcoin gets ready to break 15k and people start fomoing and and getting ready for ATH around new years, kobayashi san market dumping every single bitcoin he holds for fractions of the cost and the market tanking to 100B?
1	1522685636	6	yes
1	1522685652	4	You are twisted. 
1	1522686632	2	Jesus, man. They'd make movies about that. Let us all hope that the courts are benevolent and decide to make the creditors of MtGOX whole rather than reward a criminal. The shitstorm and civil suits following the liquidation of assets to Mark Karpel√®s would wreck bitcoin for good. 
0	1522687562	5	Are we seeing BTC level out?  I think we're going up soon....  Place your bets.
0	1522687769	5	Man Neo im sorry for killing you. Every since I bought into Neo its been an ugly ride. Yes I know all coins got wrecked but Neo hasnt rallied or much resistance. Which is strange bc before I got in it rebounded really well
1	1522689195	3	Neo is still significantly up from October....
1	1522688248	2	Same. I inject some hopium and hope for the day China endorses crypto and makes NEO the number one. But a man can dream.
2	1522688450	2	Vechain bitcoin and neo are my only coins. Vechain is my baby with neo as my 2nd child holding. China will make or break my crypto dreams, tbh not worried at all about the big boys of china crypto. China has a plan but first it has to take total control of its crypto landscape. Its just limiting the growth and one day the floodgates are gonna open. Neo and vechain/wtc gonna eat when that happens 
1	1522688676	2	its closer to ATH then most coins out there...
1	1522688638	2	ETH and NEO will be the quickest to recover whenever we begin to pump.
0	1522651747	9	Missed the VEN pump :(. It will cool off to old levels tough, like ICX. Still hurts :(
1	1522652430	7	I have this feeling too, it‚Äôll correct sooner than ICX imo. ICX had a build up hype towards the listing date, but VEN straight up got listed
2	1522663349	1	thought it would be the beginning for ICX but now we are back to this still at a mad loss from when I bought it for 76k satoshis and didn't sell at their 'big event' in january. have no hopes for VEN holding this lol
1	1522651985	7	ICX pumped for a few days when it got listed on Bithumb so it might not be too late to jump in
2	1522652208	3	It's interesting. Tthe market was in a slightly healthier position during its pump. I'm just going to watch to see if i should buy back in or whether it will drop futher. I think the later - people have been starved of profits so i think people will sell for now.
1	1522651925	0	I feel like it might go up to 4$ ish and its at 2.9 atm
1	1522652011	1	I dunno, should I sell and buy later? I worry it will stay high...
2	1522652093	3	We can't know. It's pure hype. The coin isn't even trading yet on bithump. What I know is that ICX got pumped hard and it's now bzck at it's old level again.
3	1522652372	9	I sold it, and hopefully buy back at lower price again. I want to have it long term, but this was too good to pass.
4	1522652691	3	Smart. My thoughts exactly. I like VEN but in this market at the moment...i don't like it enough to pass on profits when i  could swing it into another coin and swinng it back once it settles. 
0	1522665183	7	So is vechain going up 26% due to Bitthumb listing not allowed to be posted as news here? 
1	1522669321	7	no cause mods probaby don't own any
2	1522672146	2	To be fair, I don't mind not having posts about every random coin hitting a random exchange. VEN is my jam, but it's a trade off I'm willing to take. 
1	1522668751	1	Yes sir, and the contest I think they're having for it
0	1522668230	8	Omise go pumping really hard...Edit : 20% 
1	1522671183	4	One of the best and most underrated projects out there 
0	1522669318	8	So VEN fomoers, how does it feel
1	1522669628	6	I sold ze pump, caused ze dump.
2	1522669685	1	Probably buy back in at 37k satoshi 
1	1522669911	3	sold at average 42k sat, feels good :^)
1	1522669991	4	Anyone buying an exchange pump like this will get burned. Its a classic big-news-chart.
0	1522687784	6	WTC tweeted ‚ÄúUnprecedented Mysterious Gift Coming Soon‚Äù and ‚Äúgood things come to those who wait.‚Äù Just seems odd. 
1	1522688494	6	maybe someone forget to logout of the WTC twitter account and just wrote what was in his fortune cookie? 
1	1522688145	3	Lol their awkward English is so cringe
1	1522687929	2	Announcements of announcements works for Justin, why wouldn't it work for WTC?
1	1522688320	3	Doesn't seem odd at all considering this is WTC. They probably saw the price tanking and decided to pull this stunt to help stop the bleeding. Scams gonna scam. 
0	1522659962	8	go go ven
0	1522668544	16	Lower highs and lower lows and there‚Äôs posts proclaiming that ‚ÄúHODL‚Äù has come through.I think this may genuinely be the most retarded community on this site, which is really saying something. 
1	1522668826	22	Makes as much sense as posters like you that keep complaining that bitcoin hasn't dropped lower. So much so you can almost feel the keyboard being mashed as you write comments. 
2	1522674018	4	Public interest is gone. Google trends show a hype free fall. Adaptation is embarrassing, yet shitcoins are still valued billions of dollars?! We have a long way down to go mate.
3	1522674541	1	They're not really valued that much. Shitcoins have super low volume so trying to cash out any significant amount would dump the price a ton.
0	1522660671	6	I would be excited that we are going up again, but what if this is another 1 step forward and 2 steps back?
0	1522676795	5	I am looking to convert a little eth into Stellar and Ripple. I‚Äôll still end up holding mostly eth, just want to diversify slightly.If the XLM/ETH and XRP/ETH prices are higher then when i first bought my Eth in march - then does this mean it is a bad time to convert? Should I wait for the ratio to decrease? Does a lower ratio mean that ETH is becoming stronger than the alt pairing or vice verse?
1	1522677250	3	Buy alts with BTC/ETH when BTC/ETH are expensive and sell alts when BTC/ETH are stale/going sideways and are bear territory. EDIT: The timing on this isn't always perfect. Look for the alt coin to be bottomed out before purchasing it, IMO. You don't want to buy alts with BTC/ETH and then sell it for less BTC/ETH. That way you're literally losing BTC/ETH. The only way someone should/can justify doing so is if you're able to sell back that BTC/ETH into FIAT and have more FIAT than you did before you bought the BTC/ETH to begin with.
0	1522679650	4	"Good things come to those who wait..." Doesn't apply to just WTC, but everything you hold.Any guesses on what the 'mystery surprise' may be?
1	1522679912	4	There's a GMN carved into the moon in the image. They'll be announcing Guardian Master Node rewards. Unfortunately, it doesn't concern the rest of us
2	1522680077	2	Ahh. Thanks!
0	1522679371	6	Do people really think that bitcoin is going to be worth 100k and everyone not invested in it (almost everyone) are just randomly going to decide to use this hugely valued thing. Why would the general world adopt crypto currencies with inflated prices that just means they are increasing the wealth of a bunch of unproductive people who just "invested in crypto yo".Why would all the general people in the world not just fork a crypto currency to make a new one without the baggage of all these speculators hoarding the supply of the coin and thus driving up the price and reducing the amount of the coin in circulation to actually be "adopted"? Answer: they wouldn't. When the world is ready to adopt cryptocurrency then it will be a new cryptocurrency created for that purpose by international cooperation. 
1	1522679632	5	Gold is/was more or less useless. At the end of the day, it is just a shiny, malleable piece of metal. People just arbitrarily decided to give it value, too.Why cannot be said same of Bitcoin? Why do we suddenly need another crypto that is used for purpose of "international cooperation?" Why can't BTC be that crypto you're talking about? 
2	1522679757	5	Yeh, BTC can be a digital gold potentially. It will never be something widely adopted and used though. Think about it. Everyone says they "believe in the tech", but do they really? Who here uses bitcoin for transactions? I would guess <0.001%. Who here hodls? 99.999%.
1	1522681310	2	If you use satoshis and not an entire Bitcoin, it's not really that expensive... At $100k, 1 Satoshi is a penny. Also, if people who own it and have a vested interest in it try to make it more useful themselves (e.g. create apps that accept BTC as payment), then it could grow faster. I think we as a community should be trying to make BTC more useful. When large institutions start seeing BTC being used more for smaller businesses, they'll follow suit. That's what I'd be doing right now especially if I was a Bitcoin whale. Just funding projects that use BTC. 
0	1522665836	2	Would love Eth to go back up a bit so I can get back into BNB! Sold it at the last ATH for Eth and then it proceeded to drop like crazy :(
0	1522673885	2	Best top 5 projects for this year?
1	1522677489	7	1.) IOTA2.) Oyster (PRL)3.) Request4.) NEO5.) VechainEach of these has varying amounts to go, but I'm a fan of the projects and their use cases. They're each consistently hitting their goals, they communicate well, and I've liked what I've seen from their teams.
1	1522675771	1	Where the devs are

1	1522684676	13	It's spring now, everything should be turning green. 
1	1522684488	3	Recovering from the nastiness of the weekend to where it was last week. It isn't green because it is moving up due to new investment it is green relative to where it was. 
0	1522684738	2	What are some moonshot projects that you guys currently own in your portfolio?
1	1522685154	4	PRL is a favorite of mine with the airdrop and mainnet this month. Origin Trail (TRAC) is my high risk high rewardMy sleeper is Relex (RLX) which I am following heavily. Look into this one
2	1522686533	2	Just checked RLX. Idea seems interesting, but the website seems not really up to date (in maintanance). How is it looking with them? Do they plan some airdrop?
1	1522684962	7	REQ.  #93 on CMC right now, 101 million market cap.  Currently 15 cents and had a $1 ATH.  This seems easily doable since the team is very good and has a good track record of meeting their goals.  I think it can easily go past $1, their goals are incredible, they basically want to replace the online payment, credit card, and accounting industry.

0	1522650729	3	Yay! Thank you mods for sticking this thread. 
0	1522668986	2	I'm a simple man. I hold POWR and set a high  sell limit and then a lower buy. Rinse and repeat. If you look at the binance hour candles it happens once a week. 
1	1522676869	2	Would this work with a lot of coins? Buy 10% low, sell 10% high?
2	1522677476	1	Yes. I do it with a coin I mine that has low liquidity. Patience pays dividends.
1	1522673788	1	Wrong. If this sub has taught me anything, you're doing it wrong. Buy low sell high, pfffttt who do you think you are?  
0	1522677817	4	According to Fundstrat, the current break-even point for Bitcoin mining is $8,038. Surely the miners are not profitable now? Why are they still mining? 
1	1522678249	13	There is no singular break-even point for mining. It is a range depending on how much your electricity costs and on the low end is around $3000. Some miners are definitely profitable and some are probably right around break even or operating at a loss. ASIC farms with cheap electricity are fine. 
1	1522680663	3	They don't cash out at such low prices I guess.
1	1522679885	2	They will shut some equipment down, the difficulty will drop, life will go on. 
1	1522680223	2	I don't have a farm, but I have several machines mining - it's still profitable for me - just not nearly as much as it was, and certainly wouldn't be worth buying any new machines currently.
1	1522678033	2	You don't think about today, you think about tomorrow, next week, next month, next year.What's shitty today can turn out to be fantastic for you in the future. You should be willing to take a loss in order to profit off it later. Also, not all places in the world is it that expensive to mine BTC.
2	1522678546	7	Incorrect. The second it costs more in electricity to mine a BTC than the value of that BTC, you shut down the miner. You're better off investing that money directly into BTC using an exchange until profitability is positive.
3	1522679656	2	<mic drop>

0	1522688776	3	Yeah, I was thinking about doing some crypto myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don‚Äôt know, kind of just for fun.I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a coin that is going to launch their mainnet, you know, like, like they‚Äôre tied into some crooked dealings, maybe their kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that?

1	1522672376	10	We‚Äôve been saying that every week. I expect more price drops 
2	1522672486	3	We have been saying the price will drop from 1300, 1200, 1000, 800, 700, 500, and 400...there is only so much you can drop to be still profitable for miners.

0	1522676558	4	It's amazing how little people understand investing, but pretend they understand why their magic internet money will moon.  The concepts are so basic and so fundamental, but people refuse to let facts get in the way of their dreams.  Buying crypto coins is awful as an "investment."  They might be useful for other things, but as an investment, they are absolutely absurd.
1	1522677271	11	I'd like to encourage you to explain your reasoning.
2	1522677623	9	Crypto coins don't generate cash flows.  You aren't buying shares of a company that's making money.  You aren't loaning money for interest.  You're buying a coin, which just sits there, it doesn't provide cash flow, it doesn't grow corn or produce cars or anything else, it just sits there doing nothing.  Then eventually you just try to sell this thing, which does nothing and produces nothing, to someone else for more than you paid for it.  It's not an investment.  It's not something you hold and should expect to make money on (outside massive speculation mania).  Can it be used as a medium of exchange, maybe, but why are you just holding them?  What do you expect them to do?
3	1522678570	8	"Then eventually you just try to sell this thing, which does nothing and produces nothing, to someone else for more than you paid for it."So you know, like gold, diamond, paintings, collectibles etc, which are valued the same way.. by other peoples desire to have them aswell.
4	1522679152	1	None of those would be considered investments.  It's pure speculation.  Here's what buffett thinks of investing in gold:Gold gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or some place. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.
3	1522678743	7	That's because most cryptos are commodities, not stocks in a company. Gold doesn't generate cash flow on its own. Neither do dollars. yet both have value and are actively and speculatively traded.
4	1522678999	3	Gold has other properties that crypto coins don't have, namely that people find it to be beautiful and so forth.  I also wouldn't consider gold an investment.  It is speculative and in the long run, investing in gold is an extremely poor decision.
5	1522679378	1	Investing in gold would be a wise decision if you could go back to its discovery, or to just before its wide adoption as a currency or currency backing. But today you're right as gold has long reached maturity.My point is more so that crypto is new and can't be compared to other commodities since its properties set it apart in too many ways. Comparing it to a stock doesn't make any sense though. That would only work for supply chain coins like VEN/WTC who do actually have products that their coin is meant to support (or other coins that have made some sort of software framework, and coupled it with their coin).
6	1522679719	2	It's not that big of a leap from existing concepts.  It will have its uses, but I have a really hard time seeing how speculatively buying these coins is doing you any favors.  There's no good reason for them to go up outside of speculation, and speculation isn't a good long term investing strategy.
3	1522679023	4	Great point. And the problem with ‚Äúhodl‚Äù. What people don‚Äôt realise is that bitcoins price rise has been down to PEOPLE USING THE BLOODY THING and selling it... from the guy who bought a pizza with thousands of bitcoins, to the guy who had 10000 bitcoins and sold them all at $0.10. These are the things that increased BTC price, yes after that you also had manipulation on the markets with bots, and mania / FOMO in 2017 etc but the primary factor for bitcoins organic price rise was people using it, people buy it and people selling it. Which is why ‚Äúeveryone should buy a coin to hodl‚Äù makes absolutely no sense.  Because how can a coin demonstrate its value if every owner just held..,Nice to hear from someone who gets it 
3	1522678393	6	This shows a fundamental lack of understanding as to why most cryptos exist. 
4	1522679280	1	and why money exists.
0	1522667669	3	Is this really an organic pump? I am a tether boy and looks like I am getting rekt :(
1	1522669186	5	Not really getting wrecked unless you're losing money.
1	1522668004	7	There‚Äôs a lot of resistance at $7200. Don‚Äôt worry unless we breach that. 
2	1522668305	2	Give it 1 hour..
3	1522671915	2	55 minutes later, still hodling my breath. 
1	1522668682	2	Dont think like that.  If it continues going up then you can join back in a start getting gains.  Do not focus on the idea that you could have got in earlier....  shoulda wpulda coulda doesnt change anything... just focus on the gains you can make going forward.  If it drops back down then you can rethink your strategy.At this point you probably should wait to see which way it goes.
2	1522671362	1	thnx, good advice
1	1522667986	3	Goooood, enjoying this a lot!
0	1522685025	2	So the next question will be:How far do you ride VEN when it finally lists on Bithumb to sell it again. Few hours ago I sold a bit too early and bought back too early (Only 10% profit :( ). Dont want to make the same mistake twice
0	1522685602	2	Wow dent is doing well !
0	1522686155	2	Silly question... do we know when Bithump is listing VEN? is there an exact time/date? 
1	1522686672	3	"listing on Bithumb will announce further"https://m.bithumb.com/event/e20180402_coin_open"They haven't announced a time or date yet.
0	1522689656	2	Please don't abuse BNB as you new DGD now!Edit: placed sell order at $20 - now abuse it! :D
0	1522691690	2	I see all these accounts posting "everything is so cheap, this is the perfect opportunity to buy X coin, the only problem is I don't have any FIAT to spare". These are just bots and shill accounts. The psychology is they make you feel like you're missing out so you buy in for fear of losing out. It's pretty sad that people fall for this. 
0	1522653012	2	Did ICX pump with the exchange listing NEWS then pump again after it was officially listed?
1	1522653146	7	Started pumping from 18th due to expectation, listing test announced on 21th - pumped hard, listed on 23th - dropped like a rock
2	1522653508	8	It's hard to compare it to ICX because like someone below said, the market was in a good spot when the listing announcement happened but everything started crashing a day or two after it got listed. Also, ICX had a pre-pump because people were anticipating it but the Vechain listing came out of nowhere.  Bithumb also announced a huge trading competition to go along with the Vechain listing. 
3	1522653810	9	Here's a link to that competition. Should keep VEN solid for a few days?https://www.bithumb.com/event/e20180402_coin_open
4	1522657513	3	Thanks for posting this, I nearly took some profits already
5	1522658922	1	I've read that we should be aware that it could be listed on 4th of April, which is a few days before the competition ends. So watch it around then because it could dump all of a sudden.
6	1522658956	1	Thanks for the info!
2	1522653249	2	Interesting cheers
1	1522653562	7	Yep. Basically went 0.0033 ETH to 0.0042 settled for a few hours then the news hit and it kept going for a few days to 0.0077 ETH before the slow bleed. 
0	1522664053	2	When do you think this little uptrend ends? Im thinking going back to tether at 7200.
1	1522666028	2	i second this. there are a number of big conferences upcoming in may, not just your typical news and announcements. As I understand it, youtube doesn't start banning ads until june, this is perfect timing. If you are deciding to get back in, my advice would be a little just before may. april is gonna be full of mini peaks and troughs unless you have the conviction to hodl through it all
2	1522669851	1	I was thinking about the exact same thing.
1	1522664490	1	Yeah I‚Äôm looking around the 7.2-7.4 range unless we look like we are going to have a breakout. 
0	1522689233	2	I shill ENJ a lot because it's my fave, but better than me talking about it might be listening to the lead developer talk about (footage just released from the GDC in San Francisco).Good points made from a game-dev p.o.v. particularly players being more reticent to pay for something if they know it can be taken away, or is a totally sunk cost.https://youtu.be/pLO7uBW6_is
0	1522685090	0	If I could downvote myself, i would.
1	1522685484	6	You can though silly guy
1	1522685155	5	i got you bro
0	1522650629	1	So if bit thumb raised Ven such a nice amount. What's their next coin/token? 
0	1522650873	1	Can someone please ELI5 how major corporations like Google, Facebook and Twitter banning crypto ads directly affects the market?Yesterday I was made aware of the fact that no new money is entering the market as of now. And someone told me in december that less than 1% of the worlds population own cryptocurrency. How will the general public flock to the market without being made aware of its existence? What will it take to open the flood gates?
1	1522654781	3	I don't think those ads reflected well on the crypto community or blockchain. There's a chance that they did it to suppress the markets for the time being to slow growth, either because they have their own ideas, they fear a competitor rising, or someone powerful doesn't like crypto for other reasons. It makes sense that they would want things to stay the same since they are all very successful right now. There will be a point that they reverse their decision and use all the networking influence they have to shill their chosen coins ("this is extremely dangerous to our democracy") and overnight in normies minds crypto changes from a meme that got some tech nerds really rich to a legitimate asset that might deserve a place in an investment portfolio.(I don't think this can happen with bitcoin being dominate, something like Ethereum would have a fresh start and would be more engaging to viewers with its potential use cases)
1	1522651110	1	if amazon.com as an example decides to accept bitcoin as a payment method it could explode.  but who knows if that will ever happen. 
2	1522653277	5	Then why would anyone spend it at amazon if it‚Äôs going to appreciate in value?
3	1522655904	3	Because people eventually need to buy stuff. I never understood why people think that this is such a compelling argument. Let's imagine that we live in a world where everyone has deflationary currency. Are people really just going to starve themselves in hopes of buying more food later? Besides, people could theoretically already do that. You already *can* dump all your money into long term investments and starve yourself, but no one does that.
4	1522656503	3	Ok they buy stuff, they use a currency that isn‚Äôt going up in value.
3	1522653457	1	??? isnt that the whole point of these cryptos?  to be able to use them?  
4	1522654284	3	Why would you use them if they are going up in value.It‚Äôs a catch 22 and biggest problem for crypto, for adaption you need to spend, to moon you need to hodl. It can‚Äôt do both.It‚Äôs either a currency and gets used like a currency or it‚Äôs an investment that will moon.
5	1522656357	2	Yeah. It would really suck if crypto also killed off the consumerism that is slowly killing the planet we're living on as well. 
4	1522654616	3	Most people these days are lambo boys who think they'll get rich for nothing just by buying some coins and do not give the slightest damn about anything else.  It doesn't work like that, of course, and I do think the preponderance of these people does put the whole movement in a precarious position now.  Ultimately, yes we need to see adoption and see it fast or else this whole thing is not only not going to appreciate any more but it will utterly collapse and bankrupt everyone.
3	1522654395	1	Purposely being obtuse?  You can buy more just as easily as you spend it.
4	1522654796	2	Not as easily. There's ton of fees to buy, you have to wait ages for your wire transfer. 
0	1522661246	1	Been researching crypto for a few months and finally made a small investment a few weeks ago so I‚Äôm fairly new at this. Are we looking at a short boost after reaching the support level like 3 days ago or are we on our way back up? What do you all think?
1	1522663218	6	a lot of people believe we are still going to drop. im one of those believers, but i dont think we have all that much to go. Im still expecting a drop to around 6k and possibly 5k at worst 
1	1522663123	1	We "all" think different outcomes will happen. If you're patient, you will have more opportunities for the price to reach what you want.
0	1522665026	1	Any thoughts about ZIL (Zilliqa)? I started reading into to this coin when it got listed on Binannce. I find it quite nice that they use a mix of POW and dBFT (consensus method also used by NEO) for their blockchain.
1	1522665802	4	The name is weird
2	1522666804	1	RIP, just took out my whole investment
1	1522666863	2	Iirc Thats the coin that NEO invested in, Which could be a Good sign..
1	1522666613	1	Nothing till Q3 when mainnet gets released.

1	1522677733	3	- 100 of Ripple- 75 of Stellar- 25 of something high-risk, high-reward, like LOCI or TEL. 
1	1522677110	2	I'm a big fan of FunFair, it'll probably get people's attention once the first casino goes live later this quarter.
2	1522678491	1	I have a minor amount of FunFair - what's their price target, do you know? Is the plan to gamble with the FunFair tokens themselves?
3	1522678868	2	FunFair's team doesn't make comments about price targets, but yes, FUN tokens are what will be used to gamble on FunFair casinos
1	1522674553	0	NANO and just HODL for 5 years.
2	1522675215	24	and then collect your 20‚Ç¨?
