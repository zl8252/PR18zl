0	1522764046	12	So I made an android app that shows 15 first cryptocurrencies -according to their market Cap.- and their price charts for the day/month/year/5 years.The app is free & ad-free because I wanted to make a resume.Where can I advertise it?It's this (Published right now)https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dataliz.blockchainmarket
1	1522766291	2	Submit a post about it!  I'm sure others would be interested.
2	1522766760	2	Thanks. Sorry I already had deleted my comment because I saw no answer.
0	1522768944	13	100%ing on BNB has been my one and only good Crypto move
0	1522760138	24	So Verge is pumping because some dodgy looking dude in a hoody calling himself a dev announces over webcam they'll release details of a mysterious partnership on April 16 (Originally promised last Monday)?
1	1522760359	11	And it was recently revealed that said sketchy dude has tons of money that coinbase won't let him withdraw and can't pay his shitload of crypto taxes.
2	1522761352	8	I'm actually impressed he is even paying his taxes. Does not seem the type. 
1	1522761164	4	Actually now it’s been pushed another day to the 17th. Was skimming through their subreddit this morning. Apparently he said that the new partnership company usually does their announcements on Tuesdays as the reason.

2	1522743868	2	KAKAROT!!!
3	1522744014	3	Vegeta > Kakarot. Vegeta should be the main character. I really wish they make a spin-off to dragon ball where Vegata is the main character of the series. He is Prince of all Saiyans after all. 
0	1522764944	11	Real question tho : where is CryptoDaily ? 
1	1522768453	2	I know he went ice age and I thought it was gonna be like a vid a week but nothing. I miss him. Maybe it was cause Doug Polk dogged on him for using not original meme content in his intros. Or he capitulated? Alt coin buzz Jeff is still putting out content and he has prob taken a beating. Crypto daily come back to us.
2	1522769587	3	There's plenty of things to talk about, it's not the ice age at all ! The real one stayed (DD, CoinMastery, Boxmining, etc) in the bear market as in the bull market.
0	1522765773	9	i lost most of my money by going in on ETH. makes up about 65% of my bags. so..i'm really stoked to see it around $400 again lol
1	1522765965	10	My personal opinion:ETH had such a strong pullback due to all the complete shit ICOs harvesting as much profits as they can before they die. Very unfortunate.I think ETH is one of the single best buys right now though, just because it's had so much "artificial" downward pressure from all the scam ICOs selling their shares of ETH just to reap as much money as possible before they croak.I would just say, either pick more up now, or hold long. I personally still think ETH will flip BTC, but it won't happen until the next wave of new money (since their entrance is BTC). Once BTC starts slowing down to a crawl again, the new money will exit BTC and ETH will have a massive push again.
2	1522766991	2	I've been thinking the same thing regarding the ICO's. Should hopefully be a good entry point now if you're not already invested, especially with casper and staking pools coming down the line.
1	1522766954	4	Me too because I fell for the diversification meme and put some of my Bitcoins into Ethereum at the worst time possible.
2	1522767055	4	i mainly did it last year when everyone was buying BTC. i knew it'd come back down but i thought the ETH flippening would happen with the awful btc tx fees and time.
0	1522743026	9	The promised lands!
0	1522743229	9	Not really sure what is undervalued anymore since most alts went up today. 
1	1522743962	8	Everything (except BNB) is still far away from their ATHs (at least most of my coins).
1	1522744890	15	NANO ?
1	1522745402	4	Look for coins that have a legitimate use case and a working product. Unfortunately, most of top100 coins are overvalued, overhyped garbage.
2	1522749524	7	pffft....are you calling TRX and XVG overvalued and over-hyped shit coins? HOW VERY DARE YOU/s
3	1522749735	3	I know, right?
0	1522773194	10	What do we do with our xvg and bnb profits? Yes, buy Tron #full-circle
1	1522773661	4	Im looking at ICX, token swap should be happening sometime this month. Could be risky with ICX as it has not fully corrected from the last listing run. Also NANO, but low volume right now, but it is almost 80% down from last run.
0	1522763069	8	I pray to satoshi that we break 7800
1	1522763604	3	8200 and hold.
0	1522740376	33	We are still far from despair, 2 days of green, and everybody starts yelling moooooon  again.Hope I am wrong though
1	1522741063	10	I am almost a 100% sure its irony and sarcasm
1	1522743204	16	We had despair. A lot of it. I don’t see why this couldn’t be a recovery. Looks quite bullish to me.
1	1522740858	18	Don't get too attached to that Idea. Stock market bubbles last longer than the ones in crypto. Despair happens after a year of nonstop losses and delusions. Crypto did that in 3 months. 
1	1522741594	9	I think when you start disbelieving in the green, that's when an actual bull run is coming. I don't believe it myself though lol
2	1522744195	7	A lot of people already do disbelieve in the green, every time there's a pump there's always a lot of people immediately assuming it's a bull trap and to expect 5k in a few days.
0	1522751255	24	How BCH is still at 4° place is clearly inexplicable...
1	1522753553	14	Same with XVG sitting at #23Edit: #21... unbelievable
2	1522753938	14	Verge up 45% after just going up 20%. Yep, market is still retarded.
3	1522755317	7	Signs like this worries me. Like no-one has learned anything and it just continues to be stupid money. Until they draw a huge dick on their website and leave people will still invest in everything
4	1522769020	2	You know what, I ain't mad about this. If it's causing another bull run like dec, I'll take it. And this time I'll be cashing out in time.
5	1522772151	2	Haha offcourse you wont see me complaining about that either. Wish i cashed out as wel. But for the market to grow up it's seriously nescessairy imo.
2	1522756265	3	Sunerok autographed coffee mugs bro
1	1522751442	6	It boggles my mind as well.
0	1522738483	7	thats alright, I didnt want sleep today anyway
1	1522738613	5	No one knows, bud. Bet on black or red and hope for the best. 
0	1522742108	8	ETH easy x3?
1	1522743617	8	Yup better get a 2nd mortgage if you haven’t already
1	1522742516	4	Who knows, was seriously  overbought in the ICO craze. 
2	1522743807	2	yes also the news that ~~binance~~ COINBASE is going to use ethereum for development--edit
3	1522745652	2	That's awesome! Do you a source?
0	1522751109	7	Why do i never read that private sales / pre sales etc. are a bad thing ? barely anyone seems to complain about it. So many projects sell all their tokens to ~50 private investors which get to dump the coins at inflated prices to the public, and all are just screaming great project and bla bla bla. 
0	1522769304	5	If this gift turns out to be lame then WTC is doomed forever lmao
1	1522769332	4	[removed]
1	1522770245	2	You say that but people forget really fast in this space. Look at people flocking to XVG right now.
0	1522776662	7	So I made an android app that shows and updates 15 first cryptocurrencies according to their market Cap. and their price chart through the day/month/year/5 years.I don't have enough karma in this subreddit to post it so please upvote me if you liked it.Also besides here, where can I advertise it?It's this:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dataliz.blockchainmarket
0	1522776712	7	Almost every coin this sub promotes ends up in shit. It's hilarious. I now purposefully avoid any coin that's popular here.
1	1522777330	2	Any coin being pumped here is gonna be a top choice for swing trading - highs and lows, with plenty of volume. So depends on what you're looking for.
1	1522778224	2	Almost like social platforms are targeted by sketchy projects that want investors without having to make a functional product. 
1	1522778553	2	Best advice in here.
0	1522755143	11	10k btc moves from a wallet and immediately there is a post mentioning that Mt Gox  is selling again. People are very quick to fud without any evidence. Its not even a Mt Gox wallet.
0	1522776919	6	Can someone explain what exactly happened with Walton? It seems like everyone on Twitter is a bot these days
1	1522777090	10	They just announced a 700 walton airdrop for GMN holders (People who held 5000 walton since early december). People who don't have GMNs got pissed.
2	1522778385	2	People who don't have GMNs and FOMOd after the first announcement are pissed. No one else is pissed.The initial tweet even had "GMN" written on the moon: https://twitter.com/Waltonchain/status/980790468907712512
1	1522777099	8	People read too much into a tweet for Guardian Masternode holders. And are annoyed that they got big airdrops.
1	1522777039	3	Had a big count down on twitter that had a moon with an astronaut flying towards it. It went 3-2-1 in a hour countdown. Made it seem like really big news was coming out and then they gave the Master Node owners 700 WTC. 
2	1522777108	2	Why? It would seem like air drops are for advertisement. I guess that’s why everyone’s pissed ?
3	1522777204	7	Yea its the way they did it. They did have GMN spelled out on the first on picture that was tweeted out. But the way they were counting down looked like it would benefit the masses not the elite. 
3	1522777301	7	A small subset of people just have a vendetta out for walton and then other people who only get their info from this thread jump on the bandwagon. This airdrop has been promised for a month and it was way bigger than expected. Congrats to all gmn holders. 
2	1522778273	2	Was massive news!
1	1522777438	3	Hyped up an unimportant announcement
0	1522779803	6	Can someone make a list of every stunt that WaltonChain pulled since summer 2017?From the top of my head; the rigged Twitter competition debacle, the clumsy "apology" of the same, the photoshopped photos of the team members, that one time where a DEV posted a photograph in front of a company HQ to "prove" a partnership, that one time where the DEV team visited a site out of charity and clumsily reported about it on social media, this latest stunt of unnecessarily creating hype around an airdrop to already loaded masternode holders.Did I miss anything? I have no personal vendetta with WTC, but I really resent the fact that these things make the entire cryptosphere look amateurish. 
1	1522780000	2	Yes but they have patents and an 80-strong dev team and amazing real world partnerships and use cases. Reddit posters have told me this so I know that it is true.

0	1522761100	15	Don’t mind me. Just patiently waiting for my NANO pump.... any day now....
1	1522761811	7	Volume so low on binance probs due to deposit issues
1	1522761724	3	why would it do so?
2	1522762285	3	I really believe in the tech behind NANO. I’m just waiting for some real adoption to happen. 
3	1522764148	2	> I really believe in the tech behind NANO. I’m just waiting for some real adoption to happen. Translation: I want money
4	1522764802	4	I mean... duh.
0	1522773087	10	I'm up negative 67% from negative 70%!Whatamigundooooo?!?!?!
0	1522750648	19	I don't get why people are so negative and hope that btc will crash to xxxx. Man, I'm 60% down and I'm still positive. I know it will get better eventually.Have a nice day
1	1522751124	17	Some people aiming to buy want the price to drop lower so they can invest with a higher chance of profit, which isn't necessarily a negative stance on crypto, just strategy. 
1	1522765186	2	You are one of these:1) Holder/Buyer: "These coins are such great value right now"2) Tetherer: "The bear market isn't over, it could last for years"Don't ever think that anyone posting anything here, whatsoever, in any way, at all, is talking without an agenda. At all, whatsoerver, in any way. Forever. Infinity. At all.Whatsoever.
0	1522743458	25	Terherers and shorters’ palms sweaty, pacing the floor, making promises to deities. 
1	1522743584	13	>palms sweatyWell I hope his knees are ok. 
1	1522746654	8	currently sacrificing baby lambos under the moon to crypto gods for the bull run to return!

1	1522744260	5	He's nervous.
0	1522756289	27	Btc is bouncing off support lines at the moment, likely to push down from resistance at around 8k usd in a week or so, some sideways movement before a strong run 🏃‍♂️ Disclaimer; I’ve got no fucking idea what I’m talking about
1	1522756454	4	Will not go up past 8k again without a fight
0	1522744509	16	Many are hoping for another bull-run.  I'm just hoping for boring, sideways action.  It's been almost half a year since I've had a good idea of what my coins should be worth. 
1	1522746426	10	We probably won't find that out until most coins are decoupled from BTC. I'm sure there are many coins that are horrendously under/over-valued right now but they're being dragged along by BTC. 
0	1522758287	14	Purchased more NEO at rock bottom pricing, and GAS dividends are always good. A crypto that pays me to hold it #noshill
1	1522759219	3	Maybe i haven't done enough research but gas generation seems super low and not much money. If you got in early it'd be amazing. But a $20,000 investment only generating 57 gas per year (used online gas calc) doesn't feel worth from a gas perspective. Good investment regardless and the generation is icing on the cake. Please correct me if i'm wrong about the generation.
2	1522761110	6	definitely don't buy into NEO just to accumulate gas...it's just a nice bonus for holding it.
2	1522760968	2	That would be a 5% return if the value of NEO and GAS remain steady. Nothing too crazy. But if gas went back to $60, you're looking at the value of those dividends increasing. I think it's a good mix of being an established coin with a *guaranteed income so thats why I hold about 20%
1	1522759281	3	How much % it gives you per month? 0.0001%? 
2	1522759580	8	Around 5% per year
0	1522745649	11	is the winter hodlcaust over??
0	1522768745	9	200% out of the woods invest life savings before it’s too late 
1	1522768860	2	Agree - now is the time to go balls deep in the market.   This would be the equivalent of going balls deep around October 2017
2	1522768920	2	I was joking, please be cautious. Going in now isn’t a bad thing I bought some today but it’s Always a gamble 
3	1522769007	2	Not joking - now's the time.   Take u/hellabraincells advice (he's a professional) and go all in right now.
4	1522769723	3	I’m a Sanitation engineer 
1	1522768955	2	Agreed as well, at least going BTC hard in 2018 and 2019. Expecting 2020, fun gains will be long gone.
0	1522763659	5	To tell you the truth, I can't recall last time we had two good days in a row.  Hopefully, we get two in a row.  
1	1522763868	8	we had 3 green days in a row on the 18th, 19th and 20th March.
2	1522765093	2	exactly. Ages ago!
0	1522768133	6	Did any of ya shills FOMOed into any coins this morning?
1	1522768367	5	BNB
0	1522771823	4	Turned 1 ETH into 1.58 because of BNB in the last few days, not bad...
1	1522771868	4	More room to grow on it you reckon?
2	1522771961	6	It was $20 last month even without a coin burn so I think so
3	1522772426	2	last time it was 20 was Jan 15th...
4	1522772484	2	Oops, I was looking at the wrong timeline.
1	1522772430	4	It seems unstoppable now. Large sell walls are being removed, not bought through, but removed. 
0	1522777070	5	Will never sell so far from the top no matter how long the wait will be.
0	1522737150	13	its a good day when tether is outperformed 
0	1522776876	15	Why's everyone getting whingy about Walton? It literally said GMN on the moon! Whoever read into it further is an idiot. And btw - that is an unprecedented amount for an airdrop. 14% is absolutely huge for those that have held through so much fud. You can either whinge or be part of a project that rewards their supporters so well.
0	1522769386	9	FUN = Stress Free HODL :)
0	1522737903	9	Europe wakes up, instant moon.
1	1522739312	2	I'm still too tired to moon now.
0	1522771955	15	Fellow redditors, just calm down okay. We have only had a day in the green and i see posts flying around over how the bear market has ended etc. Bitcoin held nicely at the support so that's positive but please.... We are 70% down from ath and one day in the green. This says nothinh
1	1522772637	5	But for once it was a strong green day to be fair. Good volume up. Support held.Cant complain. It is a first step.
1	1522772458	8	This comment is measured, sensible, and intelligent. It clearly doesn't belong in here.
1	1522772637	4	There are no external factors in control of the crypto market, except when people choose to buy and when they don’t. When the majority aren’t buying because they are not comfortable with something it’s called a bear market. When majority are buying it’s a bull market. If you are comfortable buying at this price and $1000 to $2000 above this price (and not putting in more money you can afford) then buy. No matter what any TA charts are showing at any given moment, the people through buying or not are in charge of whether it’s a bull or bear market. You can choose to be ruled by a chart or to rule the chart.
1	1522772110	5	This comment is way too sensible for this sub
1	1522772500	6	Yeah, I tend to do the opposite of what this sub feels is going to happen. Worked out so far :)
1	1522772429	2	go away with your common sense, wasasasasaaaaaaaap!!!
0	1522739946	4	Small trading profits bit by bit 5 dollars here, 10 dollar there i will get my lambo damit!!! In this life or the next!!!
0	1522751997	3	Interesting pump last night 
0	1522754709	4	Good article on The New York Times today https://nyti.ms/2uAHLKg
0	1522756219	4	Is anyone actually expecting the Cardano roadmap to pump the price? When Nano updated their roadmap nothing happened.
1	1522756767	3	Meh, i bought some back as well yesterday but it might be a bit too early, last update of the roadmap nothing too much happened for the price.  Still have big expectations for the project this year (mostly because of Charles Hoskinsons as leader) EDIT: yes i know, his twitter is him travelling the world eating food, w/e
0	1522762940	4	What is your plan for maximizing gains from the recovery?  I'm not saying it is here yet, but when it comes what is your plan?I'm thinking low market cap (#75-200 on CMC), high quality coins will rebound hard.  What is your plan?
1	1522764507	13	I'd stick with mostly top 100 with decent market recognition and progress to date. You are still easily looking at 5x to 10x to 20x for some of them long term. There are too many shitcoins amongst the 1500. Outside of top 100  it will be real dog eat dog, big wins and big losses.So BNB, NEO, OMG, NANO, ETH, BTC, ENG, ICX would be my favorites.  Even thw hype stuff like TRX has good growth potential because of gaming. Hype still matters.In the lower caps thinking PRL, LEND, POW, ‚FUN,
1	1522763670	13	Ride the BTC wave, as it should be the entry point to new money. But very shortly after alts start to rise more than BTC on any given day, you want to be where you just mentioned.I also think ETH will be an insanely profitable, because it crashed so hard, and is still just as valuable as it ever was. There's been a lot of downwards pressure on dying ICOs selling off ETH - which is a good lesson to learn from any platform play which uses it's currency to pay for ICOs. Once all the shit ICO die off and try to harvest as much cash before they die, the platform coin may die back a bit just from all the downward pressure. This is especially true if there are LOTS of really BAD ICOs. That downward pressure on ETH should be done soon, and it's likely going to rebound harder than BTC.Look at 2016-2017, BTC went 17x and ETH went almost 100x. I think the same thing will happen in 2018-2019... BTC will rebound but ETH will be better.Then, other super undervalued coins like NANO, NEO, OMG, VEN, WAN, ICX, etc, they could be even better plays than ETH longterm.Just look at something like Nano. That could either stagnate and slowly die, or it could become a #2 or #3 ranked coin, or even take over BTC one day (I'm talking like 5-10 years). The growth potential for some of these coins is INSANE.I mean, look at OMG... they seek to be the backbone of every blockchain transaction, not just currency, but new drivers license applications, real estate transactions, etc. It's a massively big goal, but they have a decent chance of doing it. They've also been working on plasma for 2 years before their ICO, and are MILES ahead of anyone else from implementing it. If they are first to the market with plasma, OMG will skyrocket, along with ETH. Add to that POS dividends, and OMG could also be the biggest play of 2018.I dunno, I'm just happy for a little stability. It's too early to tell, but I'd be okay with some slow sideways growth for a bit, with a slow trend of increasing volume.
1	1522764475	5	LINK, OMG & REQ for me. 
1	1522763876	8	BNB, ETH and OMG. BNB - Massively undervalued at the moment. Loads of good news and upcoming burn, but price has been dragged around by BTC.ETH - Heavily oversold compared to most big coins in this dip. PoS and big scaling solutions coming soon. OMG - Hard-spoon airdrop coming soon. Plasma very close to completion, which is huge for both OMG and ETH. Always been a promising project but taking it to the next level now. 
0	1522768305	4	Waking up this morning to it still above 7k is nice to see.

1	1522772052	2	Did they make some announcement of an announcement of an announcement or something?

2	1522778556	3	it also means that Bitmain have been mining ETH up until this announcement with their stack of miners, and now, before this announcement they want to pawn off their miners to us even though the ETH miner will become null and voidBitmain crooks
0	1522747920	20	This is a channel wide broadcast: To any hodlers still out there, the end of the storm is near. 
1	1522750494	24	People have said this every time there was a slight recovery since mid january. Literally every time. 
2	1522754375	5	The post comments switch to BTC 25k end of month and 100k end of year after a little rise. Then when the afternoon dip of $1-200 hits everyone starts panicking because “crypto is dead”. It is incredibly funny to watch. 
1	1522749683	5	I have fallen for this before. I went out for a pee. Wind.
1	1522750307	6	How many times have people said that? Every small rally after a huge drop people say this.

0	1522767248	9	WTC twitter has posted a cryptic message of a "3" with a moon and an astronaut in the background. I have some WTC but using "Moon" in your own twitter posts? really...

1	1522767703	5	I sold my stack after the Twitter scam debacle. So unprofessional. They keep pulling stunts like these. There are many projects that do (or aim to do) the same thing as WTC. Not much sense investing in a company that keeps pulling these unprofessional tricks.
1	1522767457	5	This is just more of the same bullshit from WTC team.
1	1522769317	2	And still people will fall again for this scam until the next debacle happens.

1	1522748336	15	Crying on reddit.
1	1522748372	11	Their plan is still to buy at 6-5k. We will get to 8 - 9- 10k and then they will FOMO back in. I guarantee it :)
0	1522747272	9	Just a reminder to the new one's in here: Sell the news happens. Don't listen to holders like u/stanklove1 that said VEN wouldn't dip after the listing - he said the same before the VEN rebrand and yet it dropped and slowly bled out 25%. It's nothing against VEN (I hold it) but sell the news happens 99% of the time and is priced in when people know ahead of time. But if you are smart you can sell before and buy back after the drop (easy 10% minimum). It sucks but it's the self fulfilling prophecy in crypto.  Be smart out there.
1	1522748150	4	100% that! And stop the delusional talk about HODL. You fucking HAVE TO act when there is a sell the news situation comming up.
2	1522748559	3	It's okay to HODL if you want to leave it be and look at it again in a few months but in a bear market I don't think it's wise to watch a coin go up 10% and then watch it come back down 10%...and possibly even more. HODLing is good in a bull market but in a bear market most coins/tokens inevitability come back down. If you have the time it's smart to buy low, sell high, rinse and repeat to accumulate. End result is you may still be down $$$ wise but if the bull returns and the market improves you will be in a better position than you were in Jan. Got to adapt and learn when to HODL and when to trade. 
0	1522774959	7	It's a WTC airdrop for GMN. Alrighty then.

0	1522738299	3	Tinfoil theory: majority shorts on bitmex etc. is actually an indicator of market going up temporarily due to manipulation to bust shorts.
1	1522739265	2	Some smart guy said that Shorts can be Fuel for a Bull Run or some shit.
2	1522739426	3	It's just a silly theory but we've seen a few odd pumps the last few days popping the price back up above 7k. This will liquidate a lot of high leverage shorts, people like to think its the exchanges orchestrating these pumps. Not sure if I buy into that tinfoil shit but to go along with it, majority shorts would be a bullish signal rather than a bearish one as presented by many shorters on this sub.

2	1522742470	2	I’m aware about fiat pairs with altcoins, but what is this has to do with bnb as their coin, since you’ll be buying with USD/EUR anyway? Sorry if I missunderstood something. Havent looked into BNB coin at all, but use binance daily so hoped to get some quick previews about the real life usage before doing my own research.
3	1522742548	3	trading fees are lower if you pay with bnb
4	1522743335	3	Im also aware of that, sorry if i cant express myself clearly since english is not my first or second language, but i still dont get it, why should the coin have such a high value when its only use case is to trade for a second to pay less fees
5	1522745710	3	Trading volume is bound to increase on Binance with the inclusion of trading pairs. BNB is meant to piggyback off that and to be used as an intermediary for trading.

1	1522777534	3	Look at his comment history. He was already invested in VeChain and has probably never owned WTC.  As someone who owns some of both, the constant Ve FUD could not be more annoying or pointless. WTC gave some coins to long-term master node holders and announced it on twitter. Who cares?

0	1522736197	2	I have done extensive research on lower cap coins to find long term holds so much so that I realize my portfolio has fallen mostly to these. I’m struggling between picking up XLM, VEN, ICX, Aion, or Wan. Shill me your shillsEdit: also keeping an eye on iota, but probably for the longest term hold
1	1522736372	6	Power Ledger - just read the whitepaper 
2	1522736473	2	Power Ledger is a 2 year hold minimum. Not even joking; what they are doing is ambitious and extremely slow. 
1	1522736436	5	Aion, wan and icx all have overlapping agenda and that is interoperability. My suggestion is to pick one of them (ICX has the best fundementals). Between Ven and XLM, I would go with XLM. While they're both totally different in what they intend to do and both are great projects, XLM as a platform has wider use and has IBM brand backing it up.
2	1522736588	5	Beautifully put. The reason those three have caught my eye is for that reason. The concept of interoperability between blockchains is huge to me. XLM was my first buy in the altcoin realm and nothing has changed in my sentiment, just began looking for larger profit potential. 
3	1522737473	3	If you're looking for profit go for BNB. It's a great coin but people are recently noticing it's value. It already has a use and a big business behind it and is always in demand. Binance coin burn in April (and up until total supply is reduced to 100 million) will drive the price even higher, binance chain will only add value to bnb and many other things. It's only weakness is being tied to binance. I've profited greatly from bnb even during dips.
1	1522736530	7	Ven and Icx all the way. OMG also one of my favs.
1	1522736360	3	VEN and ICX. You want even more lower cap long term holds? Nebulas.
2	1522736445	2	Nas has been on my radar. And looking for higher mcap coins to balance out. Held Ven forever. No lie sold a few days ago before this pump 
3	1522737175	2	Neblio
3	1522736533	3	Unfortunate, but from your list VEN and ICX are the best projects long term.
1	1522737539	2	All much too safe. MAN, CPC, HPB. With the flippening of the petro dollar (China just paid for oil with yuan for first time), Chinese coins ftw
0	1522747031	2	someone saw this ICX/ETH spike on binance? My sell order got magicly triggered and then it went back to normal againFat fingered or what?
1	1522747842	3	Rumours of a partnership and some are suggesting samsung. I remember reading something similar in Jan as an advisor for ICX worked for Samsung once upon a time. 
1	1522747517	2	Reminded me to always set up a ridic sell order in case that happens. Had success with something similar with VEN in the past.
2	1522747965	2	Always do it! Worked for me with POWR 3 times in less than 24 hours. Same with buy orders (if it isn't a scam or shit coin). Someone sets off a big market sell and you pick up cheap coins and it recovers quickly (easy 5-10% sometimes).

0	1522768717	2	After the coin burn and a correction, can't one make an argument to just put everything into BNB?  It seems like this thing is just allergic to dipping for a long period of time.  And this is as "rigged" as anything can get with the help of Binance, correct?  
1	1522768777	3	Go all in on BNB and create a vlog or blog about it.  Report daily on the outcome.
1	1522769027	2	Rule #1: don't keep your assets on an exchangeMt. Gox and a variety of smaller exchanges has taught us this. If this is true, why would you invest entirely in BNB. Don't be blinded by fomo. BNB looks good, but it takes a simple slip in security for it to look real real bad.

0	1522773705	2	You guys think ETH or NEO is a better long term hold? (looking at a 3+ year time frame)
1	1522773949	6	Difficult to say, but as ETH currently hasn't got POS, NEO generating GAS is a bonus for a long term hold.
1	1522774390	8	NEO probably won't ever overtake ETH, but NEO is incredibly low. I expect NEO to have a huge pump at some point, but long term, I don't think you'll go too far wrong with either.Split it 50/50
1	1522774166	7	Neo for sure. They have a business like platform set up that will make it easy to follow regulations. They also seem to have scailing issues figured out and will be faster at processing transactions. I also think their process of choosing ICO's is what will be a game changer. They will have higher quality projects on their platform that they vetted and chose. Whereas ETH just lets anyone on its network. Eventually alot of these ICO's will die and sell off their etheruem stacks. 
0	1522775412	2	Which alt coin would you buy right now to hold till the end of the year? I know many of them are on a ridiculous discount
1	1522776030	7	REQ and AMB
1	1522775677	4	IXC, BNB, LSK, POE
2	1522776185	3	I'd also add VET, REQ, OMG to that list
1	1522775452	5	Request network 
1	1522776307	2	Trac, kind of has early vechain vibes, but can also utilize vechain and they're still making up their mind on staking and masternodes, but either way sounds like we'll be getting some kind of return.
1	1522775514	4	VeChain

0	1522761577	5	Just wondering what are people's general impression of LEND (ETHLend project)?I'm a bag holder and just curious why not more people are liking this project. They are already making profits on their proof of concept platform, and their product is working quite well already. - Br, salty bag holder.
1	1522761720	3	I ask myself the same question. But we already learned that actual news or running products do not mean much in the crypto world in terms of value.
1	1522764700	2	They don't have good recognition in the wider market.  The first question people ask about LEND is...What the hell is LEND :)?I have bags too. I am converted from pessimist to optimist I'm impressed at their effort to bring more value to LEND coun holders and they've really got into gear. Crowdfunding is going to be good, so are BTC loans. Want to learn more about them, join their telegram which is very active.Dont believe me, checy my Very Critical posts in the ETHlend reddit. Probably the most downvoted ever lol. I have changed my mind about the team almost 180 degrees, they were on the wrong track for marketing but they have really started to engage with their user base and wider world. They are executing well.Its a matter of time. They will get exposure and their price could definitely explode within a short period as very small market cap. You may have noticed LEND held it's value very well recently. In fact I am still thinking of.buying more even though I am down on my investment. About a third of portfolio in LEND as I think lending platforms on crypto is already proven by these guys and they have first mover advantage.Other factor is low cost per coin, the newbs love this. Someday some big money is going to move into LEND and explode this small cap upwards !

0	1522773557	4	Okay guys BNB is doing well and for me looks a good long term hold, but........‘‘Twas not long ago ETH was the Daddy during the “flippening” and was dip resistant.Then came NEO which “doesn’t give two fucks about BTC dipping”Not forgetting Monero with a little nod to XLM which were both darlings for a month.All have shit the bed because no matter what news or partnerships come about, this market is entirely sentiment driven and if you’ve watched your investment go down and down for months or hopped onto a “dip proof” option only to see it crash then the sentiment will be that this is all utter bollocks.We need a few weeks of slow steady growth for the FOMO to start again. There must be so much money sitting on the sidelines (Tetherer’s or clever bastards who cashed out Jan) waiting for >6K. They’re not gonna jump back in coz we had 1 day of green.

2	1522755882	6	You feel sorry for all the noobs who fell pray to the FUD and sold at 9k and 8k? How about those who sold at 12k? Or maybe 16k? God damn noobs man, so glad I held on to my BTC lolThe logic and reasoning in this sub is amazing.

1	1522757761	2	because some of us care about actual adoption of the tech?
1	1522758408	2	people generally like good news. i feel like this isn't that deep of a concept
1	1522759335	2	Because there’s a vast amount of people with zero investment experience, likely zero retirement savings, and zero market knowledge who’ve between $100 and $1000 “invested” in funky internet tokens who feel entitled to it making them millionaires, and get very upset when you saying anything not in line with that.

0	1522737403	2	I wanted to increase my positions over the next few weeks by buying a little every week to even out sudden spikes.My question is: my portfolio is currently ETH based, meaning that I make sure Eth is my biggest position and all alts are measured by their performance against Eth.Should I keep it that way or add some bitcoin to the mix? The problem is that apart from the huge marketing bonus that bitcoin gets when newspapers treat bitcoin as the only cryptocurrency I don't see much attraction of bitcoin compared to others.For reference, my biggest positions are Eth, xlm, ven, iota, omg, neo
1	1522740855	4	Do not measure against ETH. You think your alts holding off nicely but they actually dropped 50% against bitcoin along with ETH.
0	1522739482	2	So what can I do with all the leftover coins on Binance that I cannot trade? Is there a way to get them or is it like a Binance tax that you can't ever get back? I have 0.99999 Ven and can't do anything with it also have 0.9999 XLM same thing can't really trade it also have 0.999998988 LISK that I can't trade. What can I do with it?
1	1522739553	3	You could buy 1.1 VEN, then sell the full 2. Or something similar.
1	1522739641	5	I believe you can place market orders for XLM/BNB to turn it into BNB. Won't work with limit orders though.
1	1522739599	3	Sell for bnb. Use a market order

1	1522757382	5	When BTC finds a bottom so will BNB but it might not be much lower than this. The first time BTC forayed into 6.6k territory last week BNB went to $9.73. The second time it dipped to 6.4k BNB went to $10.30. BNB is getting consecutive higher lows.

0	1522755175	1	I am happy for Btc to go up 2k before I jump back in. The prospect of Bitcoin losing a big slice of its exclusivity as gateway to the alts is massive in my opinion.I feel the market is undergoing steep evolution.

1	1522760859	13	1 Doge. Because 1 Doge will always equal 1 Doge. 
1	1522760687	8	One Bitcoin
1	1522761219	5	Depends how much money you have. Currently 1 bitcoin is $7424, 1 ethereum is $405, 1 litecoin is $125, 1 VEN is $2.81, 1 Stellar is $0.23. All top 20 coins.
2	1522761455	3	This is a great answer. Go with this I reckon.
1	1522762228	7	Bitcoin
1	1522760739	11	I’d recommend backing away slowly...

1	1522768517	3	It's definitely something.
1	1522770394	2	yes.
1	1522770202	2	Quite possible. Volume is low and BTC's  50/100 day moving averages are still pointing down. The 1-week RSI still has us firmly in bearish territory. Virtually all of the major coins (ETH/BTC/LTC/NEO) were heavily oversold going into last weekend and BTC's on-balance-volume was at fresh lows, so some minor gains are expected. The sell-off appears to be slowing down, but market sentiment is still low so bears are having a field day selling the top of the rallies like they have been for the last 3 months. TL;DR - We'll probably keep dropping. 
0	1522736015	4	The bullrun has begun. 
1	1522736125	19	Are you saying January is finally over?
2	1522742430	6	There's no volume. Don't be fooled 
2	1522747332	2	Nope. BTC price has to prove itself by sustaining above 12k for atleast a month or two to be confident about a bull run. 
1	1522736109	16	The dead cat bounce has begun.
