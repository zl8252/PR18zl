0	1522827131	48	Wife:  Honey I'm so excited, with your crypto gains we will live comfortably for the rest of our lives!Me: if we die on Sunday.
1	1522829008	14	My wife still doesn’t believe in me! I’m telling him “Oh honey, this is real!” “Oh no no no no no, that’s a scam!” And I said “But wait I’m gonna go to the bank and I’m gonna get my bitcoins and I’m actually gonna turn it into dollars, here there right on the table!”

0	1522855846	28	It's funny how perspectives changed.  Back in January, if someone threw out an idea about BTC going to 7000 dollars, most people would have laughed.  They would have laughed not because BTC couldn't fall to 7000 dollars, but because if it did, then in the January of 2018 mindset, we thought that everyone and their moms would buy BTC at that point, pushing the price upwards again to 10,000+.  It is interesting how similar to life, once we get used to certain things, then the perspective changes. Similarly, right now, we can't imagine BTC being at 1000 dollars.  Why?  Because we feel like in our April 2018 mindset that if somehow BTC was at 1000, everyone and their moms would buy BTC propelling the upward launch.  This is not meant to be pessimistic and I certainly am not predicting that BTC will dip to 1000.  However, it is interesting that after some beatdown, our sense of high/low keeps on changing as we get used to the current circumstances.  
1	1522856078	12	Whatever you do, don't imagine BTC being worth a million.
1	1522860582	2	By the time it gets to 1000 enough fear and uncertainty regarding its future will have been created and therefore not everyone and their moms will buy it.That is why the end of the bear is months of low volume low volatility low growth. Not and immediate trend reversal like so many like to believe.
0	1522853443	17	Good thing I can no longer afford rope otherwise I'd probably just hang myself.

0	1522855595	16	We should just ignore the market for a few months and turn the daily discussion into a Haiku contest.
1	1522856021	30	Noob from December60 percent down. Hurts bad.Want moon and lambo.
2	1522856168	8	fucking solid haiku mate....fucking solid.
2	1522857787	2	Well done

0	1522828516	39	I know nothing except I will not sell for a loss and I’m done putting in more money. So, no matter how impatient I am and how much is hurts, I refuse to sell for a loss. I will wait as long as I have to 
1	1522829577	17	Yadda yadda sunk cost fallacy. It's not a loss until you sell is only true for the taxes part of it. Selling and moving to an investment with more upside potential is the smart thing to do rather than sit in denial (if you believe your investment has the best upside potential it's fine to sit on your hands, but look at other options). But they, this sub is full of bagholders who have little to no experience trading or investing in stocks so I'm not surprised that knowledge gets twisted as it does.
2	1522850224	5	That's all good and well if you have a crystal ball
1	1522847537	3	Same here. Everyone says sell and cut your losses. Im not so sure. I had a buddy panic sell when btc was 2k a good while ago. He'd be happy as a cat where it all sits now. 
0	1522835977	11	Dear BTC...Stop bouncing you filthy little chipmunk.
0	1522838356	27	Note to self: Never buy when everything is green!
1	1522839373	5	this is so simple yet so true. 
0	1522830526	11	Anyone heard of FOIN yet ? New bitconnect in thailand , indonesia etc. and people are so hot for it. So much stupidity hurts, but i guess there is nothing to be done.They promise 0.91% daily gains and 50 mio tokens will be kept by the founders, while 50 mio go to early, trusted ,investorsThey call it the most stable currency in the world with guranteed returns for the next 10 years.😥
1	1522832362	3	I saw an advert on YouTube the other day for a coin that promised the price would increase 1% every day for so long. It was about a minute long and not once was I told what the coin did or the product they were making. Sad thing is 1000s of people probably fell for it and bought in. Hopefully YouTube ban crypto ads too. 
0	1522851294	12	Btc for sale! Purchased in december. Bill included, brand new and never used! Limited moon edition! $14k
1	1522852519	3	keep it

0	1522853829	10	this market sucks ass
0	1522854276	9	Forget New Years bonuses, Tax returns, and Chinese New Year.  Cinco Del Mayo (May 5th) is when the real bull run starts!!!

0	1522862779	10	Everyone thinking Trump's tweet is about some trade dealWhen it actually is talking about crypto mcap
1	1522863558	2	What kind of Crypto guy could you imagine Trump as?  A bitcoin maximalist like Richard Heart or Andreas?  A dodgy looking Verge dev in a hoodie?  A JP morgan type trying to get in on the game privately while publicly trashing it?  A trump version of Carlos Matos? 
2	1522864200	8	Bcash shill. Gotta make Bitcoin great again. 
2	1522863645	5	Trump is definitely a BTC whale.
3	1522863821	4	annoyed I didn't think of that one myself :)
0	1522852775	9	I think this CTR pump (unfortunately) symbolizes the state of crypto right now.  
0	1522854904	8	https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89o16y/im_mark_karpel%C3%A8s_exceo_of_bankrupt_mtgox_ask_me/Interesting.>I don't want this. I don't want this billion dollars. From day one I never expected to receive anything from this bankruptcy. The fact that today this is a possibility is an aberration and I believe it is my responsibility to make sure it doesn’t happen. **One of the ways to do this would be civil rehabilitation, and as it seems most creditors agree with this, I am doing my best to help make it happen.** I do not want to become instantly rich. I do not ask for forgiveness. I just want to see this end as soon as possible with everyone receiving their share of what they had on MtGox so everyone, myself included, can get some closure.Most important part of his letter.  This would mean the original owners of the bitcoins would get them and Mt. Gox Trustee would not have anymore to sell, nor would they all be under Karpeles' control.
0	1522854376	17	* Our CZ in Hongkong,* Hallowed be your name.* Your DEX come,* Your vision be done* As in Hongkong,* So on Malta.* Give us our daily gains* And forgive us our greed* As we forgive those whales who bet against us.* Lead us not into FOMO,* But deliver us from Bitcoin.* For the DEX, the power and the success are yours* Until next Bull trap* Binance.
0	1522831611	16	I have a feeling that the longer we go without an upward movement, the fewer people will invest despite generally more becoming interested, and that once prices start to improve a lot of these people will fomo in. It's an unsubstantiated gut feeling but I think in 2 years time I might strongly regret not buying more $400 eth.  Or maybe not :@
1	1522832174	10	Strange how things change. If someone offered me $400 ETH 3 months ago I'd have maxed out every credit card I have, now it just seems normal. Bought a lot in this dip though, I definitely think ETH is worth more than $400 especially if people think BTC is worth $10k+ lol. Looking forward to the FOMO soon. 
2	1522834344	3	Me too, we can only hope!
1	1522831977	4	I just bought 0.5eth, I will buy second half soon. But I will have to buy one more, because I know that I will be afraid to sell it if I have only one. 
0	1522830134	9	huh, green day for me? bought drgn a couple of days ago and iost at 350 yesterday, is this what gains feels like??? 
0	1522850654	8	I bought with 50% of my fiat.  Expect it to plummet now.  Thank me later.
1	1522850885	3	thanks, it worked
2	1522851056	2	I meant the comment as a joke.  But I am not laughing now looking at this :O. Fuck, what did I do?
3	1522852228	2	Care to predict some lottery numbers to make up for this, you monster?
0	1522852497	7	Fuck. I went to sleep,  and right after I get violated by the the market. WHY DID I WAKE UP TO THIS!? What the actual fuck? REPORT BTC PLEASE
1	1522852717	3	Buttcoin is busy right now
0	1522854362	9	Anyone notice how when a coin comes out as a scam the price actually goes up? Should we all start buying scam coins when they are publicly announced as a scam coin. forget the ICO its time for the ISO
0	1522856849	8	In these incredibly bearish times, can we all take the time to appreciate that the market cap went from $238b to $823b in under 2months (Nov 22nd 17 - Jan 7th 18) 
1	1522857171	6	Lets also remember that we have shitcoins valued in the billions of USD and that this will properly come crashing down to reality like a meteor.
1	1522858017	5	Market cap isn't always the best metric cause there's never enough liquidity in these markets.
0	1522857508	8	postponing my retirement to 28. (in 18 months)
0	1522861427	8	Why the hell is CTR up 88%. It's been publicly outed as a scam
1	1522861766	11	people are truly stupid
2	1522862365	2	It was just slowly dying as it should be and some massive buy volume came in suddenly. Much bigger volume than the sells when the scam was made public. Weird
0	1522864592	8	Do you think Asian cryptocurrency communities are like "Whelp, looks like America is waking up."?
1	1522864877	6	more like "lol, America is buying it again"
0	1522822517	15	How do I contact Coinbase to refund my $1100 Eth?
1	1522822846	19	press contact
2	1522823332	13	And wait for about three months, then post a thread in their subreddit.
3	1522823973	7	and then repeat , step 1
1	1522825396	14	Send it to vitalik so he can send you 5 back.
1	1522825110	2	Good luck trying to contact them.
0	1522835044	7	Sorry guys, this is probably because I bought some.
0	1522851162	7	It's amazing how days worth of gains is wiped out in hours now.
0	1522856988	8	Please accept my condolences, just know that I am here for you, please don’t hesitate to reach out, especially during this difficult time.
0	1522861631	7	I can't for the life of me remember where to find that hilarious YouTube video about market manipulation in crypto where they keep showing that guy talking on the phone initiating PnD's

0	1522853420	13	We're never getting out of this bear cycle are we?
1	1522854231	3	The worst is that they make us believe we start a recovery, to fuck us even harder afterwards. Absolutely savage.
2	1522855216	2	And people that speak the truth get downvoted during pumps. This sub is cancer. 
0	1522826281	49	* I thought nobody in their right mind would invest in scam-TRON any more after all that has been discovered, it pumped hard for testnet* but really, who would buy the VERGE scam after they came up with a "3 fucking Mil. $ in 3 days" crowdfunding scam and then shit on their words to only announce they will announce the name in 2 weeks? Hahaha, epic pump incoming, more and more! VERGE pumping exploded since then* and than I thought, nobody with any brains would invest in WTC anymore after all those failures and lies/scams they puled! oh boy, was I wrong, yup, the price exploded, based on moon tweets and a failed mining net lunch.Literal scammers and liars are what generates huge money in this space. Fuck sane and logical reasoning, people are utter stupid, emotionally married to their investment and cultist behavior, with a memory of a 1-Day fly, shit will pump again and again, no need to deliver, who cares about lies and scams,, just HYPE and PUMP!!! this is where the money is...
1	1522827208	3	Sauerkraut
1	1522826587	6	Yeah and that is really fucking frustrating to see, every one of those projects is just utterly ..... Though they pump the hardest. One day those people will eventually get burned
2	1522828418	3	Think about how poorly coins like bitconnect reflect on crypto and how they can potentially effect the market. Then realize there are dozens if not hundreds of shitcoins that could do the same damage. 
3	1522829704	1	yuuup, scary as fuck. But although thats happening, I don't understand how that will affect solid projects. Maybe for new investors to be scared? But thats it.Just stupid that so many people invest in scams
1	1522826556	2	you're expecting too much of the human brain
1	1522827342	2	I sincerely think some of the first pump is done by the owner/ceo of the coin's company to legitimize the pump. 
1	1522832153	2	Welcome to the age where wishes are facts and facts are fake.This is the market you want me and everyone else to dump money into, yeah right dream on.Once all these scams are finished, flushed out, then maybe the market for the 3 or 4 legit coins can actually get some adoption.
1	1522827536	3	Welcome to crypto. You're getting it. It doesn't matter how shit a coin is. If it's got volume and hype and the charts in an uptrend, shit's gonna keep going that way.
1	1522826483	2	maybe because theres money to be made? Any coin can get pumped and dumped, you just gotta make sure to get rid of your bags at the pump.
2	1522826674	4	This Tron bashing is as pathetic as the Ripple bashing. Maybe stop jerking each other in your small Btc circle!? There are reasons that some coins are worse or better than the others, but just rephrasing like a stupid monkey what other Redditors are yelling because of “it’s cool to bash” won’t help anyone. 
3	1522827833	14	No. People in here actually do the research and don't close and shout "FUD" just because people call a clear scam coin a scam coin. Do some research into Justin Sun and Tron and get back to us. Copied code, copied white paper, fake partnerships with companies he owns (so giving himself money and pumping the coin to make himself richer), tweeting images of him shaking rich billionaires hands at a conference so people would think he is going to partner with them when he basically is just fan boying them. Fake new office building in the US which after some digging was just a share space in a delaware building. Crypto dogs and fake username which saw him caught out in a live stream chat - selling expensive cyber dogs to himself to get more tron. SCAM. If you want to overlook all that - that's on you. 
1	1522827863	1	Funny thing is if they are scammed they are the types to whinge the loudest and want the SEC to bail them out. 
1	1522835531	1	Welcome to earth.
0	1522861448	12	Suggestion for mods:  Posts that are calling a coin a scam without some iota (had to) of evidence or a source, should be deleted.
1	1522862429	2	I don’t think they should be deleted because it starts a slippery slope of what’s allowed to be deleted. If people can really be manipulated by a daily thread comment saying “Coin is a scam” then they deserve it. 
1	1522862618	3	Yeah anyone calling bitconnect a scam needs to be deleted 
0	1522839376	5	binance problems... anybody knows whats up?
1	1522839716	4	They're working on the issue
2	1522840222	3	What is your source “their working on the issue”What is the issue?Where have they said their working on it?
3	1522840315	5	Some dude opened a support ticket for that, he received this response "we are aware of the problem and working on it" and published all that on the binance Reddit. That's my source
4	1522840523	2	Great thank you.
0	1522853710	6	CTR exit pump. Scam coin owners pumping from jail.
1	1522854297	2	They need that money for them jail honey buns 
0	1522860730	5	Down 30% ish this month but if I switch Delta to ETH instead of fiat I’m up 50% Yay
0	1522824318	19	I see people keep hoping BTC will shit the floor to 4K. Not sure it'll happen. Lots of shorts on exchanges, whales know this as well. I see 10k coming in sooner than 5k.Also good to see blue chip alts holding up and growing back. 
1	1522824528	13	The destructive nature of cryptocurrencies. People spread FUD when they sell, hoping their news will crash the market and praise random coins to heaven when they buy them and buy coins for no reason other than making a quick profit.
2	1522825622	6	It's crazy isn't it. The amount of people that start defending TRX just because it was going up. It's like a flip of the switch. I also noticed the resentment some posters have towards coins they bought at near all time high and then sold at a loss. A few that bought NANO at $30 pop in from time to time on the nanocurrency thread to FUD or troll. crazy. 
1	1522825900	3	Starting to think that when there is lots of shorts the exchanges handling those shorts pump it to liquidate those people.
1	1522825330	1	ive stopped trying to predict the market but just because it hits 10k first doesn't mean it cant drop back down
0	1522857634	13	Lol this market is a joke. First TRX, then XVG and now CTR. All those theories, DYORs, bullshit analysis, fairy tales about investing in working projects, coins with a future and nonsense like that. It's all bullshit. Fkin delusional crap
1	1522857865	8	You know why Bitcoiners call alt coins shitcoins?This is why.You know why /r/bitcoin bans for shilling alt coins? Because no one cares about how excited you are for shitcoins. 
1	1522857699	3	you need a hug my friend
1	1522857713	2	don't trade with emotion man, just ride the wave and dump it for more BTC..
0	1522824074	5	This article about the Centra Tech SEC charges ( https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/03/sec-charges-two-individuals-with-fraud-in-continuing-ico-investi/ ) mentions:> ... refunds of fraudulently raised money ...How could they go about doing this? Has it, or can it be done? There have been numerous ICO scams where raised moneys haven't been refunded, so would be interested to see how this pans out.
0	1522829084	4	ELEC is holding up well. Interested to see what Electrify have to say at Beyond Blocks in Tokyo tomorrow.
0	1522838807	6	Damn. bought ICX @ 7 and 4. I want to buy more to compensate the loss that i had and atleast breakeven the soonest in case it bounce back but im putting all my money in 1 coin. what do you think guys?
1	1522839407	2	I say yes. DCA is the best tool there is in a market like this
1	1522839575	2	I would buy more to decrease my average price. icx is a great long term project but i would diversify your portfolio
0	1522851708	4	BEARS WIN... BRUTALITY
0	1522852221	6	CTR is now green. Ok I just want to cash out and run away. I have no hope of following that dumb of money.Maybe I'll create a kittecoin, or this "isascam" coin.How many pictures of the developers McClaren do you need see before you clue in that you have been completely scammed of your money.
1	1522852727	3	Pop over to the verge sub and watch it all unfold again, people don't want to wake up to the fact they have been scammed 
0	1522852800	6	how strong are these hands ?
1	1522855457	3	Strong enough to fist the Statue of Liberty.
0	1522854362	5	Can someone give btc some viagra?
1	1522854433	7	Giant red dildos everywhere. 
2	1522854711	4	Son, I thought I told you not to look under your mom's bed.
3	1522854896	2	Lol
0	1522855475	6	Nice bounce yesterday, but, the reality is back today and it's looking more and more like it represents how I was too late to this party to benefit and now I'm just helping those who were here before me, recoup some of their losses.
1	1522855970	4	don't sell and you do not help them. Average Joe brings his money to a bank for some years to earn 3%... And he doesn't call every hour the bank manager to hear the status of his gains. - So if you think, you're late, just give the things some time. If you earn 4% per year, you're even better than Average Joe. The get-rich-quick time is over, but you can still make some bucks, if you stay patient and trade carefully.
1	1522856480	4	The brutal truth. But you're not "too late". It's basically 8.30pm at the party. The guys that ordered the booze, rented the villa that we're at in Ibiza and goodtimes are just chillin by the pool.Believe me, this party will be pumping by 11.30 and then...come 3am it's an animal's paradise.Then this goes for a week.I'm in because I like futurist ideas and blockchain makes sense. At 60% down now but it'll all bounce back as the projects I'm in just make sense. I'd use them in 5 years time.
2	1522856904	3	Great use of my analogy! I love this. thanks.
1	1522855885	2	Doesn’t help in the moment, but I think you just got in at a bad time. Blockchain isn’t done growing, the gains aren’t gone forever etc. If you didn’t invest more than you can stand losing, I’d just advise patience. I’ve held IOTA from .35, to 5.8, and now around $1. Does it suck watching something grow 15x, and then fail by 85%? Absolutely. But I believe in it, so I believe it will be back eventually.  Maybe it won’t, lots of coins won’t make it. If you’re in crypto for the long-term, I’d evaluate your portfolio and make sure you are in actual good projects, not just the most heavily shilled projects.
0	1522856029	5	Does anyone remember back in the very early Binance days (when it was still a niche exchange) that there was a rather big BNB airdrop for everyone that was on Binance back then? I'm hoping for a negative answer as I now realize I might have sold loads of BNB for a crazy low price. I hope it was just a dream.

0	1522859752	5	I just realized that it hasn't even been 3 months since BTC was worth $17k
1	1522861269	3	Exactly why we need to give time to bearish market to pass instead of screaming moon and lambos every time btc goes up 100$ 
0	1522860205	6	So I jokingly drew some lines on a chart last night accounting for rate of past dips and bull runs on the assumption that crypto is powered by memes. The idea is that BTC would have to fall to a popular "prediction" range of the popular TA on twitter. The rise would have to coincide with the World Blockchain Forum, the Verge announcement, BNB coin burn announcement, and the end of United States tax season; somewhere around April 15-18.Amazingly, it shows that we will break through the correction channel somewhere close to $9k on those days. Vegeta memes will power the next bull market. Get your Vegeta while they are cheap. 
1	1522861379	2	Gotcha, moon in 11-14 days :)
0	1522862528	5	So when do we think the xvg devs dump their bags and pull of the scammaning?

1	1522836645	1	Same strategy atm. Feel sorry that I didn't open my shorts yesterday. 
2	1522836739	1	Where do you guys short?
3	1522836834	2	I use an app called +500. But you could also use Bitfinex, GDAX, Bitflyer etc. Lot's of options to do so.

1	1522837721	5	Yep. Invalid password or email. Have 2fa. Tried on website and mobile app. Check on twitter other users are having the same issue. Anyone who wants to chec log out and then try log back in 
1	1522838891	3	same here...
1	1522837190	7	Nope everything is fine for meEdit: downvotes for having a working binance lol
0	1522853131	9	Thank god I didn't buy back in when i saw green. It was a trap all along. 
1	1522853281	3	almost everything is a trap in a bear market unless you are an extremely savvy trader and can somehow get in and out of these swings
1	1522853341	5	Well you missed an opportunity to make an easy 10-50 percent depending on what you bought as long as you didn't buy and hold.Holding doesn't work in this market.
0	1522848500	16	So another few hours sideway and then another crash I guess
1	1522848675	4	the fate of the market is in the hands of big block traders ..either they dump 200+ coins or buy 200+ coins. odds are it will dump 
1	1522848951	7	may jump to 7200-7500
2	1522849348	11	You're at -1 and the comment predicting doom is at +9. Buy signal for me.
3	1522851071	2	Nice buy signal. /s
3	1522849668	1	This is exactly what I've been thinking. We've reached the point where it seems most people instantly assume any increase in price is a bull trap and pessimistic posts are getting majority upvotes. There's no way in hell that would've happened a few weeks ago. To me that's a signal that the bottom is at least *near*, if it hasn't been reached already.
4	1522849771	3	Is it despair though? I feel more like we're in a big fat "I don't know" zone
5	1522849813	3	Honestly I think we've been in a big fat "I don't know" zone in the decline from 17k all the way to now. It's hard to tell.
1	1522848871	4	Bart formation? 
0	1522852605	13	You know what? Dips like this don't even phase me anymore. I've done my research and feel I'm invested in solid projects with bright futures. If these projects come up short and/or crypto as a whole turns out to be grossly overvalued (as in, these projects succeed without the corresponding coin/token having a high value), I lose money. So be it.

0	1522858015	4	Looking back at the daily threads of late last year, I can see how the general sentiment for the market has changed. Back then, during a dip it would be comments like, “make sure you load up tonight” or “scooped up x coin and y coin at these low prices, feeling very optimistic”. Now the bearish sentiment has really set in and everyone just talks about getting out of the market and BTC going to 3k. 
1	1522858453	2	That effect is called capitulation.
1	1522858570	2	Everybody should do this

1	1522866259	1	> there is no credible reason to be scepticalI mean, there's a few reasons, many of them involving quite compelling charts.

0	1522852731	8	Pretty much all the pumps at this stage are engineered by the whales to get a bunch of clueless morons to think the bear market is over and FOMO their money in. The whales pump it up and then sell out for a nice profit whilst the FOMO morons are left with an asset of declining value.Easy work for the whales. 
1	1522852843	3	yes, and people like you and others keep saying it and as soon as you do you get called bear shill etc etc

Wait till the next low and we'll see something similar. Once this stops happening, then you'll know we bottomed out and are ready for a bull run ( keep in mind the bull run may take months or a year to develop).

2	1522831794	1	Can you link me please? That Cartel story was pretty lame. Human history is largely one of gross incompetence, and that article attributed far too much power and competence to the buffoons that occupy our corridors of power.

0	1522841231	6	It’s not about being a bear or a bull, this is not a soccer team. It is about adapting to a market. Bears lose money on bull markets, bulls lose money on bear markets. And smart people play both differently and scalp money from the first two groups.
1	1522842415	3	Easier said than done. But i generally agree. But to be successful in crypto trading you need a lot of time, effort, knowledge and even some luck. I got none of them, maybe some knowledge after months of research. But i work 5 days a week like many other and have other stuff to care about. But i know one thing. When the next Bull run comes - i will take at least some profits. As soon as i think "this is crazy" i will consider selling a portion. Gl ladies 
2	1522844857	2	Yep, my issue as well.  I work and have a family.  I can't constantly watch the trends and interpret the market so HODL I must until my few chosen coins go up.  Just make sure you have an exit plan. :)

I personaly still waiting the price touch $6.000,00 to strongly buy more. But, pay attention, the moment is close. 
1	1522839633	3	Ps.: dont wait a bullrun/pumps at this moment, what we will see next 2 or 3 months is a slow grow... and maybe after september, when MtGox finish all sell, we will watch some pumps and the big bulls back strongly

2	1522865029	2	I would not be surprised if it was just another way to launder crypto i have no idea what the fuck im talking about
1	1522863521	2	I doubt it very much, most of these charities like BitGive that receive donations hold the Bitcoin for sometime

1	1522835350	1	Wait for the next tweet.
0	1522839973	6	Number 1 reason why most traders are rekt is because they failed to adapt to a bear market. Using bull strategies in a bear market is like hitting screws into the wall with a hammer.You've got to put your personal bias aside.

2	1522832551	1	Same. What's your reasoning?
3	1522836858	1	I started with ETH, was easier,cheaper and faster to move around. 
1	1522833115	3	BTC in early Nov. Then LTC for the faster and cheaper trx.

0	1522853091	2	yeah so,  do wealthy people pump the market because they can then later short the market by margin trading because they know they can dump it and profit from that?  
1	1522855067	2	yes. 
1	1522855354	2	Pretty much.Except, it's not "wealthy people" it's boring pricks that run "super-cashed-up-bots" that just work the margins. Wealthy people are eating their lunch and running companies.

1	1522844804	2	I agree.Although there is a smalll chance of investors getting sick with stocks and simply migrating over to crypto. But I wouldn't bet on.
0	1522841499	2	BINANCE LOG IN ISSUE. They have mentioned on they're sub there is an issue and they're working on it. Hopefully be sorted soon, even though I'm locked out for 2 hours 😭

1	1522854194	3	I just can't. It was 5$ like a month ago
1	1522854373	3	It is more likely the pump already happened.  You have to get in really early now for buy the rumor sell the news action.
1	1522854191	3	overpriced
0	1522842709	5	Question, what is taking Coinbase so long to list other currencies? They have made it clear they want to, and they also have a set of rules. Honestly wondering. Does pairing an alt-coin with fiat bring a whole slew of regulations with it, or are they just dragging their feet?
0	1522850748	4	Looks like a while bunch of stop losses just got triggered at 7K. Either that or someone just dumped a whole ton of BTC.

1	1522861720	14	Because it went down a lot after a huge pump from getting listed on Bithumb... but that was expected in this market. Daytraders are just gloating and spreading FUD as per usual.

0	1522855117	4	Last night I looked at a bunch of TA of several “pros” and most were saying this was going to happen
1	1522855835	2	Yup, I sold out at 7.3K thankfully after doing tons of TA. The hard truth is that this market is not ready for a bull run. Think about the fundamentals....1. There is a looming trade war with China2. The Mt. Gox trustee has about 1billion worth of BTC he plans to dump and people know this3. There are still MANY regulatory uncertainities that need to be figured out in many different countriesI have no doubt we WILL see new ATH's but this is just not the right time for a bull run... Too many "If's" hanging over the market currently. 
2	1522856004	2	I feel like the trade war would only help us.
3	1522856594	2	Perhaps in the much longer term (think 1-3 years).Unfortunately, bitcoin is still seen as an extremely risky asset class to 90+% of the population(except us redditors;)So for the time being any form of global economic risk could be very detrimental to bitcoin. However, if bitcoin were to emerge as a trusted safe haven asset in the next years an event like this would be beneficial.

1	1522852439	2	ok
0	1522839701	4	I got bored and started day trading some coin called ZIL Zilliqa, then someone dumped 600,000 shares and the price plummeted for the past 24 hours. Now I'm stuck with this shit coin until the price rises. The story of my crypto life.
1	1522841481	4	I honestly don't think it is a bad one to hold. I'm not currently holding it, but have put in an order at 0.00009 ETH if it ever falls down to that region again.
1	1522840625	3	Every time I buy a new coin I get scared this will happen. Buy the dip lol. 
2	1522841169	2	Hahaha, I was buying the dip and selling on the rise. Then I bought in again on the dip and it dipped a lot more, it;s still dipping. Not sure whether to HODL (ZIL fanatics swear it's going to the Moon soon), or cut my losses and trade back into ETH. Tether or FIAT isn't an option so I'm kind of stuck. 
1	1522842077	3	well that was dumb
1	1522845896	3	when going into shitcoin trading, you must be prepared to get dumped on.
1	1522843348	2	It's a good coin to be stuck with. it's currently at a very strong area of support and wouldn't be surprised to see it bounce up soon to continue it's uptrend.
0	1522852458	3	I said last week and got downvoted into oblivion.We keep dropping, leveling off, small pump to get idiots to put in fiat into the market and then whales cash out that fiat and repeat again. As long as Tether is in the market we will never move up. If you hold Tether its in your best intrest for the market to keep declining and thats whats been taking place for a long time.Tether printing provides temprorary relief but the drop that follows is harder and harder each time. Wake me up when we have decent regualtions and the problem is the whole Trump Admin are full of corrupt fucks and wont be surprised if some of them are on this someway somehow, so we will be in this market for a long time.
1	1522852805	7	> As long as Tether is in the market we will never move up. If you hold Tether its in your best intrest for the market to keep declining and thats whats been taking place for a long time.It's the exact same with fiat. You basically want people to not be able to quickly move their funds out of crypto in times of uncertainty. The only reason Tether exists is because most exchanges don't except direct fiat due to regulatory requirements. Once Binance moves to real USD people will stop tethering and start "fiating" or whatever. It's basically trading you get angry about. Not everybody is a delusional "hodler" going down with the ship. Smart people simply sell their cryptos in a bearish market. It doesn't matter whether they sell for fiat or tether.Tether has issues, but people being able to quickly sell their cryptos is not one of them. That's called trading.
1	1522852759	5	finds a way to blame Trump for bear market LOL
2	1522853216	2	Reminds me of u/UnexpectedObamaRant
1	1522852517	2	Do you realize how long tether has been in crypto?    I hate Tether with a fucking passion - but tether isn't some new concept for crypto.
2	1522852915	3	Yeah but this time last year there was something like 200 million Tethers. Today its 2.5 BILLIONS.......Big difference
3	1522853083	2	Buy TrumpCoin then.  Huge profits, guaranteed.
0	1522834854	3	Not that I'm a big fan, but this is the kind of thing that happens when you do not elect an old, retarded, orange orangutan, oligarch to lead to the country.https://coindoo.com/canadians-have-green-light-to-buy-bitcoin-with-credit-card-from-an-app/ 
1	1522840655	2	The Canadian government allows you to buy crypto at 22% interest? Looks like they need an  old, retarded, orange orangutan, oligarch to lead to the country. 
0	1522851480	2	The trade war escalation will be a good thing for crypto, quite honestly. The Chinese will have to adapt and maybe devote more resources into blockchain technology, because the days of market oversaturation via industrial means may be over. 
0	1522851641	2	welp all profits from VEN last 2 days pretty much gone lol
0	1522853452	2	During this bear market, it's obviously very frustrating. For everyone actually interested in the technology, keep up with researching and the technological advancements. The future of blockchain and crypto will find its place in this world, allow it to pace itself.
