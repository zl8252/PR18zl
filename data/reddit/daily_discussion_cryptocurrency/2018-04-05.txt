0	1522925280	26	Guys, Verge devs can't work on a fix for the hack because they're too busy designing shirts and building their merch store to hit that important roadmap milestone. 
1	1522926126	8	Priorities, Vergtards like it that way. 
0	1522925808	24	CTR scam coin is pumping once again, so great to see while my Nano, Stellar and Icon stacks are just bleeding out. Lovely
1	1522926382	4	Fuck this market eh
2	1522926464	4	do you have a condom?
2	1522930212	1	Nah this market fucks you
3	1522931542	1	And not in that sensual way with smooches and what not
1	1522926425	1	2 days it hits forced zero. I just don't get it? What am I missing? Still a ton of buying activity. Is it a tax thing maybe. Hide your profits, claim your losses?
0	1522933690	19	Its not the money I miss. It’s feeling smart. I loved making stupid trades in a bull run and having everything pay off to some extent. 
1	1522933916	12	You can feel smart in a bear market too, just keep expecting the price to drop and call every rise a bull trap
1	1522934488	2	Oh man someone gets it, haven't had that feeling yet since I'm here from January. The only time was when I made numerous buys days-weeks before a major pump but chicken out like last second. So I can Atleast make half decent judgement :/
0	1522923965	39	Wonder why there is no mention of the OMG MOU with ShinhanCard. Absolutely massive news and the thread has been deleted from the front page, yet this discussion is filled with about 20 mentions of Tron.. this subreddit is awful
1	1522924681	31	Theres 2 types of people here:* People who bought in the December hype and are left with heavy bags of scam ICOs desperately trying to defend them in the hope they'll get back to ATH. These people are down on their investment and in a constant state of anger.* People who bought before the mania and hold established coins, waiting for the shit coins created in 3-page whitepaper ICO mess to die. These people are mostly up on their investment. Its incredibly easy to tell the difference between these groups. 
2	1522925420	15	There are also people that bought December hype and managed to keep the profits and are just waiting for the market to go in a healthier direction
1	1522929577	1	It's the one green coin I have today. I consider that a win...
0	1522935064	16	WIsh i was taught how to use a stop loss before i was taught to HODL. That will be my contribution to the next wave, 
1	1522935604	7	You would've not listened just like the next wave won't, the mania always gets to us
2	1522935733	2	You are telling no lies.
2	1522935960	2	This guy gets it
0	1522932402	15	Ok to be successful in Crypto, do your research. When you see the dumbest most unneeded tech with the coin being shoehorned in a bizarre way replacing perfectly fine working real world projects and/or ideas, smash the market buy.Bonus buy if the team has recently done time for fraud.
1	1522934063	4	Ok I found the next moon shot.seacoinNothing shady about the pre ico being only available in Russian-speaking countries. Very truthful as well, we are taking your money and buying a private island.Team is shady as fuck.There it is, mark my words, to the moon this goes.
1	1522932783	2	Hey guys where do I buy Confido?
0	1522908904	42	The amount of stupid people in crypto is too damn high
1	1522910182	56	As long as your making money off the stupid people it's not a problem.Spoiler - I am not making moneyEdit - I might be stupid
2	1522917649	4	That makes at lest two of us.
1	1522916886	4	Where can I buy STPD?
0	1522937531	14	CNBC is fucking cancer. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/05/bitcoin-is-worthless-and-will-perform-worse-than-stocks-analysts.htmlEDIT: As a counterbalance. This one says part of the dump off was tax-related and relief is coming when U.S. Tax deadline hits Apr. 17. He is also bullish and thinks BTC will hit 20k mid-year and 25k EoY. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/05/wall-streets-tom-lee-predicts-massive-outflow-from-cryptocurrencies-ahead-of-tax-day.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain
1	1522937864	4	Why does anyone give a shit what CNBC have to say anyway?
2	1522938596	3	People within Crypto most likely don't.   People who might be interested in crypto but haven't gone in, might be interested in what CNBC has to say.....which ultimately hurts crypto from that perspective...since they steer potential investors away.  
2	1522938502	2	I don't give a rat's ass what they say. (If that is worth something :) )
1	1522940261	0	People who know fuck all about fuck all say bitcoin will soon be worth fuck all.
0	1522923711	14	Did India just ban every way to cash out? Could someone explain what's going on? 
1	1522925357	17	Yes, the central RBI said no regulated entity, which is all banks, should support crypto entities, which is exchanges. I can see massive sell off in the exchanges right now.Read the section on virtual currencies https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=43574
2	1522926208	12	Now that is some important news.
2	1522925929	6	fuck. this can't be good
0	1522916824	37	Wife: what's this $20 bill on the table?Me: Food budget for April. Oh, a question: do we really need our wedding  rings?
1	1522934050	2	This materialistic world we live in, we know how much we love eachother! 
0	1522909915	25	I've made 14 deposits (majority all over 4 figures) since starting crypto back in November ... I really think I'm going to take a break from all of this for the next few weeks (goal: 2 months)i dont need the money, it's already gone in my head. i need to stop checking this shit already ....who knows, might actually make some good money one day 
1	1522913054	21	See you in an hour.
2	1522930621	5	I don't know why people always say things like this. Me personally, I am so good at quitting constantly checking that I have done it 5 times this week!Also Delta will remember your shit if you delete the app then reinstall. At least if you do it within 3 hours, which is about my record for quit tine
1	1522912209	2	A good plan. 
1	1522917569	2	Come back on June 1st and I reckon you'll have a big smile on your face. And you'll be 2 months stress-free!
1	1522910511	2	2 weeks. Don't look.
2	1522910597	2	We're in death cross territory. Btc has had 3 death crosses in the past few years. Out of the 3 only 1 would've cost you money if u bought btc when it crossed. The other 2 times btc rallied shortly after crossing.
3	1522910969	1	How soon after were the rallies?
4	1522911089	1	April and September 2014 and September 2015 were the 3 times we crossed over. Go check it out.
5	1522911483	1	When do we know we crossed it, what value 6200?
6	1522911649	1	It's whenever the 50 day moving avg crosses the 200 moving avg.  And I think it's at like 6500-6000. Somewhere in there. 
0	1522912960	23	I cant anymore, that Verge is killing me:https://github.com/vergecurrency/VERGE/commit/7294e062a61f78ffb05689b562f90985463d1179Converting second to minutes is to much for that guy, I just cant...
1	1522913099	10	Haha, classic. Then again, the average Verge investor will definitely not see this.
0	1522944490	25	Goddamn. This shit is embarrassing. By "this shit" I mean, the long chains of ICO scams, bitconnect, verge, bitcoin cash drama, the bitgrail nano hack, Tron white paper bullshit, Mt. Gox drama, Meme coins, the zillion useless as shit erc20 tokens, Walton's horrible marketing efforts, to name a few things. What sort of backward ass amateur hour shit is this? We can't even begin to talk about FUD if actual events that should introduce uncertainty and doubt like these examples keeps happening/is a part of the culture. This space is on a fast path of being a big joke to the investment world if the shenanigans don't ease up. 
1	1522945471	9	I agree with you.  Honestly the term "FUD" at this point is fucking ridiculous.  I've always hated it.  EVERYONE should be critical about what they are putting their money into.  Acknowledge the flaws that your favorite coins have.  Acknowledge the risks.  But I also see low quality news articles being posted everywhere.  Don't share a shitty article after just reading the headline.  Check the source.  Check the facts.  These fuckers want you to share and get clicks.  
1	1522945122	6	Welcome to an unregulated market.
2	1522945371	3	Oh definitely - the thing thats kind of a headache is the sense that people want it to be both ways. They do not want regulation but they also do not want to be fucked over. So...something is going to have to happen. Either we get it together or it all becomes a reference we will look back at in 2030 during an Jimmy Fallon monologue where he references 2018 in some flat joke. 
1	1522944777	2	This definitely feels like we're building up to the year of the shit coin. 
1	1522948525	2	100% this and I was about to post something like this.  With all that goes on people better start having a better attitude instead of the constant divisions that occur.  Fanboys better start toning it down and Haters better keep it cool as well.  If we don't start meeting in the middle it will be a self fulfilling prophecy with nothing left.  NOTHING.  If someone came here looking to invest they would see this shit and run for the fucking hills.  WE ARE KILLING OURSELVES.    And like you said, it's bad enough that the exchanges and hacks and theft and today's big news is a timestamp exploit on a coin that may go mainstream.  Does anyone see what's going on here?  Either Verge is truly on the verge of going mainstream or we are fucked.  All you fucking haters better understand that if it happens, it's good for the space...THE WHOLE FUCKING THING.  If one payment processor starts with crypto then others WILL follow.  It could start a race to get coins on all payment processors.  Considering that our mother Bitcoin is teetering on 6000 and can take almost half the market cap with it, you better fucking hope that Verge is on the level and get's the fork done and keeps going.  But this is not just about Verge is it??  It's about the whole fucking thing.  You better hope VET get's adopted, that ICX is actually more than a vending machine, that NANO get's a nice point of sale platform together and that their coin is secure, that ADA actually comes out with a working product, that.....I could keep going here but you know what I mean.  Every coin has had to do something sketchy to survive in this space.  EVERY FUCKING ONE.  (Except Corgicoin, they are fine).  Bitcoin still has Mt fucking Gox hanging over it's head, Charlie Lee dumped Litecoin, Ripple is worthless to it's holders, BCH is I don't even know.  The list goes on and on and you can't blame anyone on the outside looking in from not wanting to touch this shit, especially when they see the crap posted on each and every outlet.  It's either a blind faith go team or a fucking FUD show of the worst kind.  Bad enough we have to keep our heads up through the hacks, the insider trading, the bots, the whales, the manipulation, the hype, the FUD, and the bottom fucking line is that nobody knows if Bitcoin is gonna take us all down on any given day.So think about the shit you spread, ask fair questions, give fair answers, think before you post.  You ultimately will end up destroying your own portfolio as people say fuck it and move on.  Just pray a few ALTS make it big and help prop up the space again.  Right now your top 10 coins have their own set of unique issues and may not be worth mainstream investment of any kind at all.
1	1522945028	2	mt gox was 4 years ago sprt 
2	1522945214	2	I know, but, its still an ugly mark on the perception of the market and there is still Nobuaki Kobayashi who just dumped 400m of BTC last month
0	1522909390	22	So CRT is a complete scam and the project is shutdown by the SEC, lets pump it right guys?? Crypto markets make me gag sometimes
1	1522909579	21	The CTR pump doesn't even qualify as gambling.  It's more perverse than that!  Meanwhile I just sit in legit and awesome projects and watch my money dwindle.  But the moment I abandon common sense and adopt the shit coin/scam coin pnd approach I'll get crushed.
0	1522939121	9	Today is a green day. Okay, so remember tomorrow is suicide prevention & awareness day. 
0	1522930499	18	An epic exit scam by verge developers. Next they will claim that their mysterious epic partnership was cancelled due to the attack.
1	1522931347	8	Hope their merch store still launches though. I need a "I was there when XVG died" hat. 
1	1522931814	2	i wonder if thier partnership was going to be with bitgrail
0	1522930285	9	Will be interesting to see how TRX price will be affected by the tronwhale running out of steam.  Hes been slowly dumping 7 billion tokens over the past 4 months and over the past 9 hours it's down from 512 million to 72 million tokens left.(The holder of that wallet is a whale who got in early when Tron was just out of ICO, and below .0002 back in November according to the first transactions - whoever is holding it have only been selling off ever since January, and haven't actually bought any tokens since before that, it also looks like their newfound wealth is being transferred into Kyber (KCN) as the wallet has been filling up on that while selling off TRX)Source: https://etherscan.io/token/0xf230b790e05390fc8295f4d3f60332c93bed42e2?a=0xb287a379e6caca6732e50b88d23c290aa990a892
1	1522930635	3	ticker is KNC, not KCNcould be interesting to follow his trades and get some Kyber too
2	1522930901	3	Right - my apologies :)
0	1522931619	8	[Fucking lol](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3256693.msg33949269#msg33949269)Verge developers have no idea how to hard fork. This is making my day watching this thread. Edit: I got banned from the Telegram asking for an ETA on a fix. 
1	1522932848	2	I have no idea why people still believe in the devs.
1	1522932892	2	> Yeah so i am not so in the materia of programming so is this a bad thing for verge and how long will it take for their porgammers to fix that issue Fucking hell...
0	1522911250	18	Forget working products just get listed on exchanges. ICX mooned (not complaining) after getting listed on Korean exchanges - still an ERC20 despite main net on Jan 26th. TRX test net (lol) and listed on exchange it goes bonkers. Not even factoring in XVG and CRT And yet adoption = sell the news. Stuff working products. Go on holiday devs, just pay to get it listed on exchanges. No need to do the work. 
1	1522912752	6	well ven didn’t moon when it recently got listed to bithumb. ven dumped after listing.
0	1522908851	8	Bitthumb list trx
1	1522909548	3	Yes, with this pump, I am out of Trx
0	1522909537	8	XVG "hacker" got the divishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Iwkznz2t0Q
1	1522909746	6	This is so bad, I love it
0	1522937778	8	I dont know where the bottom is anymore, but i do thinl the whales have overplayed their hand. Dont forget, fellow retail krill, they need us for this whole ecosystem to work.
0	1522908847	22	trx may be shit but it brings home the ramen
1	1522909532	11	It's the only thing I've made any profit off.
1	1522914026	6	Ramen? That stuff you have to collect rainwater for and then heat up with expensive energy? Fuck off you whale
0	1522935977	20	Bottom is when price stops looking “tempting “ boys and girls. It means there is no hope of it recovering. Then the end of bear has come.You would say “if I had BTc at 2k I would buy that like crazy”. But by the time it hits 2k you won’t be so sure anymore. The future will look bleak and uncertain.That is when you buy, and that is why most people don’t, because it is totally counter intuitive to do so.
1	1522936132	10	I think now, knowing this market's history, there will *always* be some people thinking any price looks like a discount. The market has already rebounded too many times after too many catastrophic crashes for people to think it's the end forever, I don't think that sentiment can truly go away at this point.Though I do think we've already reached the point you describe anyway. Almost no one is talking about buying the dip anymore, and people are taking $300 bumps up in price as a signal to tether. I think when you say the future looks bleak and uncertain, that pretty much describes sentiment around here lately.
1	1522936323	5	Not always. Sometimes it moves back up way before that point. Sometimes it never recovers. Why are you trying to act like you can gauge the exact point based on how disinterested everyone is? 
0	1522922233	14	Looks like XVG fork has failed and they need to fork the fork again...Shall i sell my 0.3 xvg?
1	1522922566	22	Yes, I think it needs to fork off
2	1522931705	1	Hahaha
0	1522931132	7	“Due to market manipulation, we’ve decided to delist CTR immediately.”Please make my day, CZ. 
1	1522931819	3	Even CZ must be surprised to see CTR as the 2nd highest volume ALT/BTC today.He is probably rubbing his hands together and laughing.TRX, CTR and XVG as top 3 volume. Followed up by ETH/BTC. What a time to be alive
0	1522939232	7	I would also say that holding and forgetting about it for 5 years is the wrong thing to do. Stay on top of crypto news and follow your coins and other coins in the market to get an idea of where the crypto world is going. 
1	1522939492	6	Definitely - if you're not following the cryptos you're invested in at minimum and making wise decisions on what to do with those as news surfaces....then you deserve to lose money if one completely tanks and you're not on top to sacrifice/capitalize on whatever gains you can /or to minimize the losses.   
0	1522945586	5	It’s mindblowing how doge has roughly 5 million dollars in trade volume everyday.Doge community is awesome lol
1	1522946367	3	DOGE is up like 3000% since 2014for a coin that is a meme and does nothing, that's amazing
1	1522945709	2	Are you deluded?  It’s not a community...it’s a group of people manipulating the price of it for gain.
0	1522908840	14	What a shitshow (Verge, CTR)
0	1522950855	13	Coinbase will be announcing something on CNBC.  My guess...**"We at Coinbase would like to announce that we are going to have an announcement in the next year or 2."**
1	1522951143	9	*"In our proven pattern of incredible laziness and failure to innovate, we have decided to list Ethereum Classic on Coinbase. We literally don't have to do anything to implement it, so trading is open as of now. Have fun!"*
0	1522917718	13	Another day another 5% down in my portfolio. 
1	1522920176	2	regular day at office
0	1522935265	7	The beatings will continue until morale improves.
1	1522935376	6	Misery loves company. We're gonna be here a while.
0	1522940435	7	What's your biggest loser? Mine is 87%. 
1	1522941621	2	GBTC is down 42.9% I only have 10% of my total portfolio in crypto, still sux. Meh. Dems the breaks right?
0	1522945804	6	you know crypto is in the dog  house when Verge XVG suffers 51% attack yesterday and the price remains relatively stableLOLhttps://news.bitcoin.com/verge-is-forced-to-fork-after-suffering-a-51-attack/
0	1522948924	6	something interestingIf you use biometrics to encrypt your phone or computer which has your wallet on it, the Government can force you via court order to unlock the device as it is the same as giving fingerprints. Lesson: don't use biometrics for your device securityhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/26/can-government-force-you-to-unlock-your-phone-fifth-amendment
0	1522919370	11	How has a delisted scam coin doubled in price? Crypto is fucking nuts.
1	1522919426	7	Thanks to your twinbrother, Crypto_Drunk.
2	1522919458	2	Ha ha
1	1522919524	3	maybe someone received the news that coin was listed, stupid people everywhere.
1	1522925509	3	Seems rather risky. Buy it, knowing that a ton of people have 2 days to sell it before it hits forced zero.My pants are not big boy enough for that move. 
2	1522926189	1	Yeah im not getting involved in that. Gonna be some serious bags left.
0	1522932785	10	Am i the only person here that works AND does crypto?
1	1522932906	16	You're probably the only one here old enough to get a job 
1	1522934207	8	Nope - i just sit on a couch in the basement, in my pj's at my mom's house.
2	1522937419	2	Id be lying if i said i wasnt jealous
1	1522933654	6	Think 85% here work or is in higher education, there was a poll here a couple of months ago.
1	1522933297	2	Wage slave here. I'm working and investing so I can eventually retire off the grid. 
0	1522912354	11	Binance announcing a delisting for CTR, the creators are going to jail, the project is finished.....    And yet:  people continue to buy.   
1	1522912770	4	that coin is -97,8% from its ATH - its basically dead. Its just a desperate pump from some bagholders to sell it to some FOMO morons.
0	1522931227	9	Bro, I'm bleeding real bad bro
1	1522932588	5	It's just a flesh wound!
0	1522933007	10	India here. Fucked.
0	1522930790	5	Is this still a bear market or have we entered sideway-limbo?
1	1522930988	9	Wouldn't call for sideways limbo unless we're sideways for at least a few weeks, IMO. A few days is nothing.
1	1522931113	7	Go to any graph of BTC, 1 day timescale, and report back.
2	1522932488	5	Reporting, sir!Sir! It appears that we are in a decent pattern. The candles are moving in a downward direction toward the 6k line. Intelligence believes we have a chance to stop it at the 6.4k line. However, their numbers have been reduced from the previous attack on 6.4k and it may not hold. 
0	1522934236	5	Are we "depressed" yet?
1	1522934363	4	Not yet
2	1522934498	4	I don't think so either.  Bear continues.
1	1522934696	8	I am.  Is that enough?
2	1522934735	3	I wish it was enough....unfortunately the market says the majority of people need to be depressed :(
1	1522936479	2	Nope, not yet
1	1522934639	4	When most people no longer believe in HODL and their investment is good, then the bubble will have popped and it is time to buy. We are a LONG way from that point. Most here, for example, still believe we are headed to the moon in the long term. Once that changes....we have hit the bottom. 
2	1522934873	4	That analysis is horrible and sucks.  Made me depressed.
0	1522936172	5	Whales have wrecked these resistances so much that they don't really exist anymore. Super easy to move the price up here. 
0	1522914272	9	Looking for the educated answer here because i get asked this a lot and i don’t have a good answer.        How can mainstream adoption and usability of cryptocurrency, as an actual currency, happen with the price being so volatile?
1	1522914409	8	if more people use it, the price gains stability
2	1522916796	6	Like Bitcoin
2	1522922873	1	Why would more people use it is the question when the price is so volatile and people are using it as speculative assets
3	1522928552	1	Eventually, the price stabilizes.  
1	1522918173	2	That's why we have Tether/s
0	1522934715	11	After years of disappointment with get rich quick schemes, I know I'm gonna get rich with this scheme. And quick.
1	1522934881	7	That's the beauty of crypto. Everyone will get rich and drive a lambo. It's just that easy. 
0	1522914201	5	Tax question. If every crypto to crypto trade is a taxable event. How iam supposed to cash out long term holds on altcoins when there is no fiat pairing. In germany long term holds >1 year are tax free. But by this logic i cant covert my alts into fiat without triggering a new crypto to crypto trade!? 
1	1522914487	6	For Germany, after the 1 Year hold, any trade you do with that coin is not taxed anymore. I dont know how they exactly handle the trades crypto to crypto to crypto from that point, will have more informations in a month or so. You will need some proof that you used that tax free coin as base for all other trades. Also very important, if the/any coin you own/buy makes any kind of dividends, this doesn't apply at all, then its a completely different story. 
2	1522915014	2	Thanks. To be tax free with cryptos that pay dividends its 10 years holding in germany - not 1. 
1	1522917985	4	I work in the german "Steuerverwaltung" so I think I can give you an answer.If you buy the coin and keep it for a year, its tax free. If you sell that coin to lets say bitcoin to cash out, that transaction is not taxable. So now you have bought the Bitcoins and the cycle basically repeats. But only for the value at the start of the last transaction. So when u sell ur bitcoin instantly for fiat, at the price you bought the bitcoin with ur alt, its a zero sum game and u cant tax that because theres been no profit made with the BTC to fiat trade. If you however trade your BTC 2 months later and the value of it meanwhile doubled, the Alt/BTC trade is still not taxable but the BTC/Fiat trade now is. I hope this is the answer you were looking for?Edit: spelling
2	1522922925	2	Yes. Thanks a lot. That was my point. Gl 
3	1522923928	2	Nice! Remember tho that there is no special decision made for crypto yet so you just apply that law to crypto, which, as you can see, leaves some questions open. So it depends on the deception of the law.If your "Finanzamt" decides differently from what ive been told, you should protest against that decision and wait for an official judgement by the BFH.And btw, if your profit is less than 600€ in that year, its taxfree either way incase you didnt know that already.
4	1522930714	1	Yeah thank you. I know there is a threshhold for taxing capital gains here. Lets hope my gains are more than 600 in 2018 :) 
1	1522914744	2	i dont think anyone cares/sues you at this point, if you trade your altcoin (which you held > 1 year) for BTC/ETH before selling to fiat. There are no clear laws/regulations for those cases right now.
2	1522915320	1	I know - its very confusing. Thats why want to do my homework. I just dont want to be fucked by taxes. I think its reasonable to be prepared to avoid truble. 
1	1522914554	1	At the very least you will have to wait for Request Network to implement fiat gateway.
0	1522915883	3	What are some of your guys favorite types of projects to invest in? Projects focusing on supply chain management, interoperability, P2P currencies, etc?
1	1522916892	10	Short term: Payment systems. OMG, Stellar. Long term: dApp platforms. Ethereum, NEO.Ultra-long term: IoT, m2m payments. IotA.
2	1522920188	4	I would put OMG also in the long term
1	1522916311	3	the one that increases my money stack
2	1522916787	2	Hahaha cant say i dont agree with you.
1	1522916333	2	Elix and ACC (accelerator network). Both down the drane currently.Elix will launch open beta somewhere in Q2 - in-house beta as we speak.ACC is utility token for a mining facility in the US. 300% staking rewards till October ;)Both very small mc tokens. I’m done with this bearmarket!
2	1522916831	4	I think the Open Beta for the APP will come next 4-6 weeks. You can register on the Elixirtoken homepage for it.Elix has upgradet their focus from Lending to Crowdfunding also-a very large business area.Btw. the App looks amazing. Really smooth and user friendly!  Elix will be one of the few very successful projects 2018

0	1522940615	4	So, with a case like REQ where mainnet is out, what do holders wait for now? Adoption?
1	1522941059	2	They didn't reach all of their Q1 roadmap objectives, missing ERC-20 integration and support for Bitcoin. After that it's adoption as they continue improving and developing.
1	1522941109	3	It will probably pump bi-weekly like it used to for the updates.  Most of us in REQ are in it for the huge long term gains though that come with adoption of a coin in the 90s on CMC.  Mine aren't even on an exchange.  Fiat pairings come Q2 and that will be a very big deal.Honestly all it takes is one big website adopting REQ's pay by request for it to pump and the adoption to snowball.  The bottom line is it saves sellers a significant amount of money on credit card processing fees (and accounting fees) and that will always be a large driving force for adoption.

1	1522922479	16	All information here is or will be filtered for you so you believe Tron sucks and you should buy neo or ven. 
1	1522922081	10	TRON is not a scam, it's just waaaaaay too overhyped.
1	1522922881	7	People never really researched it just parroted the january fud. It is an ambitious project. But one with lots of developers in multiple countries
2	1522925606	3	Glad to see this perspective finally coming through and getting upvotes on this sub. I haven't owned any TRX since January but I've long felt that this sub's vendetta against it was way overblown. It seems that the hate was originally born of crab mentality (the thing went freaking 150x in the span of a month, after all... a crypto doesn't do that without attracting significant dislike) which is not uncommon for a coin that's just had a huge run up, but the whole thing just snowballed way out of control to the point where it became popular to hate it around here and most people didn't even know why. It became popular to just parrot the same nonsense around here even long after the majority of it turned out to be false. The whole thing has been a pretty interesting psychological phenomenon to observe.Yes it has an overly enthusiastic founder who loves to spend his time on Twitter hyping it with pre-announcements, and yes there were some questionable things going on like sections of the whitepaper being copied, but the way people were talking about it in January, you'd think Justin Sun had just performed an exit scam and was in the process of fleeing his country. I've never seen a coin be on the receiving end of such a brutal FUD campaign.

1	1522949648	4	What price did you initially buy your BTC at?
1	1522949148	3	LaDdEr YoUr BuYs.Buy a little now. Set another range a bit lower where you'd buy more, etc.That way you buy between 6700 and 4000 but if it doesnt drop below 6500 you still have some gains to show for it at 8K (instead of FOMOing your whole stack at 8K then watching it drop back to 7200).
2	1522949661	2	I did DCA and picked up 1 BTC since january.Now I want to horde and wait at the bottom. I think the stock market is about to crash too.
1	1522949177	2	Looking at the same number as well for my fomo point, but my low range is 5700 - 45000 to stack buys in between. If it goes under 4K ill go alt shopping with the BTC.

1	1522935702	4	Posted this in another comment - This basically means you can't deposit and withdraw INR from exchanges like koinex, bitbns, zebpay etc. So basically people can continue trading but not with INR. This is a shitty move by all accounts. This will now encourage people to trade peer to peer which will rob government of taxes. Traders can always transfer their cryptos to wallets and sell it through localbitcoin. Whales will move their accounts to singapore or anywhere outside India. This is not FUD this is real.

0	1522935934	5	Anybody else holding their coins for 5-10 years minimum? In my mind I don’t think crypto tech has evolved enough and the world isn’t ready for crypto but technology evolves fast so the real coins with good teams and good products should still be around in the future if crypto ever catches on. 
1	1522936376	12	Fuck no. 99.9% of this shit won't be around in 2. 
1	1522936234	3	3-5 years seems more realistic. 10 years holding IDK. If crypto hasn’t found its real world use case by 2028 that would be really disappointing. 
1	1522937733	3	I entered this thing with a 5 year HODL plan. But the key is to not just HODL, but keep an eye on Crpyto in case one of my coins run into major issues. I don't want to look back after 5 years, and find out I lost 1/5th of my cash because of an attack/scam or summit.
1	1522937276	2	At least 5 years - but with a pretty thorough following of the markets, so i can scrub and update the portfolio as needed during that stage.     Hopefully within 5 years - we'll see a pivot to crypto as a p2p currency....so no real need to convert back to fiat.

1	1522942675	6	There is always someone newer than you to this and many of them are not critical thinkers, to say the least. Greed is a stronger force than skepticism. 
1	1522942241	4	Greed.  Every scam and ponzi scheme plays on people's want for easy money.  Cognitive Dissonance prevents them from thinking clearly they want it so bad.
0	1522945134	3	The superiority complex around here is disturbing. Yeah, verge is a terrible project. But a lot of people around here keep acting like these scams and dead-end projects are what's keeping their "superior tech" coins from making them millionaires.

1	1522945425	3	Well I mean the money would be going somewhere...
1	1522945395	4	well, it if weren't for those scam coins perhaps FB, Google and others wouldn't have banned crypto ads which wouldn't have caused all this panic. just saying
2	1522946092	2	Removing crypto ads had 0 to do with the market sentiment. That didn't even happen until like what, a month ago?
0	1522946634	5	Curious what the market would have to look like in order for people to say *"Fuck it, I'm out"* - Selling all of their Cryptocurrency entirely, and abandoning it as a lost cause. What kind of event, price level, or market attitude would it take for you to have this as your attitude towards cryptocurrency?A few examples might be:- Bitcoin returning to the levels of early 2017 - $1000 apiece- Banks, businesses and the world all adoption blockchain but shunning cryptocurrency- Severe government regulations - Volume dropping below a certain level - Maybe $1 billion a day total across all of cryptoNot worried about this myself, but from reading the daily, I'm sure there are plenty of people who have pushed way too much money in it and are hoping beyond hope for Crypto to succeed. Pretty much everyone knows the reasons why, but what would be some reasons you'd call it quits entirely?
1	1522947269	4	Good question and its likely something many of us are thinking. I think those that FOMO'd and entered in in nov-dec-jan likely exited for the most part at least 50% of the lambo moon chasers ... and a drop below 5K BTC will result in more exits.All your points are very valid and the most striking two points are 1) Severe government regulation well this is kind of happening with more and more banks eliminating the ability to exchange fiat to crypto globally (Canada, India and Korea have these issues) more to follow. Second the the most important in my opinion is the intertwining of blockchain and bitcoin or cryptos is that many organizations will adopt blockchain but these will be private chains or centralized as their aren't nearly as many use cases for a public or truly decentralized chains are the crypto enthusiasts tend to think. I work for a provincial government in Canada and we have been working on blockchain project for transfer payments from province to province for health care and social assistance and this will save hundreds of millions of dollars but doesnt need a decentralized chain / smart contract for operation. It will be hosted on the federal level but the operational cost savings will be significant.
2	1522948321	3	I bought in big time around November, made a tidy profit, and wisely cashed out most of my profits in late December. Have put a bit back in here and there since, but nothing major.At this point I'm letting everything ride. 
1	1522947041	6	I'll just ride it to zero, I don't care at this point.  I have a real job, I don't need the money to eat and have a place to live.  If crypto fails, it fails, I gave it a really good try and it didn't fail because I gave up on it.    
1	1522946963	6	I wont sell, if it goes to zero it's ok by me... when i invested i was prepared to lose it all...
1	1522947703	3	Prepared to lose everything I put in 🙃
2	1522948642	3	Yep, the kids tethering have no clue how investment works.If you didnt believe in cryptocurrency and were only trying to lambo, you probably panic sold and lost a bunch of money.
1	1522947833	3	I only put in what I could afford to lose, so I'd let it go to 0.  To me it's a much more involved game of blackjack.  If I walk away empty, I still had a fun time (at some point).  Basically I paid to stay entertained for 6 months now.
1	1522948253	3	Price volatility is not a problem for many people here, we are used to it. Everyone who comes to this sphere is warned about it so it's completely different from traditional markets. But think what would happen if we lost that volatility. People would go crazy saying that crypto is dead a no one is trading it. And that's what I think will happen before we start a new market cycle. Price of bitcoin will idle in 6-8k channel for a few months, people will get bored and leave while smart money will be accumulating. When they are ready, there will come a new rally.
1	1522946954	6	Riding this baby straight into the ground.
1	1522946987	2	If the most promising coin(s) don't amount to anything in the next year or two. Like VeChain should be able to be worth holding long term but if not then there is an issue.Like maybe companies rather go with IBM instead and I went the wrong direction while those who bought into IBM ended up rich. I'll still hold long term because I doubt people want to sell millions of dollars worth and take the tax hit so there should always be a way to make money. You just need to recognize it and get in before the whales do.
2	1522947522	2	See, this is an understandable mentality - You hold onto things for a couple years to see if they work out, and you realize you're holding Pets.com instead of Amazon.Was more curious of the perspective of those who put more than their idle money into Crypto - Some folks play with house money so it's hard to get inside the head of someone who really relies on that money to do well, and has a great need for it immediately.

1	1522943922	5	Well, all dumb money goes into Verge. So Verge's marketcap is the best indicator to see how much new dumb money is flowing in. Can almost be a TA indicator.

0	1522932494	2	Can someone help me please? Lost my 2FA code to log in to binance and cannot find a way back on! What do i do? Im panicking

1	1522932581	3	Send ticket to support. They will reset but will take time. Don't stress. It is just a process.
1	1522932593	3	Contact support, they'll make you do a few things to validate your identity and you're good to get back on.
1	1522932641	3	Don't panic. Binance can help you recover it but it will take time. You'll been to get a lot of info to prove you are you and then go through that process. Check out their support. But in the future always write it down...

0	1522939064	6	Do we honestly believe bitcoin will go under 6k? It’s just so low I can’t see it happening.., everything would be so cheep. 
1	1522939840	5	Always goes lower than you think it will, in addition to going higher than you think it will. The market can be rather cruel at times.
1	1522943600	2	Theres 6k, 3k and 1k options. Well those are the most rough apparent ones off the top of my head without seeing my chart.

0	1522925805	3	is it a good thing that majority of the top 10 coins hardly ever "pump" ?
1	1522926781	6	well it takes a huuge amount of volume to cause decent spikes on high market cap coins
2	1522926984	1	thanks!
1	1522928771	6	They hardly ever dump either, so in a way its a good thing. You aren't going to see a huge loss quickly or a huge gain quickly.
0	1522928812	3	7.1k continues to be resistance. Wouldn't be surprised if we hit 6k or below sooner than later. A lot of the low + some mid cap coins are sitting on launchpads and will likely not get any lower. 
1	1522930234	2	I'm not that worried at the moment. We haven't even hit last weeks low. Can't see the whales letting it drop that much. We might just sit in the 6500-7500 range for a while they manipulate the market
2	1522930680	2	I am hoping for sideways action, too! Been asking for it for weeks now, but that hasn't happened between 8-9k, and didn't happen 7-8k. I would love to see it, but not sure I am confident in it anymore. Although with that said, I don't think think we'll hit much lower than 5k-- only because I don't think big institutions bought in much lowee than that, and I doubt they will want the price to drop lower than their purchasing price.

1	1522934435	6	Nobody buys it to use as money, they buy it hoping it will moon.  That means you're all fucked.

1	1522941229	3	I'm confused. Shouldn't it be 50/50?  I thought there had to be a corresponding long to take out a short?
2	1522941422	3	That's true for derivative markets like CME and CBOE, not margin trading. At Bitfinex you are essentially borrowing money from the exchange to go long or short.
3	1522941638	2	Ah interesting. So what does the tightening indicate?

4	1522935211	3	Are there still people so delusional they think BTC can suddenly go on a "huge climb"? I wonder where the bottom will be
5	1522935244	2	One day it will climb and keep climbing, like it did in the past years..

5	1522935037	3	He's right though.
1	1522934696	2	Finally. There was no bear run for a while now.
1	1522935128	2	I'm Canadian, have no issue buying straight from my bank account using a Canadian exchange even withdrawing is no issue. I know it got harder when coinbase started raping the credit card buys by retroactively repeating the buys 50X and the CC cards took some needed swift action. Should not buy this stuff with CC anyway, so it's all good in Canada. 
0	1522935016	2	Finger on the trigger. Not pulling just now though. There’s still some more blood to be shed. I‘m so ready to throw some moola at those sick deals!

1	1522930454	3	implying xrp isnt a shitcoin?
2	1522930698	1	I think that when you're in the top 3 since 5 years and survive major crisis and is run by a multi million dollar company with an actual plan, it's hardly a shit coin anymore. Maybe a vomitcoin.
3	1522931633	1	Shitcoin until owners don't own a majority.
4	1522932264	1	The majority is in perpetual escrow. Saying it's still owned by ripple is like saying that BTC is a shitcoin until all of sleeping satoshis premine is sold...
0	1522950160	3	Damn, I heard there were alot of millenials in crypto. It seems to be holding true, price drops a little and people start panicing like the skies are falling. People need to compartmentalize their emotions and take a step back and look at the big picture.
1	1522950327	4	Trust me, I know lots of old fogeys that are doing the same. I don't know why we need to hate on a generation. Hell, if they act like that, it's because WE MADE THEM.

I kind of just had this idea in my head, one thing lead to another, and now I got this weird color-chat thing. Maybe someone can help me figure out the point of it.Here's the etherscan source code:https://etherscan.io/address/0xdcfbe1f893640f018065fdb820eb68b501f8ec2d#codeI've been developing Dapps and websites for them for about 2 months now, so I'm admittedly not very skilled, nor experienced. Hopefully will be one day, but for now, this is the level I'm producing. I appreciate any criticism, every time I post I learn something new from the comments and never miss an opportunity to learn and improve.Here's a screenshot from the inside of the Dapp after you make it past the initial "pick-a-color" screen, in case anyone was wondering what it looked like and how it works: [https://i.imgur.com/78sBhm0.png](https://i.imgur.com/78sBhm0.png)

2	1522928342	2	You must be new here, we said the same thing last time ETH dipped into the 600s
1	1522930727	2	Are you serious? It already got wrecked in the last month.
1	1522928628	1	I'd be amazed if it went below $330. It held up around $270-330 for so long, it would be an entirely different story than this recent crash for it to go below those numbers.

0	1522945349	2	Noob tax question: For example if I bought 1 Token A @1,000, it rose to $1,400 and I sold for capital gains of $400.. within a couple days the price kept rising and I used the $1,400 to buy back in @$1,500, thus reducing my stack of Token A if I had not sold.. Do I still need to report the capital gains of $400 even though I bought back in Token A at a higher price?
1	1522945461	3	Yep
1	1522945484	4	Yup. You made $400. What you chose to do with it doesn't matter. If you sell at a loss, you can subtract the loss from your capital gains though. (I'm not an accountant or anything though)

1	1522950393	2	lol
1	1522950380	1	Its not about refusing. @ 6k mark miners start losing money and if it stays below 6k for a while then this whole market will collapse.Anyone thats making bank out BTC (Exchanges, miners, Bitmex, Tether, Bitfinex and few others) will likely keep it around that price range because otherwise its no longer profitable.BTC is one of the easiest manipulated currencies we've probably seen in our life time. Right now its just bieng used as a tool to control the market, otherwise no one with a decent IQ is buying that piece of shit. 
2	1522951940	2	Not exactly how it works. If mining becomes unprofitable, then less people will mine and the difficulty adjusts. Then it becomes profitable again.

1	1522912811	5	Missed TRX?
2	1522912927	3	I got cryotobot ...it alerted me as soon as it got listed and I went all in lol
3	1522918553	1	Cryptobot? Have a link?
2	1522926295	1	Maybe, I did a trade to increase my position but pussied out at only 1% gains when I realised that while it looks like a pump that could just as quickly fall back down to support at 450ish sats, this could also quickly be 1 and 2 of an elliot wave.Seeing as I'm holding Tron longterm, it was more important to me to consolidate some profit into my position rather then just gambling it will drop back down.  But if it's not one of your long positions I wouldn't recommend buying in at this point as it's currently at a point where it could either drop by 30% or keep moving upwards to 1000+ sats.  Either way I'd say it's only really worth the risk if you have a longterm plan to hold a position in the project at this point, or you could quickly be left holding bags you don't want to hold.
0	1522940561	2	ONT the only thing working right now....(Ontology)Everything else has pumped and then dumped even harder

0	1522940579	1	Almost 3 weeks of EOS killing it.  Did I miss something?
1	1522941194	8	There is a rumor that EOS has been dumping the ETH from their ICO (something like 600k-1.3m ETH) to buy EOS and prop up the price. They want to flip ETH and are doing it in such a way that they make perpetual gains. IDK, someone smarter than me explained it on 4chan a few weeks ago. 
1	1522941377	7	Dan Larimer selling all of his ETH and buying EOS with it to pump the price.
1	1522942917	2	yes..look at larimers cvpeople says he leaves projects, but het gets it right when he starts one.steemit, bitshares. EOS imho is the one with the biggest chance of mass adoption in 2018.fairly heavily in on it. as for selling eth? well it is theirs. If people believe thats buggered eth, then all the more reason to invest in eos if thats true.
0	1522950760	2	So crypto has been around for 10 years. The one year out of ten when everything moons millions of new people jump aboard *surprise*, then when it begins reverting back to normal the year after people try to rationalize why. lulz
1	1522950947	2	I think most people mine set was that it was going to keep going up for a while, kept hearing about Bitcoin reaching 50K, so people think 20K would still be a good investment.

1	1522932240	3	Delaying the airdrop so KuCoin can support is a gift for many as the price is now much lower than a week ago. I'm also using it to my advantage.
2	1522932409	2	Bagholders? 
0	1522936905	4	Right now virtually everyone who owns cryptocurrencies is doing it for one reason: to exchange it for (hoprefully) more fiat in the future, so they can use that greater amount of fiat for actual transactions for real things.A deflationary currency makes people hoard it, because they expect it to be worth more in the future, and this lack of use prevents actual adoption. Along with that comes the decrease in velocity, which means that the monetary base (M = PQ/V) will stay high as long as people are holding it. Its a self-perpetuating cycle, people are holding in expectation for greater future worth which reduces velocity and increases value. But since nobody actually is using it as a transactional vehicle for real life value exchange, eventually that PQ portion of the equation (which is where the actual utility comes from) goes down. For example purchasing enough of a certain token to actually host a node becomes prohibitively expensive, as does the execution of actual smart contract code on platforms that support that but use the underlying token as the pricing mechanism for execution.Think about what this means: the actual utility of most cryptocurrencies today is nothing more than being a vehicle for getting more actually usable money in the future through a Greater Fool scheme. As long as that adoption doesn't follow, we will likely see fiat price declines now that the bubble is deflating. The bubble has to collapse and stabilize for actual real adoption to take place, no merchant or company will engage seriously with a currency or tokenization scheme whose fiat denominated value is so damn volatile. Bidding up the price on exchanges isn't actually helping crypto become part of anything but this greater fool scheme.
1	1522937432	7	I hear what you're saying and I don't disagree. But until I can pay my rent, bills and petrol with Crypto, my end goal will always be to better my fiat position.Once I'm able to pay for these basic needs in Crypto, then I'll have no need to take my investments out of this ecosystem.However, I am big HODLer of the Top 20 coins, and I plan to keep as much money as I can afford in Crpyto. So I'm doing my bit to keep this thing alive, even if it's a really small bit.
1	1522937550	7	Araonbunny you usually have some good insight  so I'm surprised to see you post something discouraging here. You losing faith or having a bad day?
2	1522937592	3	I'm posting something realistic. If you want blind "faith" and hopium, you won't get it from me.Bitcoin has turned out vastly different than how I imagined it several years ago. So has the crypto market in general. 
3	1522938449	3	Idk if it helps but I'm sure I'm not the only one here who has found your posts interesting and educational. You don't owe anyone here blind faith or hopium, you've contributed plenty. It's been a rough few months so I just hope you're not discouraged. Hope you have a good day buddy.
1	1522937711	4	FALSEi bought OCN because im going to europe next month and will use it for unlimited bike rides because its cheaper 
2	1522938741	3	You are in a tiny, tiny minority. Lets not kid ourselves, virtually everyone is doing it to increase the value of their fiat stack, its a speculative asset. Thats why this sub is so obsessed over its price rather than its adoption. Thats why talk about price, rather than adoption completely and utterly dominates all crypto related discussion everywhere.
1	1522939592	2	I bought VET to generate VTHO
1	1522939690	2	I tend to agree with your analysis. Deflation is inherently bad if the goal is to increase a currency's adoption & use. I also think we're still in a giant crypto bubble. What I'm having trouble figuring out is how to tell if/when the bubble has well & truly popped. In other words, where's the bottom? My initial thought was <$100B overall market cap by Q4 2018, but that's based on intuition more than anything. What do you think?Also, what alts are you still holding & why? 
1	1522936981	2	Bullshy.   I am accruing crypto for the day when we buy things based on sats...not USD/Euro/Yen/etc...Freedom or fiat off.

3	1522937457	3	bullshit.  why are you still posting in cryptocurrency.
4	1522937511	4	I literally posted about it in December when I did a valuation for Bitcoin and put it between 5-7K:>I first purchased BTC back in 2013 and liquidated my position after it hit 15K.https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n47be/i_built_these_3_fundamental_valuation_models_for/
5	1522937747	4	Well that's a different story - you bought at a relative low price and sold at 75% of ATH.   That's smart.
2	1522940862	2	I don't understand this ridiculous hostility towards someone presenting reasonable opinions. This is childish. 
0	1522910124	1	So, apparently an exchange (Coinex, I think) is selling credit-default swaps on Tether. Has anyone here bought one? What were the terms? 
0	1522910791	1	Are there any games involving crypto? Like where you find or collect crypto?Furthermore are there any apps that heavily gamify the crypto experience?
1	1522912419	9	Binance
1	1522911375	4	Well Enjin coin is working on this system. Recently they started to work with minecraft. Its not about game simulating crypto mining, just about geting crypto into gaming.
1	1522911528	3	Etherbots
1	1522915013	1	Enjin.
1	1522917296	1	Etherbots is a cool blockchain game I've been playing a bit. 
2	1522921244	1	What about it do you enjoy, if you don't mind me asking?
0	1522915521	1	Upbit giving away 70 million tron on trading competition ~  hence the pump.
1	1522915591	1	When does it end
2	1522915951	2	On april 11 midnight korean time ~  using krw pair you need to trade tron at least once and then whatever you hold on that date and time upbit will give you 2% more tron.So if you are holding 1000 they give you 20 free tron.BUT  they are also taking a 20% tax off of anything over 50,000krw...
0	1522916693	1	Anybody having trouble with binance mobile app? I have funds in my account but every time I try to buy anything it says insufficient funds. No limit orders or anything. I can't buy a single thing. But all my funds are there
1	1522917210	1	It's acting like I got buy orders in but they aren't on my order history. 
2	1522917383	2	Yes, I am having issues.  Sucks cause I am away from my computer for the next 4 hours, and I really need to put in a sell order for something.  
3	1522917426	1	Glad to know I'm not the only one. It wont let me do shit. Buy or sell.
4	1522917789	2	I suppose this type of unforseen technical difficulties is one good argument for just HODLing.  
3	1522919590	1	I hope you didn’t go all in on CTR
0	1522918172	1	Can you set price alarms in the binance app? 
1	1522919438	2	You can’t
2	1522920046	3	Damn. Good app tho. 
3	1522922043	2	You can with delta tho/crypto bot
3	1522931134	1	My most used app, handy when you're at work
4	1522932319	2	Yeah now I can lose money no matter where I am. 
0	1522920842	1	delta says drgn is up 7% in past hour but im not up by that much?
1	1522922224	6	Delta has hacked your wallet. 
0	1522927017	1	In light of the TRX bithumb listing, what's the quickest way to get an alert of new coin listings on bithumb?   You can follow the binance twitter account to get new listings for binance, but I noticed the 'official bithumb' twitter is very slow to post new listings if they post them at all.
0	1522930554	1	For any Old Timers here who went through a bear market in the past  - did it feel this agonizing?
1	1522930680	3	My brother is an old timer and he tells me he thinks we're going to be in a bear market for the rest of the year which is depressing 
2	1522931029	1	Time to work and accumulate i guess
1	1522930835	6	I don’t think countries were banning exchanges back then. I could be wrongEdit:I was wrong
1	1522932663	2	It would be more agonising holding at the moment.We all know bitcoin will lose its exclusivity as the big exchanges have announced fiat to Alts. Therefore bypassing BTC,LTC and ETH. in part the value of these are due to them being gateways to the Alts.This needs to happen for the market to evolve (shit, I'll write a short article)..
0	1522931508	1	I wonder what happened to all the old school altcoins, like peercoin, ixcoin, etc
