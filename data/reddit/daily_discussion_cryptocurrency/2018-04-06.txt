0	1523007986	20	Youtube certainly hasn't banned ico advertising. Wow.
1	1523008734	17	Yep! No way Bunny Token is a scam. That looks legit AF! /s
2	1523011245	2	I wonder if Alex the Cryptoinvestor is reading our bullish sentiments right now. /s
1	1523008211	8	The ban comes into effect in June.  However, I noticed this week that I got more ads than I've ever seen before on yourtube for Crypto.  One was a clear scamy bot setup.  Maybe they are trying to get as many out there before the ban?
2	1523008776	6	Bunny Token? So annoying.
3	1523009414	2	No, mine was some scammy robot software called "The Bitcoin code".  Within the first 2 minutes there was an old guy saying he became a millionaire and then another guy saying he made 400K in 20 something days.  That was enough for me, didn't even watch the end of it.
0	1523010951	48	1. Post "Bitcoin will be worth xxxxx by end of 2018".2. Repeat every day, on a different crypto sub, until the end of 2018.3. At the end of 2018, delete all inaccurate predictions and keep the closest one.4. Post "I told you so" with link on /r/CryptoCurrency/.5. Bask in glory.
1	1523018777	2	You can set a RemindMe bot to message you, to make is easier."Dam this CryptoPanda14 dude is legit" - Everyone in 2019
0	1523008177	14	Considering banks are unsure of whether or not to support Cryptocurrency transactions, taking India as the latest example. Why on earth aren't more people using Revolut? Revolut has been an absolute life saver for me. Is it not currently available to countries outside Europe or something? 
1	1523008628	5	Only a matter of time before everyone will be supporting our movement. 
0	1522995885	31	I just logged into Robinhood and Bitcoin was available to buy. I had never linked it to my bank, so I clicked buy and it led me to deposit funds, I chose my bank from a list, logged in, and transferred $50 just to see how many days it would take, and instead as soon as I hit transfer it was available to buy bitcoin - took like 60 seconds start to finish. So sweet. 
1	1522996449	16	Probably same as buying stocks, robinhood will lend you up to $1000 to trade ahead of time until your deposit finish processing. 
1	1522996130	7	Can you transfer it out?
2	1522996420	11	Ahh it's funny, right after I posted that I was looking for how to withdrawal BTC, and at this time you can not. It is coming soon according to their website. Also, I looked and you can access up to $1000 instantly, but have to wait for normal settlement time for anything above that. 
2	1522996411	4	no
0	1523002258	32	This is good for bitcoinShaking out weak handsBuilding support baseBlablablablaHow many hands need to be shaken? 
1	1523002353	24	I'm glad we don't see the classic "shaking out the weak hands" excuse anymore. I envy the weak hands if anything.
2	1523003881	5	As do I. I wouldn't have had to waste hours and hours day trading to stay afloat. Could have cashed out all of it (not just my initial), waltzed onto coinbase and picked up several big bags. "friends made along the way blah blah"
1	1523004197	2	Im considering buying back in anywehre between 5-6k
1	1523004421	2	There are unlimited amount of weak hands, like mosquitos they always come back in the summer. 
0	1523033203	29	I have a new co-worker starting this coming monday, they sent around an introductory email where he mentions that he loves computers, new technology and investing. He's a young dude (25).Made a bet with another co-worker that this guy will mention Bitcoin to any of us before next friday. I should be good, right?
1	1523034260	16	Dude stop talking about Dan behind his back
2	1523034432	8	But it's so damn obvious that Dan is gonna shill Bitcoin.
3	1523034782	4	‚ÄúHey guys do you guys also invest in BEANIE BABIES? I use my extensive computer and technical knowledge to trade collect and sell them‚Äù
3	1523035602	2	‚ÄúYo Ripple?‚Äù
1	1523033371	12	Yes, do your part and order a crypto coffee mug and use it when he starts. Up your bet with your coworker you will be golden haha
2	1523033519	12	This is how you ACTUALLY make money in a bear market!! :P
2	1523033657	5	Part of the bet is that none of us can talk about anything crypto unless he starts it. (Basically, I can't cheat and none of us can say the word "Bitcoin" for a week unless he does.)EDIT: Also, if he says that "it is up 10%" I can't ask him; "what is?"
1	1523033995	7	It's me
2	1523034501	2	Dammit
1	1523033859	5	If he really is into those things, he might make fun of Bitcoin before next Friday.
1	1523033256	2	Bitcoin or crypto in general.
2	1523033717	3	Just Bitcoin, if he never mentions Bitcoin but talks about cryptocurrency for a week, I still lose.
3	1523033754	3	Yea,  definitely do the bitcoin coffee mug lol
3	1523033999	2	this changes the game. if he really is into investing and new techs i bet he doesn't mention bitcoin at all. too mainstream, too common knowledge.  
0	1523007747	12	Another day, more money lost üòïJust waiting to break even
0	1523023849	44	Tether's market cap represents money that has entered the marketplace, has temporarily exited and is waiting to jump back in... waiting for the bottom. People who left for good have left into Fiat, not into tether. People who left into tether are ready and eager to jump back in. Due to it's stablecoin nature, USDT market cap is one of the only coins whose marketcap actually legit represents how much money is in the pile. It's been estimated that new money entering the crypto space has an approximate 50x magnification factor on changing price. I.e. 1B USD entering will typically cause a 50B USD increase in market cap. Remember, market cap is simply last price x circulating supply. Increasing buy pressure (or sell pressure) impacts price, not only by crushing through the order books, but by making people see that someone is willing to pay more for an asset they want to buy, and they then adjust their opinion of it. This has an extreme snowball effect either way. Look at how sell pressure has convinced many people that BTC is going to zero. Or in December, buy pressure convinced people that BTC was going to $1M per coin by 2020. Right now, many people think BTC is going to zero, but half the reason for that is that everyone sitting in Tether financially benefit from BTC falling further. You don't think the people posting on this sub that crypto is dead have no financial incentive to convince you to sell? Of course they do, they are holding tether, waiting for you to sell, to drop price further so they make more money coming back in. They have the same incentive that I have, telling you that now is a good time to buy, because I've loaded up my bags on this pullback and am ready for the next boost. I'm not going to lie to you and tell you I have no financial incentive for the price to rise. I do. I'm loaded up and ready to go. I'm not missing the bottom. And the thing that's making me confident that there is going to be another bullrun is the sheer absurd size of the USDT market cap. This represents money that's going to cause a spark of buy pressure, like we've never seen before.When the bull market comes and the tether people find their entry points, and FOMO starts kicking in, and outside money starts pouring back in, we're going back up. How far up? That's the question? When? That's the other side of it.Is BTC and crypto dying though? Tether's marketcap says everything I need it to say... no fucking way in hell. There's a LOT of money, just waiting, watching, trying to time the bottom, frothing at the mouth, ready to jump back in.If we go sideways for a little bit, and volume picks up for a few days, and tether people start buying in.... and prices rise and starts liquidating more and more shorts, that's your signal that we're going to start seeing Mr Bean train gifs.If people were actually giving up on crypto, we wouldn't see Tether market cap where it is, because they would exit into fiat (like many have done). But no, we are seeing tether market cap rise and rise and rise. This is a huge positive sign, that people are afraid of the dip, but they believe in the tech, the market, and that there will be a bull market again. And you know what's an even bigger sign that the bottom is near?Look at tether market cap over the last few weeks. It's pretty stable. What does that represent? That means that most people who have moved out to tether have done so. Nobody is stupid enough to tether up in this market right now. I'm pretty convinced that we are going to see buy pressure start to build up in the next few weeks, and the tether market cap is going to SLOWLY start to fall. Holy fuck, the moment you see that happen, you better get the fuck back in here, because we're taking off. The moment the first few pebbles are thrown back into the lake, we are going to see a snowball effect that is going to be massive. Likely bigger than anything we've seen before.Don't be stupid next time though, take some profits. You may miss the top, but at least you will recoup some money. 
1	1523024169	10	Thanks Suuperdad.
1	1523024939	11	I feel stupid now for not noticing the Tether cap as a source for market prediction before. Thanks for the positive vibes and helpful info. 
1	1523025017	8	Thanks Dad, saying the things I need to hear at the right time.  Suuperdad!
1	1523025141	5	I wonder how much fiat is sitting in gdax for example waiting to buy back in 
1	1523027856	4	Thanks for the interesting and motivating read. This would not be out of place as a standalone post on the sub, you know. I think a lot of people would benefit from reading this.
1	1523027744	3	thanks for pointing out this perspective
1	1523029313	2	Isn't the market cap of Tether always the same (except when they issue more)? It's just a question of who is holding it, the exchanges, or traders, waiting to buy in. How are you measuring the amount people are holding? If you can measure what people hold, and it's going way up, your premise makes sense.  
1	1523024811	2	Very good observations - the real market depth and the influence of tether were already covered in this very good comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7xae98/understanding_tether_why_it_accounts_for_a/Read it guys - and because of this Suuperdads comment makes A LOT of sense and shows that it will go as usual with this market - first up, then down, then up and so on - as long as there is greed, and the opportunity for crazy gains, we'll have people flocking into crypto, or never leaving it in the first place!
0	1522996199	22	I'm getting tired of seeing it plummet, every. single. day. 
1	1522996274	9	Take advantage of the predictability of the market and just short it, easy.
2	1522996350	6	which exchange let you short it?
2	1522996438	4	I've tried, but it never gets to the price i want to tether at.
3	1522996605	5	Well that's just silly, if - as you say - the market plummets every single day then you shouldn't be too picky about what exact price you sell at, that's just sunk-cost fallacy
4	1522996760	5	You're right, whenever it plummets i think i should have just taken it when i could. I honestly thought it wouldn't dive down till sunday
4	1522997189	3	Just looked up sunk-cost fallacy, thanks for that.
0	1523025139	12	So I just skimmed through the Verge subreddit. Wow. I need a shower.
1	1523025424	3	Try the telegram channel. Bonus for once you've had your fill: Say something about the hack and see how long it takes to get banned. 
2	1523025949	2	I know they have their merits, but most telegram channels I've spent any time on seem cancerous.
1	1523025435	2	Though not quite that bad, most crypto subs don't read much better. Notable exceptions: Omisego, link
2	1523025883	2	True. It's amazing how emotionally attached people get to what they choose to put money into. Seems like investing emotionally is a recipe for disaster.
0	1522997321	21	I'm really digging OMG, once the markets finish capitulating it'll be the first to lead the charge.
1	1522998162	5	It did already perform 25% better than Eth in the past month. I wonder if ETH is gonna catch up or if omg is gonna continue to outperform it.
1	1522998119	5	Agree
0	1523007101	10	This is from February, but it is just as applicable today as it was then. https://hackernoon.com/popping-the-bubble-blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-7130156f91b2TL;DR  "What differentiates last week‚Äôs crash from the ultimate ‚Äúbubble popping‚Äù crash? Perhaps nothing. It‚Äôs possible that the digital asset markets will continue to rise, fall, rise, fall until the point that adoption brings stability. It could be that last week‚Äôs crash will be the most dramatic that we ever see. However, I think the significant difference is that during last week‚Äôs crash, nothing fundamental changed about the assets. The crash was entirely based on speculation and market uncertainty. I think the ultimate crash will occur because of some fundamental change in the underlying assets. This may be a series of DLT companies that cease development because of poor management or implementation hurdles. It could be that a security flaw is discovered in a number of large cap projects (IOTA anyone?). Regardless, I think in the wake of the crash, many previous blockchains will die, condemned for an eternity of existence with no further development.It‚Äôs possible blockchain transforms every industry and never sees a crash such that dominated the early 2000s. It‚Äôs possible that blockchain and cryptocurrency rivals today‚Äôs equity markets. It‚Äôs possible that decentralization is so dramatically different and successful that it fundamentally changes the way companies and projects develop, the way humans psychologically interact with markets. It‚Äôs possible‚Ä¶.but I doubt it. We may be playing a brave new game, but we have a lot to learn from the players and games that came before us.Digital assets and DLT may very well change the world. But the journey is going to be bumpy."

0	1523007762	9	I'm still getting coin ads (Bunnytoken lol) on every single Youtube video. Weren't they going to ban ALL crypto ads?
1	1523007970	5	i actually prefer ads , then i know for sure which coin to avoid at all costs.
1	1523008492	4	1% price increase everyday!!! What is so hard to understand?! Just give them all your money now!

0	1522995552	26	Ah crypto.. i can not think of a more entertaining way to lose money. What a shitshow. Congratulations humanity, you‚Äôve outdone yourself.
1	1522996876	9	Also is this what gambling addiction is like? 
2	1523000042	4	Not if you ignore and hold like me.

1	1523028035	3	Not a great start at all
0	1523030293	6	Anyone remember that guy here who put his entire student loan into the market shortly before it tanked from 12k even though we told him not to? His last post I remember was bragging about his gains and how dumb we were for trying to dissuade him then poof, silence.Edit: I know one of you rainmen out there have memorized every discussion thread. Hook a brother up with a link.Edit: [Found it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7v9l1z/i_just_took_out_10k_worth_of_student_loans_to_buy/) I honestly feel for the guy. Dayum.
1	1523030452	4	Following for sauce.
2	1523030616	2	I'm on mobile so I can't even begin to search for it. Hoping someone pulls through.

2	1523031849	2	RIP in peace
1	1523031929	2	Bloody hell! I saw a post in the Ripple sub the other day about a guy who took out a $25k loan for xrp - I'll see if I can find it. 
1	1523032061	2	I felt bad for the guy until I read his responses. What an asshole 
1	1523035590	2	I got a loan for crypto in Jan. Meh. Could've gone better. I should've kept most of it in fiat and waited for the inevitable dip, but that's hindsight.
1	1523031712	3	People called me stupid for putting half my savings in ETH at $11. Works boths ways. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
0	1522996767	35	Ok ppl, I have it, now is the time to invest in XVG, hear me out, all signs are here:* Utter shitcoin characteristics - check* Clueless, incapable dev(team - no team here, thats a huge bonus) - check* Cult following - strong one on this shitcoin, Big check* Use of following tactics - censorship, lying, mass banning for voicing concerns and questions - check* Unsuccessful copying/stealing of other projects code/solutions - oh boy, yeah, check as fuck* Proven track record of lies and unfulfilled goals - checkedie check* Bonus: announcement of announcement for future announcement of announcement - thats right, MONSTER CHECKThis scam-shitcoin, by all that is holy in crypto, will explode as soon as the new ~~update~~, ~~hardfork~~, ~~patch~~, I dunno what that even is now, ~~solution?~~, to their problem is released within ~~hours~~, ~~tomorrow~~, ~~days~~, within a reasonable time frame. You heard it here first. 
1	1522999620	2	Probably exit scamming in 2 weeks, CHECK!
0	1522998141	13	Anyone notice how strong in satoshi's alts held this dump? So far I should say....I almost tetherd while I went for dinner and when I got back I was like fuck here we go and figured my only saving grace would be to swoop up some alts that guy slaughtered. Nope. Haven't noticed them be quite this steadfast last couple months. 
0	1522995858	6	No worries, it‚Äôs almost weekend!
1	1522996559	6	It always dumps on weekends what do you mean no worries?
0	1523017249	7	I‚Äôm losing money even todayHaha yes!
1	1523017790	3	What about the odd days? üòÖ
0	1523032567	8	I'm just here for the lolz
0	1523033134	6	The network hashrate for Monero has been falling off a cliff with the hardfork. It looks like ASICs have been silently running in the background for quite some time.
0	1523014827	14	Holy shit, that XVG blockchain legitly got raped, gangbanged and slaughtered all at the same time. Whatever the stoner dev is doing, its making the situation even more worse, ahahahahahttps://imgur.com/a/km6Aj
1	1523015244	5	It is well deserved and all the morons who gave that idiot money deserve what they get. 
0	1523023469	13	Started crypto a year ago. Was 9x at one point. I am now back to my total investment. So that was a glorious waste of time. 
1	1523023572	6	Man, there must have been some unfortunate trades in there for you to be only breaking even now if you got in at April last year.
2	1523024034	5	He likely isn't the only one who kept putting more money in over time. It's not like anyone goes all in right at the beginning, especially if they want put a percentage of their paycheck in every month. 
2	1523024566	3	Strikes and gutters. Over half my investment was later 2017, early 2018 however, not all in April 2017.
1	1523024172	2	Damn that sucks. I got in last June, went 20x my initial and now around 4x. 
0	1523031159	6	Any news for NANO? Seems like its making a move
1	1523031282	3	Idk but buying it sub $5 this morning was a great move. Just dumped it for a quick profit...  Now watch it continue to climb so I can be sad..  üòí. Lol
1	1523031269	2	Twitter tip bot maybe. Either way, meh.
0	1523022823	15	January 96, 2018
1	1523022908	8	The longest ever recorded January in the history of mankind
0	1523027896	18	10 days before tax season ends. You're sitting in tether, you see institutional money gaining approval to start investing trillions into digital coins, development is moving forward and gaining incredible momentum. BTC is currently 6.5k, fallen from the dizzying heights of 19k whilst other assets have plunged 80% or more from their ATHsYet..... you're waiting for a $500 drop before you buy in? 
1	1523028225	8	Waiting for a possible bottom falling out to make a reaping on my favorite alt coin. If it doesn't? Oh well that's why it's called a hedge. Potential for gain/mitigating loss is much more valuable to me than timing the bottom correctly.Especially since I have a hodl stack I am not touching regardless. If the market takes off while my trading stack is tethered...greatYou folks who act like watching your gains disappear is honorable. It's stupid
2	1523028359	6	Waiting for a clear trend reversal is *the* smartest thing you can do at this point. There's no clear bottom here, who knows where this is going and for how long this bear market is going to last. Do I think it's going to go much lower? Not really but what the fuck do I know, I'm holding more bags than grocery store clerk.
1	1523027962	6	Well fucking said sir. Well fucking said.
1	1523028100	7	Exactly.  Perfectly buying the bottom is for noobs with OCD.  Your portfolio isn't going to be wildly different if you buy in at 6k vs. 6500.  The chance you have to buy at 7 or 8k because you missed 6k is equally likely.
2	1523028741	2	Some us enjoy trying to snipe bottoms. I got the last $1800 last sumber and it was kick ass. Expecting around $4900 this time, but who knows, could be bottom now.
2	1523028466	2	Exactly this - people need to realise anyone with common sense is loading up and accumulating at these levels.Only the degenerate gamblers are trying to trade here. 
1	1523027958	4	Nice sales pitch. You sell time shares too?
1	1523028526	4	I aint waiting for shit. I stopped tethering last week (even though I was only tethering a portion of my portfolio)... We got our discounts.. Thank you January! Now we go up :)
1	1523028649	1	Agree... the boton is now. Maybe we will never see thisboportunity again... all chart analysis say it. Make your position in top 5 coins marketcap

0	1523006796	4	got banned from Verge reddit, made only 1 reply, well worth it.Pic of honor: https://imgur.com/a/UeVve
1	1523006921	8	I got banned from the Telegram yesterday asking for an ETA on a fix. 
0	1523013816	5	I finally figured out whats happening lads! Whales are working to push Dentacoin out of the top 100, and have been consistently manipulating the market to achieve this goal. It's not in spot #100 exactly, prepare your wallets for another bull run! Thats of course until 4/20 when all the stoners will be withdrawing their cryptogains to smoke em up...
0	1523019415	6	It officially starts, rumor is the XVG partnership is now at stake. gonna need some more popcorn!
1	1523019688	7	Exit scam!
1	1523019800	5	That hack was a convenient way to try shift the lack of a partnership to announce onto someone else!
1	1523019696	3	[No way!!!](https://i.imgur.com/7i7LOGg.mp4)
0	1523019755	4	Seems for the most part, the bear market is an equal opportunity merchant of death. All coins seem to eventually normalise at the bottom, even the ones that had big pumps since the downtrend started. Eg. WTC, NANO, GVT, ICX, all crashing back down to earth
1	1523020170	3	Seeing these big projects tanking doesn‚Äôt give much hope. 
0	1523031736	4	Woho welcome to CMC ELA, also new partnership. Its the small wins :)
0	1523037458	5	Looks like Bitcoin is frozen. Can someone get Satoshi to unplug it and plug it back in again?
1	1523038101	4	Blow on the cartridge.

0	1523019198	15	A bit over 80% down now and just starting not to care and just want it to hit 0 so I could be done with this. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself to never get in crypto. Fuck this market man.
1	1523019887	11	Pretend it has gone to zero. Honestly just write it all off as a loss and imagine it doesn't exist anymore.
1	1523019332	6	Username checks out
1	1523019602	3	It can be 0 now if you stop checking portfolio. That‚Äôs what I did and I‚Äôm quite content with it all stowed in the ledger. Reading comments and news in the sub is good enough.
1	1523024400	2	That's what you would tell yourself if you could go back in time? After that parabolic runup, I would tell myself to make a lot more money

0	1522997872	12	1k btc sell wall on bitfinex. This market is so hilariously manipulated. Crypto can never have legitimacy as a real currency until this is fixed.
1	1523002563	2	Thing is, this can be fixed if Binance work together with Bitfinex and other exchanges. Implement strict measures that prevent people putting thousands of BTC on the market for a moment then taking them off.  Stop the bots being able to crash or pump a coin. When you send a fucking BTC transaction you need to get it right. Same should apply to orders. Put the order in the order book and make sure it's right. If it's wrong and you lose out, tough shit. Get it right next time.  There's no legitimate reason for someone to list 1,500 BTC for 25% less or more than it's worth, for only 10 seconds.
0	1523010089	7	Is there anyone here who invested more than they can comfortably afford to lose, and is now in the negative on their initial? How much by? I ask because I am still up on my initial because I got in last summer, but still feeling pretty shitty for being down 75% on ATH. Those in the negative, are you still confident in getting back into profit eventually? Is there a cut off point that you're going to sell at?
1	1523010903	5	Well, wouldn't it be a good idea to cut back if you invested too much since you are still up? For myself, I only put in like 5-7% of my savings so I don't really care as much as some of the other people.  As such, I kind of treat it as a hobby/game to see if I can increase my SATs.   But I do think that if I had invested like 50-100% my savings, I would be pretty scared and at that point, I might just HODL.  
1	1523016080	2	Iam down on my intital investment but i still believe strongly. MC will hit 1 Trillion. Maybe this year maybe next. Maybe in 2 months. Nobody knows when but it will happen. People dont change. Watch the fking charts - people will buy sooner or later. Greed is mighty as fuck. Have a nice weekend ladies. 
1	1523010513	2	I have been slowly investing since we were around 8k. I put the most in sub 7.5k, with a lot ofBuys around 6700. I‚Äôm currently down 20% on my initial investment. This is after being up almost 300% last year. Yeah, it sucks to lose money but when I bought those coins, I thought they were a good price. Even if we do hit sub 6k, there is no way we won‚Äôt be back up to at least 8k once again. Might take a bit, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll profit once we reach that number. So I‚Äôm holdin and adding. 
0	1523030719	9	All I see lately is;Bitcoin is worthless it has no value it will go to zero and so will the market... the next few years look bleak. Followed by;Remember when Bitcoin was at 20k, it‚Äôll end this year on 30k minimum and be at 100k by 2020zzz it‚Äôs digital gold. I‚Äôm at 50% losses on my alts and not sure what to believe anymore. Save me.

2	1523031761	3	So true, stay wise my friend
1	1523032482	2	1) It's very unlikely this was the highest point we'll ever reach 2) Fundamentals are constantly improving3) Big money will not let Bitcoin die However4) There won't be a sudden bull run for a while 5) Most coins/tokens are still way overvalued due to no utility (yet)6) Most coins/tokens will die Oh, and to spare some bright minds the pleasure - "nob00dy kn00ws anything!!!11"
2	1523034812	2	> 5) Most coins/tokens are still way overvalued *due to no utility (yet)*BTC is most certainly in this group, which is really sad after so many months (years, even) of promises about the glory of Lightning NetworkWhat a joke.
1	1523030927	3	What do you believe Scottyn?
2	1523032108	3	I believe we‚Äôre on to something great here. Blockchain Tech can change the world. I think banks may develop their own chains to keep it ‚Äòcentralised‚Äô, we‚Äôre still a long way away from ‚Äòbeating the system‚Äô I also think I was ‚Äòlate for being early‚Äô buying in Nov ‚Äò17 but at least I‚Äôm at the right party... right? P.s nice tag! 
3	1523033006	2	I think your opinion is that of the right future, one in which we're headed towards.  It may be 5-10 years...but we're headed that way.And thanks...i try.
1	1523032758	3	I have most of my portfolio in stellar. Because I see it actually being used.BTC will be around but it‚Äôs not gonna be #1 for much longer.
2	1523032991	3	No reason for ETH to flip BTC before proof of stake goes live.
1	1523031344	3	Research research research and then learn some TA skills. I use to believe TA doesnt work on crypto but the last month I have learned that it is very useful. TA just gives to the ability to forecast where the price could go. I follow a guy who teaches TA on youtube, his channel is HypedOnCrypto and he is the real deal. He does 2 live streams per day and will TA any coin you request and does BTC, ETH, and LTC every hour. Research is just so important bc we are investing in an unknown proven service/product. Crypto is kinda like being a venture capitalist, you are investing in a company/coin in the very early beginnings of its existence. There is a reason buying apple stock just feels right and safe. Its proven and has been around forever. If the stock market tanked and you owed Amazon or Apple you would feel comfortable bc you know those companies well. Well crypto is still a baby and in the super early stages. Need to realize that it might take time for your favorite coin to succeed or fail. Make sure your investing what you can lose and make a plan for investing. Good luck 
2	1523031996	2	I keep adding little bits here and there but I put my main chunk in at the end of Nov 2017. We‚Äôve started to recede back to those times. I shoulda took profit when I had it. I have what I believe in I just don‚Äôt want the whole damn thing to go to zero! 
3	1523032140	2	Take profit is something I regret not doing. But live and learn, i want more coins with my profits but Im super bullish longterm on my biggest holding.
2	1523031610	2	TA is all I use these days. It fucking works. Those that say otherwise are poor, lazy, and/or stupid.
3	1523031848	2	Or they overemphasize its limitations.
3	1523031991	2	Yea I still have my longterm holds but Im starting to understand TA especially in a bear market is real. News, bull market, etc can all disrespect TA but for the most part its spot on. 
4	1523032262	2	It's all about risk management
3	1523032011	2	TA and regular trading? No hold? 
4	1523032315	2	TA and short/midterm trading. Hold select few long term. Just remember, they are all shitcoins.
1	1523034191	1	It's going to be bleak until some of these "partnerships" turn into actual use\adoption for one or more coins.  Once that happens then the next wave of FOMO will cause the next bull run.  Might be a year from now or never, who knows, but I am hoping it does.
2	1523034497	2	I agree. Invest in coins with confirmed partnerships. Extra points for those that hold joint events with their well-connected strategic partnerships where they confirmed all present and future clients currently on their private blockchain will be on their public blockhain.Adoption and legitmacy is 100% the biggest priority in the space right now, moreso than tech
1	1523036112	2	Just watch the fking MC chart or BTC chart and zoom out. Its a cycle and we in the "crypto is dead" part. After that comes the "moon" part. This wont change. The only question is how long do we need to switch the sentiment from dead to moon. 2 months? 1 year? 3 years? No matter what. BTC will break its ATH and many alts will follow.

0	1523024720	6	for everyone asking if its a good time to buy (aka to put more FIAT in now): find the fastest way to transfer money and the fastest coin to move stuff around (typically this is litecoin?). at best all this can be done within only few hours. put the coin into an exchange which has USDT (or alike), then its simply parked there for when you plan to use it, e.g. when the perceived final dip of dippening has come. that way your money is already in and you 1) dont lose time to put the money to use when you need it and 2) in case this wouldnt have been the final dip you can move it back to parking position again.by choosing a fast way to transfer the money and a fast moving coin you can keep the loss of money in this bear market to a minimum.

Literally everything is on Google.Once you've learnt one language you can learn any language with minimal effort. Then read the Ethereum white paper and look at some basic examples on Solidity.

0	1523022861	7	People on here seem to have learnt nothing from the past year. You are all still asking if it is a good time to buy. Spoiler: Nobody knows. BTC could go to 0 in 5 years. Or it could go back to 20k or maybe even higher.If you believe in it and want to invest in it and have, say, $10k to invest then put it into the market as $500 a week for the next 20 weeks of something. Don't just put it all in at a single price.A bunch of morons did not invest over time when they bought in at $10k+ during the FOMO bubble and they have screwed themselves. Do not be these people. Invest over time not in a single go.
1	1523023172	6	For markets that you believe will go up long term, it is in your best interest not to invest over time, but instead to invest it all asap.
2	1523023635	6	I believe Crypto will go up long term, but I only started investing in Nov, Dec 17.  I am so glad I didn't invest in it all asap!  I bought a whopping EUR60 worth of BTC at 14K, and EUR100 worth of LTC at 200 USD.  If I had gone all in then I would be way more screwed than I am now.  It's all about timing.  I'm now buying while it's lower than what I initially paid to bring my average down, and I'm putting in more at these low prices than I put in at the start.  No regrets so far, maybe it's all about timing.  
2	1523023348	2	So FOMO in essentially.
3	1523023534	5	FOMO is an emotional explanation.  If you believe the market will go up, then being in the market longer will provide the most gain.  It's been shown that it is better to lump sum into the stock market than dollar cost average, and performs better 2/3 of the time.  It's just math.
1	1523023643	7	Better yet. Do not invest at all. Save yourself from the future regrets.

0	1523022287	6	Investing in crypto is like investing in love. You think it's the right time but it isn't. You give your all but all you get is heartache and disappointments. Sigh.
1	1523023198	2	Except it isn't love until you meet your true soulmate God made for you and not the one you're projecting due to impatience. After that you two head to the moon and nothing can stop what you will become. Everything you do together will be for a greater good as you grow and produce goodness in the world and every hardship is nothing more than the tempering of your relationship together.

1	1523003021	4	Google for 2 mins and you find all you lazy bastard
2	1523007806	3	Shut up, Dad
1	1523003286	3	This is the 3rd BNB burn; one in october, one in december and one this month. Each burn has had a big price bump *after* the burn. The December burn sent the price from $10 -> $24 which is what people believe to be the actual value of the coin if it weren't being dragged around by BTC. Binance basically use some of their profits to buy back a certain amount of BNB and remove them from the network, reducing the supply which increases the value. The more profit Binance make, the more coins are burned and the more value BNB holders see. Increasing demand + reducing reducing supply. You don't need to take an economics class to see why thats a good thing.

I feel the market is saturated with 'currencies' and regardless of fees (or lack of) and latency specs, I find it very difficult to envisage adoption of a single currency.
1	1523005964	6	That's the big problem of Nano, getting actually used by regular people, everyday and for every purpose. I mean if Bitcoin worked like Nano (with scalability) then sure it would be a home run. Right now they have a massive challenge ahead to get wide adoption. Nano only truly works right now if both the buyer and seller wants Nano. It doesn't work if only one part wants to use it.Unless you used something like Kyber Network with it. But that's what Request Network is setting out to do. Which I think will be easier for sellers to adopt.
2	1523006445	7	Yeah I agree mate. This is why my main holding is in OMG and other platform coins, I struggle to envisage adoption of singular currencies, whereas OMG etc will aid adoption of all simultaneously. The amount of hype around coins like Nano is very confusing to me, So trying to find out what people actually think 
1	1523011800	3	I can see BTC being improved and adopted far faster than Nano will ever be. VHS or Beta comes to mind. Beta was by far the better format. Most of you don't even know what I'm talking about, some of you don't even know what VHS was, but VHS came out on top. Point, The best seldom wins these wars. Bitcoin is a household word now, mention nano, and you get Mork and Mindy response.BTW, I agree, you will see the adoption eventually of several I'm sure, but you start with 1 first.
2	1523014406	2	VHS came out on top because the pornography industry adopted it. So I guess it has to be PornCoin?
2	1523013842	2	Not a chance. Previous booms have been because of speculator interest only - not because of actual adoption. Adoption of Bitcoin (over 9 years) has been appallingly low, mostly because nothing about it is actually usable. No one would use Bitcoin to buy a coffee when they need to stand around for 30 minutes to wait for confirmations, and pay a bigger fee than the coffee itself.  In a "green" economy, the mining electricity usage alone (bigger than Denmark's) is never going to sell it to people.Lightning Network isn't going to be the answer either, because its user Experience is dreadful - let alone the centralization of hubs that will have to occur to find sufficiently-funded routes through to recipients.But Nano just works - and though it's only been 4-5 months since less than 1000 people in the world had even heard of it, it's starting to get adoption already. We haven't had any Nano marketng *at all* yet. Once it starts, acceptance will rocket.
1	1523005918	5	I don't necessarily think it will be widely adopted, as what you say is correct.However, if there was something in the top 100 now that was to be used widely by 3rd world countries etc for micropayments, then it has to be nano as it has the best working product atm.If IOTA does what it says, then IOTA could win. But I will hold nano until confirmed.

0	1523030886	3	The Elastos circulating supply has been updated on CMC and ELA is now ranked 73 with a current circulating supply of 5,140,074.People will be asking where this coin came from...get it while it's cheap I just loaded up. Huobi is the only place it can be traded for at this time. Huobi works fine just be careful and if you are American, say you are from Canada, the telegram mods even said so. DYOR first of course, I don't want anyone losing any funds.
0	1523032596	3	So I downloaded Abra app and at first glance it looks so much better than Coinbase.Mainly I‚Äôll use it to by stellar with fiat. Has anyone else used this app? I only just read about it now that they offered a bunch more alt coins to buy directly without having to buy btc first.Waiting for my fiat to clear so I can do my test buy this weekend.
1	1523032929	2	I have it - haven't used it yet...but when I start market buying again, it'll be my go to app over CB.
2	1523037112	2	I asked someone in the stellar sub about using it and they said it worked great and had no fees which is real nice.I'm so tired of having to buy bitcoin/eth to go then get another coin. This will be a nice change.

1	1523034228	11	THERE'S A PROJECT CALLED ETHEREUM.YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF IT.
0	1523034625	4	Call the bottom:BTC 6kETH 300-350*(more specifically 298 for ETH) 
1	1523034946	3	324 eth4.7 btc.
2	1523035231	5	If BTC drops below 6K it's gonna drop pretty hard and Eth is gonna see a 2 in that first digit.
2	1523035388	3	I'm with you on ETH,  BTC I don't think will fall that hard unless we see a huge run-up in between first 
1	1523035619	2	Really believe a fair valuation of BTC at 2.7K which would bring in potential big buyers. I think BTC is trying to find its fair value which will be determined by a flood of big money. Right now the big money still believes BTC is over-valued.
1	1523035902	2	5.6k BTC. 275 ETH.
0	1523020827	6	20k was the moon.  Thank you all for your brave sacrifices to achieve it.
1	1523022016	8	imagine if you realised that you were the poor kent to buy at exactly ATH, how unlucky can you get
2	1523022377	3	I wouldn't call it luck.  But yeah, whoever it was, we thank you.
3	1523023251	2	It sort of was luck though. There were plenty of points during 2017 where the gains would appear to have been unsustainable, but it just kept going. Some months even rivaled or exceeded December in terms of percentage growth, depending on which crypto we're talking about.Many who ended up buying at what was the ATH of the time, ended up doing amazingly well. Unfortunately some bought in late and got burned (well, they would seem burned at this very moment at least), but they couldn't really have known when it would stop.
1	1523024980	3	I still remember people thinking 1K was the moon. The new wave of sheep are always the same
1	1523021056	3	BTC moons, falls, and moons again.20k was the moon-- for now. Just have to have (lots of) patience.

0	1523029520	5	OMG has such great potential, a perfect long term hold coin. It's a shame that those in crypto don't have patience and want a quick 200% in a day or two, missing out on potentially 10 times plus if they just sit on this one and wait it out.
0	1523000911	5	At this rate, 11k EOY doesn't sound too bad
1	1523001327	10	At this point anything above 7k sounds good
1	1523007005	6	People around me thought bitcoin was a scam, now that they see me down 80% they know it's a scam. Nobody I know is coming to this market anytime soon, I'm guessing that's a common story. Get ready for some cold and lonely winters.
1	1523001603	4	What's going to happen in the next 7-8 months that's magically going to turn the boat around? 4 months later and the market cap continues to set lower lows.
2	1523003444	5	I don't think anybody believes Bitcoin is worth nothing.  I think new dumb money will come in when it's cheap enough, with some major fiat pairings for alts.  I think the market will pump because people are greedy, and this is a great way to make money.  I think crypto is worth at least a trillion as a market, because I think the blockchain is a technology that will outgrow gold and silver.  I think smart money is waiting on the sidelines, waiting to strike.  I think that bitcoin has gone through bull crazes for its entire life, and it will happen again.  I think there's so much potential for hype and greed and energy in a new asset class.  Gold isn't worth 8 trillion, but we say it is.  Who's to say we won't one day say the same about bitcoin?  I think real world application is coming, the price just outraced the tech for a little while.  If you don't see the potential that blockchain has on the global economy, you're just playing with a volatile asset.  And that's fine, but it's not why I'm here.  I invested for financial independence, this is my lottery ticket.  But I also invested because I hate the incredibly wealthy elite that keep millions of my people in rags.  I see a future for blockchain and crypto, and I see it as the great equalizer.  Is that all bullshit hope?  Probably, but it's my hope, and my truth.
3	1523004032	5	While I agree BTC is definitely worth more than nothing, new money won't care about BTC unless it manages to break another ATH. Everyone that cares enough about tech is bound to have heard about it now and the only way dumb money will care is if:a) There's some MAJOR adoption, more than random coffee shops accepting BTCb) We enter another bubble cycle after the hype dies and starts up againWhile people are greedy, at some point there won't be anyone left to buy the last persons bag other than bots that pump and dump. To be frank, I think the market will stay this low or possibly lower until there's more steady volume from adoption rather than bots/whales.
4	1523004236	3	Define major adoption?  Bitcoin can't and won't be used as a currency, it's too volatile.  It's always going to be a speculative investment.  I could see another bubble cycle, Bitcoin is still not owned by over 97% of the world.  Bots and whales are what make up the entire stock, gold, silver, and commodities market.  Why do those go up?
0	1523019791	4	The only way we get a bull run is if new money comes in. How will that happen? I have no clue. What do you guys think? 
1	1523019974	14	When there is a reason to buy crypto, i.e real world uses. There is no reason to buy crypto right now because we can't actually use it. It doesn't do anything. We're just hoping that we're early investors. Look through your portfolio. How many of those coins can you actually use to do anything? How many do you actually use? By use, I mean actually *use* to do something, rather than just hold. The answer if probably none. Do you send BTC to your friends and family? No. Do you use ETH to use dApps on Ethereum? No.Do you use any of your alts to interact with their product? No. Do most of your alts have a working application that you can even use your token on? No. Crypto right now has no use. When we can actually use these coins to do something, then money will come in. This isn't about having a mindless mania phase anymore like last year. This is about producing something that people actually want to use. 
1	1523019927	8	I'm giving up hope, where is it going to come from, anyone who wants to be apart of crypto is already in. All my friends and family laugh at the idea of crypto and very unlikely they will invest. Most households don't have the disposable income to invest in such a speculative market. The money came in december and left in january unfortunately 
2	1523020089	5	See you next year when prices spike again to new highs just like every other time, except I'll be waving from my lambo.... Lol 
2	1523024403	2	Stay on their good side if you stay in. You will have to borrow money from them one day.
1	1523026341	2	When institutional money a has straight-forward and reasonable regulation to base their investments on. That's when they'll start putting their money in.
1	1523020131	5	keep an eye on the daily volume.   It's been 12-15 billion daily for awhile.  When it creeps towards 30 bn daily....we'll know a bull run is imminent.
1	1523020502	3	Institutional money getting into the game. Once they flex their financial muscles it could pump. Media gets back hyping it and the amateur investor enters the markets again. 
1	1523020521	2	If the people who cashed out come back, we will have the same time as last year in December. Time does not repeat, but it rhymes, I guess the same thing will happen since the crash in 2013. The difference is, that it will happen much more faster 
0	1523036088	5	Last week I missed out on 6k BTC(moved to 7k)Not this week, buying 4k USD of BTC today. Thank god I was worried I was going to buy in at 8k

3	1523001935	8	What has fiat/alt pairs done to seperate ETH/LTC from BTC? 
1	1523008247	2	Perhaps look into OmiseGO. I know most people will say once this or that coin launch it'll decouple but I really do think that will happen once staking goes live with OMG. At the very least it's a decent project with some lofty goals for scaling ETH (plasma) and worth checking out for that alone.

0	1523001528	2	I need a source where it explains the philosophy behind TA.   What lies beneath the shoulder head pattern?  
1	1523001774	17	Knees and toes, knees and toes.
1	1523008973	3	TA is based off of emotion/sentiment towards the market. I'm not TA expert and can't explain h&s, but look at a cup and handle for example. It starts high and goes on a downtrend - aka people losing interest. Then, overtime it grows to an uptrend and the overall sentiment towards it becomes better as more and more people are looking at it (possibly to buy in). It now reaches a near-high and people are hesitant to buy in - that is, until it dips. And once it dips, people buy up and if it breaks the resistance, it rockets up as fomo kicks in. I feel like a lot of people are just misinformed about TA. Downvote as you will, but TA is just a tool and just because a majority of the people are trash at it, it does not discredit it. A good technical analysts will draw out different patterns and analyze the **odds** of where it **could** go. If a majority of the different patterns/lines are directed towards one direction, sure there is always the chance it can fall, but the chances are in favor of the opposite happen. On top of this, good technical analysts always mention "catalysts" which is synonymous to good/bad news that can throw the chart into a different pattern - whether it be an uptrend/downtrend or spike up/down. Hope it helps 
0	1523006897	2	When this market back to grow, which coin will have the highest percetual growth? Bitcoin . Litecoin . Ethereum.  Bcash . Ripple
1	1523007150	11	Dogecoin
1	1523010039	3	BTC will lead as usual then reach some sort of temporary platou before letting the alt coins pump reign supreme.My go to plan once I reenter the market is BTC first, let it ride, switch to ETH, let it ride, diversify into alts, go to the moon
1	1523007639	6	Ethereum, if based on tech development.Based on hype, who knows? Probably a shitcoin.
2	1523011150	2	Based on ATH, ETH will bounce back just 3-4x top, in the next phase most coins incl. ETH will do new ATH. However shortterm, there are coins with better perceptual growth back to last ATH.

1	1523021075	3	it might,  but not this month or next month.  people who make ta saying bitcoin will hit 15k by may are insane
1	1523020428	5	Yes - patience.
2	1523020535	4	Trust me patience I have, I‚Äôd HODL and watch it go to $0 before pulling out at $300.
3	1523020634	3	Good - seems like a lot of people are losing patience and have only been in the crypto market for 6 months or less.
3	1523022140	4	agree with you, I've invested quite a substantial amount of money, however I'm not going to be financially ruined if it goes to 0. Id rather go down with the ship than miss a potential bull run
1	1523023206	1	Yes and here's why...We all know how many shit ICOs were out there right? How did these get funded? People bought ETH, and traded ETH to gain the ICOs. The ETH went to these scamcoins.Now, not all ICOs were scams, but likely 90% or more (probably more like 99%) were. And they have this pile of ETH. They can either develop a "product", or they can just say "thanks for the ETH, peace out", sell their ETH and keep all the money. Of course they will say they are using the money to "hire" and "develop" their "product", but in time people will forget about them.So, we had this ICO boom, we had this ETH explosion from buy-pressure from people funding ICOs. Now we have sell pressure from ICO scamcoins liquidating ETH for whatever they can get.That's almost done (opinion of course), so ETH is now massively oversold, and is an insanely strong buy.I have no doubt that buying 400, 500, 600, even $700 ETH is going to be anything other than a great play 3 years from now. Sure, it would have been nice to buy BTC at $500, but buying it at $1000 still looks pretty awesome today. That should be your timeframe for investments (stop trying to make money overnight). ETH is insane investment opportunity right now. Sure some rank 500 coin may 100x, and ETH may only 10x. But that rank 500 coin could equally disappear, and I think of any investment in this space ETH has the most potential to still be here in 10 years (even more than BTC itself).

1	1523006298	3	down 50% is actually not bad. alot of people are down 70-80% already depends on how bad their shitcoin are

1	1523022833	6	ETH is such an insanely good buy right now. I hope these prices do go sideways for a while because some coins like ETH, NEO, OMG, NANO, etc are such no brainer buys.

1	1523028661	5	He only shorts, so not very good news

1	1523035512	4	This is the same question I grapple with. Block chain is the future, but not in the format we are used to. What I see is block chain applications for easy settlements and elimination of 3rd party documentation and verification providers. What I don't see is why a company would go and buy 1,000,000 of a utility coin to gain access to a block chain. More than anything a company can create their own block chain or use some centralized provider for block chain tech. I am in the market to try to make money in a volatile market, and I do not believe anything in the top 100 will be around (other than bitcoin) in 5 years.
1	1523035733	5	The way I see it, blockchain is absolutely game changing for a very small and specific set of applications. It won't change everything as we know it like some people seem to suggest, but it certainly has the potential to change some very large industries (e.g. banking, payments, distributed computing, etc).
1	1523035188	3	I'll let you know in a few years.
1	1523035505	3	There is no objective reason to hold blindly. Holding blindly is poor investing and in this manipulated space a very bad idea. The only time to hold blindly is if you have invested money you are 100% fine with losing forever, then buy what you think will survive the purge and thrive in a few years and put it away in cold storage.
1	1523035162	1	Depends what your holding, but despite this bear season most people still think crypto will be fine long term, it's just a question of how much it will recover. Either way if you're not going to invest in anything else I bet crypto will have better returns than USD inflation.

0	1523018492	2	The chinese are starting to devalue their currency again!!! Good news for crypto in the long run. We want the global powers to swamp the world with more cheap dollars, creating an eventual crisis.  Satoshi would be smiling right now. 
1	1523019289	8	The U.S. is not winning that trade war. The U.S. debt is going to collapse. An unparalleled currency crisis is coming. 
2	1523021069	4	I don't think anyone can 'win' with those  staggering type of debt loads that those two countries are shouldering. But the Chinese have the advantage because they have been stockpiling gold in large amounts and their people are hardier. They can endure a lower standard of living better than Americans. 
2	1523019603	2	All because of our stupid fucking POTUS thinking its 1970s America with the industrial capacity of that era.
3	1523020999	3	70s - big ass boat cars with weak engines, bell bottoms, groovy music and chill music.   We just need to undo the tech era for a complete reversal.
1	1523020134	3	2018 is gonna be bouncy. No idea what it means for crypto. With this much manipulation it is far from a safe haven.Buy gold I guess.
1	1523021024	4	Every US company has their shit made somewhere else to sell it to US citizens. Every US republican politician believes all workers everywhere need earn less for more work to compete against people living in boxes. Eventually there's no one left able to buy any shit. The Chinese don't buy US shit, the Mexicans don't buy US shit and the US don't make US shit anymore. The US middle class has only been middle class because of debt. This trade war will significantly increase prices to US citizens. Prices are a measurement of inflation. Inflation is fought with raising interest rates. The stock market is only a measurement of the economy because it is the only daily measurement there is, but it is not a measurement of the economy at all. See where this is going? Hope you enjoy Trump because he makes racist comments and grabs a few pussies, because this is all going to crumble down.

1	1523007338	3	Exchanges such as Binance won't allow you to trade with $10, you need at least $20 just to begin. You could trade a shitcoin like Tron or even Zil and increase your holdings easily, but it will only add a few cents to your total each time. I often play around with like $40-$50 of ETH when I want to satisfy my trading urge without investing much. I can usually increase the number of coins I own fairly easily, although I'm stuck in ZIL atm because it's dipped and now going sideways. TRX is actually a good coin to trade when you've got minimal dollars invested. You can trade lower amounts on exchanges such as Kucoin, who has a lot of coins under 5 cents, but the volume is so slow there. Get a Binance account, but you should aim to get a little bit of BNB so your costs per trade are lowered, and you get to keep your full amount of coins purchased instead of being taxed a percentage. 
1	1523004066	3	Starting to trade with 10$ is useless. You can keep your funds on the exchange if you trade them regularly, if not, you can store them in a wallet. Most famous exchanges are coinbase/gdax, bitfinex, binance , bitstamp, kraken, bittrex. HTH
1	1523004143	2	To start i would suggets buying bitcoin from Coinbase and transfer them over to Gdax (they are sister companies so the transfer is free of charge) Then on Gdax you can start day trading. I personally use Binance because i think it the most trustworthy exchange. The exchanges keep them in their personal wallets and link it to your account, so they actually keep your coins safe. Remember that exchanges can be hacked and its not 100% proof, although the bigger exchanges are more safe. Good cryptos to day trade? I personally stick with BTC and ETH, not to much so i can keep my focus. Hope this helps
0	1523007638	2	Do you think by April 17 tax day we will see the real bottom? I'm assuming a huge outflow of money will leave the market to pay capital gains taxes right?? 
1	1523008769	6	I feel like we've already seen that outflow. Unless you think every single person is waiting until the literal last day of the deadline
1	1523007860	4	Well it's not like USA is a majority of the world.
0	1523012524	2	:(
0	1523020948	2	Trading is like swimming against the tide now
1	1523021342	7	swim with the tide then
0	1523024315	2	I really want to have a portion of my holdings in a privacy coin, but I really can't decide which project I like best. It's the last little piece to make my ideal portfolio. What projects should I look into?
1	1523024665	6	NAV coin
1	1523028901	4	enigma
1	1523027312	3	Monero 
1	1523026899	2	COLX, if you fancy something a little riskier than the well-known privacy coins!
1	1523024744	2	start your own little privacy coin index fund. Monero, Z-cash, Enigma - those are the ones I would be looking at. Maybe Sumo for some possible mad gains. 
1	1523024573	2	monero of course
0	1523025713	2	I now own a minuscule amount of ethereum and bitcoin in my wallets only worth like 2 USD each. What do you all honestly suggest I do with it? Please go easy on me as I'm brand new to the cryptoworld and learning. Maybe I should just hang onto it?
1	1523025846	3	Leave them there. Or if you want them back, transfer more money and then withdrawal all back :)
2	1523025983	3	Thanks friend.
1	1523025818	2	I would just leave them there bro
2	1523025911	5	Ya I'd imagine so I'm just trying to earn small amounts right now via faucets and surveys... I know it might be a waste of time but I'm just trying to learn a bit. Thanks.
3	1523026006	5	As long as your are learning :). Welcome to CryptoWorld!
4	1523026453	4	aw there is humanity in this sub after all :) I second your welcome! 
5	1523029567	2	I third your welcome.
1	1523028874	2	lost it all on transaction fees
1	1523028808	2	Damn bro, ur a whale. Whatever you do please don't dump it because you'll crash the market üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£üòÜ
0	1523029795	2	Ok more Soros (or whales in general) discussion question.Let's say Soros and friends decide to pump the market back up to 20k BTC or higher.  More new money comes in to ride the wave up and we see something similar to January 2018.Do you think we'd stop at a higher low?  Would BTC "crash" to like 10k?  15k?  Just wondering what the general sentiment would be after the next manipulated bull run.   
1	1523030049	5	Does Soros really have to be the boogeyman behind everything in my life. Can we pick another person to blame things on?
1	1523031289	4	This market has a continuous cycle of "bubbles". This was happening long before Soros new anything about crypto
1	1523030459	3	No one knows, but an artificial prop like that, with someone who has famously shorted currencies, would make everyone uneasy. Say for example Soros buys in at $7k, BTC tuns up to say 25k in a few months. Soros has every incentive to short from 25k and pull all his buy support making he fall and panic that much deeper. It‚Äôs possible there are higher lows, but just as possible there are lower lows.
1	1523030051	4	If we bull run like december it will pass 20k.  Im guessing somewhere in the 30-50k range and then crash down to 15-20k.  That's assuming we follow a similar pattern to the past, which is definitely not a guarantee.
1	1523030217	2	Let's say Soros shorts BTC to 1g 
0	1523031602	2	You think when the market finally turns around, that ETH is gonna leave OMG in the dust ratio-wise, or that OMG will continue to rise with and continue to gain on ETH?  Basically, is now a good time to invest more in OMG or to sell soon to secure more ETH?
1	1523031681	7	*hits crack pipe*Yeah, for sure.
1	1523032394	6	If I put everything into OMG six months ago and just held until now, I'd have about the same fiat value. Just saying.
1	1523031939	3	OMG is having a hard spoon soon and you'll receive the new token at a 1:1 ratio with OMG you have. OMG are also implementing staking and plasma (scaling solution that can handle millions of tx/second). In case that wasn't enough, they just partnered with the biggest credit card company in SK, a country that is fairly crypto-sceptic right now.So I would say yes, invest in more OMG. Edit: In relation to ETH, I'd try and have a similar amout % wise. I'm 30% ETH, 30% OMG in my portfolio. I can see both having great gains when the market turns around as both are close to having usable products that could see adoption.
2	1523032217	3	won't it still be running ontop of the ETH network?
3	1523032276	4	The main chain will be running on ethereum, the "spooned" chain will be a Cosmos chain. 
2	1523034547	2	I guess since ETH and OMG are so in bed with one another, investing in one is essentially expecting success from the other, albiet OMG being a bit more risky. The token airdrop is definitely a nice caveat, I must admit.
0	1523032497	2	2 greens in the portfolio! ONT and OMG. Invest in anything beginning with O!
0	1523000387	2	Despair yet?
1	1523000632	8	We've been experiencing despair en masse for a while now. The tell-tale sign for me is people completely freaking out with the slightest upwards movement in the price "BULLS ARE TAKING OVER! 10K BTC HERE WE COME! POOR NOOBS TETHERED UP" despite us being in a bear-market for several months now..I think we need to accept that this kind of price-action could go on for months before we see the return of the normie investors (which we need to recover completely)
2	1523000862	3	There is a big difference between an experienced trader and the average redditor. I felt bad a few days ago when everyone was saying the bulls are back and attacking those who are tethered, but on the other hand felt as though my instincts were much stronger than what others were saying. Volume is too low for the bulls to be back. It's almost as though people see prices move up and think all of a sudden we are off to the races.
1	1523000586	3	Sorry, still want to buy, I guess we have to sink to <4k for 6 months. That ought to quench the hope.
1	1523000796	2	We're just entering that part.
1	1523001180	2	Na
1	1523001676	2	So far predicatable
1	1523000913	2	nope.
0	1523010560	3	Sugar we're going down swinging
0	1523032923	1	A real headline in the Tron thread. " Why Tron is much better than eth " and somebody comments and said this is why Justin is the best CEO in crypto.... ü§îü§îü§Ø
1	1523033183	5	Its become very tribal, maybe thats just human nature. People find a coin, stick to it and defend it no matter what. Just like supporting a sports team I suppose. 
1	1523033049	3	Sun > MoonDuh.
0	1523020785	2	Next: Down to 6100-5900, then bounce to ~7000 +/- 200. After that even deeper downward trend.
1	1523021005	7	i hope youre right.  i always miss the bottom
2	1523021374	4	trying to buy the bottom is a noob's strategy
0	1523015433	2	I've been in this game for a few months now. Recently I shuffled everything into XRP and FUN. Which coin should I invest in today?  Been pro-longing an investment for a few weeks now for obvious reasons, but now i'm eager to get back in before summer. I have a few idea's but always love to see your opinions :) thoughts?
1	1523017825	2	Lol
1	1523015512	2	ICX or Nano
1	1523018444	2	>Recently I shuffled everything into XRP and FUNlulz
0	1523027663	2	I am ready to put in some money on Monday, so thank me later for the weekend pump. 
0	1522999113	2	lol TRX rise was slaughtered. Shows that no one really  believes in TRX, just riding the stupid hype pumps
