0	1523091557	25	Need more green dildo’s up my ass ffs. 
1	1523092871	34	Okay but let's talk about cryptocurrency.
2	1523100987	2	Lol bravo
0	1523082098	22	So many crypto Youtubers/personalities have disappeared. You can guarantee they'll be back with a price rally, or be gone as long as the market tanks.It's a shame, because so many touted being supporters of the tech, but if that were the case they'd still be here. 
1	1523082403	5	lmao in crypto daily's last video he promised news everyday and then he just disappears...
2	1523083339	1	yeah Boxmining live yesterday said he has goe on a World or warcraft hiatus
1	1523083121	3	The CCN guy is delivering almost daily even though not much is hapening. Otherwise I never watched any other youtubers.
1	1523084274	3	Probably cause half of them were part of the MLM bitconnect thing.
1	1523109086	1	The whale pool is still going. They did remove about 5 alts they were watching. 
1	1523111017	1	Maybe it shouldn't bother me but it does. There are 2 or 3 "big" crypto channels that have not posted for almost a month when there has been tons of news to cover. If they think their entire audience is waiting and will still be there when they decide to upload again, they're wrong. Do they find it too difficult to make good content right now or something? Maybe they are just purely making content for the money.
0	1523117837	14	When I was a kid, little did I know that this is what chutes and ladders was preparing me for.
1	1523118406	4	Gotta love reddit. Always called it snakes and ladders. Just googled chute because it looked strange, but it’s right! You win this one.
0	1523082069	25	Vitalik has been taking out the crypto trash lately.  The hero we needed 
0	1523083663	34	For those of you wondering why Verge is pumping, both Binance and Bittrex have frozen deposits for Verge. Nobody can send their coins to the exchanges to dump them. The only Verge that can be dumped is Verge already on the exchanges. As a result, buying pressure has drastically outpaced selling pressure.
1	1523084688	10	thank you, that restored a little of my faith in crypto.
1	1523091713	1	So, it's up because it's down.Indeed, that kind of mechanism will restore faith in crypto...
1	1523091991	1	Why would anyone be buying it?
2	1523097819	3	Because it's pumping and they're FOMOing in. They probably aren't aware of the hack/scam. 
0	1523095124	10	Never buy a coin that is pumping. Will get burnt bad when the early buyers take profits
1	1523101759	7	10/10 strategy.
1	1523095485	3	Such wisdom, buy Tron now at the bottom of a possible bullflag or gvt with some patience or Ont when its done retracing at some point
2	1523096393	3	I'm with ya on the tron. its def hated but it still makes money for people... myself included. not as a coin to hodl though, just for swinging
2	1523095599	2	Tron? You serious brah? Won't touch a token with a moonboy as founder. I'm good with gvt or ont though. 
3	1523095779	1	Bnb is another pick at the moment. Im just looking to increase my btc stack, btc is king
4	1523096613	2	OMG for its stability 
5	1523098542	1	Yea I have that. Bought in real early during the skateboard hype days lol
4	1523097445	1	funny you say that,, I just posted yesterday about the great small swings with bnb and easily being able to add to your stack making quick trades. bnb has been solid and staying in a really tight range but still enough to work with.
4	1523098515	1	I don't disagree. 
3	1523095696	1	TRX good entry point, pumps will come 
0	1523083038	9	Saturday Pump, let’s go
1	1523084652	2	patience, young one. The coin burn is almost upon us!
0	1523090860	10	thank you ont, but I have to take my profits I've watched to many times my gains slip away not today! 
1	1523092623	5	Please accept my warmest congratulations on your decision. I hope it was the right one!
2	1523092981	3	I bought in at 3.14 and sold at $4 I'm happy with my little gains, I took a chance before I  went to bed woke up seen $4 and sold. 
1	1523102059	2	Watching people FOMO into ONT now , they will be crying later.
0	1523119065	9	Hmm suspicious, my portfolio isn’t getting rekt today something fishy is going on 
0	1523112079	17	Just made 2% gains with Ven, cashed that right out to buy toiletpaper. Feels better when its paid for by Ven.
1	1523113188	4	2-ply?
2	1523113760	10	Track every wipe with its ground breaking RFID (Rapid Fecal ID) tech.
3	1523115536	14	This explains the shitty white paper.
0	1523116708	9	I’m thinking ETH is good hold for awhile, or am I just being optimistic?
1	1523118421	4	The dust is settling, and these past few weeks and next few weeks may decide your profits for the year more than all other months combined.So many insane buys right now. Whales are trying to throw the market around and exchanges appear to be fighting back. These guys are gaining and losing so much money it's insane.There's more than 2B tether waiting to jump back in. When it does, anyone on the wrong side is going to get absolutely crushed and will have to decide if they are going to miss out on a bullrun that will never get back down here (look at the 1k to 20k bullrun, we are at 6-7k and never hitting 1k again, so people are going to have to FOMO in or miss out forever).There's going to be some massive action happening soon. Now is possibly the best buying season that we'll ever see again.
0	1523086799	13	I woke up today... the sun is shining... delta wasn’t the first thing I checked, Binance wasn’t the second... Life is pretty good. 
1	1523108875	2	Binance first and Delta second?
0	1523116798	7	A fake BAT Airdrop telegram channel with 42k users just asked for everyone’s private keys. If anyone browsing this sees this; don’t do it. It’s a scam. An airdrop will never need your private key for any reason.
1	1523118423	1	I'll make a new wallet with a new private key to waste the scammers' time.Side question, how does myetherwallet know which wallets are used or which aren't? Do they check on etherscan real quick before making one? Or are the chances close to impossible to get the same wallet address randomly?I'm just wondering because I have two wallet addresses...What if everyone had 10, would that make it crowded?
0	1523119290	7	Don't worry everyone, Soros is just wiring more funds to his coinbase account. Pump will continue once they resolve his ticket.
1	1523119408	3	So never?
2	1523119880	2	Nah, just in time for when everyone's favourite ERC20 shitcoin gets listed 
0	1523119647	7	It's sad that so many people are so suspicious of positive activity now. You guys have been beaten down so bad that all you really know is pain. 
1	1523120042	3	People are still very shell shocked from the crash and cautious using tight trailing limits just in case. If there’s no major dump in a few a days of this slow movement then they may be more confident.
1	1523119768	2	No, it is completely artificial, see arsonbunny's post in this thread.That being said, it sure is nice to have some exchanges wearing hero capes liquidating shorts for us. Maybe that will scare people from shorting the market and tossing it around with a rag doll to steal as much money as possible in this low volume market.
2	1523119818	3	They're not benevolent. It's fucking shady behaviour at best.
3	1523119868	2	Shit they are heroes in my eyes. Anyone that makes the whales shorting and throwing around the market lose their shirts is a good thing IMO.
4	1523120092	1	So not only are the whales manipulating the market, the places you actually buy the fucking coins from are too. Sounds good to me.
2	1523120380	1	That's how a market works, it's not there to hold your hand and guide you to huge profit on your longs. If other people want to make money shorting it that's their business, that's serious pussy shit to be lamenting that. Everybody's here to make money, just cause you find yourself on the bad side of the deal doesn't make it wrong.
1	1523120410	1	ve are in z bear marketz still, zo zer is no rezon to be an optimistic bullz right now
1	1523119718	1	This is suspicious activity haha. It's the exchanges themselves making profits off of liquidating shorts. There's no actual volume here.
0	1523108931	11	REQ is added to bitfinex?
1	1523109142	10	Whoa really?
2	1523109244	8	yeah Bitfinex just twitted
1	1523110607	6	Wow this is good news!
0	1523114997	6	Nice big green candle BTC on Binance.
0	1523116497	6	Invest in Crypto and you'll never age! Because you'll be stuck in January 2018 forever.
1	1523116824	1	*In crypto, forever = 3 months

1	1523117970	1	Can’t be bothered to look. Which one was right, small or big?
0	1523082225	5	Just trying to keep my head and my hands strong because I'm not selling!
1	1523083247	10	wait you can sell?

0	1523101913	13	signed up for youtube red to get rid of this annoying ass bunnytoken ad
1	1523104907	4	Ahhh the problem is that you signed up for the wrong YouTube red. You were looking for “redtube” 
1	1523103480	1	Or use an adblock?
2	1523104057	5	Naw it's cool bro I paid for it with my bitconnect profits
0	1523084596	11	don't go to verge subreddit. I feel unclean. ugh
1	1523088382	3	hodlers of verge is a strange bunch such madness is truly amazing its like a crash course in religion and tribalism 
0	1523090743	10	Maybe I'm an optimist but this looks and feels like a bottom to me. Some more consolidation here, and a little sideways movement for the next 1-2 weeks, and then slowly upwards again.
1	1523107595	1	What fundamental change has there been in the market that means we’ll be going up in 2 weeks?
2	1523109307	1	Abra, alibaba, radar relay, coinbase news of future erc20 listings
1	1523094552	-1	its just what it is: a rather small break-out / correctionwe will still go lower
2	1523095224	2	Considering it looks like you only entered crytpo 3 months ago what makes you so sure 
3	1523099980	3	The last 3 months.
1	1523093935	0	I would love that, but I am pessimistic and think it is not over yet, we will see 5k I guess :(
2	1523095105	8	People not in crytpo begging for 5k 
3	1523113884	1	If you zoom out we've basically resumed the trend that had been going prior to last September. At a certain point after 6K has been tested multiple times you've gotta just say we've bottomed. That doesn't mean we're going to start mooning anytime soon either though - accumulation often follows a correction.
0	1523117965	11	https://i.imgur.com/b1fOVNZ.pngSomeone is pumping with massive buy orders on Bitfinex and liquidating shorts. They just took out 1K shorts with liquidations, and people are putting trailing limit short orders above those $100 level rises so the number of shorts spikes back up:https://i.imgur.com/3BEa4l0.pngNobody is actually buying into the pump, buying volume post pump is abysmal:https://i.imgur.com/6JYG4N4.pngThis is what crypto has been reduced to, artificial exchange driven pumps making money on liquidating shorts/longs with massive pumps after long stretches of no movement.
1	1523118338	6	I know it's manipulation at its finest but I always get a little giddy when I see so many shorts get liquidated. 
1	1523118319	5	This is just what happens in low volume markets, and also why I need to see more than a few hundred dollars up on a couple spikes to justify a buy. I need to see steadily increasing volume with price increases... not just spikes.
1	1523118201	3	TBH, if this is what it takes to make people afraid of futures, then it could be a good thing overall. I really respect your opinion on this, what are your thoughts?
1	1523119013	3	The exchanges themselves are 100% behind these pumps. It's easy money for them.
1	1523119303	1	S...soros? /s
0	1523090523	8	If this mini pump can keep going just long enough so I can buy Far Cry 5 with profit I will be content. Probably could have just got it with the money I put in today but still not nearly as fun.
1	1523104962	1	So worth it. 
0	1523089572	5	ok now we are starting to get somewhere keep it up bitcoin.
0	1523099713	5	Crazy how low the volume is, its like these prices are the new norm. Barely anyone buying/selling.
1	1523101000	7	No volume means we don't even know what the norm is :)
1	1523100729	3	Just pretend December-January never happened and it’ll all seem normal.
0	1523109413	4	What a weird dip just now.
1	1523109516	6	Seems to have very quickly reversed itself too.
1	1523109753	4	Fuckery in play.

0	1523119628	4	This thing is going to the moon once everyone has given up on it, thinking it’s another fakeout. 
1	1523119808	5	This has happened so many times before, and people never learn. Just remember when it goes parabolic again, and don't be afraid to take some profits and miss the top. 
2	1523119825	2	For sure. 
1	1523119697	3	If everyone gives up on it it has no way of mooning.... 
0	1523089111	14	The ONT fall is going to be so brutal
1	1523089352	3	lmao a guy is about to sell 27k of ont
1	1523090568	4	Happens every time. Pretty predictable. Now the question is wait for $5 or play it safe and sell now?
0	1523106963	7	Seeing so many people in /r/btc rallying around Craig Wright really highlights how delusional and cult-like this space is.  They support a provable fraud just because he's on "their team" 
1	1523107100	8	Tribalism is real no matter the subject. As much as we try to elevate ourselves mentally and spiritually, we are still apes in the flesh. 
0	1523107600	6	I'd like to know how many Old Boys (pre-2013) are out there that still DCA monthly? Or do you just buy the big dips? Or are you all cashed out and just come and laugh at the state of this sub occasionally?
0	1523099987	11	The same people that were fomoing into BTC at 18K+ are now fomoing into Ontology this high. Don't make the same mistake twice ffs.
1	1523107829	3	I agree. Gone up a lot. In saying that someone convinced me not to FOMO 14 hours ago. Stopped me from earning 25%...
1	1523103971	1	That's smart, what about this space tells me to follow smart?
0	1523089733	7	I like that some of the most talked about coins are Nep-5 and not Erc-20 :)
1	1523090513	8	Same, I see huge potential for the future of Neo. 
0	1523117659	6	Can we all go back to hodling again, I was happy then 
0	1523092037	8	BNB & OMG breakout on the horizon, as long as btc just keeps climbing steadily 
1	1523094024	5	I hope so picked up OMG yesterday it was around 8.80 
1	1523092917	3	Shill me on why I should load up on some BNB?
2	1523094679	3	The coin burn + all the Binance news. 
2	1523095177	3	BNB should correlate roughly Binance popularity, right?
2	1523099720	2	BNB has been a steady rock these last weeks. It’s the new tether.
2	1523102878	2	perhaps the most stable coin out there atm. 
1	1523094335	3	Why breakout?
0	1523115041	8	Nice ORGANIC growth here....
1	1523116242	1	(((Organic)))
1	1523115250	1	Indeed. Nothing to see here folks, move along.
0	1523081631	3	Who's first?
1	1523081928	2	You!
0	1523111581	3	ONT increase over the last days due to a pump? or rather healthy grow?
1	1523111626	4	Yeah certainly very healthy /s
2	1523111925	3	2 legit 2 quit
1	1523112211	7	that shit is going to dump so bad when CMC updates the actual circulating supply.. 
2	1523114011	1	It's not right on CMC?  Although I'm really jelly I didn't make gains on it

5	1523115410	2	LOL what a joke
1	1523113182	4	Looks like pure pump 
0	1523116363	3	7k !
1	1523116548	2	Easy there, soros' fiat cannon can't keep up at the moment.
0	1523119448	3	On the bright side I am starting to lean towards thinking this is actual sideways movement and we might not dip past 6k after all. Let’s see.
1	1523120231	1	Ppl called me bearish in march when i said 6k, now they call me bullish for it. I think the 5k range was never in the cards.
0	1523101084	8	I want to be rich!
1	1523102224	4	Quit crypto, it's no place for rich.
1	1523104183	2	Get out your mother’s kneepads and get to work so! 
1	1523113551	1	Its not hard... just buy...hold and be patience... in 2 or 4 years you will do 10x you money or more. $
0	1523087054	7	LMAO they guy on the bunny token just pronounced Ethereum as EteriumJust bought 100k of bunny token
1	1523092671	2	Could be German. They pronounce "th" similar to the English "t"
0	1523091297	7	I think this is it guys. We're finally going up!  /s
1	1523091578	8	Never heard this before. 
2	1523093906	2	January is still not over btw
3	1523094013	6	The longest month of the century. 
3	1523094653	6	Yeah, wake me up when January ends
4	1523095010	2	what if dead?
5	1523096270	2	If dead, then limbo (not lambo)Edit: I was hoping for alive and lambo but all I got was death and limbo
0	1523082039	6	Stellar mission about to take off
0	1523110331	4	I think cyber security is the biggest threat to crypto and bitcoin. How is adoption going to happen with this issue? You have two choices with bitcoin. Either you keep it on a server somewhere, in which case if that server gets hacked then you lose your money PERMANENTLY. This is a huge downgrade on fiat where that money can be compensated to you. Or you can have a hardware wallet. I am not sure I would want to keep $10k+ in my house though. That seems even less of a good idea, as again this can be stolen permanently. There is a reason we moved from using gold to buy things, to cash to buy things and now to credit cards to buy things. We have reached a much less risky and more convenient way to buy things. Adopting crypto would take us back as it is less convenient and more risky.
1	1523110751	11	Even if someone steals your hardware wallet, they wouldn't be able to access anything without your pass/pin.As far as theft goes, it's not always easy to keep your fiat safe, either. Think about identity theft and how much that fucks people over.There will always be people after your shit.
1	1523114933	2	You keep your keys to a hardware wallet. Write it down and put that paper somewhere safe. Vault or bank safe box. If you lose it or it is damaged you simply get another and renter the key and your coins are accessible. No coin or token is even IN a wallet. A wallet is a misnomer. It is just a key holder that gives access to your ledger entries encoded on the blockchain.
1	1523111140	2	Smart contracts settling with other smart contracts with multisig and conditional use, which are possibly maintained by financial or banking institutions like coinbase.For example, you lock up 10 units into a smart contract with an institution. Possibly, there may be a zksnarks offering greater access protection as well. With one private key requirement, the limit to transact can be set to 1 unit within a 24hr or 10 day period, etc.   
1	1523115289	1	Sort of you are right, having them all in your hands make's it a bit risky. It's not easy to steal 100k from your bank as it's stealing it from your phone wallet.
0	1523114862	9	Looks like the scamcoin WTC is dropping
1	1523114982	1	Only logical if a company only cares about the big Investors. There is no reason for the small fish to buy that coin anymore. WTC does not give a shit about small investors and so every small fish got burned.Oh well...All the Airdopped and Mined WTC dropping on the Market will be a fun slide down to new lows.
1	1523119897	1	Wtc made some shit mistakes, but it’s far from a scam coin. That’s fake shilling 
1	1523117518	0	It's not a scam, they are creating their own hardware!  Mainnet was just released.  Are you trying to FUD the price?
0	1523113422	7	You’ve been green too long now, go back to dip
0	1523117117	6	Seems like there is a very good volume behind this. I hope we get to test 7.4-7.5 again 
1	1523117437	1	Where do you go to gauge the volume ?

2	1523090386	0	Aw salt
0	1523101166	5	What is that one coin that you are irrationally attached to, regardless of logic or fundamentals? It can be because of the name, the logo, etc.Mine is TRAC. There's a StarTRAC treadmill at the gym. Seems like staring at the logo while I run has conditioned me.
1	1523101904	7	ICON because I like to think of myself as an icon when in reality i'm a loser >:)
2	1523102317	1	: )   : (
2	1523102598	1	Lol that's probably why us ICX holders are all self-deprecating. 
1	1523101451	8	Nano for me. 
2	1523101807	2	Why?
3	1523102128	6	Love the logo and name. Even the old Raiblock icon was nice. But I also have an irrational hate for bitcoin when I had a transaction stuck for a month (while it was dropping from 20k). That really drew me to it with the instant transfers. 
1	1523102511	6	I love the little rocket logo for xlm.
2	1523104624	2	I love everything about Stellar but the logo really seems a bit “childish”IMO they could do much better
3	1523107652	3	Yeah, I mean why would a company named Stellar Lunar use a logo like that? It makes no sense.
3	1523104994	1	I think it's funny, very iconic to the crypto community
1	1523103892	3	Vertcoin would be my emotional one, but funnily enough I currently own mostly TRAC because I decided to set aside emotion and buy into a project that is very likely to succeed based on logic and fundamentals. But yes I suppose I've grown attached to TRAC now too.
2	1523116074	1	Missing Vertcoin, was a promising project, but something stopped them halfway through...
1	1523102351	1	Does it have to be one you have bought or just one you like the name of?
2	1523103215	1	Whichever you like :)

1	1523111331	4	That's already priced in. There is a dump incoming.
1	1523115182	1	Did you know it before the release of the news?
0	1523116525	4	ohhh holding REQ is so satisfying. big thing still to come 
1	1523116830	3	REQ pumping hard right now, big green candle

2	1523117975	2	andddd parties over folks. hope you had fun!   /s 
1	1523116714	2	Yes those months and months of stagnation were so gratifying haha.

0	1523101020	2	Hey Reddit, I have a question about the time of transactions. I've sent a little amout of bitcoins on some website, the website says that my bitcoins will be credited after 2 confirms, is anyone knows how long would it take? And is there any services that helps me to to estimate the transaction rate, cause I used to send money by stellar, and thinking about using credits blockchain with the fastest tps, however I'm dealing with bitcoins now. thank you.
0	1523107631	2	WTF is that huge AION spike?!
1	1523107904	5	REQ and AION, along with other projects, got listed on Bitfinex. That's a possible explanation.
2	1523108103	1	just now?
3	1523108174	3	Announcement was 28 min ago according to their Twitter.https://twitter.com/bitfinex
4	1523108293	1	ok thanks
4	1523110674	1	Thanks for the link.
0	1523116504	2	Something I've wondered since I joined in early Dec is if Bitconnect was an obvious scam.    I'm sure now in hindsight everyone will reply to how obvious it was and how none of you got fooled.. but what were ways people shilled this thing before it all imploded?
1	1523116784	6	Any time I saw bitconnect mentioned, it was as the butt of a joke. This was for a few months before december, at least. It was basically treated the same way it is now, except with a bit more frustration that it still was being bought so much.
2	1523117022	3	kind of like a couple coins now a days hehe
1	1523118017	4	yes it was obvious...
1	1523116973	3	The first time I even heard about Bitconnect was when Kenn Bosak (the only “crypto celeb” I follow) actually signed up for the point of exposing it for what it was and made a lot of posts and videos telling people to stay away. He actually got his Android hacked and lost his YouTube account, and he suspects someone from Bitconnect was behind it.
1	1523117501	1	Most people used 1%a day interest as the main shilling point

0	1523119834	2	Remember guys, exchanges are not your friends. None of them.While there are shorts up they will keep on destroying them and profiting. When they are done then we will see what the market is really thinking.I would recommend watching this (the whole thing) to get an idea of the role of a broker is. And exchanges essentially are those brokers in crypto. And surprise surprise, they don’t want you to make money.https://youtu.be/L7G0OfJUON8
0	1523120175	1	I am not by any means a trader but I put in a small stack to play swings with, made a pretty penny of TRX and now Ive divided it into NANO and NULS which is working out so far. I think next I might try XLM, but I'm considering doing another 50/50 with the other half in NEO or something. Thoughts for a newb trader?
1	1523120239	1	My thought is inform yourself and study trading in depth from multiple sources.
2	1523120347	1	I try to, I know the fundamentals and basic TA. The thing that I'm learning is bad projects moon too, but I don't want to be too risky. Just trying to farm BTC without putting in more fiat.

0	1523084289	2	At this point would one have a better chance at becoming a millionaire by putting $20,000 into crypto and holding for a few years or by buying $20,000 worth of lottery tickets? 
1	1523084651	7	I think crypto. Although, 20k might not be enough. 
2	1523085119	5	20k is easily enough if you gamble on something like REQ or ENG being successful.
0	1523090997	4	what's this with chinese government and ont?
1	1523091477	5	OnChain, the parent company of NEO and ONT, has a good relationship with the Chinese government. This was already known though.
2	1523091545	13	So why not buy NEO instead? 
3	1523091743	15	ONT is new and has a lower market cap, which a lot of people think show it has more growth potential. Basically, everyone is quickly jumping on the bandwagon. There will be a dump soon enough.
4	1523093655	2	yeah it had a small correction at 4 dollars down to 3.7
4	1523092109	1	Yeah I think there will be one Bellow 4$ mark Thanks

0	1523105409	6	TRX volume is crazy 
1	1523107057	6	Yeah, whenever I transfer ETH to Binance I always dive into TRX first and make a fast small profit and sell out, to increase my ETH. It's almost a no brainer that you'll make a bit more if you buy and sell some TRX in it's very predictable cycles. 
0	1523083541	5	Calm down VEN you're not Ontology.
1	1523104657	1	It's cause I sold my VEN for BNB last night, you're welcome.

0	1523086561	2	Does the VeChain ban still apply? I'm barely seeing posts on it on this sub.
1	1523086887	9	No it’s no longer banned, and Sunny Lu appeared on the cover of a CIO magazine yesterday but that article was removed by the mods.Not sure what’s going on but VEN gets a lot of hate in this sub.I’m English but I feel like it’s kinda like supporting the patriots... everyone treats them like a rival sports team. 
2	1523090524	1	VEN isn't like the Patriots. They're simply not tbr best team. It's exciting but they have a long way to go 
3	1523090627	2	No but they get a lot of hate... 
4	1523090942	2	There was a time (3 months ago) when even considering Vechain could maybe be overvalued would lead to countless downvites, threats and spam.One day the entire board was VEN posts. Mostly jerking off the CEO and shit.VEN was when the bubble was the most bubbly. People were not looking at red flags.It's a good coin, but there is no guarantee it will succeed. 
5	1523093835	2	Is there a guarantee any coin will succeed?
1	1523091562	2	Awwwwww someone hug this guy
1	1523097237	1	Thank goodness. Shame on boxmining as well. He had a hand in the VeChain brigading that went on in this subreddit.Since I’ve been dabbling in crypto and lurking this sub lots of coins were shilled hard and now you barely hear about them. SIA, Waves, Stratis, LISK, IOTA, Factom, Ardor, Golem, GridCoin, STORJ, TenX, VertCoin, Groestl-whatever the fuck that name was-coin, WaltonChain, Digibyte, etc.I’m sure there’s more since then that I’m forgetting. The only one that is still discussed a decent amount is AntShares aka NEO and a little bit of ARK.
1	1523096285	1	Shsss, if you say VEN three times in a row you summon *RawMidge*
0	1523096812	2	AION or NULS for a year long hold?

2	1523105587	1	Ma man
0	1523103776	2	Whenever i see the letters POW followed by another letter (POWH, POWL, POWH3D) I just automatically think Ponzi. 
1	1523104352	5	I think Prisoner of War every time I see POW.
2	1523108042	3	Me too. And I got captured in early Jan just as I thought I was going to win the war single-handedly. Now I'm in a cage with a bunch of funny degenerates eating rats for scraps and mumbling..."Moon!...When lambo?"
3	1523109025	2	Ha ha, it's bad enough being a prisoner, but being locked up with a bunch of Lambo/Moon degenerates is like some GTMO style torture 
1	1523106487	1	Aren't they all very open about being a Ponzi scheme?
2	1523106610	2	Yeah but what they don’t say is they’re gonna run off with everyone’s money after a week or two. 
0	1523108327	2	How is cryptocurrency, as a whole, not the same as proof of Weak Hands. Don't they both require new money to come in to result in gains for the holders? Aren't coins only minted during transactions for proof of stake tokens?Why are we fooling ourselves by calling one a ponzi and one a technological revolution that will result in lambos?
1	1523108727	7	Eventually adoption will make it more than a speculative asset. You'll obtain crypto to spend it, not just hodl and hope for gainz. 
1	1523110032	4	You're referring to the 'greater fool' concept. To that extent, it's somewhat applicable to traditional stocks as well, where new money also needs to buy in at the top or be able to support current sellers.In stocks, it does have more of a valuation basis in buybacks, dividends, and a much more distinct consumer and production infrastructure. In crypto, the foundation is still more shaky. In the future, we expect this to change. Most of the current coins predictively will fade off. The ones that will survive or prosper will have coin security, network effect, an entrenched ecosystem of merchants and users, a clear revenue stream (such as proof-of-stake coin with increasing traffic), etc. As useful dapps and smart contracts proliferate, the limited fuel to pay for that will also impact coin value.The future internet will be blockchain-based, and right now, there are protocol wars in this early stage of innovation, research, and development. Crypto wars are possibly already emerging, and eventually will be forefront.
2	1523115312	1	I've seen you post a lot of nuanced information in this thread. Do you have any recommended readings or resources?
1	1523109862	2	I don't even understand why 90% of the coins out there even need us to hold them.
1	1523110060	1	Usecase
0	1523117706	2	Anyone know a crypto with an actual product that isn’t vaporware?
1	1523118116	7	Ven if you're looking at the 'higher' caps is a good one
1	1523118420	7	VEN, GVT(in alpha right now but full version will launch soon), ETH, BTC, LTC, DOGE, NANO, XLM, XMR, XRP, NEO, and there are way more but I'm honestly tired of listing.

0	1523103928	2	why is ONT continuing to pump? did they release something?
1	1523107432	3	I wonder why NEO and GAS just go sideways and slowly bleed, whilst ONT is going to the Moon. If it's all the same technology from the same people, then why does everyone have a hard on for ONT only? All of the other NEP-5 coins are bleeding badly as well, but not ONT.
2	1523109317	3	I think you're underestimating how hype-driven this market can be, especially in the short term. I mean yeah, in the last 24 hours ONT has seen much more price action, but that may not be the case over the course of a few months.
1	1523106504	6	https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-announces-venture-capital-cooperation-to-co-build-a-next-generation-chain-network-52addf28d211Da Hongfei is building out a real ecosystem targeted at publicly governed chain (NEO) and privately governed public chains that use API in a very standardized and structured way (ONT). He has government and venture backing as part of the 13^th 5-year plan. NEOx could change China. It is a big deal over there because he is offering an ecosystem solution to business and government with standardized modules for different applications and a way for them to interact with regulated government chains and public chains. 
2	1523110801	1	Awesome!
1	1523104998	0	They defied logic... Which means that they are bound to moon lol. I got some last night as I've been watching ONT and missing out for few days.
0	1523104107	0	$7000 >>> $6700 >>> $6900 >>> $6600 >>> $6900 >>> $6700 >>> $6900Getting really tired of this shit. Been going on for almost a month now soon
1	1523104462	17	What do you mean it's been going on for almost a month, exactly 1 month ago btc was at $10,600.Unless you mean a crypto month, which is really more like 5 days - in which case, carry on.
1	1523104275	6	I’d happily have this happen all year in preparation for another ridiculous bull run. Sure beats a slow bleed out in a bear market right? 
2	1523105666	5	If only it could fluctuate by say $100 per day. My heart cant handle the trips down towards $6500. I feel sweaty and instantly think about sub $6000 next baaah
3	1523112794	1	Like.. stocks?
1	1523111051	1	Ermagawd it’s the end of the world btc went down $100
0	1523112594	1	wow WAN is going to the moon right now. Did any news break out?
1	1523119034	3	I think just insanely undervalued.People were so pissed off about the time to market that everyone was afraid ICO buyers would all dump inventory and price would crash. I think people are realising it's not going to $2. I mean, if it hasn't gone there with this market dump the last few weeks, it's never going there. So if they want in on it they need to get in before it takes off.I expect WAN to pull an ONT over the next month or so.
1	1523112774	1	Idk but I'm watching it intently since its market cap is low... I thinkcoinmarketcap shows a ? so... I actually have no idea.Edit: Coincodex is showing 380 million
0	1523110398	2	I for one wish we had more boring trading days like this, with healthy organic uptrend. There's too many people who find shit to complain about. They complain a boring market. They complain about why a particular coin hasn't 10x yet. Just do a search on the word 'pump' and you'll see what i mean. Out of 400 comments it has been mentioned 30 times. Unless you have insider info, or you're a whale, with no news you cant ever time a pump.  Random bad news cant be timed, but good news I find is general easier to be 'timed' if we keep track of it.  Doing our own research is critical because not only do we learn from our mistakes better, but by the time we clicked on that vid on youtube its too late to jump on the boat. Plus, those guys on youtube or reddit rarely put money where their mouths at. They tell us to hold but do you really think they held on from december to now? 
1	1523110520	2	Agreed. I would prefer if we did sideways for a while. 
0	1523107233	3	Ah boy, this sub is made of butthurt people who downvote every comment regarding a coin they don’t like. Pathetic stuff, emotional investors stay home please.  ( Big hug towards the normal people in here, I see you <3 ) 
0	1523090876	1	If i want to pay something directly from my wallet in binance, do i just send the exact ammount or do i need to calculate the fee and send the fee on top?Edit: ty guys
1	1523091010	3	Binance calculates the fee for you. It will tell you the total and how much of that you will get.
1	1523091007	2	If you withdraw to pay, Binance shows how much you will get. That amount has to match the amount you want to pay.
0	1523110674	1	Is the market caps of cryptos messed up or is it me ? DBC is £38 million ? 
1	1523111294	3	I have never understood what the massive interest in market cap is, whether for the whole market or single coins. It means nothing as far as I can see. Willing to be corrected though.
2	1523111783	2	Overall market cap is an important indicator in market strength. If the overall cap is increasing for crypto, it means more money is flowing in (good things). If the MC is dying, it means money is flowing out (bad).Market cap for single coins is important because you compare circulating supply vs MC. It's more important with low cap coins and ability to profit big time. 
3	1523114112	2	I understand market cap but I don’t see it as an important indicator. It can mean that the last few trades made have been for stupid sums. Somebody making stupid trades for coins when 95% of the market is holding or in tether does not necessarily mean money is flowing in or out. This ability to let investments lie dormant takes away the usefulness for me.In a large market, these differences would be evened out. If however 50% of bitcoin (guess) lies in cold storage or mt gox or wherever and never sees the light of day, how do you work out supply? I understand your point, but I find statements like eoy mc unusable. If half of the shitcoins on the market were to fall off the face of the earth (exit scam, money gone), the market cap would generally be less but most people would be in a better position.If another 1000 shitcoins appear by year end, we may be at 10x current market cap but on the whole in a worse position.I could bring out a coin tomorrow with a billion circulating supply, hype it to fuck and it would be sitting around 4 cents. What does the market cap tell me?
2	1523113695	2	it means more than any other statistic
3	1523114350	1	If multiplying supply by price means more than any other statistic then I’ve been making it too difficult for myself
0	1523111159	1	So the 12 new tokens on bitfinex don’t really start trading for 3 more hours, is that right?

0	1523118637	-1	Most hourly charts look overbought. This is likely the last pump before the inevitable dumpeningThis pump has less volume than the last. It will run out of steam faster. But whales still have fiat so it depends. If they see a bunch of shorts ready for liquidation they might just keep on doing this
1	1523119060	3	because hourly charts look overbought? 
2	1523119276	1	Volume is low, it is evident this is being done to liquidate shorts and so on. It keeps piling arguments. We might hold this for some hours, then might even see some more of it up to 7.2k soon. But the dump is still coming to consolidate sideways movement.
3	1523119845	2	So you're saying the price can go up or down. Got it. Do yourself a favor and stop acting like you know what you're talking about.

1	1523088609	3	I think people are more sceptical after all the other XRP rumours that turned out to be false. Not saying it is in this case, but considering it was supposed to be listed on Coinbase three times and wasn't is a bit like crying wolf. 
1	1523088395	5	Maybe because it doesn't affect XRP the token at all.

1	1523087149	1	i like gold. it's a coin that's been around for more than 5000 years..
2	1523088402	1	I agree gold is one of the safest investments. Crypto definitely isn't safe, but it has potential to go up (a lot).

1	1523094439	5	Come on man can't you just let us have this one. I would kill for a bull run that lasts more than two days.
2	1523104489	1	Time to hit up your local Craigslist personals so. All your dreams can come true, if you just believe.

1	1523101797	0	Sunday dump confirmed.
0	1523108032	1	I've seen members here saying that they use BNB as an alternative to USDT because it's very stable and doesn't seem to be effected much by the dips of BTC. Not sure if that is correct as I've often seen it go from $9.00 to $14.00 recently.  But I just put all my play money (what I keep on the exchange to trade coins) into BNB while I'm waiting for ONT to drop. I bought at $12.45, it will be my luck that it will drop now, just as ONT goes under $3.00. Already feel like trading back out and playing with TRX for a few hours. It sucks having a limited amount of funds. 
1	1523108524	2	It is effected by BTC movements. The bottom is padded though. People trading into It from BTC has propped It up somewhat. It could go back to $10 if BTC plummets hard enough and trading can't keep up. Set tight stop losses.
2	1523109470	1	Interesting, I've already lost 0.15 cents a coin >:
1	1523111011	2	BNB is a little risky on the downside at this point with the coin burn coming in about a week.  A lot of preemptive “sell the news” peeps will be getting out early.  Just my two cents.  After coin burn, I think it’s a good hold though once it retraces a bit.
2	1523111057	1	So you think the value may drop due to the coin burn? 
3	1523111857	2	Temporarily yes, due to sell off.  But long term I think it will trend upward based on lower supply and higher demand if Binance continues to grow.

0	1523115310	0	This is the test pump. To see how many people FOMO back in from tether or BNB. 
1	1523117156	2	Can confirm. I used bnb as my stable coin during bear market and jump bavk to my favorite ICX during bull. Increase my stack by more than 20%. 
1	1523115613	3	I bought the top guys, now what do I do?
2	1523115899	1	Wait for the bots to dump, then sell the dip.
1	1523115823	3	Are people using BNB as a stable coin ? lol
2	1523115920	4	At the minute since the burn and 15% rise last week! Idk I haven’t personally. I don’t trade at all just buy. 
2	1523117894	1	I'm trying it now. It's not bad because there's a lot of coins you can trade directly with BNB.
2	1523119567	1	Its got the burn before april end, so not a bad bet at all. There is not much upcoming news elsewhere apart from XVG.If the whole market goes up, it goes up too.And as others have said, lots of options for trading.I thought it was done and it has dipped as i thought, but as a rest of april low risk, its got my money and options to trade it.
0	1523093720	-2	So now tether, wait for 6.3k, buy again and wait for 6.6k, tether and repeat? 
1	1523099572	5	Sounds like your trying to time exact price points. Good luck with that, really
1	1523097641	1	I would wait and see how the day starts to play out...  might be a little more upward movement to take advantage of
0	1523085337	-1	Are we still seeing a typical Sunday dump cycle?
1	1523085909	4	I got you hold up.... "shakes the magic 8-ball". It says buy up to 8200$.
2	1523087856	2	I'm setting my buys now.
0	1523091565	-1	Sell today buy the dip tomorrow ?
1	1523091826	8	Didn't you hear the news?  The whales are leaving crypto and not being dickbags!
1	1523094901	4	Big investors wanting to invest in crypto. Its a great risk you take! Maybe iT Will never dip ! 
2	1523094969	-2	It has dipped every single Sunday so far 
3	1523096483	5	And this is why people lose money in the market
4	1523097209	1	w/e, I'm not gonna sell, it was more of a shitpost since the price does drop every Sunday, and I'm sure it's gonna be the same tomorrow(unless I really sell, then it's gonna go up).
4	1523103894	1	It pumped one Sunday... and then dipped on Monday.
3	1523095705	2	Billionnaire Fund Manager George Soros Plans to Trade Digital Assets. this can change everything
4	1523099885	1	Soros lost billions trading agains the us economy. He‘s old and creepy and - right now - more occupied with funding anti government movements. To put it in a nutshell: He‘s not someone you want on your side. If he enters crypto, he might kill it with his shorting.
4	1523103954	1	Yeah, buddy! He gonna short this whole market to death. 
5	1523106025	1	going short does not cause the price to fall, educate your self
6	1523106795	2	Buying a shitton, pumping the price, selling off in tiny increments until it is paid for, shorting the market and taking a giant steaming dump is how people with real funny money do it. I bet he is jizzing himself at the unregulated market. 
0	1523114060	-1	Hear a lot about coinbase adding new coins, which coin do you guys think will get listed and for what reason?
1	1523114251	5	They literally just announced they have no intentions of adding new coins until regulations come in. They're going to support all the bitcoin forks allowing you to withdraw only. 
1	1523114156	5	All the coins in my portfolio because I want more money.
2	1523115175	1	0x and airswap are suspects and that's why they pump when coinbase talks
3	1523115317	2	And yet people still haven't learned...
1	1523115000	2	Should be ERC20 tokens, just go down CMC and look for ones that aren't scams or securities.
1	1523114844	2	None because of BCH insider trading lawsuits.
2	1523116409	0	Moron.
3	1523116928	1	Oh look, a fraud apologist. Fuck off. 
1	1523115062	1	They are rumouring that it's a ERC20, so I hope it's EOS that would benefit me quite a lot.
2	1523115767	4	It's not going to be EOS, as the ERC20 version of that coin will go away in June, IIRC.
2	1523118955	1	How does it feel to have invested in a pedophile backed coin (EOS) ?
3	1523119403	1	It's wrong to not support something innovative just because someone who you call a paedophile touched it. You must know that he got in it because of the money, but EOS is just more than a simple project. It has great potential and that's what I'm focusing.
4	1523120440	1	Yea like all Larimer scams since 2014 lol 
0	1523090431	-5	This Ont pump reminds me of NEO's runup last August. 
0	1523081962	-1	why ONT is pumping so hard all the time? 
1	1523082403	9	Because there are no bag holders yet who would dump on every pump.
2	1523085143	7	Thank you for the first real explanation of this phenomena.
