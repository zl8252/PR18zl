1	1523177254	8	Doesnt happen till late on sundays.
2	1523178569	5	I guess hangover could be a reason why.....
0	1523205898	24	Verge out of the top 20 yessss.
1	1523209124	5	It shouldn't even be in the top 100.
0	1523205041	18	Gone are the days of following a reddit shillfolio and making 300% in 2 weeks. That was nice
1	1523206658	1	lol 
0	1523204446	13	Is it happening? Did we Buy the taxes? Dip the pump? Chinese bonuses? Wall Street new year?
1	1523204542	7	January has ended.
0	1523201754	20	Holy shit, institutional adoption is actually happening 
1	1523202254	27	OMG! üò≠ Can't believe they're here ! Thank you Wall Street team ! ‚ô•Ô∏è keep doing the great work. üí™üí™üí™üöÄüöÄüöÄ
2	1523202926	2	As a WTC fan hilarious lol
3	1523203068	-1	What was their ‚Äúoh wait there‚Äôs more‚Äù about? 
2	1523202599	0	Gets a chuckle out of me every time  
1	1523202273	3	Is there new news? 
2	1523202650	9	http://thebitplex.com/2018/04/07/rockefeller-crypto/+Soros
3	1523203048	4	"Interested in the long term investment of cryptocurrency" . That's an awesome quote. 
4	1523203900	5	yes, but remember there are many ways to profit in crypto, shorting being the easiest, also investing in futures contracts this seems like good news, but it might be bad for the price depending on their startegythe best news for Bitcoin and crypto is adoption by the public, not some fat asshat like Soros
5	1523204401	3	Listen here buddy. You've been abusing your username lately. Time for you to say fud again ha
6	1523204614	4	mmmmmmlaying FUD or slaying FUD.....that is the questionthe problem for me is that this apparently "positive" news may not be that positiveso is calling it out and saying so the right thing to do, or keep silent and let people trade on hopium?
7	1523207821	1	Well it's all speculation so you may be right or you may be crazy. But it just might be a lunatic I'm looking for. 
0	1523179601	9	REQ getting some steam
1	1523191726	3	Yeah it really seems to be.  Bitfinex listing yesterday and biweekly update coming this Friday.
2	1523208789	2	I remember when it spiked to around 1.00 ...  some people are holding bagss i bet. I got in early with req luckily but im holding heavy ass bags in other coins
0	1523191148	10	People trying to short crypto is like being asked to get fucked. Nothing like some x10 leverage to get x10 the theoretical unlimited amount of losses on a crypto that can make 10-20% moves per day 
0	1523198972	11	Guys, we must go out and spread the good word of the Bitcoin to all the filthy heathen.
0	1523203488	10	what i woke up to green!? What is going on!?!? STOP PLAYING WITH MY FEELINGS
1	1523205245	3	you were having  dream inside of a dream. this is a dream too.. when you wake up all you will see are red dildos.
0	1523188852	28	I have like 40$ in crypto yet I still check the prices every 10 minutes and visit this sub daily
1	1523193922	17	It's fast what happens to a thousand dollars around here. üòÑüòâ
1	1523194028	-13	That's sad. Invest more to at least make it worth your time.
2	1523194153	10	How is it ‚Äúsad‚Äù?  He‚Äôs maybe just learning and doesn‚Äôt want to spunk away thousands initially. 
3	1523194821	-3	Checking every 10 minutes for $40?My time is worth more than that. Just saying.
2	1523194270	8	I‚Äôm just in it to learn about the tech and considering I‚Äôm not even old enough to buy off of most exchanges I can‚Äôt really invest more.
3	1523195242	-1	Fair enough. Though checking too frequently will drive up stress levels.I check at mealtimes. Any other big price action,I'll get an automated alert.I find that helps minimize the craziness that is crypto
0	1523195078	8	The ethtrader altcoin discussion thread had 16 comments yesterday wtf.  Perhaps the greatest indicator of the bottom I know of.  Back in the crazy days that thing had hundreds or thousands of comments.
1	1523197626	-1	That sub is hot garbage. Maybe people wised up (I say while post here lol..).
2	1523199143	3	What subreddits for crypto are actually decent these days then? 
3	1523200502	0	Almost all subs on reddit are hot garbage nowadays. /r/bitcoinmarkets is the only crypto sub I can think of with high quality discussions. 
0	1523195274	17	You know how i know the mods tether? Everytime btc goes up they dont sticky the daily
1	1523195818	4	Mods have weak hands. Can't even hold a feather with those weak ass mitts.
2	1523202952	1	Feathercoin still a thing?
1	1523195946	3	This happens every Sunday. It is related to having two stickies. I think only one can be automatic and the other is a manual sticky. They have to move the Skeptics to the manual sticky and put Daily on auto every week. 
0	1523179701	9	Sticky this post please mods
0	1523198550	16	*puts tinfoil hat on*Anyone find it weird that soon after it's announced that institutional money is entering crypto, Bitcoin stopped barting? It's movements seem more stable over the past couple days. Small sample size of course.
0	1523172530	6	Any Funfair holders here?
1	1523194059	4	I sold ~70% of my position for AION, which has been a better move so far. So I still hold some, but I think BTC needs to recover to really see any action. 
1	1523175822	2	I amLong term hold
1	1523190329	2	Yup, made it the majority of my crypto portfolio
2	1523193275	1	I don‚Äôt mean this at all in a rude way, but why? I have a tiny bit so i feel it‚Äôs a good investment but genuinely curious as to why you‚Äôd have it be a bulk of your portfolio. 
2	1523193602	0	Majority of mines as well.
3	1523197794	1	Grab your pickaxe and start digging!
1	1523179729	1	Here here.
1	1523182593	1	Aye.
0	1523188547	5	Why isn't this thread stickied like normal?
1	1523189121	4	Doesnt happen till later on a sunday. 
1	1523190516	2	Once the sunday dip starts, they will..
0	1523173967	19	Green dildo‚Äôs please, asshole is ready to take them all
1	1523179940	9	coming already, be prepared
1	1523182171	8	Lube up 
1	1523183254	0	[deleted]
2	1523184025	1	Silent
3	1523185172	1	My joke wasn't as funny this time.
0	1523201592	13	My mom asked me if I could buy some cryptos for her, thinking about this:Eth 40%Neo 40%ICX 20%Thoughts?Edit:New plan:BTC 30%NEO 30%ETH 25%ICX 15%Edit 2: I love that you guys are all saying different things! Makes making choices really difficult lol.
1	1523202326	12	My mom asked me the same when we met a few weeks ago - I told her to dyor
2	1523204021	11	Congrats on meeting your mum!
1	1523201910	7	I think that's pretty solid honestly, wouldn't be bad to have bitcoin also. Any idea how much she's willing to invest? 
2	1523202106	11	6-7 billion USD.  Bull run confirmed.
3	1523205348	1	Loading up right now
2	1523202086	6	Thanks, probably about 500 to start.
1	1523202759	3	Perfect combination of security and risk. She will be happy in 2 years. 
2	1523202925	2	Thanks I hope so!
1	1523203148	3	Put more into ETH..
1	1523203279	7	XRP
2	1523203565	1	Not a huge fan of xrp...
3	1523204894	3	Doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs a logical choice. Furthermore I would consider looking into iota 
1	1523209648	3	Word of warning: your mom is gonna drive you crazy for the next 2+ years
2	1523210772	1	She is gonna do that regardless lol
1	1523203431	2	I would rather go full in on Qash if I was u.. but:)
2	1523203548	2	I want to play it a bit on the safe side
1	1523201873	1	BTC
1	1523204163	1	That's actually a good plan. Love NEO, Love ICX, ETH is good too although I'd have OMG there instead, and BTC is a safe bet but I doubt it'll give you grand increases.
2	1523204578	1	Thanks, don‚Äôt know if I want to diversify too much as she isn‚Äôt investing that much.Edit: also want to be a bit on the safe side
3	1523209382	1	ok. Eth is pretty safe. I think you have a solid thing going on
1	1523206107	1	Try the crypto20 maybe.  
1	1523205082	1	Invest in passive income projects. NEO and Ven are my favorite projects 
1	1523204138	-2	ICX is vaporwave and NEO won‚Äôt be in the top 15 anymore in a yearEither XLM or Monero
2	1523204507	1	I like monero and XLM but I don‚Äôt agree with you on ICX and NEO
3	1523204776	1	Tbh I‚Äôm really wary of Chinese cryptos, the Chinese government can clamp on them anytime it wants in order to regulate them. After all they are a dictatorship and cryptos effectively erode their power. So NEO is actually risky in my opinion.In regards to ICX they‚Äôre really behind their road map so I‚Äôm not really enthusiastic about them, but then again they could prove to be really successful
4	1523204952	1	It could also swing the other way right? If the Chinese government is bullish, NEO could work out nicely
4	1523205167	1	Why would the they clamp down on a project that is government compliant though
1	1523206414	0	looks good but I would split neo to 15 and give 15 to Ven 
0	1523186104	6	Sticky please mods.Calling u/LargeSnorlax
1	1523193946	2	No the skeptics thread is stickied on Sundays, there is a link to this thread in thereThey can only have 2 stickies at a time.
0	1523184492	9	Is one doge still one doge?
1	1523184903	9	the day this isn't true, crypto is officially ded
2	1523189724	6	But Elon musk said in Twitter if I send him 1 doge he'll send 10 doge back.
1	1523187179	4	Much stable 
0	1523206527	5	Man going to tether has always scared me when I'm at loss on my intial investment. The last few days weird price movement now has me even more spooked.
1	1523208032	1	Why do you constitute it as weird?
2	1523208092	1	It moves up and down. 
2	1523208355	1	Hitting a resistance line in a downtrend and doesnt tank but it doesnt break through to higher highs. Normally its tanked very rapidly when it failed to break through the resistance line. 
0	1523205618	8	When people say "it's still early" are they just lying? Even teens and old grandmothers know about bitcoin now.
1	1523206462	13	No adoption yet, no big institutional money yet, less than 5% have fully developed products. Yes it is the beginning, saying otherwise is extremely ignorant. Everyone knew about mobile phones, yet it took a good while for people to buy them as "it wasn't seen as something needed". Same with many technological innovations. Spreading the word about tech is literally step 1. This market's worth is barely anything. Remember: Bitcoin is "old", 99% of projects in this market are much much younger. Ask grandmothers about areas like supply chain, decentralized internet, storage/ad solutions, etc. and think again how early we are.Edit: almost forgot the most important thing: the new cohorts of young people after us will be even more tech minded than us. They will push adoption the next 5-10 years. 
2	1523207714	6	To be fair, I could ask grandmas about telecom systems or sql databases and they would be just as clueless.  Old grandmas should not be your goto example.
3	1523208700	3	That's one of my points. OP used grandmothers as part of his sample group. 
1	1523206204	5	People 'knowing' about something isn't adoption. The curve for adoption doesn't refer to how many people 'know' about a product, but rather how many people trust the product and see the need for it, and actually start using it.  Teens would be expected to be early adopters for new technology though.  When our parents start using cryptocurrencies in their daily lives to pay bills or whatnot, that's when we've hit mainstream adoption.  Everything before that is 'still early'.  People had heard of the iPhone, Amazon, FaceBook, etc... long before they started adopting it into their daily lives.
2	1523206303	1	Quick! All you teens go make babies so we can speed up adoption!!!
1	1523206441	4	they know, but they don't buy (with) it. so we are still early!
1	1523209112	2	Are you HODLing or are you acquiring crypto to use in an expedient, secure, and cost-effective way? How does the public currently leverage crypto?Adoption = real-world use beyond a store of value. It is the next layer over Satoshi's core. We are very early. 
1	1523209439	1	I think so. Bitcoin wont make any more millionaires on tiny investments. We are still pre adoption however. So that's exciting but also dangerous. 
0	1523187566	4	when does the 1 hour and 24 hour happen? dumb question probs
1	1523189208	3	It's compared exactly 1hr or 24hr from the time you're currently checking
1	1523188416	1	When does anything happen? What is time? 
2	1523189977	3	time is a social construct 
0	1523168156	7	First!Wonder if we'll finally avert the old classic Sunday dip this time, or if we're in for more of the same mess. Hoping for the former.
1	1523171620	9	Due to unforeseen circumstances Sunday dip will now be held on Monday after everyone takes long positions.
2	1523184386	1	Exactly, more ass reaming can be achieved that way.
0	1523191539	10	I like to imagine each btc pump is George Soros just brutally wrecking every noob shorter that thinks they have it all figured out and that their TA means anything.
0	1523191376	7	BNB - Thinking out loud....1 week till the coin burn. Is it going to burn me, or am i going to burn Benjamin's to light my Cubans.If i was a betting man, and I am, not a very good one though, I bet I get burned.Why do I get burned?Because it is a working project. The exchange has excellent support, responded amazingly to last few issues in a timely manner, has plans for the coin, has plans to grow the exchange even more. Sounds like a smart play, hence why I get burned.Its just not scammy enough to be successful.You sell, I'm holding anyway, hero or zero.
1	1523192470	4	The price is being baked in. They have been steadily buying since the quarter started. Why do you think it has refused to dive below $12 when BTC was $6500 but then suddenly loses upward momentum around $12.75 when BTC goes on a rampage?
2	1523193805	0	Must of missed the BTC rampage.But I did notice the great 12 support, which would be why I'm holding so strong. My hand is typically very weak and I limit my losses.I see what you mean though, it's up about 4 bucks since BTC was last at this price.So you think it runs this level then for the week, it's run it's course already. I still like my minimum 15 call, was hoping for at least 20, I like your call as well. I'm basing my call strictly on the last burn, BTC crashed and this still pumped a few days before the burn and crashed after. It pumped from 13 to 25 starting 4 days before the burn. I'll give this a couple more days, if it does not show signs of life by then I will move on.
3	1523195651	3	I honestly don't know for sure. Bearish sentiment is a bitch and, like it or not, BNB does follow BTC if it is pumping/dumping hard. It got down to <$10 because BTC was dropping like a stone. Arbitrage and padding the bottom can't keep up. If BTC goes on a run it will too. If BTC doesn't, hope we don't plunge. FWIW, I'm DCAing it and watching closely. 
1	1523199857	1	Id add into the debate...Binance burn 20 % of profits on coinburns per q... 986000 coins in their first quarter , 1.8m in jan. If i understand it right..Now..What is likely to be their most profitable quarter thus? This one just gone? I reckon. Which means there will be at least 1.8m coins burned.  I think they may have tripled/quadrupled profits, maybe more in Jan - Mar vs the previous q.So that could mean LOTS getting burned. = More swing in price.I did nicely out of it recently and had no intention to go back in. But seems fairly steady and only coin with a decent story in next week or so. (Dont mention XVG but did ok on that as well).So went back in yesterday, after it dipped  with the on exchange money. Sods law, im down 5% vs the big coins. But the gambler in me thinks that given its dipped a bit and no coin burn, it will breach 13, maybe 15 on the burn announcement.After that ill be out.
1	1523191470	1	It will dump a lot after or even before the burn.  I‚Äôve been in it and not sold before during that time.  I won‚Äôt make that mistake again.
2	1523193611	2	Not rightly so with BNB cb iidrc. The whole buy the rumor, sell the news doesn't fit with this scenario. Granted,,, it may drop a little just from majority people thinking this way and selling, but if I recall right from my reading and research, the prices stays at it's higher value. 
2	1523192631	1	I played this one bad. Sold it last week on the pump, but well before the high, rebought higher than my sell and basically at this level and lost some volume. Got some of the volume back with the ONT/BNB BTC/BNB trade pair. Looking at it closely the last burn, It pumped when BTC pumped to 23, BTC crashed, BNB pumped to 25 before the burn, then crashed after the burn with along with BTC. Were people just running to BNB for the BTC crash or was it the burn or both?Truthfully I think this pumps before burn, then crashes.I'm likely wrong and this takes me out of crypto by the end of today.Hero or zero
3	1523193818	1	It only crashed because everything did. In my humble opinion, I think it's going to stay right around where it's at until it's time to follow btc in an upward movement.
1	1523191921	1	I'll sell after coin burn - to buy more in the expected dip or to FOMO if a dip will not happen :)
0	1523168385	7	Bitcoin is going to lose more exclusivity in been the gateway to the alts.NEX announce fiat to alt offerings.NEX have will be situated in the heart of finance Switzerland!
1	1523182480	3	Oh I love the prospect of the NEX dex! One part of the NEO smart economy :)
0	1523209107	4	I've been working on an aggregate cryptocurrency subreddit network, check it out and let me know if I am missing any subreddits:https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoTraderNetwork/I'm still working on [this page](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoTraderNetwork/wiki/network) which will eventually include more buttons/links for all those subreddits listed at the bottom.If anyone wants to help out or has any suggestions, let me know.

0	1523203852	6	My daily analysis looking at:* Bitcoin's push higher but possible bearish signs* Ethereum moving to retest resistance* Litecoin's continued dip to test support* Monero as it also tests support levelshttps://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-8th-apr-technical-analysis
0	1523190229	4	In Russian: Dip Sundays
0	1523206097	5	*he's in, dump it*
1	1523206999	2	Seriously, feels like a conspiracy sometimes. I wonder how I can always perfectly time it that I buy one minute before the dump comes. 
2	1523207816	1	That's bad karma... Some of us aren't made to have good luck. 
0	1523182663	2	What's going to see the most +% today?Winner get's to go on my christmas card list.

1	1523189051	2	Red flags everywhere yet people fomo in
1	1523191138	2	Harvard buzz nonsense, product is in 10 stores only nobody knows where, somewhere in India. Dit not do  proper ICO. 90% of coins in circulation are owned by some whales.... ALL FUD as usual. Great project with potential! Breakout was just a closing triangle, should go to 500 or something.Just discuss Ven and Neo here 
0	1523193483	2	if i use market price buying on binance will it choose thebest price?
1	1523195011	3	it will start filling from the top of the seller's order book (the red book). If your order is larger than the seller's it will fill their order and move on to the next order until your order is filled. Pay close attention to this. There can be big gaps in price during pump and dumps and if you panic sell or buy you may not get the price you think you are. It is much better, and often cheaper, to be a market maker by placing limit orders on the books. Exchanges will offer you discounted fees for being a maker. Liquidity on the books benefits everyone. This takes good timing and skill. Trying to buy/sell during a panic at tops and bottoms can get mixed results. On margin trading, it can get you rekt. That is why TA is important for identifying places where a particular market naturally resists change. You are far more likely to make money at this if you use a DCA method, ladder efficiently, and never panic. HODLing works, in the very long-term, unless you have had the misfortune of buying a toxic asset. 
2	1523197628	2	I‚Äôm buying market price and hodling for a couple of months so it shouldn‚Äôt make that much of a difference
1	1523193598	2	You will buy at the price it is at the moment you click the buy button.
2	1523193858	1	So is that what people normally do or?
3	1523194171	2	That's the easiest way but you can set a limit buy if you think the price will drop so if the market is at $5.00 but you think it will go to $4.50 you can set a limit buy at $4.50 hit the buy button and when the price drop to your limit your trade will be made. You can also cancel your trade before it goes through at the bottom right of the page.
4	1523194714	1	also think of the spread. if you buy market the order will take the first ask, if you do limit you will set a price as the lowest bid. if there is a big difference, you need to wait for the market to move upwards until you are equal
1	1523193591	1	I believe in buys all orders beneath and up to the Satoshi ratio you set.
0	1523196906	2	Looking to see how to go about logging my holdings to keep track of what I have. What do most people use? Or how do you do it?
1	1523196937	3	Delta app
2	1523197251	2	Does that help with transactions too?
3	1523199590	3	Yep, it‚Äôs ace.

0	1523202455	1	even if we enter into a bull run in the coming months, what's to stop the scenario that we just went through (January/February crash) from occurring again?We could go up to 50k by December this year and then? Another crash....tis the season after all. Hopefully we will be wiser and set stop loss orders then
1	1523202798	17	Yup, called a market cycle. It'll happen. People will still get rekt.
2	1523203273	7	not me, not againI learned my lesson
3	1523205179	4	Not me! üåù lambo gainz!!
4	1523205458	4	lambos are a bad investmenta lambo depreciates in value by 10% as soon as you sign the paperworkbuy property instead
5	1523209071	1	Lambos are also pleb tier taste in cars. If you buy a lambo after amassing a fortune you have zero imagination.
2	1523203100	3	Life of crypto.
1	1523204070	10	That's how economies work now. Look at stocks. Japan, USA, if you zoom out 20-30 years you'll always see a exponential run-up, downturn, then repeat. The crash of the market usually is higher than the previous high though. And the next crash will still be higher as long as the world economy grows.That's why a lot of people say time in the market is better than timing then market. Now this is assuming the world stays in relative "peace". Obviously we've had a period of unprecedented growth in most nations from after World War 2 onwards that also had a huge population growth.In a sense, it could be considered a bit like a pyramid scheme, but one that will never end as long as there's more and more people and the economy keeps growing. And one that actually adds value (debatable on your definition of value). I don't know if this will continue forever. Population equilibrium may be reached at some point. Also, the baby boomer generation was born in probably one of the luckiest generation in terms of economy that we've seen so far. By simply buying some stocks or a real estate, they could've been extremely wealthy. That is why I think this self serving bias hurts the younger generation. "Just go to school and get a job".  "Work 35-40 years". "Buy a house and watch it 5x or even 10x". "If I did it, why can't you, you lazy bum?"Don't think it'll crash horribly either but kinda taper off for slow growth. We'll see. Exciting times ahead of us in terms of technological innovation (both crypto and non-crypto innovation).
2	1523205533	3	Japan never really came back after the 1989 Nikkei bubble.
3	1523211094	1	You do have a point. But they did cycle from 1950's to 1990.And they haven't really exploded but have gone sideways...maybe that's what's going to happen to countries once things are saturated?
1	1523202768	7	March was arguably just as bad. Slowly bled down from March 7th on 
1	1523205676	6	Stop loss orders aren't magic. Say you set a stop loss order at -15%. The market has a bad week and your order triggers a sell. Then it quickly rebounds +5% while you're sleeping. What do you do? Not to mention that you have to keep your coins on the exchange. Not to mention that Tether is not exactly risk free.
2	1523206477	3	the strategy is to do this only in decemberAlternative to Tether is DIA
2	1523208686	1	You revel in the fact that you pulled out your funds at a gain and get to keep all of that profit without any more risk (provided Tether remains stable or you convert your profit to fiat). Go for the notorious "last eighth" that will probably occur while you are sleeping and risk getting burned and losing your profit. It's a basic concept of sound investing.
0	1523192862	2	Good time to buy some BNB?
1	1523194745	3	Prior to the last burn it pumped with the BTC pump to 23. BTC crashed. BNB crashed. But 3 days before the burn it pumped from 13 to 25 when BTC was still crashing for 4 days prior the burn. It then took it's dump along with BTC.Not proper TA I know.Other thing to consider was BTC was twice the price it is now, if that is even part of the consideration and whether or not people were running to BNB for the BTC crash or the burn.Bottom line, I don't fckn know and I have no help to provide.
2	1523208777	2	You make a good point.  I remember that and it did appear everyone was using BNB as a temporary safe-haven while BTC crashed... The same has happened with XRP and DGD.  I'm sure there are others...
1	1523193334	1	Why? Good time for that was over the last 3-4 weeks up until last week...  Unless of course you do mean for the long run, then sure, why not.
1	1523193346	1	maybe - maybe not... you should ask CZ :)

1	1523208539	4	I can see why you'd say that.The dominance will slowly migrate to exchanges as they plough on with fiat to alt coin gateways.leaving BTC less valuable.Binance have a shot to draw in the mainstream. They may just do it.
2	1523209228	2	I never know what is truly satire here.

2	1523207362	2	I have the same, don't really know which alt is promising at this price point. What do you reckon?
2	1523208697	1	On the sidelines. The market is evolving right now - fiat to alts from major exchanges will change the landscape ... for the good
0	1523190572	1	So what did you guys buy for the last two to three weeks?
1	1523193967	11	Ramen
2	1523194973	1	I feel you on that.
1	1523191977	2	Hotdogs , mac and cheese.
1	1523202205	1	Strat, Gbyte, IoP, Powr, Part.Some nice bullish divergences on RSI and flattening out of prices.
0	1523195027	1	What coins are you guys looking at short term for the next week?
1	1523196233	7	Mostly BTC. 
1	1523202313	3	The top 30 coins that have dropped the most in the last week might bounce. Im watching ada, neo, nano and icx, seem to be bottomed out. 
1	1523205952	2	Substratum this month bro, they are having a documentary coming out, I thnk on CNN or CNBC, can't remember which one. Their MVP product release in imminent, many are saying they will release it before the documentary airs on tv.
0	1523197535	1	Do you guys see BNB rising again until the coin burn this week? Or will it most likely stay around here then dip after the burn?
1	1523197915	2	As much FOMO questions that are happening around here lately I'm inclined to believe it will pump at some point. How much I couldn't say. It has been pretty rock solid above $12.00 unless BTC goes on a selloff. 
2	1523199774	2	I‚Äôve actually used it as a stable coin at times when something‚Äôs tanking

0	1523204648	1	Quick question about Huobi.  I haven't used it before.  It says that it will not accept ETH transfers from Coinbase.  Does that include GDAX?  I wouldn't think so...Thanks in advance!

0	1523208951	1	i hope im wrong but volume seems too low.. i expect a big red candle forming soon and BTC dropping to 6.6-6.8 range again
1	1523209307	3	With low volume, the whales could spike it either way. Since the market is on a downtrend though, I see it taking a dip soon. Time well tell I guess. 
2	1523210542	3	yeah, exact same thinking 
0	1523194239	1	NCASH is about the only coin I'm even on
1	1523194421	6	Well that's a little silly
0	1523210540	1	Planning to invest in VEN, but would only be able to get around 700. My question is with the total supply being 870 million is it possible for ven to reach at least 50 per coin? or the highest i can go is around 25? correct me if i am wrong. thanks
1	1523211166	1	If there‚Äôs another crypto boom and most of us think there will be another major one and if their main net goes well and gets tons of clients $100 could be acheivable by sometime next year.
1	1523210669	1	Theoretically everything is possible. Practically, you'd need to consider if you see a circulating supply times potential coin price happening. 50 euro would then be quite a lot but can still happen theoretically 
1	1523210688	0	price is anyone's guess. it could go way past $50, could never reach past $10 again. It's up to you to decide if VEN is worth it, most seem to choose "yes".

1	1523198385	4	Probably helps that BTC is moving up again for a bit.
2	1523198467	4	Yea that's true. Good to see anyway though. 
0	1523190890	-3	Did Binance just crash?
0	1523209992	0	We finally got a positive 7 days.  We also had one circa March 18-25 so it doesn't have to mean anything.Some moon math: take ethereum for instance. 5% in 7 days. That's about 13x your money a year. Not bad. Stellar did 1.28%. That's 2x a year. That's a hell of a lot better than the stock market.You don't always have to zoom up to remain positive :)   Although if you do, it's a lot better. The total market cap was 28B only 12 months ago. Whichever way it goes in the future, keep expecting this kind of volatility.
1	1523210947	2	Nope. I'm here for 300% per week. 
2	1523211060	1	You realize that if you invest $0.01 at 300% per week, you'll have 65 million quadrillion dollars after a year? Or something like that, I may be off by a factor of 100.

2	1523192565	1	This is correct. It is already back up. Got a little worried that some asshat decided to DDoS Binance. 
0	1523183380	-5	Right now I'm sitting 50% in AION 50% in ICON. Do you think this is too "safe" a portfolio with not enough potential for big multiples?
1	1523185335	5	Nothing is safe 
1	1523191657	5	It is a very risky portfolio, you aren‚Äôt diversified at all.  What if neither of those projects make it?
2	1523193640	2	I agree! I think 3-4 is a better number, and maybe 5 tops. It really depends on how much is invested. Over diversifying is a thing too, because you‚Äôll have projects sink your stack and not be able to keep up with them all. I see a lot of people saying they are in like 10-12 coins on here which is just crazy. 
3	1523194337	1	http://www.bsic.it/markowitz-walk-crypto-land-modern-assets-modern-portfolios/After about 8-9 you have reached maximum risk reduction in stock portfolios, I'm unsure how well that carries over to crypto portfolios though.  It may be the same.
1	1523184493	4	I hold both and i like interoperability but i wouldn't call them safe. Both are long term holds and have a lot of work to do. ICX hasn't even swapped their ERC20 tokens yet and are ~4/5 months behind on that swap so not really that safe. Mod risk if anything. Only coins i'd call safe in the current market are BTC and ETH. 
1	1523184437	2	Diversify more would be my advice.

2	1523189845	3	He puts up collateral. Say 1k for example. If price goes up 100 he loses his 1k and his short position gets automatically closed to avoid further losses. But if price goes down 100 he makes 1k. If it goes down 500 he makes 5k, and so on.
