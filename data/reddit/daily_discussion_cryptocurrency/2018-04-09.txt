0	1523254776	42	7k feels like 20k.
1	1523255367	32	Maybe next year 20k will feel like 7k.
1	1523254901	11	7k is the new 20k. 
2	1523255339	5	So what does that make 7500. Looks closer then it has been for a while. 
0	1523275144	32	Anyone else so dead inside they don't care anymore? 🤷‍♂️
1	1523278403	4	Yo, don't dead, open inside. 
1	1523278923	3	I‘m just a fading shadow of the trader I once was. At least now I trade 100% without emotions because I have none left.
1	1523278927	2	At this point  the only update on crypto I get is Delta telling me that my portfolio dropped another 2% in 24 hours. 
1	1523279480	2	I was for a bit, but the prospect of btc going g to 4k and putting my portfolio at 0 has made me care again.
0	1523269305	29	Ah, whale just arrived at his office 
0	1523269755	50	Amazing to see that just 2 hours ago i was reading comments that said bull run incoming, never below 7k again. How quickly sentiment changes 
1	1523275074	5	The delusion is so strong in these dailies. It's just mental masturbation.
0	1523271994	43	Go to the gym happy that ETH is on the move. Come out of the gym and it's back to yesterday's price...lol...might go back in and drop the barbell on my neck. 
0	1523258669	15	Ethereum FOMO party in full effect. 
1	1523258896	4	Back to 800 pleaseeee
2	1523262765	6	Fuck that.....1400 please
2	1523262820	4	Excuse you, 1800 ave. Is my stop on this train.
0	1523269817	12	Well that's a pretty sudden drop. Will be interesting to see if this means we're headed back down, but a drop of that magnitude could also result in a pretty violent rebound.
1	1523269894	10	probably down.
1	1523270622	4	I bought the dip so you can rest assured it won't rebound.
1	1523269973	2	I think we need to be optimistic now, so my guess is that it'll be a pretty violent drop. Think positive, could be worse!
0	1523290292	12	/u/RawMidge is the new acehigh666 (or whatever his name was).  Everyone is sick of your crap. Edit: Maybe RawMidge is acehigh... Woah
1	1523290488	5	he is everywhere, check his comment history, it's all just angry bs on all kinds of forums, not even crypto 
2	1523290531	5	Ah so he's a psychopath... I see. Oh and a total dick, gotta love these guys that hide behind keyboards and spread negativity
1	1523290369	9	Mods can we get him out of here already till he makes a new name 
0	1523254854	11	Whats that weird color I see on CMC and blockfolio? you guys did something? 
1	1523255320	16	It's a bug. Should be fixed soon. Thank you for your patience.
2	1523273557	6	Its fixed now, thank you!
3	1523275817	1	No worries, let us know if it happens again!
0	1523271595	12	Is only a whale,  why you heff to be mad
1	1523274085	2	This comment made my day
0	1523254828	22	Another day of green. The world is no longer how it used to be.
1	1523254880	5	We are coming and we are coming in waves.
2	1523255443	2	Not our money. People with more money than us. 
3	1523262743	1	New world order money
4	1523263783	1	Correct but we just need to ride the wave 
5	1523266174	1	What are you thinking? I am thinking we could break all time highs by end of year 
6	1523270099	1	When it goes on the next bullrun it will exceed previous ATH 
1	1523260763	5	Mmm mmm nonono.  
2	1523282891	2	Whatamagonnado?!
1	1523273441	1	Yes it is
0	1523269166	12	damp it
0	1523269230	11	Sunday's finally here guys.
0	1523269715	11	he bought back
0	1523269726	12	why am i not surprised this shit happened.
0	1523272667	11	The market is playing 4D chess while I'm playing checkers
1	1523273098	5	Mostly Chutes and Ladders for me.  
2	1523273609	1	We'll be playing Tic-Tac-Toe by the afternoon/evening 
0	1523273374	21	Every Monday same thing. Some whale sells 10k ish BTC market order and tried to plunge price.Guys this isn't going to stop. You know how to beat these guys?Let your buy money accumulate, save it for one of these non organic dumps. They are trying to liquidate stop loss orders then buy back their position on your panic sells. Instead just buy in on the discount. Then hold.If you want to get fancy you can try to sell immediately after a non organic pump that tries to liquidate shorts.I mean this shit is so obvious. It's clear they are "next levelling" your stop loss orders. It's clear they are next levelling your shorts. So stop doing that shit, and just time entries around their attempts.I have actually made almost 30% doing this in the last 2 weeks while the overall market is roughly reset.You know what happens to this whale when everyone just sits and times buys for his dumps? He throws his money into the garbage. He literally just gives away his position, because it dumps them instantly recovers. We just need volume to beat them.When these non organic dumps happen and you either don't buy in, or even worse sell (or get stop losses triggered), then YOU just give your position to them.
1	1523274051	7	The way you beat them is by comparing timestamps, you isolate the exchange where the selling is coming from.. Then DDOS the exchange as the selling begins. 
1	1523278488	2	There isn't some conspiracy man, BTC just hasn't broken its downtrend yet.
0	1523276979	18	TA is rendered useless when someone sells 12.5 k bitcoin. 
1	1523278600	3	Except they sold right at the end of the ascending wedge so they were likely using TA as a guide.
0	1523269245	9	Dropcoin
0	1523269297	9	And there it goes again 
1	1523272910	2	every damn day since a couple months this happens
0	1523282165	9	Interesting to know why cck tweeted some specific other cryptos this time in addition to VEN.
1	1523282628	7	Because he's laughing at them
1	1523285901	2	More exposure for his tweet?
0	1523261379	17	Whole lotta $ beginning to flow into ETH.
0	1523267002	9	having 2 daily discussion threads stickied on a monday morning is just too much to cope with
0	1523269465	8	E's FOMO'd in. Damp eet. 
0	1523269550	9	nano plz stop :/
1	1523273265	2	buy gr s
0	1523283427	9	Seeing eth at $430 earlier.... I had the inkling to sell up, and “see what happens”. But FOMO hit me and I thought maybe wait for $450 or maybe even 500! Next thing you know.... it’s back to $390 now! The joys of Crypto these days.... sitting tight as always!
1	1523283537	6	Same. I woke up pissed as hell 
0	1523293742	8	>"Bitcoin is a dinosaur and needs to die for my favorite alt coin to dominate"Translated to:>The united states needs to die for ethopia to dominate.Comparing market cap and Per Capita GDP
1	1523295116	3	If someone today created and premined 1 billion ANYCOIN and then sold just one of the ANY coins for $1 USD (or sats equivalent) you would be listed on coinmarketcap as having a Market Cap of $1Billion USD. Even though for all the coins there’s only liquidity of $1 dollar and not $1billion dollars. Market cap (number of tokens X last sale price) tells you nothing at all. It is a measurement of some future potential not an actual measurement or valuation.
2	1523295240	1	Bitcoin has 9 years of trust, millions of transactions, and multiple exchanges.And you think thats comparable to 1 person shilling an alt coin? Be real
0	1523283417	14	This market has reached a new level of patheticness now.
0	1523254872	7	Feels like Chinese  New Year 
0	1523262833	7	investing in crypto atm ( i dont trade) yet i check prices like every 30 mins how can i stop myself from doing this i can hardly sleep
1	1523264501	21	Lose enough money that you become despondent. 
2	1523266282	6	This. I check once a day now and have no emotion whatever I see.
2	1523265996	4	Its the only way 
2	1523266212	3	Made me laugh out loud. 
2	1523266271	2	Be in for so long that you've already payed back your intital investment a few times over. Then this becomes only a passing interest. On the same token (see what I did there?) Use the obsession to do actual research about why coin x is better than coin y and all that jazz. 
2	1523265412	1	This^
2	1523265522	1	That acutally did the trick for me as well. Sad but true :)
1	1523263972	4	Get a girlfriend, a job, some hobbies and stuff to care about. If i wouldnt have that - i would probally ask the same question here :) 
2	1523267002	1	They *still* come second to checking crypto price 😂
1	1523263293	1	Just do it twice a day is enough
0	1523264722	8	Pamp it
1	1523268450	2	LOUDER...
1	1523267470	1	e solld?
1	1523268187	1	Laud ze Koreea food
0	1523269287	8	That happened...
0	1523284448	6	My weak hands refused to dump my BNB, I was holding for dear life. TY
0	1523290485	7	Cryptos will not be a craze again until people stop trying to turn crypto money into fiat money. If that happens, we won't continually hemorrhage money after small gains. Cryptos should be currency, not something you use to get currency.
1	1523290700	6	Not all cryptos are meant to used as currency in the traditional sense. Smart currency tokens are a means of easy value transfer in blockchain networks, but the big players using these networks may still want their FIAT
2	1523290883	2	That is the sad truth, and why cryptos may not go anywhere. As long as people are using it as a vessel to get fiat, it will not boom.
1	1523293918	3	Cryptos aren't meant to replace FIAT currencies. They are designed to replace certain types of transactions performed that currently requires alot of bureaucratic nonsense and are uneccessarily costly as a result. That doesn't render FIAT money useless or replace it any way.Same way that once people started using FIAT money in the first place to replace bartering and trading with chickens, it didn't replace the bartering and chickens but rather enhanced it. Similarly Cryptocurrencies will be a tool that will enhance the utility of FIAT money.
0	1523269991	14	lol are you fucking kidding me, sigh back to the 6.5 - 6.8k battle
1	1523270124	12	I know right? Every time I start to let myself be optimistic again this happens, and so fast. Totally organic lol
2	1523270880	7	Hint: Don't be optimistic until theres actually a reason for the price to increase. Makes life much easier. 
2	1523270260	3	Week by week. You can set your timer that after 270mio $ market cap the dump hammer goes on crypto. As long as people are afraid and set stop loss orders like idiots we won't make it further. 
0	1523270194	14	Another day another dump. Good to see absolutely nothing has changed in crypto land.
0	1523257321	27	This bear market showed me why I shouldn't be too greedy.. had bought $1000 worth of crypto which became $5000 worth in a month. My greedy ass, after reading how much gains 2018 would bring in this sub and in the media, wanted to atleast make it $10,000 before I cash out.And now here I am with my portfolio reduced to $200. 
1	1523259743	10	I think this bear market made all the new people more experienced, but also created a lot of haters, because they lost a lot of money if they sold after being down -70% and more. Hopefully the next bull run won't be as crazy and more people will be aware just how dangerous betting on crypto is
2	1523268242	2	> I think this bear market made all the new people more experiencedNah, this place is still infested with moon kids who think its going up forever at the smallest spike.
1	1523260421	7	We all know the bull market will return,so try to take this as a lesson.    i was also in like a 4k profit in January,but in the end life is about learning,not about money.
1	1523262812	4	But its not about the money, its about the friends we make along the way right?
1	1523257429	8	Man what did you buy that is down 95%+ from ATH? Bitconnect?
2	1523258849	6	Haha! No. I got in early December and had bought XRP at $0.2 and TRX at $0.02. TRX was actually called a decent coin then before it grabbed the sixth spot and caught everyone's attention. I didn't sell TRX at $0.30 and XRP at $3. Was waiting for TRX to hit $1 and XRP at $10.I sold all my TRX a couple weeks ago, just before the pump, at $0.03 and bought Nano at $6.
3	1523259252	2	Not sure I quite follow the math here mate. You put 1k into XRP @0.2 and TRX @0.02.  Then you sold TRX @0.03 (+50%) and XRP is sitting well above 0.2 but your 1k is down to 200?
4	1523259830	6	Yes. I had done some bad trades. I was selling a part of XRP on every 20-30% rise only to buy lesser coins with the fiat I got after selling. So now I have only like 1000 XRP.
5	1523259913	3	Oof, that hurts. Hope you learned from that experience though, it'll help you going forward.
3	1523260828	2	Read whitepapers before you hand over your money in the future
4	1523269335	1	Like the one from confido or bitconnect?
3	1523259141	1	so if you bought 1000 dollars of xrp at 20 cents and tron at 2 cents... xrp is at at 50 cents.... trx was still above 2 cents... how did your portfolio go from 1000 to 200?
4	1523259639	1	I just listed my biggest holdings here - XRP and TRX.I had 2500 XRP and 15000 TRX to start with and $200 of other coins like ENJ, XLM, XVG, etc.I did some stupid trades in Jan trading for other coins at their ATH. 
1	1523257607	4	Mayn u just gotta chill quit bein a birch ufeelme its all gonna b straight jus shit on ur hands b patient
0	1523271120	17	Daily reminder: This will happen until there is a *reason* for the price to go up.2 days of green for no reason isn't a bull market. 
1	1523271500	5	What was the reason for it to fall then? 
2	1523272066	5	enough % in green, sell orders placed/reached get executed. If you have 5+ digits in $ in crypto, making 5-10% per trade is already great. If you have 6+ digits, this is a never ending supply of cash at the moment. Buy the red, sell at 3-5%+ raise, rinse and repeat..... 
0	1523258955	6	We all see green and get a little optimism. I like that. But is it for the long term or do people just want to dump their bags?
1	1523261034	7	I feel like there’s been a lot of positive news lately. Big names and orgs getting into crypto and showing bullishness. Of course we could go lower but we look to be breaking out of the trendlines. 
1	1523260074	4	I think dumping is getting fatigue at this point lol 
1	1523260043	1	its a proven fact that in the long term, people been wanting to dump their bags. It's been like this. It's an endless repetitive cycle.
2	1523261486	2	Those January bags are heavy 
0	1523261203	6	380000 sellwall on ICX. That's fun.
0	1523269139	6	And there it is
0	1523282728	6	These pump and dumps are just to rekt shorts and longs
1	1523283077	9	Nah they're to rekt people looking at them. Use heisenberg's prinicple, stop checking the price for it to make movements
0	1523288958	5	Bitfinex just approved my account I opened up end of November!
1	1523289548	2	Nice, i was doing the approval mid december, so it will happen for me as well soon!
0	1523271145	15	I love this reddit :) The prices go up a few % and everyone's as happy as can be, then the prices drop a few % and everyone's panicking again.
0	1523269334	9	staight up the anus
0	1523269354	10	Fuck this shit, 
0	1523278942	11	https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-04-09/yes-these-chickens-are-on-the-blockchainBloomberg just posted this article about the use of block chain technology for supermarkets and food safety. It mentions the benefits of blockchain.Also important to note that there is no mention of cryptocurrency at all. Users, especially on this sub, need to realize that blockchain advancements don't necessarily mean that public coins are the answer. I'm an investor in VeChain but it's important to be wary that many companies may decide to develop blockchain in house instead of using public cryptocurrency.
1	1523279777	6	Saw an IBM commercial the other day about using Blockchain to track the path of a coffee bean so you can verify where it originated from :)
0	1523258131	5	$7100, Soros Fund bonuses are in action
1	1523265030	1	What bollocks..people beleive anything.
0	1523269127	5	Ayy there it is
0	1523270924	6	Its been like this for a while now, we go up for couple days then we go down the same amount within couple hours, definitely not ready for a big uptrend yet.
0	1523278130	6	most these ppl from Oct-jan 2018 pumping Bitcoin and other coins on Twitter are nowhere to be found . they think by not talking about Bitcoin we have forgotten
1	1523278981	2	they're out in full force when it looks good though. not to be trusted.
0	1523294704	5	>I'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong... I basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes. - George SorosMaybe George finally realized ignoring crypto was a mistake.
1	1523295041	4	The fact that man can say anything coherent at this stage of his life is amazing.  Vampires.
0	1523297386	4	I dont know shit
1	1523297727	1	Bullshit - i bet you know how to bake a loaf of bread!
1	1523297732	1	none of us do...
1	1523297812	1	I'm with you. As a tangentially interested "mainstream" techie, I'm curious to see where crypto currency is going, the implications it has for the future of trade, and the evolution of blockchain in regards to security.  With no working knowledge of "the story so far", how would one determine if now is a good time to adopt cryptocurrency?
1	1523298084	1	Yes you do! But there will always be more to learn! I hate that, because there's always someone who knows better. But I am better to those who don't know yet. And that is pretty awesome :)
0	1523266532	14	The headlines will change very quickly after an >30% crypto market cap jump day.
0	1523269902	8	Pathetic. Just pathetic. How an instance is doing the same week by week and yet a lot of people fall into this trap by having stop loss orders and give them money. 
0	1523274063	9	I've watched this dumping happen so much since December it doesn't even affect me any more. In Jan shortly after entering the market  it was terrifying. Woke up this morning to green "this should last no longer than two hours." Thirty minutes later and * BAM * incredibly manipulated dump.It's like the boy who cried wolf except here it's 'The Whale who Cried the Death of Bitcoin'.
0	1523262214	12	Mmm 3 green days in a row? bullish news? are we seeing the start of a little uptrend here? is spring really in the air? what do you guys think?
0	1523291166	19	So Rolf Werner, head of Fujitsu EU, joins the IOTA foundation and a mod removes the post.OMG!😭Can't believe ~~I won~~ how good the front page is ! Thank you ~~Walton~~ mod team ! ❤️ keep doing the great work. 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻🚀🚀🚀
1	1523291224	6	upvote for solid edit job.
1	1523291509	3	I mean, I am a huge IOTA fan, but the mods DID announce rule changes prohibiting that exact type of post a few weeks ago sooooo...
2	1523291719	4	I mean to highlight why I think this rule is a bad decision. I have disagreements about the # cap on posts for any single currency as well.
0	1523273003	9	Panic and fear are stronger emotions than hope.
0	1523259449	4	Question: if you had 5k today to invest into some bags, what coins do you sink your money into? And why? (If you have time) Mid to long term investments. Really interested to see what you all think. Cheers! 
1	1523262060	8	OMG. Stellar team and advisors. Nice organic growth the last few days. Massive next quarter. Hit their milestones when they said they would.  Great community. Very welcoming. Should see enormous growth this year and bigger again next year. Oh and you will be able to earn from staking. Need I go on. :)
1	1523264632	3	BTC, ETH mainly (80%) and maybe 1 or 2 alts. "Safest" bets and later on you can buy/swap more alts if you did your research. Gl
1	1523263866	2	BNB - Binance is a joy to use, great customer service, secure (ish) and they're getting the fuck out of China. (Fiat onramp, extended market data, DEX.) the exchange race is theirs to lose.ETH - A growing market will encourage ICOs while this bear market discourages new projects from launching and makes teams want to liquidate their launch ETH. I have a feeling the SEC will create guidelines for legal regulated ICOs to encourage American projects to launch, and investors love American companys. Meanwhile existing projects will start meeting goals and finding success which will encourage more ERC20 launches.I have a feeling XMR is due for a rebound. ASIC resistance is important and their hardfork went beautifully.
1	1523261072	6	TRAC
1	1523262785	3	OMG, ETH, LINK, ARK, REQ, ENG
1	1523260325	2	XLM, BTC, NEO
1	1523262817	2	At the moment, nothing, until the market decides which way it will go.
1	1523260352	2	Probably nothing at this point. Wait till the market makes a decisive move in either direction, I'm not buying until I see stability for consecutive weeks instead of 2-3 days.
1	1523262260	1	I would invest in chainlink, im a shill so im biased ill tell u that, but decentralized oracles are gonna be big this year.
1	1523269879	1	DYOR. But also check out ELA. 
1	1523269945	1	ICX, BNB and ETH for me, maybe with a bet on POE. ICX has really strong fundementals, a good team actually delivering and not so much hype. 
0	1523264878	5	Regarding GDAX, do Stop-Limit orders to sell actually work as intended?I was suspicious and I watched one yesterday. I had the Trigger set for €5711 and the Limit set for €5674. As the price went up to the Limit, the order Filled. Which I did not want to happen.It didn't bypass, as I would've imagined, the Limit and wait for the price to hit the Trigger that then Fill at the Limit. Thereby not stopping my loss.It seems that they just work as Limit Orders, as the trigger doesn't seem to wait.None of this is specified in the documentation: https://support.gdax.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2426596-entering-market-limit-stop-orders
1	1523268153	1	Stop limit sells work in opposite direction of limit sells. Trigger is where you want the limit sell to activate, limit is the very lowest you will allow it to be  sold for. If there is liquidity at your stop amount it will sell there, if there is slippage you will market sell until your limit
2	1523269968	1	Yes, but my order triggered straight away at €5674, it didn't wait until the Trigger Price to place the Limit.I'll need to capture a video of my placing the Stop Order and it just Filling without reaching the Trigger Price.
3	1523270569	2	 That doesn't make sense, the trigger should be higher than the limit 
4	1523271265	1	> Trigger set for €5711 and the Limit set for €5674That is what I had. Hence me asking the question.
5	1523271949	2	You are mistaking what a stop limit sell is for. It for one direction, price going down. You are correct that in this case it functions as a regular limit since once the price is between your limit and stop price it is activatedAfaik you cannot set a stop moving upward to trigger a lower sell limit. You can set a bit stop limit that way though

0	1523269499	4	Bad news: Bitcoin dumped and took all alts with it.Good news: It had some decent volume, so volume is back!
1	1523269554	5	thought you were joking, checked, you were not
0	1523270002	4	Whole Crypto market on multiple charts https://www.cryptomarketsite.com
0	1523273065	3	I blame Banano! 
0	1523273118	4	Its not the end of the world, bullish divergence on the daily btc chart, also unlikely to go heavily oversold without a decent recovery first.
0	1523277765	3	Charts looks like it’s beginning a sideways movement (or another dip). Could be a sign of stagnation in price which is a good sign of the bear getting sleepy
1	1523277904	2	after a dump, often when theres a bit of sideways and not a rather fast counter reaction then the likelihood of further dumping is increased
2	1523278445	2	Seems like 6,700 dollars is the stable price of BTC so far with 395 dollars for ETH. I guess it’s safe to say now is the accumulation phase. Next up a mini mark-up.
3	1523279365	2	its not safe, wait for volume to pick up on the buy side. There's more down until volume starts increasing. Decreasing volume is a huge indicator for more down
0	1523286815	5	Wish i was asian

0	1523288748	4	I’ve been holding NEO and NANO without keeping up for a couple months. I popped in today to find out January was just the beginning of the flop. No rebound yet? Anything worth noting? Why so lowwwww?
1	1523288818	12	BTC and BCH got into a nasty fight, BCH broke up with BTC...BTC od'd on cryptocaine and has been in and out of rehab since.  It's awful man.
0	1523293694	4	I wonder if cruise missiles will incite a bull run?  
0	1523262890	8	Everyone selling alts and fomo eth?
1	1523264747	9	Def not, holding onto my NEO for dear life.
2	1523265826	4	Neo is Life 
0	1523264400	8	ETH reversal, finally
1	1523265436	7	Eth drops: alts drop even more  Eth raises: people sell alts for eth and they   drop  Ffs
2	1523266352	8	95% of tokens are near-worthless.The security of $Billions of tokenized securities/tokens atop the Ethereum protocol rest on the value of ETH long term (Proof of Stake). ETH is the consistent truth.
3	1523267007	2	Preach!
1	1523264573	5	Bunch of stop loss on eth pairs are being triggered. This run will go for awhile but will bleed all other alts dry. Same effect as bitcoin run.
1	1523264963	5	i bought some eth at $380, not regretting it yet
0	1523295371	9	- VERGE --> Top 20 and pumping like a contender to the throne- NANO --> Out of Top 20 and dumping like a scamCrypto is bizarro land.  
1	1523295677	4	I'm a simple man, I buy when everyone dumps. Waiting to buy a ton of NANO at 4.70 (if it even gets there). 
1	1523295448	2	Crypto is a crazy place.
0	1523279536	13	TAs are worthless bullshit for crypto market. I think I have to make a tattoo on my forehead to remember about it...
1	1523279699	2	I don't know what TA you are looking at, but the 1hr and 4hr TDI were way high, and volume was going insane, the kind of volume that happens when we hit a bottom or top and are about to reverse.Oscillators don't really mean shit though, RSI can be bottomed out or topped out for months
1	1523279749	2	You know what you signed up for when you entered the crypto market. 
0	1523272361	7	I was swing trading and making some small profits for the past few days. Then I decided to buy BTC at 7k thinking this is organic pump. Lel. 
1	1523272547	1	I am also trying swing trading so interested in other views/reason,. why did you think its organic? volume is low AF. 
0	1523274385	6	Suddenly I am glad my paycheck didn't arrive this morning, otherwise I would probably fomoed in. I am idiot.
0	1523289837	6	Holy shit philakone just tweeted that altone crypto has hired thugs to hack him
0	1523290245	7	Man, the Great War of WTC shills vs. VEN shills is reaching new heights today. 
1	1523290644	5	It's actually sad seeing so many FUD posts tbh. Just pathetic people all around
1	1523290447	11	I mean, it's not much of a war tbh. WTC has nothing on VEN. 
0	1523297182	5	If people still think Vechain is a scam then I don't know what to tell you.
1	1523297638	1	There are a lot of fud brigades for ven here
0	1523286266	19	Seems like VeChain has began working with LVMH (Louis Vuitton).Impressive partnership.
1	1523286606	3	We're going to the outer space, well dressed.

3	1523287202	0	But at least those are posh bags !!
4	1523287326	3	And real and not a fake. We will be the carrying our money to the moon in the real deal 
1	1523287516	2	stylish crypto
0	1523262226	3	Is this organic growth? I know this has been happening again and again and we have been going up and then down but many sources are saying that institutional money is getting in now. Datadash suggested to buy yesterday. Also saw this tweet by another favourite youtuber of mine.https://twitter.com/carterthomas/status/983106735215804417Not trying to shill or anything, what do you guys think?
1	1523262351	10	Check out the Ethereum developer community growth. It's hasn't slowed one bit.That's what counts.
2	1523262643	2	Developer sentiment > price sentiment
3	1523266122	1	This.
4	1523266125	1	That.
1	1523263819	6	I think institutional money has been in. It’s like if the price drops enough, it scares everybody away or you got people down 85-90 percent. Institutional money gobbles all the low prices up and keeps it down for a while. Some people can’t take it, bought high/Sold low and got out.  Some people cant stand that loss, so they’re basically being forced to hodl and are planning on selling if they get anywhere near even. But once people do break even, what percentage of those are willing to keep playing the game? Now that they’ve got their money back, it becomes scared money. Some will call it quits for good. And then some will wait for the dump because “It always dumps”. But why would it? The institutional money would own the whole bottom by then wouldn’t they? Only the hodlers would survive. Idk if my logic is flawed but that’s how I see it. 
0	1523262747	3	Are we finally out of the woods?
1	1523263868	6	Nope.
0	1523266407	3	Gotta love LiveCoinWatch's Ethereum glitch... up 85% in last hour.
1	1523266464	6	as someone who's on the sidelines, this shit scares me
2	1523266482	1	Why is that?
3	1523266502	5	FOMO my friend
4	1523266552	6	ETH is a no brainer, it will get back to over $1000 by the end of the year.
5	1523267896	2	i agree. we practically saw the future in January and at these prices count me in.
1	1523275856	1	Aye I saw this haha. Went to take a screenshot but it quickly fixed itself

0	1523286458	6	LV
1	1523286572	2	Pump, with style.
1	1523287500	2	Louis Vuitton?
0	1523286039	5	I still think that most of the overly optimistic people during the pump are whales getting others excited and buying their bags. I also think that the pessimistic people during the dump are whales making people sell at a loss. It doesn’t make any sense to me how the last 4 months have been the same way and people still get excited about a two day pump and upset about the imminent dump. It’s literally been like that for a while. It must be whales catering the 600k+ users on this sub. 
1	1523286278	8	Fuck - he's on to us.
2	1523286572	5	Quick, hide under the bed.
3	1523287254	5	I sold it for crypto
0	1523297335	4	Friendly reminder....90% of the people on this sub are full of shit, including myself.

0	1523265121	9	What if you are all jumping back in ...the price of btc hits the high 7000s and then it bombs again? Not out of the woods yet. These sidelines are safe.
1	1523265965	4	Standing and sweating on the sidelines, so I hope you’re right. :D Last time I was celebrating till 7500, then it crashed hard.
2	1523277485	2	Yep I'm literally happy waiting in no man's land. If it goes down great . If not we'll I've done well so far I can afford the knock . Good luck to you and all 
1	1523267818	3	you know the market won't stay down forever, good luck trying to time a re-entry without missing the ride.
1	1523266357	4	See you at 10k
0	1523274452	12	HODL!!!
0	1523258716	3	Is there any help out there for crypto addiction?Had a 225/1 bet come in on the Footy on Saturday and before I’d even received the winnings I’d converted it into how many Nano I could buy! 
1	1523259034	4	isnt the devs for nano getting sued?
2	1523259095	1	Yep and if this market has taught me anything it means buy :-)
3	1523264200	2	Boy you think the NANO team has class action lawsuit money? They told Nano holders that their money was safe on Bitgrail, so they might actually have a case.Sadly you're probably right I wouldn't be surprised to see it pump for the next week.
4	1523271545	1	Not their fault an exchange exit scammed. It's like blaming MasterCard because you shopped at a weird store and the owner stole your creds. Everyone knew back then it was the equivalent of buying from a dude in an alley and they chose to still give him money and not remove their property from the exchange
4	1523272920	1	While I don't think the dev team should be liable people have won law suits that have been far more ridiculous. That said. I'd still pick up some $5 NANO if I had spare money.
0	1523263333	4	I need to ask a question as a hodler and not really a trader: I want to change some % on my portfolio regarding my altcoins, but everything right now is in the red with as USD value lower than when I bought in. BUT the sats value is higher. Which means if I sell some of those altcoins I would still make a profit, right? I don't really care about the USD value right now because I just need to sell some alts for BTC, then buy some other alts with BTC. I don't want to sell at a loss but considering I'd be selling at higher sats I'm not selling at a loss, right?
1	1523263519	9	Technically correct. Satoshi value is currently used to value altcoins and how strong they are to bitcoin. You effectively own a bigger amount of bitcoin. But since bitcoin is down it's down in USD value
2	1523263658	3	Thanks!
0	1523278171	4	Y'all Got Any More Of That marketcap? 
1	1523278801	2	You might find some in the cracks of all the forgotten wallet keys, enough to scrape up for just one pump man!
0	1523287023	4	do you guys think we will ever see 10k again?
1	1523287957	6	of course....this happens every year
1	1523287383	8	of course
1	1523287863	5	> do you guys think we will ever see 10k again?Considering - The USD global currency is printing money like toilet paper- Incompetent economic policies will destroy a lot of currencies from time to time- Bitcoin is slowly improving itself as a payment infrastructure - More people know of Bitcoin thus network effect- People are becoming more technical combined with crypto is going to become more user friendly..- and there is only 21 Million Bitcoin and halvening in 2020 will cut rewards in halfProbably a decent chance of 20K in the next few years.  
1	1523287120	2	Go on trading view they have history charts there
1	1523287294	2	With futures in play, it's tough to say. I don't trust any of the central planners. They are criminals in suits. 
1	1523287508	4	Nah, Soros and Rockefeller VC got in to make 30% gains. /s
1	1523287380	4	[removed]
2	1523287437	3	it's funny. I'm probably going to end up holding all my coins a year after all of this, and likely *only* have to pay the 15% capital gains tax in the US after I sell. 
1	1523287097	2	We will see 20k again, maybe not as fast as people would like but when it happens you'll want to be on board.
2	1523287233	3	I'm a hodler, unfortunately, so I still have everything I bought in August. I'm just waiting for the market to get out of this zombie state, but it never seems like it will. 
3	1523287475	3	Yeah it could go lower but when the market shifts the next bull run could be the last major run before crypto is regulated to accredited investors. Believe me the banks are going to try and control this and they want to shake us out before the next run.
4	1523287913	2	Interesting. Never thought of that 
0	1523290069	4	Fuck sake

0	1523257051	4	Are we out of it yet? or are we looking at another 10-20% dip
1	1523258434	8	No one knows man. Everyone will tell you what they want to happen and state it as fact.I'm not tethered so btc is definitely going to 25k by tomorrow 
1	1523258152	5	Money on the sidelines waiting for 3-5k could fomo back in soon if 7k continues to hold
0	1523277618	6	It’s down 3.7%, calm down.  Yes the change happened quickly but that doesn’t really affect you.  You aren’t stupid enough to be margin trading still in this manipulated market are you?  You basically have no tools at your disposal (unless you have the ability to market sell 12.5k BTC) to determine where the price is going, you are at a slot machine pulling a lever.  The first step is admitting that to yourself.
0	1523280622	5	when are you going to learn you're being played by whales hoping to milk a profit from your hopium

0	1523296041	5	Listen.The bull market is here, believe it or not. The price is being supressed as we obviously saw in that flash crash. Someone is trying to shake you out. If you have been through what ive been through, hang in a little longer. End of the rainbow will be reached, soon. 
1	1523297305	5	Cool story bro........talk to me in a few weeks when BTC is under 5k. This bear market is nowhere close to the finish line. Simply fooling people into thinking the worst is over. There is absolutely no demand whatsoever from people not already in this space.

1	1523270564	17	It's more that it set us back 2 days, in about 2 min. Not so cool
2	1523270713	6	One whale with too much btc messing with us. His btc are now more evenly distributed and will cause less stress on the market in the long term
3	1523271238	5	the opposite is true. large addresses have actually been accumulating more in this bear. 
3	1523270817	3	Yea I don't disagree. It's just that the ICX that I own always shits the bed harder than btc whenever it drops, making me highly annoyed with ICX right now. 
4	1523271028	2	Know the feels. Think NANO just broke all time low with this one 
5	1523271168	2	Yea. I noticed its becoming more profitable to just go after pumps instead of holding the coins you actually like. I held ICX for a long time and everytime it shit the bed. Went all in on a variety of pumps last week made 40%. Holding again now and I see the downtrend again. Interesting phenomenon :(
0	1523281191	6	I'm thinking we have one more dip down (btc < $6k), then I'm gonna buy back in :)WHALES, HAVE YOU HEARD ME
1	1523283586	6	Yup I think we still have to hang around 6,5k for a bit longer for wealthy People to accumulate and the remaning weak hands to sell 
1	1523281751	5	I think you are right ~ dip a little below 6k and then the reversal happens ~ 50k by end of year.
1	1523281478	3	isn't 6k a pretty strong support?
0	1523273440	4	German media throws 4k$ as "rumors" for the BTC bottom AND a good price to get in. sentiment is slowly changing
1	1523273842	7	Wouldn't german media talk about euro price rather than dollar price?
1	1523273566	1	where?
2	1523273696	1	n-tv has video on the price 
0	1523275498	5	I just think it's funny to see that so many people are complaining about manipulation, eventhough the entire run towards 20k wouldn't have happened without manipulation. 
1	1523275562	10	Manipulation is fine to people if they're making gains from it. 
2	1523275836	9	I know, but it's still funny to see. It's like people only think that manipulation is going on when prices are going down, but in reality, manipulation is going on constantly.

0	1523288910	5	Not shilling anything here - but just wondering what peoples thoughts are about oracles in crypto? Everyone talks about mass adoption but we never discuss the use case of decentralised oracles, everyone seems to have a hard-on for supply chain tokens instead :/ Edit: Not shilling things and trying to promote discussion = downvotes? Makes sense.
1	1523290778	3	I'm wondering how they'd work? I mean oracles seem like a necessity for some things that cannot be solely managed in a smart contract (results of a football match for example).You can't expect every oracle to provide data on every event (you might want some oracles that do Sports scores, some that do FX rates etc etc)... how do you manage all those actors to make sure they tell the truth? You'd have to have a concensus mechanism like forging blocks, but then how do you ensure you ask only oracles that have the answer? Does every question go to ALL oracles (regardless of type)? They could then answer "No idea" / "Here's the answer" and then you check the ones that answer vs each other to ensure that > some %age match each other. You'd need to make sure you had a certain amount of oracles for the same questions before being able to use them on the network...Also how do those oracles operate automatically? They'd need feeds from other external sources but I guess that'd be up to the operators of the oracles to ensure they had real time info etc.I'm pretty interested in how they'll get implemented in any blockchain tbh
2	1523293615	2	Very good questions!A few different concepts that we'll have to break down in order to answer everything thoroughly. First, how data is obtained externally. Some APIs are open, meaning it accepts anonymous requests, so technically _any_ oracle node _could_ be tasked with retrieving that data (we'll get into node selection in a bit). For APIs that require authentication, we offload that to external adapters. External adapters may be written in any language, they only need to conform to how the Chainlink node communicates with them. When data is requested from a source that's only available via external adapters (for example, you need an API key to access the data), only those nodes with the adapters would be able to accept the request. That would be done automatically, but the act of _adding_ them to the node would be a one-time manual task carried out by the node operator, per adapter.Validating that nodes are honest is done by comparing each answer against its peers. Contract creators may require nodes to place a deposit (in LINK) on jobs that the node would get back as long as their data was accepted, or lose if not. In addition, nodes would be paid (in LINK) for returning acceptable data, and not paid if their data isn't accepted. We'll have a few different aggregating contracts on-chain that will be used to form the answer back to the consuming contract. This is necessary because not all data is the same, and even data of the same type shouldn't always be _treated_ the same (averaging vs. threshold).We also have a reputation system where there can be multiple reputation providers. This is so that reputation isn't centrally concentrated on a single contract. On-chain, reputation providers would track the metrics in our [white paper](https://link.smartcontract.com/whitepaper), page 18. Off-chain, they're free to validate node operator's identities, provide listing services, etc. Though a reputation provider isn't required to do anything off-chain.Now the SLA process, which is what the contract creator (or consuming contract, as I'll sometimes call it) specifies for the data retrieval task (also called a Job) to be given to the nodes. When creating their contract, to get data from Chainlink nodes they'll specify:* The data they want* The number of nodes to use* The reputation contract to use* The aggregation contract to use* How much they'll pay (in LINK)* (Optional) Penalty feeThis request goes to our order-matching contract, which nodes will be "listening" to for events. When they see a request for data that they could fulfill, they'll indicate so, knowing what the payout would be, reputation contract is used, and penalty fee is required. Of those nodes that have indicated that they would take the job, their reputation would be checked against the given reputation provider, excluding any nodes that don't meet the reputation requirements of that provider. Finally, the number of nodes specified by the contract creator are randomly selected to fulfill the request.Nodes will return results to the aggregation contract, where the answers will be compared to their peers and the reputation contract will be updated. And the final result is returned to the consuming contract. This got a bit long, but hopefully that addresses all of your questions. Feel free to ask away if you have more.

0	1523281747	3	Does anyone have some kind of theory on why ICX has performed so poorly in this market for the past few months? Is it their lack of communication?
1	1523284127	4	ICX is past the speculation phase and is now in the put up or shut up and be adopted phase after mainnet release.  This [phase is death](https://medium.com/@cburniske/the-crypto-j-curve-be5fdddafa26) for the price of most cryptos.
1	1523284126	3	There are too many platform coins that went way too high in irrationally exuberant period.  When sober, people start to realize that the vast majority of them will need to disappear and maybe only one or two of them will actually see any real adoption in the next year.  People aren't going to speculate like that anymore.  Coins that can perform now are what the market will reward 2018.
1	1523282213	6	That’s a big part of it. I think it’s a combination of: missing deadlines, then leaving everyone in the dust as to why (shit communications), poor marketing (do Korean retail buyers even know about it?), and overall market sentiment. My strategy on ICX has been to accumulate a decent bag, then using a third of that to swing trades when it pumps and dumps. To the people who don’t have a lot of experience in this space: don’t let social media influence you. Hodling everything is a meme. Contrary to the YouTube/twitter shills, there is no nobility in turning $10 to $1. That’s how you end up homeless. Accumulate gradually by averaging in—and learn how to trade on swings!

2	1523282440	3	No problem. Also my favorite longterm hold as well. Hopefully we get a chance to swing trade for profits or build on our stacks

2	1523280372	2	one of the most unprofessional? theres literally thousands of cryptos but this top 20 coin is the worst. okay
3	1523280939	3	Dude we just watched a shitcoin go 200% whose leads went to jail after shutting their operation down and trying to evade authorities. Current valuation means jack and shit in this market.  
3	1523281991	2	You’re definitely right here. Not as bad as the era of premined, litecoin cloned mene/shit coins. We used to line those in hopes in just hit exchanges so we could dump. This is a bad project, but not the worst.

0	1523262742	2	One increasingly prevalent thought is that AI will be conducting most blockchain computations/transactions in a decade or two.Too much business logic is left inactionable without turing complete optionality (which crypto's like Ethereum provide).And the scalability will be ready.Might not bode well for BCash/LTC etc. types  
1	1523264309	4	You do realize that turing completeness may equal more features but also MAXIMUM bugs and attack vectors that's why the bitcoin core devs told vitalik to piss off when he brought up the idea of eth to them. Money and turing completeness do not mix that's how fuck ups like the DAO hack, and the multisig parity disaster happen where people lose millions of freaking dollars. 
2	1523265263	2	Have you ever developed atop Ethereum/with solidity?You may not be familiar with the formally verified & audited standards now agreed upon for high $ mission critical contracts/components. (and they're rather simple yet extremely powerful.)Non-devs can't seem to differentiate between 'protocol attack surface' & a programmer's contract code object.

0	1523293065	2	What's your thought on nano? Think it's rise was just a one time hypetrain back in december and it's already seen it's prime or is there still something worth looking into?
1	1523293949	4	NANO is great, fantastic blockchain tech, and it would make a fantastic currency, but, it has no adoption, and is only used by NANO users to trade and HODLBitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are the only real options for currency adoption by the mainstreamI do however hope that NANO will find its niche in the future, maybe if crypto really takes off, it will even rival BitcoinBut it doesn't have any privacy features, which will i think will become extremity important 
2	1523294991	2	It not having privacy features is a plus imo. Privacy coins make for slow and expensive (relatively speaking) transactions. I'd rather use a privacy focused coin when I need to than use nano.
1	1523293847	3	I think the tech is the best out of any cryptos right now. It does need better marketing, though, so it might be a good long-term hold. I do hold some NANO, though so my review is a bit biased. I think good things are in it's future.
1	1523293769	2	It's one of the top contenders for the 'currency' segment. I do think we're far away from crypto being used as a widespread currency though due to all the volatility, so it could be a good while before it sees significant real world adoption.

0	1523259503	2	Just bought WTC. Did I dun goof?
1	1523259787	5	Maybe. It's been going down quite a bit compared to the market so in that sense it's a good idea.  I also think the things that happened with WTC will be forgotten eventually, it's already been proven over and over again that the masses have no long term memory. If WTC picks it back up and delivers on their roadmap I think you'll be fine.  I hold no WTC.
1	1523261505	7	Buy when there is blood in the streets.WTC has one of the best fundamentals in the game, plus one of the lowest valuation in comparison right now. I'm certain it was the right choice
2	1523264379	1	when the blood has dried in the streets....then you buy
1	1523259695	2	Nope.  In this market buy the coins that have dumped for ages and give it a chance to go on a run.  Wtc and Nano look like good bets to me atm.  Just watch Btc like a hawk.  It could dump at any moment I feel. 
2	1523269841	2	Wow, BTC dumped right after this comment, who sells your crystall orbs? 
3	1523271106	1	Lol it'd been slowly rising on pathetic volumes and felt due for one of its steep step like dumps.  Pure luck on the timing... no orb sadly :(  
1	1523267721	1	you're asking the wrong people.
0	1523255985	2	Guys, I tethered. Can anyone call the bogs to dump? 
1	1523256925	6	Just called, he is stuck in traffic.
1	1523256221	2	I am predicting downvote on this post but surprisingly the tether volume is going up. 
0	1523283116	3	in terms of ratio, are y'all buying VEN with ETH or BTC right now? because the VEN/ETH ratio seems to spike every month or so, and hasn't done its typical drop in quite awhile 
1	1523283537	3	Ive moved on from using Eth as a pair. It doesnt rebound as well as BTC and drops just as hard. 
2	1523283823	2	so currently BTC? what's the ETH/BTC ratio doing these days, i haven't even paid attention. i would have to go ETH -> BTC to use BTC 
3	1523284093	2	just stick with btc, since that is what the market is pegged against

1	1523266196	5	There will be an uptrend in Ethereum hashpower pre-PoS.If Ethereum wasn't moving to PoS (like Monero), the impetus would be there to prevent mining centralization.Ethereum GPU miners who will lose a portion of profitability are a vocal minority.&nbsp;"In Ethereum, Bitmain doesn't control the protocol.
