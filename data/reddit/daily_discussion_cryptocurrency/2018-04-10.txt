0	1523356739	19	i am here on a hourly basis and every week is happening the same, what am i doing with my life?
1	1523357617	7	https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/
1	1523358671	10	like me, you think the next bull run will only last for 10 minutes and you dont want to miss out
0	1523374938	17	People buying ont and xvg right now = "crypto is dead" people in a week
0	1523365557	33	The rich will remain rich while the poor will buy bitcoin at $20K and not at $6K.
1	1523366328	4	What's your solution to end the poor problem of buying BTC at 20k?
2	1523366674	12	If you bought BTC at 20K just buy 100 more at 6700. Then you would only need BTC to be 6830 for you to break even. Easy peasy!
3	1523368090	1	Listen to this man if you're poor.
2	1523366489	6	Buy the fundamentals not the TA. Lower your average buying price if you have a chance like now. Can't wait to see comments filled with regret in a few months. Crypto will never die.
3	1523367483	1	Fundamentals for say BTC have been pretty much the same over the years, while price has had wild swings, so how do you determine if price is high or low based on the fundamentals?
4	1523367812	1	Putting an end to millenia of financial slavery to the state and it's banks is invaluable. Fundamentals are not the same. There is constant development.
3	1523368143	1	TA is only good for quick money (and crypto TA isn't always that great for that).   I agree - crypto isn't going anywhere....See you at the crossroads.
0	1523343209	62	It sure is taking a long time to get rich quick.
1	1523346433	12	Wait. They told me we're here for the tech.
2	1523366779	5	Yea all the tech gadgets you can buy when you're rich.
1	1523344459	7	People are getting rekt instead of rich... I guess I'll follow the get rich slowly method 
0	1523374083	15	Thank me later but last night i emailed a few billionaires and told them to put a min of 500 million into bitcoin. 
1	1523374525	1	I'll thank you now
0	1523351631	8	More than 70% all marketcap is with Asia people... the ocident people, like me, are introducing to cryptos recently... I can read all day in USA news, and blogs, too much new investors still will join. In 2018 the world talk about regulamentation like never before. We are in progress and in maturation. All we need is patience to wait the grow. I follow blog, news and analyzes of experts in Brazil and the United States and I am verifying that in these last days they are all arriving at the consensus that the end of the falls is next, for several different reasons. I believe in these analyzes because they are professionals who have made the predictions and past analyzes that I follow. I'm optimistic for 2018
1	1523362068	2	u wot m8
1	1523375863	1	Not to rain on your parade bud, I understand English is not your first language, but a quick spell-check never hurt anyone :)
0	1523363762	9	[How much things can change in 3 months](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20180107/)
1	1523364085	1	Ripple #2, VEN #37, NEM #7, BCC #24
2	1523367176	1	Forget the rankings those prices thoughVEN @ 37  but $4.70 aughhhhhhh
3	1523368297	1	Well you gotta put things in perspective right, it's nowhere near 4,70 anymore but considering it gained ~20 spots there's at least 20 coins in the top 40 that suffered more than VEN did.
2	1523367755	1	lmoa BCC 24, it's 410 now :D
0	1523371815	10	So everyone is pretty much bouncing between ONT and NEO at the moment? Is this the smart economy ecosystem OnChain has been touting? 
1	1523373847	4	I've been pretty much swimming against the current..Few days ago people were selling ONT (probably to buy NEO)... I was buying ONT :P
2	1523374929	3	Me too, right on
0	1523376372	9	Cant wait for new bullrun, getting money from my fund to invest in eth hope it doesnt explode for a week or so
0	1523384284	8	Got tf out of XVG during this pump. Grateful I even got the chance to wipe away that bad decision. 
1	1523384508	3	You wont regret it. Certainly not in the long term.
0	1523349261	53	#Yes ok, I‚Äôll admit it. When crypto was in its mega hype stage I did think BTC was just going to continue climbing to 100k within pretty quick succession and make me a millionaire from a few grand.Yes ok, I did believe that old fucker about bitcoin going to $1million without this huge breakdown in sentiment.Yes ok, I did enter on the way up thinking it was just going to be easy money, so I could later tell all my niggaz that I‚Äôm the big cock of the gang now and for them to follow me and my money earning wisdom.Yes ok, I did think I was going to buy a huge property before 2019 and throw parties every night with my niggaz, all of them worshipping me at my feet for my new found coolness and wealth.Yes ok, I did think I was going to be driving around in a Lambo (fully blacked out, huge alloys, more fucking pimp than the batmobile)Yes ok, I did think bitches were going to be lusting after me, creaming between their knees, begging to be apart of my crypto party empire (more than that bitch Bilzerian)Yes ok, I did think I was going to put Bob Marley to shame and smoke the finest green money could buy all.day.long (when you arrived at my mansion and opened the door you‚Äôd be first greeted by a huge puff of smoke coming out the huge door with me appearing behind that smoke dressed like a pimp putting on a chilled out gangster voice saying ‚Äúcome right in my nigga, come in‚Äù).But no. I‚Äôm sat here in fucking 80% drawdown with my dreams smashed.Yes ok, I am bitter now. 
1	1523351225	20	**initiate the pump, he confessed**
1	1523351616	7	Sit tight son, Rome wasn't built in a day
1	1523351297	5	i feel you baby
1	1523350901	4	But did you die?
2	1523351966	3	I prefer to lose it all but at least i tried to do something different! 
1	1523352149	1	U need to visit these fking bad and boring parties where you by far the oldest and wish yourself asleep at home - to learn to love the good and juicy ones :) 
0	1523354014	21	bulls are back boys, btc gained 1 $
1	1523354502	8	Natural organic growth because of mass adoption
1	1523354584	7	this is good for bitcoin
1	1523354264	3	aaaand down 3$
2	1523369840	1	Bear trap!
1	1523356556	1	Its whas me... I bought 0.005 BTC and the price jump 1 dollar
1	1523368426	1	wat?
0	1523361970	14	All this negativity... Stop worrying, the future is going to be bright guys. üòé
1	1523363380	13	Emoji wearing sunglasses, bright future confirmed.
0	1523385043	7	C‚Äômon guys I remember the last 2 day bull run of a week ago and I‚Äôm still about 10% down.To quote the words of the great Mr Wolf ‚Äú let‚Äôs not start sucking each other‚Äôs dicks just yet gentlemen‚Äù
1	1523385649	2	Too lategagphlhph
2	1523386855	2	Hmmm *nice*
0	1523385104	7	This pump actually feels very organic. Money is flowing back. Hold on to your shitcoins. Winter is over.
1	1523385354	6	This pump is grass fed, free range and gluten free.
0	1523362631	21	Confused why so many people on this sub are so concerned with day-to-day price activity. If you're here to day trade, you should be happy when the price is volatile. If you're here to invest in disruptive technology, then you shouldn't bother looking at the price until you're buying coffee with REQ or NANO, or paying highway tolls with IOTA, or eating avocado toast tracked by VEN, etc, etc...To put it another way, the price of BTC today or tomorrow doesn't change the codebase of BTC core. The technology and use case(s) remain.
1	1523363060	14	It seems most people here are from the Dec/Jan hype and are actually down quite a lot of money. They're neither day-traders or long term investors, they just want their money back and maybe a bit more. 
1	1523363730	8	People are obsessed with the value displayed in their Blockfolio and Delta, I think to their own detriment.
1	1523362720	5	git rich quick without understanding why or how.
2	1523362726	18	    git: 'rich' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
3	1523362948	6	Bad bot. Git rich is the only command.
1	1523362789	3	Dude, I am stealing your comment.. love it
1	1523369704	1	Everyone knows this, yet they still do it.  People chase emotion over reason.  The divorce rate in the US is a perfect example.
0	1523367011	28	Final portfolio for 2-4 year hold:45% BTC20% ETH20% NEO12% OMG3% NANOI realize none of these are going to moon most likely, but I‚Äôm just hoping to see 2-3x gains over the next few years or so which would beat anything I could do in the stock market.
1	1523367125	2	That's solid
1	1523367963	2	The only thing I would recommend is that when the next bullrun happens, it's very likely it will follow previous ones. BTC may rise first, then taper off. So once it looks like BTC is going sideways, it's likely that another alt season is starting up, and you may want to move some of that 45% BTC position into the alts.
1	1523369691	2	personally i would switch a few % from BTC to high risk / high reward projects like ADA/XLM/IOTA. Also a few % in XMR, because its the only coin which is actually used for something
1	1523368155	1	You should really consider buying at least one sub 200mil marketcap coin.Why settle for 3x gains?
1	1523368285	1	it will be a bit more than just 2-3x over the next few years
1	1523368337	1	I would diversify further.  Many of those could fail completely and wreck your portfolio.Some good info here-http://www.bsic.it/markowitz-walk-crypto-land-modern-assets-modern-portfolios/
1	1523368342	1	This looks pretty good for a hold that long tbh. Well done.
1	1523368760	1	Considering your expectations ~  I doubt you will be disappointed.   
1	1523368837	1	Nice I like investing in the lower risk coins as well but my portfolio has a little more risk but more upside. My 2-10 year old is Ven, Neo, Omg, and Bnb. 
1	1523368871	1	Why no litecoin? 
1	1523369258	1	Great picks, very safe.  I'd add a tiny amount in a moonshot coin.
1	1523369367	1	Hope is not a plan.  Speculating in a negative sum game is gambling at best.  The average market participant will lose money.  What makes you think you aren't the sheep to be slaughtered?
1	1523369465	1	not bad
1	1523369630	1	As long as the gains are sustainable
1	1523370182	1	Seems like a very safe portfolio. No interest in throwing <5% on a moonshot? 
1	1523370252	1	they might moon man.
1	1523371517	1	Depends when you got in the market. 
1	1523371749	1	i feel like all of these (maybe besides btc) have the potential to moon and 2-3x gains is extremely conservative. solid portfolio. 
1	1523372077	1	You're holding a good hand, friendo.
1	1523373266	1	2-4 Years is like 2 decades....
0	1523350230	6	So, if you were to say manipulate a crypto like XVG in a bear market and hypothetically make the price move  counter to logic. How would you do it? Also, let's say your grandpa, we'll call him Grandpa Hack also had a bunch and wanted to show way... Could it be done
1	1523361783	3	Market share. Have enough BTC to slowly buy a big enough market share in a coin that the sell books become thin. Spread FUD to get it as cheap as possible. Create sell walls that demoralize traders at low prices. Force the price down by painting the line. Shake out every weak hand in the market and break hidden stop orders. Then go on a shill spree. Pump it a bit which shouldn't take much since you own the market share. Shill your ass off. Spread it to whale groups that this coin is pumping.Finally, pump it hard and simultaneously start to dump a little on the FOMO crowd. Create small sell walls that they can destroy. Help them a little. Make them think it is going fucking insane and going to pump 200%-300%. Wait for a good "Fibonacci Elliot wave" location to fucking unload as they "try to break resistance."
0	1523381232	5	Verge just keeps climbing and climbing. Makes me want to dive in but I won't contribute to their bullshit.
1	1523381372	3	have felt the urge for a while now... just to ride a the cult wave.but i know once i buy in its going to tank 100%
0	1523342524	24	Im really sleepy right now and a little drunk but I just thought I would say I love you guys.Rant, Also dont worry if your holding or trading your coins, tokens or what have you, shorting or longing. It your strategy and no one else gets to change it. All the haters can STFU. You just keep doning what you were going to do.
1	1523348518	4	What a nice guy.
1	1523343347	2	Lol, thank you man. Go easy on the booze in these days.
0	1523355672	54	Vechain has news that makes the price jump 11% and the mods deleted all the posts about it. What the hell? What are they playing at?
1	1523357269	29	Welcome to IOTA's world...
1	1523360209	8	>Welcome to reddit, enjoy ur freedom... its why i visit biz allot, uncensored.
2	1523364602	1	biz?
3	1523365959	2	Probably 4chan /biz 
1	1523359826	13	They do/did the same to IOTA. 
1	1523358849	20	Yup. Vechain got a new partnership and mods just flat out deleted all posts about it. It was a purely factual thread too - just announcement. I'm inclined to believe some of the mods have an agenda or hold WTC.
2	1523363168	3	Oh yeah, when WTC had their Twitter gate there were 5+ posts on the front page and where were the mods then? These mods are weird as hell.
3	1523366502	2	Mods were filling bags on the dip haha 
1	1523362861	7	They did the same for REQ and PWC partnership and OMG and ShinhanCard.Please don't make this a solo VEN thing.
2	1523365159	6	Didn't mean to. Funny enough i didn't even know because i don't follow their subs. Looks like mod censorship works.
2	1523366425	7	Baked its an issue that has happened since the ban. Alot of solid content has been removed for weeks now. If it gets 5 upvotes in 1 minute it is deemed shilling and deleted. What is their issue with OMG?
3	1523367494	1	That's not it. There's a new rule here that states that partnership links can only be posted if the other company posts a statement about it.So in many cases the post gets deleted because there won't come a second statement.
2	1523364161	5	OMG and shinhan card???  What what what?  Partnership?  Can you give some details please and thanks?
3	1523364272	3	https://toshitimes.com/omisego-secures-partnership-with-shinhan-as-south-korean-banks-go-pro-crypto/
4	1523364653	2	Just read it ~ thanks again.   Any ideas on what this MOU will result in?
5	1523364733	2	Np :). A MOU is not an obligation but as I read that Shinhan is targetting the younger generations I do see them working full time with OMG in the future.
6	1523364855	1	Sounds interesting!
4	1523364496	1	Thanks gunna read now ~  i have a shinhan bank account and credit card and I hold OMG so I am dumbfounded that I missed this.
0	1523341474	4	How much heavier do my DBC bags need to get before they start to pay off? Bought at $.41. 
1	1523341717	3	About $0.350
0	1523370441	5	Boar market
1	1523373151	1	ManBearPig Market?
1	1523373793	1	Moose market..
0	1523375980	6	Wait can someone tell me whats going on with Verge? 
1	1523376404	11	They are going to announce a partnership with Amazon. Google is going to change its name to XVoogle. IRS is going to accept XVG as preferred method of crypto tax payment. Take your pick.
2	1523376521	2	Just fools running full speed towards a cliff with their 0.25 verge bags from January.
0	1523376854	4	So slow climb to 7300 and then dump in 30 seconds again?
0	1523382429	4	Bittrex allowed new users for a whole 25 minutes. Lmao
1	1523383090	2	Well the good news is they were rushed with so many people it crashed again.  People are still interested haha.  That being said, I'm glad I got into Bittrex last November.  I prefer Binance still.
0	1523386434	5	its odd, every move of a decent size seems to happen every 4 hours 
1	1523386924	2	mid march it was every 5.5hours  for 3 days straight.  
0	1523341668	8	GVT going for a plummet.
1	1523345664	2	$10 and I'll buy in again
2	1523345718	2	I bought in the other day, needless to say I'm not happy right now haha. 
0	1523350715	36	Did they really just remove all vechain threads again? Those mods are actually absurd
1	1523352547	19	you guys realize that the mods are probably children aswell? At best early 20's. This is reddit afterall. 
2	1523352801	5	Early 20's and bitconnect supporters ! Could be..
1	1523351970	26	Contacted one of em (LargeSnorlax) two days ago about what was going on with rawmidge, him deleting his posts etc. He replied that he would require screenshots to do anything because he doesn't have time to look into accounts like that himself.  Fair enough, I can understand that.  Yesterday I messaged him again, he responded by saying that RawMidge hasn't posted for 2 days and I'm wasting his time, ignoring the fact that he obviously deletes his own posts as previously pointed out.  Provided him with screenshots, asked him to at least make an effort not to reinforce the anti-VEN mod theory going around. LargeSnorlax ignored all the proof that he requested himself and told me not to contact him anymore.  Ridiculous and in sharp contrast with the deletionspree they went on during the ban.
1	1523351519	11	Yeah it's absurd,but in the end most of this sub are kids that don't actually bring any insight at all.
1	1523351625	9	They need to explain this
1	1523351312	13	Absurd is too soft.. They are morons ! Vechain plans to make 100+ partnership along 2018. If mods of this sub really think to remove all those news, they simply should not do this "hobby".
2	1523352277	4	I‚Äôm starting to feel like these mods wanted to force Ven into a payment of some kind and got rejected so now here we are
3	1523352685	5	Could be. Medium post could also not follow the guidelines but those mods also removed the LMVH source that was reported from third parts and LMVH themself (like users are pointing out on VEN subreddit too). 
4	1523362170	2	yeah they probably did the medium one on a technicality, despite eGrid adding the VeChain logo to their website also. Or maybe the post got 6 votes immediately then almost doubled a few minutes later and after almost a day (with 100+ comments and hundreds of upvotes), removed it under the guise of "brigading" due to those (less than) 12 votes? Like they did with a VeChain post which was big news a week or two back. 
5	1523363755	1	Well, mods just removed my post about LMVH Le maison du startup. A post from LMVH not Vechain. https://www.ceddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8b6gj3/lvmh_inaugurates_vechain_is_on_the_list_french/ Mods are crossing the line...
1	1523353769	7	lmao, lets just post them again
2	1523363721	3	As suspected ...Well, mods just removed my post about LMVH Le maison du startup. A post from LMVH not Vechain. https://www.ceddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8b6gj3/lvmh_inaugurates_vechain_is_on_the_list_french/ Mods are crossing the line...
0	1523341726	21	My wife still doesn't believe in me. Whatamagonnado????
1	1523344101	6	You just have to put $100 bills on her, you know right on her .... table.
2	1523372246	1	ja ja ja das real
1	1523344156	4	That‚Äôs the best this thread has to offer üëçüèªüëçüèª
1	1523346691	1	I'm surprised! 
0	1523383502	8	This XVG pump is absurd. Feels like all FOMO, but...you go, Verge community. I don't get it.NEO forming a cup and handle, GVT and ENG kinda due for a breakout too...we'll see. TA with crypto is so iffy.
1	1523383702	4	NEO on the 1hr, wow
1	1523384006	2	XVG is shedding the shitcoin label (or doing their best to) - brilliant website, marketing....Other shitcoins should take note if they want to pump.
0	1523363793	28	Well, mods just removed my post about LMVH Le maison du startup. A post from LMVH not Vechain. https://www.ceddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8b6gj3/lvmh_inaugurates_vechain_is_on_the_list_french/ Mods are crossing the line...
1	1523363994	15	I think mods owe us an answer on why they are deleting every thread related to Vechain. The new partnership thread was also deleted.
0	1523341879	4	Thoughts on INDIA coin that has been pumping hard for a few days now ?
1	1523344607	5	That's a strange coin... Tread carefully
2	1523347415	1	My thoughts as well. 
1	1523345137	3	Scams pump
1	1523352486	3	Since RBI banned crypto exchange, I think Indians are heavily investing into it to show their rebellion.
2	1523352707	1	That was along my lines of thinking as well. It is such a big market. The greedy me is fomoing. 
0	1523367500	4	Does anyone else suspect yesterday's insta-dump from $7176 to $6778 was an attempt to start a bear run, which this time looks to have failed? Could that be because all those prone to panic selling have finally left the market? Disclaimer: I have no investment or TA experience. 
1	1523372701	1	It is possible. It is harder to shake hands nowadays, I reckon.
0	1523368871	4	Despite being an obvious shit coin, suffered the mining exploits, and pulled out a ridiculous fork, and everyone knows the 16th Apr news is not going to as big as promised, XVG still moving up non-stop..... I have to give it to Verge Fam... They have the power to move market, we don't. 
1	1523375134	1	I heard they will partner with Jesus.
0	1523371330	3	Bullrun confirmed!~
0	1523372651	5	That crypto yardie song on spotify is awesome !
0	1523341243	12	Oyster is surely due another decent pump before the airdrop on Friday.
1	1523342870	5	Are KuCoin participating in the airdrop? 
2	1523343536	4	Yes. 
0	1523382383	10	I just went through a BTC reddit post from 6 years ago.. It was surprisingly uncomfortable (wish I joined then blah blah) but also funny: "I dont think it will go above $10 again".HODL doesn't mean for 2 or 3 months (*hello downvotes*). It is hodling for a year or even more. I could've made more money selling in Jan? Yes, but it is easy to look at the past and say: I wish I did that.One thing for sure, few years from now, I won't look back and say: **I wish I invested in Crypto**In the mean time, I hope that you are accumulating, same as I am doing :)Cheers! and **to the moon!** whatever your moon is, my internet friend.
1	1523383399	2	Most important quote to take from here is " I wont look back and say: I wish I invested in crypto." I always say to people who ask why I invest, the regret of losing √ó amount of dollars is way less concerning than the regret of not investing and missing the insane gains for being in the game early. 
0	1523353150	15	Maybe I should hit my head really, really hard so I'm the same IQ as an XVG holder as bizarrely they're the only ones making gains right now.

1	1523373933	6	bought yesterday... I buy twice a month.
1	1523373748	6	Bruh, I've been buying since last summer.
2	1523373864	1	You make regular buys based on price or dates? and what are you adding to in this current climate?
3	1523373949	6	price.  If i think something is lower than where it should be...i buy.  In the current climate, BTC, ETH and LTC.   My alt bags have been loaded since October and seen ATHs...profits skimmed and waiting for the next round of ATHs.
1	1523373903	4	Adding new fiat each week fam üëçüèª
1	1523374515	4	If I had money I'd still be buying.  This is just the beginning in my opinion.  People might spout gloom and doom but I bet we still see ATH this year.  When the bulls run again (whenever it happens), we will see FOMO backed by more government and big businesses (SEC was bullish, China looks like they are sniffing around again, SK had good news, Soros +Rockefeller and a lot of other big companies are investing).In the next few weeks I should have some extra FIAT and I will for sure buy more.
2	1523375643	4	It's nice to see some optimism here for once.
1	1523374136	3	Every month I buy a little more, that is why I don't really mind if the bear market lasts a little longer.  I have more time to accumulate at these prices.
1	1523373961	1	Will probably do so soon, but I haven't since the end of March. 
1	1523375080	1	Did you buy BTC or shitcoin?
2	1523375108	2	Definitely shitcoin.. with intent of trading it for more btc than I could have got by just buying btc.
0	1523385287	6	After being skeptical all year i was finally comfortable buying nano at 5$, am upset
1	1523385523	9	Easy 4x during the next bull.
1	1523385809	5	Just hold man. Nano always explodes during bull runs. As soon as we are over the bearish market its ez money. I made ez $2k last time on Nano when I bought it really cheap. 
0	1523385929	6	I think with all the adoption, branding, marketing and partnerships, this year is going to be more about altcoins than BTC. what do you think?
1	1523386310	4	I think that to actually get the altcoins to dramatically increase in value requires another big bull run on BTC. After the next one we may even see some uncoupling where the alts can begin to rise and fall independently of BTC price. Until then, the alts are locked into the price of BTC and can only increase through pump and dumps. Put 50% into Alts of your choice and 50% into BTC to raise the market price on everything. Putting your money into alts alone won‚Äôt make a fortune.
2	1523386390	5	I still try to increase my Satoshi value by trading alts but I don't intend to invest in BTC for the long term. I have my eyes on promising projects and try to build up a stash.
3	1523386458	2	Hope that strategy works out for you. 
2	1523386539	3	> Putting your money into alts alone won‚Äôt make a fortune.so wrong. I wouldnt trade my 1000> in OMG, iota, EOS for anything
3	1523387036	2	I never said to trade them for anything.
1	1523388034	1	Year of the doge bro
1	1523385977	3	I think both.  BTC always king.  King no go home just yet.
1	1523386223	2	Partnerships/adoption won't matter if people continue to still not use any coin for their intended purpose. Adoption is one thing, but people actively using them is another. If BTC starts randomly dropping and taking alts down with it, then people are less inclined to use said coins and you lose adoption like what we saw with BTC.

0	1523373710	3	Look at the tiny bursts of market sell orders at low volume being used to drive down BNB.  They fire off almost every time there is a buy.  I watched it happen last night and see it clearly happening again.  This seems like a very easy way to manipulate the market.  Push the price down by buying your own under-priced coins and use maybe a few hundred BNB.  Then buy at the base of that where the cost is low and let the rest of the market drive up the cost of your new cheap coins.  Rinse, repeat.  
0	1523375639	3	Is this another step forward before two steps back?

Thank your lucky stars that you are in the here and now in a crypto boring time ~ now is when you accumulate at lowish prices.....  this accumulation phase could take months more but that is even better ~ you have more tine to set aside funds to accumulate more before the next run where crypto goes bullish and then eventually parabolic crushing all previous ATH's.....You have no idea how lucky you are and if you do not quietly take advantage of this opportunity you will forever lament the time when you could have got it all so cheap....

0	1523372812	2	100 btc buywall on bitstamp. 
1	1523373513	4	Could anyone explain what exactly are the effects of a buy wall and a sell wall? I‚Äôm not a trader and still becoming familiar with some of the terms you guys use around here. I read up on this topic at investopedia and I understand they are large orders yet to be fulfilled.My question is, in the case of a buy wall, wouldn‚Äôt we have to know the buy price set in the order before we know what effect it would have on the price? This is kind of confusing to me and any pointers in the right direction would be really appreciated. Thanks!
2	1523374078	3	Yes we do need to know what price the wall is at, but that is open for all to see (as all orders on any trading platform is). Sell/buy walls are just basic supply and demand, if someone is willing to buy a huge amount of a coin at one price naturally there will be a resistance for the price going any lower than it aslong as it remains, why would anyone sell for less if they can sell it into the wall? Walls acts as price supports, but they aren't safe indications as they can be pulled at anytime before they are filled aswell. Edit: and ofc, the buyorders need to be larger than the sell orders for it to be concidered a buywall and vice versa.
3	1523375490	1	Gotcha, that clears things up a lot. Thank you very much for the thorough explanation!

0	1523365240	12	I don't know why you guys are so surprised that the mods keep deleting Vechain posts. It's been proven that they are heavy WTC and NANO bagholders. Their agenda is incredibly obvious. 
1	1523366943	5	WTC I understand, because they feel threatened at a superior coin, but Nano? What does Nano have to do with VEN? 
2	1523370583	2	he was just bringing up another example of them favoring a coin. With nano, you'll see buttfuck of posts all day and night allowed when it's obvious brigading. 
2	1523368246	1	Threatened? LolThis sub really has gone to shit.
2	1523369165	1	You guys are so full of it.
1	1523367612	1	but why would they invest in a scam coin like WTC? I mean, look at the partnerships between WTC and VEN. WTC has absolutely NO deals while VEN closes deals with all the big companies in the world.. They're not leaving anything for WTC haha.
1	1523368013	1	For a VEN holder no matter what the reason, somehow it's WTCs fault. Paranoid. 
1	1523368053	1	I thought mods were deleting to accumulate more with less competition.
1	1523369505	1	proven? elaborate.  Not doubting you, just would like to know what the proof is.
0	1523363245	5	I keep looking at ONT and thinking "nah don't FOMO in, it's too late" then it proceeds to go up another 5%... what the actual fuck is going on?
1	1523363487	4	I‚Äôm in the same boat.  I don‚Äôt know enough about the project yet to make a decision on it.  Seems legit from what I can tell so far, definitely not a Verge or Tron, that‚Äôs for sure.  
2	1523371725	1	I agree, onchain is behind this and they are well respected market leaders behind the neo smart economy.
1	1523363849	4	Same here, I just decided to jump in and do the do
1	1523363841	3	Stop looking and see it as opportunity missed, just be more keen on catching the next one :-)
2	1523364017	2	when is that?! we never know ...
3	1523365312	2	That's the fun part
1	1523369217	1	I FOMOed in the other day, at the ATH, then it dropped, didn't go back up for a bit, so I figured the pump and dump was over and I'd better get out before it's dropped completely. That was at about $2.30....I always figured the whales would dump this coin hard at some point anyway since they got it for free, so never felt too safe in it.

0	1523373009	3	What to see my alt lottery ticket "portfolio?" I haven't done an update in a while, so I thought I'd share. All percentages rounded. - Ripple: 32%- TEL: 11%- BNTY: 8% - OCN: 7%- DENT: 7%- RDD: 6%- LOCI: 6%- REQ: 6%- OMG: 6%- XP: 5%- SENC: 4%- CV: 1.5%Total "invested": ~$500Current value: ~$295Comments: I started buying in mid-February of this year. I'm probably going to put another $250 or so in alt-coins, and then try to get a couple of thousand in top-10 coins by the end of the year. My only two regrets are CV and SENC, which were both FOMO purchases. I spent less than $15 on each, though, so I'm not really upset. Next purchases: Probably LOCI, TEL, and Ripple for dollar-cost averaging. If anyone wants to recommend any alts, I'll consider putting $25 into them--that's how I ended up with OCN, DENT, and BNTY.
1	1523373517	3	Check out TKY
2	1523373690	1	Will do. What do you like about it?
3	1523374101	3	dodgy project, stay away! Centralized big brother, proprietary with the worst ICO on our planet.
4	1523374168	1	I'll still look at it, but I'll keep your advice in mind. 
3	1523374008	2	Chinese government is planning to use it for a bunch of different things, insurance, smart cities, etc.
1	1523373620	3	lol. I see that's the reddit special huh? hahaha
1	1523373238	2	If that's your lottery - I'd go more into DENT, BNTY and OMG personally, vs XRP.  
1	1523385639	2	That's a lot of crypto choices for only a "small " investment. I started with the same amount and jumped from one crypto to another until my portfolio was worth being in more than one coin. For the only reason, it was easier to keep updated on my one cryoti and slowly start researching the others. I'd take gains out and start putting them in those other projects. Not saying your wrong, it'll just be hard to have that lottery moment when you're spread thin
1	1523373845	2	Oh boy, I'd sell and move to BTC where you might get something.

1	1523372538	2	As far as I understand.. ONT for enteprise use cases including identity... NEO public blockchain.... I think both will be connected somehow...
0	1523377094	3	There is no red day for ONT?
1	1523377175	1	When BTC drops it turn red for a few minutes :/

0	1523377829	3	I have all my investments still in alt coins and eth, hodled through everything. I'm wondering now though if I should start moving stuff around again? I've been afraid to touch anything since the crash since it's all now at a fraction of what it once was. But also, I'm wondering if I should dump half of what I have into BTC. Sitting stagnant is starting to make me nervous, or is that a good idea, to just tuck it away? Holding: ETHREQVENXLMICXBAT
1	1523379798	7	Just chill and hold what you have. Nobody's advice here is truly worth anything, including mine. Those are decent projects though, so just hold. Put new money into BTC if you want, maybe trade some ETH if you have enough
1	1523377970	11	The time to sell to BTC was when it started falling in January (although just going to fiat would have been even better).  I would just hold those now.  Every time BTC shows any signs of life, alts start taking off now.  When BTC starts recovering and staying there, I think the alt explosion is going to be crazy.
2	1523378247	3	+1
1	1523381111	2	Swap ICX and BAT with NEO and BTC and you have my portfolio.  Not suggesting that you make those changes, its just what I have.

1	1523381410	2	Onchain behind Neo is also behind ont. This project has some serious backing
1	1523381327	2	Probably a combination of reasons. Da hong fei is known to be great at crypto. Look at his past success with neo. So some people might believe this will succeed as well.Others may be just trying to pump it and fomo in.Or this project could legitimately be great.Or insider trading.

1	1523377904	4	During bull run: Fuck I wish we'd have a dip.  I'll never see those cheap prices again.During bear market: Fuck I hate these dips.  I wish my coin would just go up close to ATH again.
1	1523378315	4	I would settle for 10% increase a week as well. No less though. After the past few months us holders deserve at least 1+ year of consistent 10%/week increase.If I wanted slow money I would be invested into stocks. I am not chasing nickels here.

0	1523360209	2	>He hasn't bought link yetYou're never going to make it
0	1523365947	2	Two questions:1) Is it worth it to learn technycal analysis for the crypto world? Does it behave similar to the stock market?2) Does anybody have a reliable theory on when the bear market will finish? So far I've seen people saying May will be the month when we'll see a huge increase in capitalization, whereas others state that this bearish market will last until mid 2019. I tend to believe the latter, but I'm talking based on a gut feeling.Thanks!
1	1523366188	11	People here will say no because it helps them rationalize the terrible trades they've made but having a moderate understanding of TA goes a long way. Simply knowing where support and resistance lie gives you an advantage when deciding when to invest.
2	1523371974	1	This is sound advice. I tried this out over the last couple months, and decided to only buy BTC below $8k.It's not completely immune to the volatility of the market, but buying in that ~$6k to ~$8k range has been solid so far.
1	1523371742	4	TA on an immature market like crypto is anecdotal at best. In general TA comes more from the world of psychology than from mathematics. It is a psychological manipulation tool more than anything else. A human mind wants and even requires reasons for the things that happen. People will create reasons for all sorts of things that are not readily explained. This is the reason for superstition. TA allows those with money to create a more predictable market for themselves by giving a reason to the peasants for the goings on in a market. It is a way to restrict profitability for the masses and passing it on to the few. Bringing order to chaos. As long as those with money can convince those without that TA has application and value as it provides an explanation in the crypto market, it will have that value. Not because there is some mystical science to it but because traders will alter the way they trade to follow TA. You sell because the numbers indicated you should sell and you buy because the numbers indicated you should buy. Without TA imposing the psychological restriction on traders everyone would trade by emotion and as a result create an irrational market and make more money than those who wish to control and manipulate the market would like. 
2	1523375309	1	This wins. 
1	1523366784	5	1) Yes, definitely.2) That has nothing to do with TA because it's not how it works.
1	1523366364	4	1) TA is a valuable skill which if learned correctly could provide you with a second income during your lifetime. Not only for crypto but other financial markets as well. Dont let anyone tell you TA doesnt work in crypto, the market is still driven by human emotions.2) Nobody knows, but there are some key factors which can indicate a new bull market. Volume, interest of the public, institutional money are some indicators. Could be weeks, could be years
1	1523368650	2	Yes and no. Some things are comparable but a lot of things behave differently from what you're used to with stocks. I wouldn't rely on it too much beyond the very basic TA principles.  For reference: if you look at [the 6 year old bitcoin thread somewhere on the front page of this sub](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ka3mo/its_the_perfect_time_to_buy_bitcoins/) you'll find many, many people dismissing the odds of BTC ever making it above $10 based on their triangles.
1	1523366242	3	TA works with sufficient (real) activity/liquidity. Right now, very few assets are active enough in crypto to have any immunity against easy manipulation, though. 
1	1523366842	3	1) if you do in-day trading2) soon
1	1523367163	1	1) Yes2) Remember that TA is only really accurate between the 2 day limit. Outside of that there is just not enough data to extrapolate. So we can't tell
1	1523368963	1	Even just understanding and using bollinger bands to determine likely support and resistance levels makes learning worth it.
1	1523369050	1	TA def helps but it doesnt predict the future price.  If your looking to learn it a guy I follow teaches TA via a live stream youtube channel and also private lessons. His channel is hypedoncrypto(which provides breakdowns on certain coins) then he has a live stream twice a day on youtube and twitch at 2pm and 10pm central time ( which he will break down and teach TA based on coins the viewers request.)  He is legit give him a try

2	1523376844	5	Crabs in a bucket
1	1523374959	1	Not so much worried as a ‚Äúsame old‚Äù sort of sentiment. At this point there‚Äôs really nothing preventing me from believing it‚Äôs just another pump & dump. We‚Äôve been hovering at around the current price range for a while now, and no catalytic event has occurred to warrant *this particular* pump on a blue April Tuesday to be the one that breaks the bear cycle. Skeptical.
0	1523365560	1	Programmer here, I have some serious concerns for these altcoins.Decentralized, Public, Verified Ledgers is entirely the point of blockchain. There is no magic here. - Decentralized means that leadership or decisions can be overthrown by a hard fork. This is not appealing to business owners who would be at the will of a blockchain created years ago. This makes decisions and changes slower and have more resistance.- Public means, no sensitive data allowed. Logistics 'cryptos' make me wonder if anyone realized that this info is Public?- **Verified, this is entirely the value added.** You only use blockchain technology if something needs to be verified. Voting and Currency are two applications this is needed on. You will not need your social media/medical records/etc.. to be 'verified'. Centralized servers are significantly cheaper to run and changes are more flexible.**If you disagree, I wonder if you watched hype youtube videos or actually know how *Public, Decentralized, Verified Ledgers* can be useful.**EDIT: Buy Bitcoin
1	1523366942	6	Take a look at qtum for the hard fork problem and Enigma for the privacy problem. Not saying they are silver bullets but they are attempts to address some of these concerns. 
2	1523368929	1	I dont think Enigma answered the hard fork problem.There are privacy coins, but again, those miss out on the entire benefit of triple entry accounting. 
3	1523369206	1	Well Enigma not a chain, technically so maybe it doesn't encounter the hard form problem in the first place? It's a chain-agnostic protocol that keeps private data private, from what I understand. Qtum is the chain with the most nodes that seems to have come closest to solving the hard fork problem
1	1523365900	1	how do you feel about xrp?
2	1523368089	1	It's a digital currency not a crypto currency.
3	1523369138	1	yes
2	1523369433	1	I like it a lot for what it tries to do, but it's starting to lose a bit of its market share to XLM.  I think that trend is going to continue.  
2	1523371747	1	very bad
1	1523368525	1	Centralized servers will always be faster and cheaper but the whole point of crypto is decentralization.
2	1523369222	1	Agreed, which is why the application NEEDs to have decentralization.
1	1523369201	1	Programmer here myself.>Decentralized means that leadership or decisions can be overthrown by a hard fork. This is not appealing to business owners who would be at the will of a blockchain created years ago. This makes decisions and changes slower and have more resistanceCorrect. However, there are solutions for this that find a balance between centralization and decentralization. >Public means, no sensitive data allowed. Logistics 'cryptos' make me wonder if anyone realized that this info is Public?Incorrect. Data stored can be secured via various means of hashing cryptography and private side chains that keeps sensitive data hidden.>Verified, this is entirely the value added. You only use blockchain technology if something needs to be verified. Voting and Currency are two applications this is needed on. You will not need your social media/medical records/etc.. to be 'verified'.Not sure what your point is here. So I'm not going to respond. There are many uses outside of Voting and Currency, but you're right on some accounts that a lot of information doesn't *need* to be stored on a chain.> Centralized servers are significantly cheaper to run and changes are more flexible.Correct. But centralized servers will not solve the problems that blockchain is trying to solve. Sure, a lot of these alt coins are trying to just slap a blockchain onto existing solutions, but some of them actually solve problems that couldn't otherwise be solved without trustless data.
2	1523370300	1	>Correct. However, there are solutions for this that find a balance between centralization and decentralization.Eh, after being a manager, you really only get 1 or the other, hybrid centralized-decentralized is probably worse. Centralized leadership is very useful for fast decision making. Decentralized has obvious advantages.>, a lot of these alt coins are trying to just slap a blockchain onto existing solutions, but some of them actually solve problems that couldn't otherwise be solved without trustless data.This is entirely my worry. 
1	1523371178	1	Decentralized - Meaning no central body could go in and edit or change appendixes to a databasePublic - Meaning a ledger could be easily accessed through any party on the utilizing the block chainVerified - Document collection and verification of document appendixesCentralized Servers are cheaper in hardware, but Integration support and maintenance to get all parties using that one centralized server is the true cost. Block chain for applications in supply chain and inter connection solve the issues that come with a centralized server integration.For example - Supply Chain multiple suppliers could easily use a block chain application to more quickly document all necessary documentation. If you are a company looking to take on a new supplier the time to integrate systems on both sides is expensive/time consuming. With Block chain all that needs to be added and coded could be done through a block chain and integrated to the final manufacturers central data base. 
2	1523372340	2	>If you are a company looking to take on a new supplier the time to integrate systems on both sides is expensive/time consuming. Its going to be time consuming either way, they both will use APIs or crawlers for development. >With Block chain all that needs to be added and coded could be done through a block chain and integrated to the final manufacturers central data base.You are describing a public database table(which is the triple accounting mentioned above), it is still a database. This doesnt change the amount of work involved.

0	1523360995	1	How do you guys convert to fiat? My country does not regulate crypto so taxes are 0% for now - i checked. Wanted some kind of anonymous card in case they decide to regulate and tax from the past  sometimes in the future... something i can withdraw from ATM`s with as little fees as possible. So i'd send from an exchange to the card and withdraw via an ATM in my local currency. I`m in the European Union. They are thinking of a 10% tax so when it happens i'll just pay that but until then i basically want to guard myself from surprises... i do not trust the Government that much.Should be able to handle low to moderate amounts of say 10k per month minimum so a 200$ max per day withdraw limit does nothing for me.I found some cards but honestly i have no clue what is reliable and can be trusted i also see a lot have stopped issuing cards and plan to resume in the future... so again the trust issue, i'd rather take my chances with the Government instability than lose the money, anonymity is not worth that risk for me.
1	1523361071	3	Revolut. https://www.revolut.com/?lang=enNot sure there's going to be a card that will ever be "Anonymous" - you may as well just look into crypto debit cards instead if that's the road you're going down.
