0	1523459357	26	why do i get the feeling like theres only 10 of us in the sub and we just argue/joke with each other all day 
1	1523459549	7	Sounds about right.  It's sad when I recognize names in Reddit and i'm like...that's my reddit buddy.
2	1523460099	5	i wish there was a ranker that showed who's most active...most upvotes...best trading advice(woudl be hard to measure)...but would be interesting
3	1523461120	1	That would be dope.
2	1523461298	3	I'm not your buddy, guy.
3	1523461619	4	I'm not your guy, friend.
4	1523462021	3	I'm not your friend, pal.
5	1523463561	2	I'm not your pal, dude
6	1523464801	2	I'm not your dude, bro
7	1523467023	2	im not your bro, dawg
1	1523460423	5	Yeah... I know which user names I don't get along with lol
1	1523462569	2	everyone is a bot, you are the only real person on reddit
1	1523459528	1	BFFs OMFG :P
1	1523462028	1	Seriously this is the only subreddit where i actually recognize users. We got AllThingsVain, 0x000, RawMidge, TruthHurts102, BagHolder420, ArsonBunny, its like our own celebritysphereShouts to chewtoy at bitcoinmarkets he da real mvp
1	1523462305	1	Since there are few kinds of people here, that why everyone sounds familiar xD
1	1523464438	1	Yea pretty much lol
0	1523435002	15	What an amazing trade bots war at 6,844.38-6,844.39https://imgur.com/a/jyaLzHard fight for $0.01 profits
1	1523437264	5	BTC arm wrestling
1	1523436572	3	bitcoin is bought by real buyers to buy alts, so they could care less about the price. The battle is between short and long whales. Couldn't care less personally. 
1	1523449693	1	Season 3 of Battlebots early release!
0	1523453395	16	I'm selling everything and going all in on cans of dog food. 
1	1523454173	9	1 DOG FOOD = 1 DOG FOOD.
0	1523440054	13	Why are so many alts pumping right now? 
1	1523440488	18	it's alt season baby!
2	1523440902	10	thats the dream..
1	1523443630	5	Because BTC stay quite stable last weeks so Alt's are rising. It's 2 weeks BTC dominance started to decrease. Therefore more money into Alt's. 
1	1523440899	4	Alts are on the startline und tired of waiting for BTC!
2	1523453631	1	Found the german
3	1523465059	1	Haha, exactly😂 But how?
4	1523466354	2	You used "und" instead of "and". Autocorrect fucks it up
1	1523448376	2	Everything except PRL. The airdrop dump has started early.
2	1523452964	2	Which makes no sense pre snapshot.
1	1523453072	1	A lot retraced fully from Dec/Jan and we're in accumulation zones. Typical Wyckoff cycles
0	1523428056	16	Damn, OMG getting news after news. I'm feeling pretty comfy with my paltry stack. I need to hit my goal before it leaves me in the dust.
1	1523428134	4	Am I naive for thinking once the date is announced for the hard spoon it will go on a run due to everyone trying to get the 1:1 cosmo or wtv token? 
2	1523430432	4	Does spoon just mean airdrop?I know it's supposed to be a naming based on fork. So fork you spin off, and spoon you add on an airdrop?
2	1523428402	2	I can see this as a strong possibility. I wonder if volume will swing up when they give that 2 week notice.
1	1523428838	5	I'm 30% OMG and it still doesn't feel enough!
1	1523428293	2	What news are you referring to?
2	1523428829	5	Shinhan card MOU, hardspoon on Cosmos Network, Partnership with Dai/Makerdao. 
3	1523434979	11	Gesundheit 
3	1523452644	2	Wait, I thought the Cosmos photons went to ETH holders?
2	1523428864	3	The latest is them partnering with MakerDAO
1	1523429071	2	you almost gave me a heart attack. i thought they released more news after makerdao.
0	1523429462	15	by now i've read soo many times "[coin x] is easily a top 10 soon" looks like we will have about 100 top 10 coins in the future!
1	1523436448	9	where can I buy this coin x? I hear its going to be in the top 10 soon..
1	1523431506	5	Everybody favourite coin is a top ten coin. Dont listen to the reddit shills
2	1523433084	1	To be fair the shills are mostly based on genuine belief. I wouldn’t have invested in my coins if I didn’t honestly think they wouldn’t change the world and go top ten. 
3	1523439175	1	true that. be not everyone can be number 1
0	1523462249	15	It’s so ridiculous how almost all of my friends lost interest in cryptos over the past 3 months. I spent so much time helping them explaining things, setting up their accounts etc. Got invitations to several group chats where we‘d discuss news, prices, fresh projects... now they won’t even reply anymore if it’s about cryptos. Some even lost their seeds, ledgers or forgot all their logins. But, you know, they were all about the tech. Of course. 
1	1523462762	4	Good, sounds like coins are burned or lost.  Decrease in supply and selling when those coins moon again and your friends can't even access them.
1	1523465669	2	Let them buy again at ATHs
1	1523462389	3	Not everyone likes to take a beating and repeatedly come back for more. I wouldn't be surprised if they resent you for getting them in at an ATH. 
2	1523462765	5	I wouldn’t be surprised if this wasn’t the first time you made stupid assumptions. I never talked anyone into anything. People asked me for help, I helped. 
1	1523462355	2	Who cares,  they'll miss out. Investing isn't for everyone
0	1523427415	22	Go up you bitch
1	1523427999	31	Here you go https://www.viagra.com
0	1523436430	7	Something happening with ICX?
1	1523437112	5	It's sitting on support (previous resistence) for a few days now. Volume is increasing day by day. If you believe in TA, there are only good things for ICX
2	1523439052	10	You forgot the take into account the fact that I have ICX and everything I touch turns to shit.
3	1523439781	1	Ahhh, so you are that guy. What other coins do you have? And please always let me know before you buy anything :D
2	1523437229	3	no unfortunately unless something has changed fundamentally I think this is just price manipulation. I see huge buy and sells walls moving the price up.
1	1523436727	1	yes
0	1523463026	7	Eth is 420, light it up.
0	1523443299	25	The first time I got into crypto was right before Bitcoin shot up in Spring of 2013. The second time I got into crypto was right before everything shot up in Spring of 2017. Not sure if it’s just nostalgia but the fact that’s it’s spring makes me feel like we’re due for a sustained rise. 
1	1523448476	10	Next time you get in, let me know. Thanks.
1	1523443492	12	I think in May it will begin..... and it will be epic.
2	1523448401	10	Yeah well people have been saying this for every single month since janurary :/
3	1523450647	5	isn't it January 99th today? 
3	1523451478	2	Yeah well, if you dont believe it will ever go back up then you should sell and move on.
4	1523463115	1	It's just bears afraid a little positivity will ruin their shorts.
2	1523448572	10	I think in February it will begin..... and it will be epic.I think in March it will begin..... and it will be epic.I think in April it will begin..... and it will be epic.I think in May it will begin..... and it will be epic.
3	1523450556	2	Sure, but if you're just going to assume the downtrend will continue indefinitely, you could end up looking like [the guy who drew this chart](http://i.imgur.com/W1JCW.png).
3	1523449291	1	well one of these times, they may just be right.
3	1523453719	1	lol
1	1523450275	1	I wish people would stop talking in seasons and start talking in months, considering each half of the globe has opposite seasons. Am from Australia and every time someone says something happened/will happen in whatever season, I have to stop and think when that's supposed to be.
1	1523452964	1	When alt season aligns with late spring early summer we pump hard, could be coincidence though.
0	1523428971	19	Dear diary, today I'm buying more. FUCK THE BEARS!!!
1	1523429044	7	Go pack go!
2	1523454672	1	Da Bears!
1	1523439318	2	is your diary on the blockchain or not
0	1523454921	12	Volume up over the last 24-36 hours....hopefully that trend continues.
1	1523456487	4	later...maybe...after Chinese NY :)))) or tax day
2	1523457578	1	Tax day is the key IMHO...
1	1523455037	1	Could just be coming in from wallets to sell it. i hope not.
2	1523455103	3	could be - next few days should give us a better picture.
0	1523464285	13	We're either gonna go hamburger or hotdog on the 5 min chart. If we go hotdog, we're fucked. But if we get a side of fries, we could see a reversal. However, if it's diet Pepsi instead of fries, total capitulation. 
1	1523464797	4	But the Golden Arches are coming up! 
2	1523464869	3	Waiting on Ketchup to confirm. 
0	1523431449	13	Im so fucking irritated by Ont...who in their right mind could have called this ridiculous pump..../salt
1	1523433408	2	Same. looked at it after the weekend dip (0.008 ETH) but thought the CMC update would throw people off...i was wrong. 
1	1523450872	1	What's worse is that they gave away 1000 $ont if you signed up for their newsletter...BTW I sold Ont at 22k sats. Which sucks.
1	1523454392	1	I’m salty I sold at .0025, it hit .011
0	1523461306	11	I'll believe we're in a bull run when we break 10k
1	1523461576	16	When you sit down for lunch at $8k and by end of lunch it’s $10k, then it’s a bull run.
2	1523461782	10	That day I went to take a shit and it had gone from 17-19k by the time I was done wiping. Sweet sweet memories 
3	1523462962	1	nick checks out
2	1523461790	6	Surely only if you eat like Mr. Creosote..
1	1523461731	6	Thats a high goal friendo
1	1523461358	3	That's fair
0	1523447122	7	Hi, I want to buy in at these prices. I am buying BTC,ETH and LTC on Coinbase. My question is if it would be smarter to just buy BTC and then buy ETH and LTC on other exchanges for BTC? Instead of separately via fiat.I live in Europe and pay with EUR, if that makes a difference :)
1	1523447208	8	No, that wouldn't be worth it. What would be worth it is signing in to GDAX and buying there (since you avoid the Coinbase fees)
2	1523447275	2	I tried that, but I dont think I can in my country (Denmark)
3	1523447601	2	you need to make verification on gdax before transfering from coinbase to gdax, just buy directly with fiat the coins. 
1	1523447970	3	i would suggest using fiat to get all 3. and then transfer those out to a more secure wallet. 
1	1523448966	3	just buy everything with fiat and hodl
1	1523452882	1	I think that increases tax obligation in the states, not sure about euro zone
0	1523459840	5	Let's go Doge!
1	1523460920	7	Wow such moon, very money
0	1523463417	6	Just stuck 400 in a hodlbot account. More just curious about it, but wont you lose money if something leaves the top 20 at a low or on all the transaction fees from constant rejiggering? Im just gonna.ignore til dec
1	1523463880	2	aaaaaaaaaand your $400 is gone
2	1523463958	2	Care to elaborate? In expecting to get fucked at some point due to my carelessness.
3	1523464466	2	To be honest, I personally would not trust to put $400 in an account and give my private key to a random website. This website is not some AI-operated machine learning shit lol. It probably has some very rudimentary technical evaluations and what happens to your money will 99.9% depend on what happens to BTC lol. The market is down already, a lot of solid coins are already very low. Put your $400 on a decent project, forget about it, and come back in 6 months. That's what I would do personally. 
1	1523463530	2	I'm looking hard into it as well.  I know it is silly thinking you can trade and outperform an [index fund in stocks](http://fortune.com/2017/12/30/warren-buffett-million-dollar-bet/) and can't see why it would be any different in crypto.
0	1523468905	6	When I see the word "short" come up consistently, every day, within the first 5 posts of me visiting this daily general discussion (not counting my own post, of course), well........you know the bottom, the base, the ground, the foundation, the lower most meat-and-potatoes price, the absolute rock-bottom floor has been reached.The only time I heard the word "short" last December was in the phrase:  "I'm short on cash to buy more bitcoin, what's leverage?"
1	1523469200	3	So are you putting more fiat in? I talked about short earlier lol because I'm thinking of doing that.
0	1523472044	1	The Verge zombies, are coming out in droves  The price keeps on climbing  Despite the constant woes  The partnership is coming  The details we do not know  Because it's all an illusion  Just to take your dough
0	1523451548	15	He thinks he's going to make it
0	1523454059	14	I moved my WTC bag into more NEO yesterday and now it's up 20% today. My type of fucking luck. You're welcome WTC holders.
1	1523454157	4	Man I feel you.... I made so many wrong decisions....
2	1523454830	1	Hahaha I feel like this type of shit ONLY HAPPENS TO ME, ya know..Anyways, we'll see how NEO will do in a few years from now/
1	1523454162	3	I think i bought from you
2	1523454260	1	If you bought @ 0.020882 ETH. then yes.
1	1523454401	15	OMG! 😭 I can’t believe I won ! Thank you Walton team !❤️ keep doing the great work. 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻🚀🚀🚀 
1	1523454714	2	Neo is about to have a good little run. WTC is suppose to have a partnership deal announced in the next few days. TA shows Neo has broken through its downtrend and could run for a while. Lots of volume too dont Neo will run for a while and WTC will pump in the shortterm. 
0	1523469638	5	I kinda miss those days when you do something besides Crypto for like ten min, then recheck and go HOLY SHIT!!!!
1	1523469843	11	We just went through a couple months of HOLY SHIT but in the opposite direction.
2	1523470560	2	I took a shit. And before my shit fully drops, bitchcoin went from 11k to 5k 
3	1523470873	4	The fuck? You dropping logs from the ISS homie?
0	1523431526	14	How's everyone's patience? Ask yourself: If this bear market lasts till mid 2019, will you still be holding?
1	1523432236	23	In my mind the money in crypto is written off, I will hold. 
1	1523432120	11	I will be holding and slowly accumulating
2	1523432987	21	I’ll be honest: I’ve lost the enthusiasm and belief to accumulate more. I was doing it non-stop until about a month ago and now I’ve reached a point where I’m happy enough with what I have but I’d be incredibly angry with myself if I spent more and the risk didn’t pay off. In other words, I’ve reached my limit of what I’m prepared to lose.However there is zero chance of me selling. I’ve accepted that I’ve lost my money. At the very least I want to be part of the tech revolution that my investments are involved with.
3	1523438509	3	Actually the same. All what is left is just to adjust the current holdings between each other and that is all. 
1	1523432854	11	I'd hold but also be worried. If we're still bearish over 1 year from now it would mean crypto/blockchain tech wouldn't have done anything in that time to bring back the bulls. 1 year is a long time in technology and if its going to be another year of speculation and hype, I'm going to be a bit worried. We need some products and real world uses to bring back the bulls. 
1	1523431718	6	I'm holding until I no longer need to.
1	1523434267	2	If the price holds for another two weeks: fine.If it spikes on the 16th: Fucked.
1	1523442977	2	A long bear market means, that I have enough time to buy some cheap coins
1	1523436810	2	i will hold until atleast 2030
2	1523448109	1	No by then AI and quantum computing will have rendered crypto obsolete.
1	1523433987	1	I'll hold and accum till this time next year. Magic Wizard sets out the reality pretty well below.
1	1523445151	1	Too late to sell. I'm down too much already
1	1523463501	1	I had bough almost every month for a couple of years only looking at fundamentals and I will do this till ~2025. Served me well so far.
0	1523456704	12	I had a dream last night. I dreamt I was a dove flying over the sea. And then I dove into the ocean... And I swam with the whales. I was two animals joined as one... ...which meant - good things are coming. Good things.
1	1523457218	9	whoa.. who sells you your weed?
2	1523457250	5	You do parallax22288
3	1523457346	6	ohhh yeaaa! whats up mkalaf?!
1	1523457283	5	Thank you MR. Cheezle.
2	1523457896	3	Oh, ok, ok... Fair enough, yeah, rage it up. Rage all you want. Good things are coming. Good things.
1	1523457482	3	I would probably interpret that dream differently. You was a dove that dove down, and you joined with a whale. Sounds to me like the markets going down people are going to sell and whales are going to buy, they’ll eat you all up.
1	1523457146	2	you just woke up before the whale ate you krill.... :)
1	1523457194	2	So you were a krill eaten by a whale. Cool dream.
1	1523458296	1	Nah man, that means you have to get in on the Bitocean ICO
1	1523458481	1	I had the same damn dream.....what's the odds?
1	1523461435	1	Shots of wheat grass for the boys. Who’s buying, not me...
0	1523445480	10	LINK update: ropsten network (ethereum) + testnet3 (bitcoin) launched.Since they do zero marketing figured it was worth mentioning. Edit: also an update to their website https://www.smartcontract.com/features 
1	1523450017	1	Oh no no no no i havent finished accumulating my stinkies
0	1523461127	8	Doge 23% up in 24 hs. This market makes perfect sense.
1	1523461350	10	It's the only coin with an entirely positive community.
1	1523462141	3	Doge is fun to use, It's a good indicator for how excited people are about crypto. Or its getting pumped and dumped again who knows.
0	1523463093	8	Honestly tempted to throw a little at Potcoin because 4/20, ya know. There are worse ideas. 
1	1523463171	5	Blaze it 
2	1523468895	3	honestly.... few have been better!
0	1523455865	19	I hereby announce the start of, "The Great Bullrun of 2018".Pepper ur anguses m8tes, I'm going in dry
1	1523456084	5	Find somebody to hold on to. You might end up in the streets.
1	1523456562	4	February has finally arrived. 
2	1523457809	1	I've been waiting for February!!!
1	1523456443	2	lol...you are rushing things
1	1523456713	2	If you end up being wrong I'll hook you up with a plate of warm dog food. We are all brothers in this and need to look out for each other.
1	1523457785	2	At least spit first.
1	1523457533	1	I expect a big dip between now and 4/17, then a run to the next peak sometime after.  Probably will hit our next peak between may-june.  Yes, I am a broken record.  Been saying this for a while.
1	1523459668	1	Pamplona is the official city of Crypto!!
0	1523459345	8	The original bitcoin white paper should be required reading and the holy bible of cryptocurrency. https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
1	1523460405	2	And thus it was decreed; The first commandment in crypto, thou shalt read the bitcoin white paper. 
1	1523462094	2	Isn't that the Bitcoin Cash whitepaper? Where can i find the Bitcoin whitepaper? 
2	1523462619	1	Blasphemy!
1	1523459733	2	amen
1	1523462680	1	does it have a coin? is it good?
0	1523441734	3	What happened to Bitcoin's Terra hash rate? https://blockchain.info/nl/charts/hash-rate 
1	1523442914	7	Had to turn my rig off for maintenance
1	1523442872	1	oooh
1	1523442886	1	I've no idea but it doesn't look good
2	1523444074	1	ye thought the same
1	1523445102	1	looks fine to me?
2	1523445492	1	Hmm had a weird sudden drop
1	1523449460	1	looks normal?
2	1523449697	1	There was a huge spike going down towards 10.000K. I heard it was some sort of bug so nothing to worry
0	1523453696	5	So having proved the market can be manipulated like it was in December, why wouldn't the same people do it again? And again? And again? Are we going to see even bigger ATHs and then crashes over and over? 
0	1523464298	4	Can someone explain how coin burn can be verified?  Coins go into an inaccessible wallet address, but how can its inaccessibility be proven?
1	1523464565	3	Which coin?
2	1523464593	2	BNB for instance.
3	1523465076	3	To find out if coins have been burned [check the total supply of their ERC20](https://etherscan.io/token/BNB) vs [what CMC currently lists](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/). CMC will not update their numbers until Binance announces that a coin burn has been completed and the change in the total supply of the ERC20 can be verified on etherscan. So, if you see the total on etherscan change, the burn is happening. 
4	1523466828	2	Ok, so the total supply changes, but the coins technically still exist.I guess I’m just confused as to how it can be indisputably known that no one has access to the address into which the coins slated for the burn get deposited.  Don’t all addresses have public/private keys and mnemonic seed phrases for recovery?
5	1523467828	3	No, they'll burn the coins through the contract. Essentially they will send the tokens to the contract address with instructions.    Function: burn(uint256 _value)
6	1523468012	2	Interesting.  And that basically renders them unable to be sent or received?
7	1523468061	3	That destroys them and the total supply on the contract changes.

1	1523469545	3	This is old news...
0	1523428127	14	Wow~ Monster can go fuck itself
0	1523457304	7	Been holding since 01/01/2018.....68% down. I have bought along the way to lower my average, but yeah...Great Success.
1	1523457411	4	Your patience will be rewarded. 
2	1523457428	1	Hope so.
1	1523458493	1	After DCA down what % are you down from your total investment now?
1	1523459000	1	Welcome aboard. After the learning curve, I'm not down that far though, last time i looked it was about 20%. But I don't hold much longer than 24 hours and often in and out within 10 or 15 minutes. I have been sitting on BNB on and off for about a month, but using it as a short term trading pair here and there. My hands are weak, very weak, I will cut my losses and move on.
1	1523462563	1	Holding is for retards who like to lose money.  You have to buy low, sell high, and know when to abandon a coin and find a new one. I don’t care how good the white paper is, or how capable the team is, hold allegiance to no coin. 
0	1523454856	11	I don't want a lambo. I don't need to get rich. I just want to pay off my leased KIA when it comes due next DEC without taking out a loan.Willing to invest in anything that does not immediately start crashing down the second I buy it.1200 percent should not be that much to ask for in a year. :)
1	1523455643	8	Seriously, Im looking at my favorites list, about 30 coins, all green but the 1 I'm all in on. The 1 with the so called burn about to happen within a few days. The 1 with a proven team, working tech, future plans. The green ones have ex cons for teams, previous fraudsters, admitted scams, no working tech, BS whitepapers, It might be just me, but I think I'm doing this all wrong.
2	1523456888	1	It's because you were late on it. Coin burn has been known about. Should have went all in on it about a month ago when it was $6-$7. I went 70% BNB and 30% Tron for it's just released test net a month ago. Dumped both for awesome profits over the last 2 weeks
3	1523458136	1	Was in at 8, out at 12, back in at 12.30. Can't say it's been a loser. Spent a good day in TRX, now waiting for it to retrace. I'm trying my best. I'd be out now if I could find another, thinking about Ven or Neo or ETH at the moment, but I want a quick entry back into BTC. Everything other than BTC is just about increasing my BTC holding. I'll be out of BNB on the burn.
1	1523457849	3	If I do 1200% gain I’m quitting my job 
1	1523455143	1	I don't want a lambo either - I just want to buy and restore a 1970 Subaru 360 micro van.
0	1523461072	10	Unbelievable that the investment sentiments change the moment we see 5-6% increase when this has happened like 10 times in the past several weeks. You don't need a crystal ball to predict that BTC will likely rise to 7-7.2 and then drop to 6.5-6.6 again (and alts that had a nice increase over the past week suffer the most). There is absolutely no reason for this market to get bullish overnight.

1	1523468781	6	It is not well marketed, I think. I have some on my nano s ledger that are voting for delegates. When companies use ARK to implement their own blockchains, ARK should moon :) In the mean time, I keep accumulating.
1	1523469092	3	I would also love to know what ARK, a fork of Lisk, can offer what Lisk can't apart from the delegate system. Because if Lisk works on their consensus issue...what will ARK offer extra? Someone enlighten me. Rarely see ARK community talk about the actual tech here (always about delegates) and happy to learn more. Even as a Lisk holder. In the end, ARK is one of the more legit projects.

1	1523433263	6	depends what the market sentiment is regarding the class action lawsuit. Desktop wallet is in final beta and apparently will have a quick turn around. One dev said ios wallet is in final stage too so those could change things momentarily. In my experience if their is negative FUD people will steer clear regardless of how ridiculous it is.

0	1523457561	5	Got out of Crypto in 2015. Sold off my 10 bitcoins and was happy that I had almost doubled my investment. I took that money and paid down my car loan. I was pretty happy, until bitcoin went to the moon...Started looking at crypto again back in December when everything was crazy. Held off buying until last month. Slowly phasing in some of my “disposable” income that *was* going to go toward a new motorcycle in an attempt get my feet wet again. Putting 20% in ADA, 25% in Ethereum, 20% in stellar, 20% in IOTA, 10% in Vechain, 5% in Chainlink. I figure Ethereum to be the safest of those investments and the rest to be quite risky. Going off the (100%) - (Age as a %) = $ to devote to high risk investment rule I feel like I am not being too insane. The goal for the year would be to take 2x whatever I invest in crypto and invest in Index funds just in case I lose my ass. At least then I will still be saving a nice chunk of money.Any amateur reddit financial advisors feel like weighing in on my plan???
1	1523457648	4	I'm a professional amateur reddit financial advisor.  Your plan looks solid for Reddit shills.   ADA test net launches soon....so there's that.
2	1523457897	3	Thank you professional amateur reddit financial advisor. Is this the part where I send you one btc as thanks and you send me back 2 btc because you are too polite to accept my thanks?
3	1523457973	4	Of course, but I'll take BTC, ETH or LTC.   No need to limit my gratitude to a single crypto.
1	1523459683	3	No BTC but you are 20% ADA?You know Cardano doesnt even have an Android app?
2	1523460613	2	I have zero problems with admitting that I have drank the ADA Kool-Aid. I did my own research, got a little too hyped up after watching some YouTube videos, and rolled the dice. ADA might very well shit the bed, and knowing that I won’t try to shill them, but I am a believer. 
1	1523458264	2	If I was you I would look into just using HodlBot.  Invests in the top 20 coins and rebalances every month.  I'm looking into doing this myself.  Info about it here-https://medium.com/hodlblog/hodlbot-cryptocurrency-investing-on-autopilot-dce2e4c9a7f7>Over a 3 year period, Bitcoin was up by a factor of 42x. HODL 20 with no rebalancing was up a factor of 51x and the HODL 20 with monthly rebalancing was up a factor of 164x.Yes please.
2	1523460149	5	I like the concept... but I will have to do my own research. That is handing over a LOT of control... 
1	1523459195	2	Honestly, sell it all to fiat or tether. Wait for the next pump n dump on the coin of the day. Jump in early and dump out early. Take your 10-20% gains and then do something else with your money. You’ll have less stress and more money.
1	1523459787	2	hi im certified reddit finanical advisor and my recommendation is just put $10 into every coin on etherdelta
1	1523457932	2	I really don't consider Vechain a risky investment. Plus, most people are locking up their tokens for Nodes to generate passive income. If anything, with all the sponsorships/partnerships they have acquired, I feel comfortable and safe. Total market cap really doesn't reflect my thoughts on how safe an investment is.
1	1523457981	2	this is when you know the bull is coming back - rate my portfolio threads. moon incoming. 
2	1523459227	2	I never thought I'd say this.... i miss the "rate my port" threads.   Definitely signs of a solid bull run.
3	1523459519	2	Flair Checks out 
1	1523458063	1	Can you explain that age as a % rule?  So like if I'm 40 i can invest 60% of my money into high risk investments?  
2	1523459328	3	It is a general rule of thumb that my finance professor used to talk about. I don’t remember where he got it from, but I have heard it many times since then. The idea being that the younger you are the more you should allocate towards risky investments because if you lose your ass on a risky investment you have more time to recover losses than someone who is about to retire. It isn’t a perfect rule as it doesn’t account for each persons own thoughts in regards to risk adversity, but it does set you up to potentially net large gains over the course of your investing career. With that said, in the traditional sense of this application a “safe” investment might be land or gold and a “risky” investment might be a stock. My application here is leaning HEAVILY on the risk side of things since even the safest of crypto investments is riskier than anything on the S&P 500 vaguely speaking. TL/DR: Yeah man.Also I should mention I dropped that class before midterms, dropped out of college, and joined the military. So the weight of my financial advice should be balanced evenly with that of a 5 year old wiping boogers on a Forbes magazine. 
3	1523462286	1	No, it's 120-age in % you should invest in riskier assets (e.g. index funds, select individual stocks) rather than safer assets (e.g. bonds, annuities, etc...). Crypto definitely does NOT fit in the "riskier assets" bucket, it sits in the "very very very very risky" bucket. So if you're 40, 80% index funds/large cap stocks, 20% bonds. Nowhere does it mention crypto.
4	1523465877	1	I wasn’t saying crypto would fit in that slot, just that I was applying a similar rule as a breakdown in my crypto portfolio. Thanks for correcting my numbers, I knew it felt a little bit off! I hope you have a goodday and your bank account has an even better one!
2	1523459826	2	"High-risk investments" are usually considered to be non-bluechip stocks. Crypto is several degrees of risk above that. I'm 35, and I absolutely wouldn't put that large a percentage of my retirements funds into this. Even if my 401(k) started offering a crypto fund, I probably wouldn't put in more than 10-15% of my nest egg. 
1	1523459694	1	Sounds reasonable as a crypto strategy (with the caveat that crypto investments are inherently significantly riskier than stocks). Good luck!Edit: FWIW, a professional financial advisor I know recommends Ripple. I've put $140 into it so far.

2	1523451099	1	You may have misunderstood, i am speaking of the coinburn that ahould occur this month, bininance buys back a bunch of coins before the burn as we know, but last time the usd price went up, this time, i noticed that the bnb/btc price has went up to ~$24 USD. I may be wrong, correct me if i am.
3	1523452621	1	Yes, you are wrong. It has gone to an ATH vs BTC. However, BTC does not have the same value as it used to. The USDT value you see is BNBs actual value vs Fiat which is about half of its ATH that was hit shortly before the January burn.BNB satoshi value = ATHBNB fiat value = <50% ATH

1	1523441121	3	I like that they have a product, demo videos etc and could in theory work with any of the other supply chains. Hold a small amount as a moonshot.
1	1523441138	4	Probably one of the best projects this year, seems very likely to make big moves once some more volume and confidence returns to the market.Has more of an actual working product than many of the coins in the top 20, it has a team that consistently delivers progress updates without feeling the need to hype them with pre-announcements, they've been hitting every proposed deadline so far.I actually have the majority of my portfolio in it, I'm very optimistic about it.

1	1523436088	2	Make sure you have registered your EOS tokens before the main net launch in June! Otherwise your old ERC20 EOS tokens may be useless!! 
2	1523437294	2	thanks, I am now trying to get 100EOS to get the EOSDac airdrop, so I am just checking the correct steps to not lose anything. 
3	1523437709	1	Smart man
2	1523438590	2	Yup just ended up registering my eos tokens last week! Eagerly waiting for the mainnet launch.
1	1523442035	2	I like it. Not what i would hold (beside the top 4) but it's a good of safe, mod, and one riskier coin. 8/10
2	1523461760	1	You may want to look into OMG
1	1523436464	4	50%btc 25%eth 18%xrp 5%neo 2%icx Looking to add about 1k fresh money but dont know on what.. thinking of adding more neo but I also have my eyes on iota what do you Think?
1	1523440554	4	Best part of the bear market was/is not to see such posts
2	1523440785	7	I am new to crypto, let me enjoy my noobishnes please. 
1	1523434478	1	Decent/10
1	1523435106	1	Looks nice and similar to mine, although tbh we probably could have just randomly pulled out 10 cryptos out of a hat containing the top 100 and would get similar returns
1	1523447748	1	8/8 m8
0	1523452798	3	Thoughts on Enigma? Seems to me it's one of the most promising projects out there right now.
1	1523457800	2	It's a game changer.  I am heavily invested in it.  Can't wait for launch!
1	1523453204	3	Give details mate. Anybody can buy a stack and attempt to create hysteria. Why do you think enigma is promising? 
2	1523453881	6	Aah yeah sorry, short explanation: 2nd layer network that offers 'secret contracts'. Basically smart contracts, but with the data being used not accesible to the node executing the code. With current data markets, once someone purchases data they own it forever. With enigma you could have facebook, for example, sell the use of their data for analysis without actually giving the companies access to the data itself. Or think of hospitals offering scientists access to all of the patiënt data without any privacy concerns (because the scientists can't see the data itself, only the results of their secret contracts). It's based on a 2015 MIT graduate thesis, for a more detailed explanation check out this [blogpost](https://blog.enigma.co/defining-secret-contracts-f40ddee67ef2).
3	1523455401	2	Good stuff!
0	1523458287	4	The bear has been slayed! Welcome back: https://www.coindesk.com/bear-market-largely-over-crypto-hedge-fund-manager-claims/amp/
1	1523459550	2	I think public statements like this after only three months of corrections are, at best, misguided optimism. The 2013-2015 bear market lasted for 17 months before the market hit bottom. Even if this bear market is only 1/3 that long, we would still be looking at June or July before it's over. I think we're going to see at least another 25% correction, and possibly more. 
2	1523460076	5	Maybe but 2013-2015 is a far different lanscape than today. Way more institutional and retail attention. You have Soros and Rockefeller funds starting, ETFs, and that was just last week's news.
2	1523460925	3	> The 2013-2015 bear market There was almost miniscule media attention on cryptos compared to today.
1	1523459091	1	so this guys job depends on getting people to throw their money at hime while he invests that money into different projects.Doesn't it make sense that this is what he'll say?what else would he say? 
2	1523459177	2	He will short the market :P
0	1523427661	2	Just loaded up on BNB 
0	1523428962	3	Am I crazy for owning a lot of ARK? Is it a meme coin like LINK or is it actually going to ever do anything?  I feel like I'm being strung along. 
1	1523430393	13	What is it with calling LINK a meme coin today? Are you being paid?
2	1523430757	5	I noticed this too about people referring to Link as a meme. These are some weird times we’re living in... who knows who is real, a bot, a paid shiller, or just someone looking for advice anymore. 
3	1523431906	2	I only read this thread as a sort of pulse of crypto. I think at least half the posts are paid or bots
2	1523434590	5	The whole meme is that link is a meme, but reddit will find out soon enough... 
2	1523430703	1	LINK has been one of the most heavily shilled coin on 4chan for months. Not really surprising that it's not taken seriously by people who haven't done research on it. 
3	1523432272	3	But those who researched are going to be well rewarded. Even ETH was shilled on 4chan when it was 3$ 
1	1523430107	5	hold it dude once the flood comes you will save us.
1	1523439376	2	Diversify away some if you need to. I sold some Ark for VeChain, and I don't regret it one bit.
1	1523429477	5	ARK is a solid project. Unfortunately, shitcoins like Verge take all the spotlight nowadays. 
1	1523439835	1	I would unironically sell some for LINK. Have you looked into it? The potential is insane 
0	1523450487	2	So what are some big events that are set to happen in April?  I know ADA has a testnet release scheduled at the end of the month.  Anything else? 
1	1523450800	4	PRL mainnet on the 30th
1	1523450609	10	Bitconnect has massive releases coming up very soon. Check em out 
2	1523452058	1	Only available on shit exchanges too so you can get in before the normies.
1	1523453911	3	Not huge, but the PRL snapshot for SHL airdrop is on 13th April. 1:1 ratio IIRC.
1	1523451939	2	IOTA's Q?
1	1523456342	1	NEX ICO.
1	1523456766	1	BNB coin burn on 4/15.  Net neutrality repeal in US takes effect on 4/23.  SUB is in closed beta and rumored to move to open beta around the NN date.
1	1523457837	1	The biggest event?  US Tax season ends on 4/17.
0	1523453501	2	is it over guise?
0	1523459036	2	HOW HIGH WE GUNNA GO EOS
1	1523460096	1	I think eos is going up because of tesla blockchain news also their main net is close!

1	1523465094	1	Every post downvoted apart from NAV, BCC and POWR, clear brigading so be careful
0	1523462705	2	Any of you afraid to sell, because there are chances that at one point the bull run starts and leaves you on tether? How do you fight that thought and decide to sell anyway?
1	1523463195	6	Take a look at the volume, general feelings of the market toward crypto, and how many bull traps there have been lately. There will always be some saying a bull run is right around the corner and there will always be somebody else saying the opposite. You’ve just got to make your own decision based on the information you have, not much else you can do. Don’t makw decisions based on FOMO.
2	1523463295	2	Thanks for that. About the volume, is there like a simple formula to know what is considered a high or low volume??
3	1523464754	1	nope. But just to put things into perspective: today's volume would have been unthinkable just one year ago. Nevertheless, in January, it was practically 5x what  it is now. 
1	1523468784	2	Time in the Market is better than timing the market. Except for when you are in a bubble.
0	1523462869	2	🌙 
0	1523462952	2	My theory is the whales keep buying, waiting 3 days and then selling. They make a small profit and they test the market. If it goes down they know people are still bearish, if it stays the same they know it’s a good sign a bull run is incoming. They can just rinse and repeat, it’s a win win for them. 
0	1523460172	3	We've had a couple of good market days this week. I'd only say, let's not get cocky. There's no concrete reason for this bear market to be over, and this could be a bull trap. I'm holding my fire because I suspect that we've still got some significant corrections ahead of us.
0	1523460900	1	We will go either to 4.5k or to 10k. It's interesting that sentiment again gets on the positive side, and I think bears already sold their assets. And there are no much more people willing to sell. To go to 4.5k we would need a massively bad news. So good sentiment is back, but we don't see a volume yet. 
1	1523462123	3	You are adopted. Is that enough bad news to drop below 4.5k? I need to rebuy my stack that I tethered
1	1523461078	4	There’s no good sentiment. I would place a bet that if the market starts a good bull run, 70% of everyone in it today will sell out and never come back. It will be the shortest bull run in market history.
2	1523461915	6	People are greedy though.  A lot would see a bull run and think "just a bit more".
2	1523461885	3	Nah once it hits 10k everyone that says they'll sell will fomo in more because it's gonna moon this time then we have 30% gains daily for a week
2	1523461730	1	Ok, I put it wrongly, but we already hit the sentiment bottom ( I measure sentiment every day ) and we are already recovering. I think it's important that sentiment is not going further down. 
3	1523462072	1	It’s just a Dead Cat Bounce on the sentimental chart.
2	1523462213	1	Where have you been the last three months? 90% of the people here talk about being down more than 50%.I doubt they're going to sell to break even.
3	1523464555	1	I think by now they realize they will never break even. I think they’ll take the loss during a short Bull than risk further losses after.
0	1523461626	2	Normies are botting in pubg to sell loot crate items for cash now.
0	1523467176	2	BTC holder. Seriously which coins should I switch to when BTC is so stagnant like this? Thinking ETH and NEO or too late already?
1	1523467584	8	NEO took such a massive hit. Not too late at all. 
1	1523467670	7	Neo imo 
1	1523467749	4	Be careful trading just because you're bored.
0	1523463667	1	Decided to take a crypto-info break a couple weeks back. Occasionally I check this reddit and man you are all delusional. The market goes down and down, but there are still 20 front page posts talking about how the bull market is here, or how it's the whales. The crypto field is booming, the crypto market isn't. There are literally 0 signs of reversal anytime soon. I'm long term bull, but cmon it's just annoying to see how everyone says tomorrow will be the day.
0	1523457640	3	Bitcoin value is built on a solid foundation of unicorn farts.
1	1523458247	3	Solid and technical analysis of BTC.
1	1523457838	2	why not buy instead of beeing salty and sorry?
2	1523457994	2	Rich people bite their lips when they make mistakes and invest in their findings.Poor people keep gambling thinking that they only need to jackpot once.
3	1523458723	2	do you think there is a correlation?
4	1523459007	1	Ive been seeing people post here and I cant figure out:>Are people ignorant of the math and think their shitcoin is going to moon.or>People dont want 10-100x gains, they want 10,000x gains and are literally gambling.Whatever the case, people dont listen, and the downvotes support this bad mentality. 
1	1523459330	1	like farts?
0	1523469869	2	People really buying eos up thinking they’re partnered with Tesla?

1	1523470046	2	Yep that's how bad things have gotten.Tesloop is not Tesla, I guess people just read the first four letters of things now. #Idiocracy>The idea came to founder Haydn (one name only; probably because he’s still a minor) in May 2015, when he turned 16 and got his drivers license. Christ

0	1523437723	1	Exchange question: i got 0,6 ONT - am i able to trade it on binance for ETH or BNB or something? Is there a way to get rid of this dust? Thanks in advance 
1	1523438196	7	Yes you can sell on binance for bnb but you must use a market order and not a limit order
2	1523438343	1	Okay. Thank you :) 
0	1523459204	1	can anyone check out HOQU? it's under the radar in my opinion, it can't be that i'm THAT early

3	1523459812	3	its true total scam shitcoin
0	1523464297	1	which coins have you been topping up during the last couple months and looking to hold through 2018?
1	1523468612	4	ONT and NEO.
1	1523469058	3	COSS & ARK
1	1523465285	4	ICX, NANO and COLX. 
1	1523467453	2	ICX, ETH, and CV as a moon shot
2	1523470465	2	ICX OKETH OKCV = good usecase but cars have a big change incoming, no one is going to own a car in the near future. Everything will be "cab--uber-like"
