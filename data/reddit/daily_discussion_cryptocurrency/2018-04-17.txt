0	1523951154	44	People buying into XVG right now should be getting baskets to carry around their watermelon-sized balls
1	1523951887	2	Thanks bro
1	1523969630	2	Apparently because of this:https://www.pornhub.com/crypto
0	1523958805	26	Whoever is pumping Dentacoin is trying to show us how irrational and insane this market is. I'm sure of it. 
1	1523959572	9	Who doesn't like teeth and dental care?
2	1523961608	15	The English?
3	1523962922	3	Nice. 
0	1523969117	27	Verge holders speculating on PayPal and they get Pornhub premium. 
1	1523969136	13	Lmfaoooooo 
0	1523974592	24	Verge: the first thing to never get a rise from Pornhub.
0	1523954913	33	I want the Verge announcement to be legit for the benefit of the whole crypto space, but I also want it to be a complete flop and exit scam for the memeconomy.Either way, I think I'll be disappointed.
1	1523955391	14	If its legitimately a big partner it would damage the whole crypto space. Same applies if turns out to be a big exit scam.I rather hope its some weird company nobody has ever heard of, price gets a big dump but verge holders will still cling to their bags - and everyone can move on.
2	1523956514	5	This. Seems like the least damaging for crypto.Huge partnership with an online DVD rental service, rather than a website update to <p>penis</p>.
0	1523986086	16	So in order to pay for porn you can now either enter your paypal, credit card or fill in KYC on coinbase, send them fiat, buy bitcoin, fill in KYC for binance, deposit bitcoin on binance, trade bitcoin for verge and pay pornhub subscription
1	1523986320	8	This may be a shock to you, but there are other countries outside USA
2	1523986909	7	Yea...down here in Texas, we like to call them commonwealths.  
1	1523987826	3	I want my wife seeing a coinbase statement not a XXX on my statement 
2	1523988403	3	Just bang your wife not your pool floaty
1	1523986262	2	Or if you're into some filthy stuff then localbitcoins > buy anonymously > transfer to binance > don't fill out KYC > buy Verge > get subscription > watch your 2 girls 1 cup movie
0	1523965645	15	Arise chickun!!!
0	1523973341	14	Stellar firmly above 30 cents for now. That’s a good sign. 
1	1523974143	3	Love to see it finally grow a bit again
0	1523969639	13	[deleted]
1	1523970052	6	He raise more then $6mil from donation, he give them few milions and he got the rest for him... how easy some people make money...
0	1523972461	13	Someone gonna tell pornhub how private that privacy coin really is?
1	1523972510	16	Well Pornhub got paid a couple million dollars for essentially a couple lines of code to add verge...I don't imagine they would care
0	1523980622	12	Interesting how TRON goes up when XVG crashes. They attract the same type of investors...
0	1523960315	23	Not screaming bullrun or anything, but feels really good that the market has  managed to stay somewhat at the same level for these past few days. And cheers for everyone holding those bags that got some nice gains!
1	1523963372	9	Volume up 36% over the last week too
1	1523965853	3	let's touch 8420 and this would be a good success 
0	1523975402	22	Pornhub: “Ok, let’s hear your pitch.”XVG: “We’re all about slow builds, fast crashes, and unrealistic expectations.”Pornhub: “I’m listening...”
0	1523975678	22	The only people who have ever paid for porn are those people who donated 75million XVG to Verge to pay for a partnership with Pornhub. Rekt. 
1	1523975995	5	 I'm gonna mortgage my house to get you more upvotes.
0	1523977412	26	bcash is a shitcoin
0	1523951352	13	NASA Tests Ethereum’s Smart Contracts for Space Exploration  Such awesome news for ETH
0	1523967840	12	Got in verge last night. Just cashed out. Feels nice to take 18% profit and now I can peacefully sit on the sidelines and watch the show. 
1	1523967924	2	Welcome amigo 
0	1523974859	12	Hahahahahahhahahahshahahahahhahahshahahahahhahahaha
0	1523975878	10	Verge bagholder logic:I can use cash to buy things at Target.Target has partnered with cash!I can use my debit card to buy things at the grocery store.The grocery store has partnered with my bank!
0	1523983790	11	I'll be watching Pornhub later and I guarantee you I won`t be needing any Verge
0	1523985428	11	Gosh, is it a XVG subreddit?
0	1523986607	11	Verge Cash is the real Verge.  Those Verge Core guys want to act like they have the sponsorship with MindGeek - but it's really Verge Cash that deserves this partnership.Verge Core supporters are jealous shills.Sincerely- Justin Ver
1	1523987012	3	Justin Ver(ge) the ultimate Vergin 
0	1523956105	9	Is the HODL phrase retired? I rarely see it these days. 
1	1523960626	7	I'm a holder. Its worked out well for me
1	1523957273	9	It does feel like posts in this sub are mostly (wannabe?) day/short term traders now. I still hodl and accumulate.
1	1523956180	5	Let’s see how it plays out for verge. I’m already seeing people saying they “are not going to sell”. This is why people got burned in January so bad. Some people learn and some don’t. 
2	1523956471	13	Without hodlers the burn would have been even more severe 🤔
3	1523956792	3	Okay bran the HODLER
0	1523974103	10	Two girls one dump. Fucking creasing up. So glad I don't hold Verge
0	1523974794	11	Good. Go down more. You are a terrible example to the cryptosphere. 
0	1523976006	10	Can someone clue me in as to why the "vergens" are upset about Mindgeek (owners of Pornhub and Brazzers) are now accepting XVG? Pornhub is the largest porn site in the world. Practically everyone knows who they are. I bet most of us in here have seen people in public with Pornhub shirts or hats etc. TBH, I thought that the XVG devs were going to scam investors and not announce anything, but from what I can tell they delivered. Any thoughts?
1	1523976117	13	who the fuck walks around with pornhub merchandise?
1	1523976155	11	Raising millions of dollars to add a payment plug-in to a website that nobody pays for anyway?That's your idea of delivering?
1	1523976513	6	They're upset because they all thought it would go to $1 XVG. And sunerok said it would be a top 3 coin post announcement. And that its the BiGgEsT cRyPtO pArTnErShIp In HiStOrY. None of which were true. 
1	1523976107	4	Verge raised millions of dollars to pay Pornhub to accept their coin as payment.  I guess it's just underwhelming.
1	1523976236	3	Credit card > XVG Not to mention the goobs in crypto aren't going to pay for porn in the first place. The average joe doesn't even know what Verge is, nor does he care and the grandpas with the paid accounts barely even know how to login to their accounts. This is such a non event.
0	1523958633	20	NEO my boy ;)
0	1523979856	17	"Honey, it's not what it looks like, I was doing some crypto reseach."
0	1523954209	10	ADA looking really strong. 
0	1523969043	9	[https://www.pornhub.com/crypto](https://www.pornhub.com/crypto) LMAO.
1	1523969351	6	I wish I could click this but I'm at work :-(
2	1523969713	5	I'm in a cafe with many families and children around. Decisions decisions
2	1523969605	2	[Screenie for you:)](https://imgur.com/gallery/ay1PK) 
1	1523969596	10	pornhub is not anymore the way it used to be MMM MMM NO NO NO
0	1523974691	9	I was really hoping for an exit scam.
0	1523980362	10	Volume is slowly going back up again. From 14B in the weekend to 17.5B today
0	1523971064	9	Sex sells, I’ll give them that. 
0	1523972891	8	think crypto just rekt twitter
0	1523976062	8	ZRX pumping quietly for a few days now.
0	1523969172	16	Wow, of course the Vergins make a deal with a porn site.
1	1523969589	16	and they only had to pay 7.5 million dollars to have it as a payment system that no one will ever use! what a deal
2	1523969805	4	"Masturbating good, crypto good, masturbating with crypto gooder!"
0	1523977506	16	Get horny, go to PH to fapCan’t find anything good, decide to pay for PH premiumNah, don’t want to pay with my CCLog into Coinbase, transfer funds from bankWait three daysBuy Bitcoin, send BinanceBuy XVGUse XVG to pay for PH premiumFinally fap
1	1523977708	8	Meanwhile XVG dumps 25% right before you hit pay making the whole process cost 200% more after fees than the standard way of paying.
2	1523977946	7	 Not sure that this math checks out but yeah
0	1523968947	22	The future has cum. Damn i hate Verge but this Slogan is a killer
0	1523969320	13	Verge is dropping faster than my computer can handle. Binance keeps crashing...
0	1523969365	14	That's a big XVG dip. Crashed my Binance browser.
1	1523969546	5	This kills the Verge.
0	1523969678	15	PENIS! Literally! (Well maybe figuratively!)
1	1523969875	8	It's fappening!
2	1523969945	3	The future has cum!
0	1523976290	13	Uhh no verge shill but Mindgeek is a massive partnership, damn.
0	1523948778	7	charge!!!
0	1523954268	7	I'm sensing a nice little alt bull run over the next few days!  C'mon Btc just slowly march your way up to 8.8k or so over a week.  
0	1523961249	7	Just noticed: Nice new reddit design you got there /r/cryptocurrency. Good job to whoever did it! :)
0	1523966165	6	The FOMO is coming...
0	1523970240	6	So this announcement appears to be a premature ejaculation of sorts.
0	1523971338	7	This daily tread is one of the most enjoyable ones i've seen in a couple months. So much hate/love for verge, then Verge partners with pornhub, then they don't partner with pornhub, cardano shoots up etc, etc, etc....
1	1523971537	2	Verge partnering with pornhub to make Cardano shoot up? Nice!
1	1523974430	2	The entertainment tends to cum and go.
0	1523973781	7	Where the fuck is the partner?
1	1523974086	2	From Verge's sub it seems to be Pornhub
0	1523974165	7	The IRS [requires you to disclose purchases made with crypto](http://fortune.com/2018/01/29/bitcoin-taxes-cryptocurrency-irs/) - what's the point of paying for Pornhub with Verge? If you're hiding it from your wife, it's going to be on your tax forms....hell, it might be even more public to use Verge than a credit card.
0	1523974752	7	Well, we warned them.
0	1523974788	7	Verge falling hard, my binance is locked up but I can see it flashing in the tab bar.  890 sats and falling.
0	1523976403	7	So, people are going to start arguing about the size of their "Partnership"?
1	1523976488	9	Being able to pay for something isn't a partnership dawg
2	1523976653	4	Still a better adoption example than most of 95% of the other shitcoins that exist.
1	1523976972	3	This is pretty decent partnership I would say. I do not know why people are so negative about this?I do not even own verge.Good luck to guys who own verge
0	1523980481	8	Anyone here hold Devery? Seems like a small-cap gem.
0	1523982841	7	Who the hell pays for porn!! Just kidding I have some Verge. 
1	1523982922	2	>  I have some Verge. You good fam
2	1523983348	3	Thanks fam
0	1523984727	7	Volume on xvg is bigger than his marketkap 😂😂
0	1523966566	19	Honest question: scam or not, what's the point of Verge as a privacy coin when Monero has already been so successful?
1	1523966837	18	The truth is that there’s no pointMonero has been the best privacy coin since 2014
1	1523967204	10	Competition drives innovation. Not that I believe in Verge, but having competitors in this space is always a good thing
1	1523967558	3	Many Vergins seem to believe that "Wraith protocol" is the better than anything Monero has to offer.
1	1523966973	2	Making devs shitloads of money.
0	1523969801	12	75 million XVG was raised for Pornhub
1	1523969833	7	That's a lot of tube socks.
0	1523975239	12	Not a Verge holder and never have been. Honestly think that announcement was better than what I thought would be announced. Atleast its a big company and atleast its highly unlikely to be a complete scam.Hope people had stop losses set up. 
0	1523975330	12	So do I understand this right? Pornhub got a few million from Verge to accept them as payment, Verge crashes to zero and dies, Pornhub can now remove the Verge payment method and got a few free millions?
1	1523975744	7	Pornhub generates most of its income from advertising ~  it gets a lot of views and that sells advertising.......    and to the vergins oit there:   how do you think pornhub gets so many views?   FREE PORN......  that already makes xvg obsolete.
0	1523979771	11	I'm gonna try to talk objectivity about the "Massive partnership" with XVG and Pornhub. Firstly, getting crypto integrated with the porn industry is pretty big, porn is the driver in almost all technologies. I'm happy for the XVG bag holders for not getting scammed and actually getting a decent announcement, I wouldn't call it the biggest ever, but its a good one. My issue and concern with the whole thing is the claim that it is a "Partnership". Companies do not pay millions of dollars to partner, to me this an agreement. Pornhub had agreed to integrate Verge on there networks for a fee (which was paid for by the verge holders through donations).To me, Pornhub has no incentive to integrate XVG outside of the fact they got paid millions of dollars to do so. If Pornhub wanted cryptocurrency integration, wouldn't they integrate a coin that has a greater ROI such as BTC or ETH? It doesn't make sense to only integrate XVG, the ROI for the them wouldn't be high enough, but since they got paid for the Agreement, they don't really care.So to me, this is more of a High budget marketing campaign then a partnership.That being said, it's pretty good news for XVG and Crypto as whole I would say.
1	1523980497	5	buy porn = buy winrar
1	1523980539	3	Privacy....  Btc and Eth are not Privacy coins
0	1523948831	5	Everything is rising.
1	1523948920	8	me too
1	1523949118	7	ripple is waking up! 
0	1523967621	6	NANO finally waking up dammn it
0	1523969917	6	I don't understand. Anyone that knows about crypto should have the tech savvy to know how to get porn for free. Are people really going to spend crypto on pornhub?
1	1523970128	8	Coinbase ETH > Binance > ETH to Verge > Transfer to wallet > Buy porn > pay capital gainsORBuy porn with credit card.What makes more sense?
2	1523970676	4	Or just pay through REQ
2	1523970262	2	a completely anonymous way to do tipping to webcam models where the model doesn't have to deal with a bank either. 
2	1523972539	2	Watching porn for free.
1	1523970146	5	Tipping live cams is a pretty big thing tbh (not that I do it lol)
1	1523970180	3	Oh, short answer, "yes" with an "if." Long answer, "no" with a "but".
0	1523974024	6	It's clear, Twitter is re-branding to Verge
1	1523974103	4	Big if penis.
0	1523975393	5	XVG down ---> Twitter Down. 
0	1523976221	6	Oh lol, this crypto dump the news cycle after hype never fails to entertain :D
0	1523976840	5	So, I've been toying with the idea of investing $200-$400 in a basket of alt-coins selected by Reddit upvotes, just to see what would happen. Has this ever been tried before? Would people be curious to watch such an experiment? 
1	1523977017	3	I'll watch almost anything in crypto.
1	1523977534	3	I already did this a few months ago.  I'm down. Waaaay down.  But hey, if at least one of them takes off in a few years, I could be a millionaire, so fuck it. It's like going to a casino but getting to watch your wins/losses everyday.
2	1523977956	3	Do you have a link to your post? 
3	1523978430	3	Oh I never made a post, just bought a few of whatever was being shilled at the time.
0	1523987904	6	I'm legitimately curious why Pornhub chose Verge out of all possible cryptos to accept. At least at first.
1	1523987947	11	Because verge paid them millions of dollars to
2	1523988001	8	thisit isn't a real partnership, it's a bribe
1	1523988955	4	Because Sunerok paid them millions to 
1	1523988660	3	There are plenty more obvious picks, and PH already accepts some other currencies. This was simply a bribe, PH doesn't gaf about Verge
0	1523970763	16	Honestly, PornHub accepting crypto is pretty significant.  If it was Nano, this sub would be blowing up over it. People are dissing it because "no one pays for porn", and that's probably true for most people, but pornhub is one of the largest porn sites out there, and they make a profit somehow. so someone is paying for it... And when it comes to the porn industry, it only makes since that an (alleged) privacy coin will be the coin of choice.
1	1523970968	7	I do think this is pretty significant.People who love privacy will use crypto than credits cards.I do not own verge
0	1523951465	13	Anyone holding verge should look at what happened to tron at 25 cents when they were expecting 'news'.
0	1523965161	11	I just bought something real and physical with crypto for the first time. Feels good!
1	1523966282	8	Hooker?
1	1523965297	8	Your 2000’late dude. I bought 3 ounces of blue dream with bitcoin in 2012
0	1523970443	11	So in the past you left your porn store with a brown plastic bag, not showing what's inside, but everyone knew it must be something kinky. And today, once you own verge, no one will know what you buy, but everyone assumes you bought porn. Well done.
1	1523970571	2	That's gold lmao
0	1523972921	10	Hi just leaving a non-penis related comment, pls upvote 4 the lulz
1	1523973268	5	Fuck u ~  this reddit is for vergin penis's only.....
0	1523975733	11	Verge pays PH millions to add Verge payment plugin, calls it partnership. 
1	1523976171	6	PH made an awesome deal
0	1523985553	11	just a question about Verge and Pornhubso Justin asked the Verge community to donate 75,000,000 XVG for this partnership (4.7 million USD at the time)does this mean, that VERGE had to pay Pornhub 4.7 million to partner with them?????Is this how business partnerships work? You have to pay the partner?
1	1523985670	7	That's pretty much what it appears to be, and who knows, it could have been more
1	1523985796	7	Sounds like a sponsorship to me.
1	1523986816	3	No, strategic partnerships aren't sold to the highest bidder.
0	1523986289	20	Just came back from lunch just wanted to say bcash is a shitcoin 
1	1523986632	7	I will always upvote comments like this.
2	1523987356	5	Ver is behind the failing Zcash too.  Funny that he doesn't mind this pathetic 'privacy coin' being called ZeeCash, but when people say BCash it makes him fall off his trolley and raise his middle finger.He desperately wants Bitcoin in the name of his lying coin - it is the only thing that gives it legitimacy - even though he is doing his best to destroy Bitcoin.  What a tosser.
0	1523961020	25	Tron is in top 15, Verge is going to be top 15, Dentacoin is going to be in top 50 with this speed. Didnt we all agreed that once the bubble burst, shitcoin will die first.
0	1523978720	17	Announcing my partnership with Visa and MasterCard!They have agreed to forward my payments to merchants! Huge news! 
1	1523978827	5	MASSIVE! Just went all in on VisaChain.
1	1523979204	3	And you get a 3% charge on the merchant end and get your money deposited in 30 days not to mention the chargebacks and reversals for every customer that tries to scam a business!
0	1523972410	11	.> be verge.> ask for 75 million verge for donation.> take some of it out for "ledger" and then pay your taxes with it.> pay Pornhub to accept verge and pump the price.> sell more.> "everyone" wins

0	1523964872	4	Can I ask for advice here?
1	1523965519	29	A bit of careful trimming of the bush can make the shaft appear longer than it is.

1	1523964944	9	Of course, but people will probably just try to get you to buy their shitty coin bags.

0	1523986720	5	V means Verge
1	1523987642	3	When Vechain Thor was banned...V was used as one way to say the coin's name.Now I guess V stands for Verge.

0	1523963735	7	i grabbed so much popcorn i don't know if i stacked up enough just 3more hours to the Show.
0	1523967590	8	Jesus verge is up 260% on the month and still pumping. If this doesn't drop to record lows after no announcement I may genuinely get out of crypto, as there is no way this market follows any legitimate pattern or logic. It's just absolutely fucked. I mean good for you guys, balls of steel, cult like support but still it's undeniable that it there are some glaring red flags and still it performs unbelievably well. Crazy.

0	1523978217	8	is there any news about Verge today? just scrolled through the sub and havent heard anything about it
0	1523952634	4	so...no exit scam of verge coming?
1	1523955635	2	10am Eastern
0	1523952657	4	Damn, I should go to sleep but am contemplating pulling an all nighter so I can try to sell XVG near the very top.
0	1523954687	3	Hey guys, I don't know if this will get any responses. I know that this sub is more about shilling and trolling, but thought I would try anyway. I don't mind patronising comments and I am more than prepared to be shut down or whatever, I want to be educated on this issue. But one thing that I'm wondering about is how would a crypto currency, say Bitcoin or maybe Nano idk... be able to act as a global currency when time and time again a global currency has proven to be ineffective in comparison to national currencies? Like for example the Euro, while many say it is teething issues, it does have drawbacks in that one side of the currency is backed by industrial, highly productive manufacturing based countries like Northern Europe whilst the other half is based on tourism and consumer goods which are more prevalent in Southern Europe. Would this not be an issue? Or would different market prices in different countries fix this? And surely if this is solvable, wouldn't we (the free market) be adopting BTC rapidly as a global currency seeing as the growing consensus is that we need a global currency? I might be wrong on this but this is an assumption that I see regularly on economics journals, etc. Hopefully someone can help me xxx
1	1523958812	2	Crypto isn't going to become the global currency in one snap - it's going to take time. Slowly more and more businesses will begin accepting crypto. This will increase with popularity similar to how we now can pay with our phones because companies have upgraded to cash registers that allow this. Next thing you know almost every major business accepts crypto and we've already hit mass adoption
1	1523969734	2	The Euro is only a "problem" because the Southern European countries that want to inflate the currency (by printing more) cannot.  It's a concept totally alien to pre-mined crypto which, with one bound, escapes the entire concept. The currency itself is the strength.   Any government actually attempting to base their economy on it would need to use different tools in their macro-economic policy to stimulate purchasing.We see the extreme example of the Venezuelan Petro.  Entirely unsurprisingly, this incompetent and corrupt government is attempting to "print" Petros as "free money".  They've claimed that is to be backed by oil in the ground but...are also encouraging Venezuelans to *mine it*!!! WTF?Crypto-enthusiasts and Venzuelans (having more than passing acquaintance with the concept of inflation) see straight through it and scorn it. As a result, the Venzuelan government will (eventually) be forced to recognise that the free market is the only way to grow their economy.
0	1523957420	4	Question: People are posting links to an image or websites etc. Wouldn't it be possible for a virus to be implemented in those links? And people owning crypto in more danger of being hacked? I don't know how this works and if it's even possible so correct me if i'm wrong. Just thought it might be important
1	1523957730	2	As long as you dont send any tokens from your wallet, download softwares or enter credentials, you're fine
1	1523961644	2	I've been asking myself the same thing. Good thing you asked others instead of asking yourself like I did.
2	1523962631	2	Haha so true, i've kept it for myself as well but thought: why not ask it?
0	1523966274	3	Go on XVG sellers, buy that Cardano up. You can now benefit from Tethering.
0	1523966493	3	The people heavily invested in Verge are going to be in for a surprise, shit's getting pumped as hell before the "big" news and when it finally is released, you won't even be able to catch the knife.
1	1523966938	5	Most XVG holders won't even see the knife falling and they'll blindly support their coin until its literally worth $0 and removed from all exchanges. 
2	1523967683	3	Agree, most of them seem so delusional, they will hodl no matter how bad the news. As seen with the hack the other day. Other coins would have dipped, not so Verge. Dev said: it was a minor problem and we fixed it within 3 hours. They trust him blindly and hodl.

0	1523974922	5	Let's see how low this goes. I'm guessing a 60% drop off on the BTC ratio at least
0	1523979673	5	Pavel Durov (who created vk.com and Telegram messenger) said that he creates "decentralised movement to protect digital freedoms and progress". It will be called 'Digital Resistnce' and Durov promises to send his own money (millions of dollars) to "bitcoin-grants" for VPN and proxies providers.   This is happening while Russia tries to ban Telegram in Russian part of internet. I find it interesting, because there were rumours that Telegram wanted to create its own cryptocurrency. Imagine if you could send money via just Telegram messenger.

0	1523945775	19	please Verge, let it be an exit scam. i can't wait for all the memes
0	1523950483	6	Despite all the facts is anyone else feeling FOMO on Verge? Can't be 12 year olds bringing highest volume
1	1523950658	6	The volume is Crazy... 
1	1523950926	7	You underestimate how stupid crypto buyers are
0	1523962168	7	Lmaaoo who just market bought shitload of wtc. I was surprised when at the moment wtc was at 0.0225ETH and the next moment my 0.023999 sell order went through
1	1523962948	7	I bet it's the guy who is in charge of the Walton twitter account. 
2	1523963128	4	Just adding to his stack of WTC he won in the last competition.
0	1523970277	7	Well i mean its not what i expected but its still one of the bigger partnetships in the crypto space. Congratulations to the Verge holders
0	1523973533	8	Alright its 10am EST wheres this announcement lmao
1	1523973593	4	Jokes on us Verge had its fingers crossed when it announced the announcement!
0	1523978356	8	Why is this hyped up as a huge partnership. Unless you are incentivized to pay with XVG then this doesn't matter
1	1523978573	6	unless there are incentives for using any cryptos, do you think any of them will matter? At least a 5-10% discount for using a direct payment method...
2	1523978685	5	Crypto as a currency makes less and less sense as more time goes by. Blockchain tech has much better and applicable uses.
2	1523978834	5	Many cryptos are used for utility functions for their specific service, thus the arguement that crypto = fiat is null. Future of crypto is not acceptance as currency to replace fiat, but the fundamental problems in daily business and institutional practices that it solves. That's what will drive acceptance of crypto and bring value
2	1523979817	2	Businesses are already incentivized to use cryptocurrency through 1 hour or less money deposits, 3% more revenue than credit card purchases and less scams where customers reverse charges on legitimate purchases saving thousands to hundreds of thousands.
0	1523964753	16	I seriously hope verge tanks today
1	1523966345	10	The Vergins are in full-force on this subreddit doing damage control. Expect downvotes across the board and minor-brigading.  Verge has:Announced they need 75 million coins to announce a **potential** partnership  Announced they have been hacked, where the hacker has mined a huge number of coins.  Claimed they fixed the hack, but the exploit was still present and being exploited.  They then accidentally forked the currency trying to fix this exploit.  News has come out showing the creator of Verge has been arrested over 20 times - perhaps not relevance, but shows a person who makes continual poor life decisions.  The donated funds now move out of the account, people question this and are told "It's to fund Ledger Nano integration" - Ledger team confirms that A) You don't need to pay to integrate into Ledger Nano and B) They have nobody at all working with Verge.  Partnership announcement is today at 2 pm GMT - that is, of course, unless their homepage changes to a white screen with the word "penis" on it.
1	1523965359	3	Me too, I sold my $20 worth of Verge at a loss of $9. I really want to feel that I made the right choice for once in my life. 
2	1523965494	15	Wow $20????? I didnt know we've got whales on this sub. Also I hope you recover from this huge loss. 
3	1523965773	13	Oops, didn't mean to flex. 
0	1523977547	13	Who the fuck even pays for porn? If I want to watch a skinny teen being fisted by a mature bbw I'll watch it for free thanks.

1	1523977830	3	Sophisticated, classy people pay
2	1523980053	2	*holds pinky out*  Yes, only the most civil of us pay for good, honorable smut.
0	1523950142	11	I might stay up all night to watch the Verge drama, it's better than the NBA playoffs or sex even
1	1523950677	5	And what if they come up with a huge name? 
2	1523950837	5	Then it's good for all crypto, why not? But it's not just about the name, it's more about what exactly they're going to do. If it's just shaking hands and nothing verge is rekt...
2	1523950811	5	Unless they're announcing google or goldman sachs, this thing will dump faster than diarrhea 
0	1523971080	12	I've always laughed at `Verge` but........online porn is one of cryptos most obvious use cases.  I don't know if this will ever materialize but there are people who do pay for porn, sex toys, etc.  It's a huuuge industry.  I worked at PHE, Inc which is the largest porn and adult sex products distributor in the US  during the 1990s.   Anonymity and privacy the fact that people don't want to give out their private information and credit cards to porn companies was a huge deal.   
1	1523971499	11	Pornhub was already accepting bitcoin as payment system
0	1523955007	14	Got out of XVG, made a nice 1.3 ETH profit. Let the dump begin 
0	1523946498	11	How to lose 95% of your holdings in 1 hour?Buy verge just before the announcement. 
1	1523950346	2	I remember being on the Verge train back in December. They hyped up an event so much that it fell flat on its ass. I’m staying clear. Good luck to all those who are brave and maybe even make money today. 
0	1523952672	10	I'M SELLING. 6 hours left is close enough for me. What a day. Thanks for allowing me to add 25% more NANO XVG you shit coin. 
1	1523952911	4	You’ll either be disappointed upon waking tomorrow morning or very happy. Either way profits are profits so you can’t complain about that, well played
0	1523973811	10	Lol to everybody thinking this is a HUGE partnership. Pornhub was probably paid millions in that crowd funding scam just so that Verge would be accepted. I seriously doubt Pornhub even gives a shit about Verge. There is still plenty of time in the day, but mass media coverage? nope, you guys got played.Oh and someone should probably tell Pornhub that Verge isn't even private. 
1	1523974137	4	I've been skeptic of verge for a while (but slowly changing), but to play devil's advocate, PH generates billions in income. Why would they take a few millions from the crowd funding unless they at least see a use case. It probably creates more work for them to figure out integrating verge.  
2	1523974661	2	While I do not think its huge as they promised, but still think this is bullish news. Not here to comment whether or not XVG is private. But there are guys who pour money into cam girls. If this partnership entails that then its good for XVG in general.
0	1523976496	10	This whole "nobody pays for porn" thing is kind of hilarious. The industry is massive, and most of the money comes from cam sections (and many Mindgeek websites have those). I didn't even own Verge before a few minutes ago, the Mindgeek thing is huge. If it was just Pornhub, fine - but after Brazzers has come out with the same and the Mindgeek announcement on the Verge forums, it seems pretty legit. And I could see it costing several million for the advertising (though requesting it of your holders is scummy).Still. This is a really big deal.
1	1523976642	4	Yeah the porn industry is so incredibly wealthy it’s insane. The people acting like this isn’t a big deal are either clueless or just haters 
0	1523970909	6	Today is shaping up to be one of the most fun in the daily thread :)
0	1523974811	5	Perhaps people will start learning
0	1523977410	5	Funfair just announced partnership 
1	1523977805	5	Out of nowhere too.  I dunno, sometimes I prefer no news and then BAM!  Eliminates the pump/dump, although it is fun to have speculation sometimes too ;)
0	1523948471	3	If you look at the 30 day percent increase on livecoinwatch you can see that we have coins with 50%+ increase. Most of them are in the green, even Bitcoin is 3% higher than it was a month ago. I like it
0	1523952139	3	I think i never seen so much volume like now on xvg...
0	1523954076	3	So whats verge's announcement?
1	1523954892	6	6 hours from now
1	1523956454	2	A payment processor i guess.
0	1523956832	3	Can't you just play whale by buying small coins and just pump and dump them? Of course there probably won't be anyone to buy them from you :/ 
0	1523957226	3	What are your guys thoughts on Verify CRED?Low Supply: 13.3mAll Time High Price: $4.50 ICO Price: $0.23 Current Price: $0.18-$0.20 All Time High MC: $54mThey haven't been listed on a large exchange yet only on small ETH exchanges such as IDEX and EtherDelta.

1	1523958452	3	Was shilled a lot as a low-cap coin and the price pumped like crazy during the bull run, seemed like a decent project as well. I think if the project makes any progress it'll make some $ if it EVER goes to a real exchange. 
0	1523968388	3	Come on ETH. 
0	1523968691	3	Holy crap, XVG partner is PornHub: https://www.pornhub.com/cryptoNow what??? Price up or down???
1	1523969307	6	So they have paid pornhub to accept verge? Not exactly what I would call a partnership.
1	1523968770	10	I predict the price will spring upwards and then slowly dribble down
2	1523968899	3	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
1	1523969000	6	huge dump incoming obviously. Who the fuck pays for pornhub and bothers to buy verge for that.
0	1523973302	3	when is the right time to buy? Thinking I might wait for the market to dip a little after a solid week, but that may not happen
0	1523974092	3	Twitter partnership incoming!
0	1523974159	3	the dump is on
0	1523974180	3	ITS PORNHUB HAZHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED 
0	1523974270	3	Wish there had been some way to short verge
0	1523974562	3	There you go 
0	1523975064	3	Verge bags getting flattened...
0	1523975180	3	Pornhub partners with Verge - immediately regrets the decision as Verge shows a limp dick pattern in TA. I guess the Vergins just have to keep waiting for that ejaculation...
0	1523975229	3	curious why would people buy a coin that is obviously dumping, especially as it only just begun
0	1523975899	3	That was a solid XVG dead cat bounce.... To the floor they go! 
0	1523975960	3	gonna fap one out to the XVG news, just not sure if it's an anger fap or an excitement fap... hmm.
0	1523983231	3	Johnny Sins buying dem verge!!!
0	1523980564	8	I dislike XVG a lot but must say the announcement was pretty big. If it stays out of bad press for a while then I think XVG holders could be in for some gains. Luck of the draw I guess. My sentiment about Verge doesn't change though and I still have massive concerns about the project, devs and even the new partnership. I won't be touching XVG with a barge pole but its fair to say this took most of us XVG haters by surprise. 
1	1523982771	3	Glad to hear your honest opinion. Most ppl are on the extreme. Either they hate or blindly follow. I myself own XVG and also have been banned from their sub for pointing out the shady nature of team/project. But have to say this news is bullish overall. Definitely overhyped by dev team but any adoption news is good for this community!
0	1523973651	6	Exit scam confirmed?
0	1523974436	7	XVG shitcoin crashing like a MOFO
0	1523976463	8	I think the jokes are funny, but this is a big deal, someone must be paying for Pornhub to keep it in business.....
1	1523976538	5	Ads lol?
1	1523976521	2	They make millions of ads, they don't need help from anyone. 
0	1523979482	7	I don't own any or do not like XVG really because of the shadyness, but i must say XVG partnership is pretty huge.
1	1523979696	3	and their marketing is amazing to persuade people to donate
2	1523980224	3	XVG just lost all their faith based investors.   The way they dick them around....then really stuck it to them with that announcement.  Major screw job.
0	1523978514	15	Not an XVG holder but I think all the haters are pissed now coz it didn't turn out to be a complete scam. People just wanted these verge owners to lose all their money just to feed their egos.Now those guys are posting threads and comments saying how verge still sucks blah blah or who pays for porn. There is a reason that porn and the adult industry is a billion dollar industry. Just because you don't pay for it, doesn't mean no one does. Else why would sites like Brazzers even keep producing content? More than that, what matters is the exposure that verge is going to get. At the end of the day, it is all about adoption and adoption by your average joe. More people will probably know about Verge soon than your quality "coin".Some idiots are also laughing at the XVG holders since the coin value dropped after the announcement. But isn't this the case with a lot of alts now? Most people sell the news.In the end, it didn't turn out to be a scam so these haters will bring up new reasons to hate verge. The extent to which people will go to prove themselves right. 
1	1523978823	3	As far as main stream attention, I’m curious if it will now be the “porn coin” or the “crypto for perverts.” 
2	1523979103	2	Porn is always at the forefront of new technology. That said. This is crypto, never hold through the announcement, you can always buy back after the dip.
0	1523947098	5	Put some cash into XRP or ONT ?

Probably one of if not the lowest market cap coin on Binance. ENJ looks ready.STRAT looks ready.I say you could buy a few of those coins and make money within a week.
1	1523986061	2	AMB is my 2018 moonshot. Yee boi
0	1523961665	9	Right now, the alts are kind of doing well, so I expect this WTC run to go far higher.  The volume is low and it started and it is not uncommon to see 20-30% daily gain in the current market.  In other words, buy the dip.  
0	1523946405	4	Verge could also be an exit scam, but that fucker went up 265% in one month !

2	1523983211	3	Don't mind if I do...
0	1523970839	7	This is weird, it's bouncing back so hard,... Verge is on the top 
1	1523971000	3	Purely because of the size and speed of the dump and the volume traded... some people can't help themselves and saw it as a buying opportunity.  But this mini bounce will die fast and the bleed with begin in earnest.
1	1523971020	3	The bounce backs we always expect from Bitcoin

0	1523976152	5	By CHRIS MORRIS 10:18 AM EDTMindgeek, the biggest company in adult entertainment, is adding crypto to its payment options. The owner of Pornhub and Brazzers announced Tuesday it was entering into a partnership with cryptocurrency Verge.The partnership sent Verge prices soaring more than 22% in the hours before the announcement, as investors awaited the long-teased partnership announcement. Verge began hinting a big partner was coming last month, launching a crowdfunding campaign with a target of collecting 75 million worth of the crypto. It’s unclear at this time if Mindgeek took an ownership stake in the currency.“Pornhub is a global organization with nearly a hundred million daily users,” said Vergefounder Justin Sunerok. “This partnership represents an enormous market with a global reach that will compete with fiat currencies. It’s huge for Verge and we’re extremely excited to finally be able to announce it.”
1	1523976220	5	> The partnership sent Verge prices soaring more than 22% in the hours before the announcement,And then dropped 43% right after the announcement, funny you forgot to mention that
2	1523976492	2	Funny you never heard of buy the rumor, sell the news. Of course it’s going to dump short term, no one is using verge on those sites yet. The instant gratification noobs are so annoying. The future of Verge is what holders are interested in. If you’re a trader, you bought the rumor and dumped the news. What else is new? 
3	1523976590	3	Seems like a definite buy to me. I can't understand why anyone would be pissed about getting a partnership with a Fortune 500 company.
1	1523976335	7	And the crowd goes mild!
1	1523976427	5	Nice top 3 coin. BiGgEsT cRyPtO pArTnErShIp In HiStOrY
0	1523977147	5	Am I the only person who believes that this partnership actually isn’t bad. This is good for the Cryptocurrency space. Another step toward mass adoption. Mass adoption also includes the sex industry. Good job XVG. **I don’t own any XVG and never will.** 
1	1523977481	3	Sure, I mean it's not terrible. They raised money and convinced an Internet org to accept their crypto. Other coins could learn from this method, though they should be more more transparent about it.I honestly thought they were just going to exit scam, so they've already exceeded my expectations.
1	1523977779	2	You do know that they already accept BTC right?
0	1523978349	5	If we’re all being honest, while not the biggest partnership of all time as was promised (not even close), Pornhub honestly exceeded my expectations for XVG’s announcement. While they hyped it up to a level that only Amazon or Apple could meet expectations, I was honestly expecting somewhere between exit scam and a startup company with no real customers. How can an announcement exceed expectations by coming nowhere close to what was promised? I don’t know, but XVG did it in my mind.
1	1523978578	5	Just curious how this is a partnership. Seems like XVG paid them millions to have a payment button added. Why would pornhub ever say no?
1	1523978627	5	Pornhub is not a Verge's partner, they just accept XVG
1	1523978637	5	Remember how Verge needed 75 million XVG to announce the partnership? Then giving that money to PH. Every project could have done this. 
1	1523978595	2	Well when you get millions of crowd funded dollars thrown at your business, you'll probably let them add their "private" coin payment plugin onto your site. 
0	1523978953	9	I don't hold any XVG, but man is it fun to see you guys in full denial. If Nano got the same partnership you'd shout "HUGE" or "HODL xdDxD" all over the place. Hypocrisy at its finest.
0	1523948762	8	Honestly with this shit with verge going on makes me respect tokens like ICX even more. 
1	1523949716	3	I took the risk and sold off my ICX for Verge the other week. Rode it up, sold it and nearly doubled my ICX holdings.There is no way I'd risk being in Verge today though.
2	1523950017	3	Hey props to you and congrats. I wish I could have doubled my stack. However, I would never risk or have the balls to put any amount of money into Verge.
0	1523985339	8	I did shit on xvg mainly because I thought they were for sure exit scamming...the verdict still stands that their “wraith protocol” is shit, their main dev “Sunercock” is still shit and the coin overall is still a shitcoin. I still don’t get why they needed to crowdfund 75mil for this, and for support for ledger. Overall still shady. Congrats to them for still being able to pull any partner, sorry I doubted, crypto is weird 
1	1523985558	7	What about that accidental hard fork that the devs had to be notified of? What happened with that?
2	1523985645	3	That’s my point, it seems the “devs” (I still am wondering if there are more than 1 on the actual team) are pretty much clueless
0	1523946827	2	It seems like to make money in this market, you need to FOMO into something and time it right.  Hate doing that. 
0	1523950282	2	Please stop this PPT, its going on from last 24hr. 
0	1523951268	2	Today will be an exciting day
0	1523953168	2	MOD pump
0	1523955875	2	ADA is live on Huobi now. Since 2 hours ago.https://www.huobi.pro/ada_btc/exchange/Price is bigger than binance.
0	1523964452	2	So I finally got rid of  the remainder of my bag of shit (Dentacoin) and I am looking for something to invest it. What do you guys recommend to invest in? I am only buying from Binance cause I already transferred my ETH to it. 
1	1523964722	5	DYOR but I say NANO, ICX, or IOTA
2	1523965734	2	I am already holding the first one, but the last two are also very interesting. On the other hand I can also increase my NANO holdings , really difficult to choose :P
1	1523964535	1	Neo, Ven, OMG, Wan are all good prices... good coins that are either still way undervalued or just had a profit taking pullback and are likely to go on another good run.
0	1523964820	2	Will upgrading firmware on ledger force me to recover from 24 word seed ? 
1	1523965811	2	No
2	1523966240	2	Found out if your current firmware on your ledger is lower than 1.3 then you will have to re-enter the 24 word seed.
0	1523965576	2	Ralph Waldo Emerson said, To be great is to be misunderstood.Crypto Market says, Time will tell.... 
0	1523967039	2	Does anyone expect omg to pump after being listed on coinone? Or was the rise yesterday the pump?
0	1523967225	2	so on what plattform will they announce the partner? (just here for the memes)
1	1523967740	2	In Neverland.
0	1523970222	2	A big day for crypto!
0	1523971206	2	It was only a matter of time before masturbation and crypto formed an alliance.
0	1523973793	2	coinsquare's new logo, if you rotate it 90 degrees ccw, looks like it's having a hearty laugh at my expense. that concludes todays deep thoughts.
0	1523977956	2	I think Binance its happy with that volume on xvg 😂
1	1523978446	2	Holy shit! Seriously!!!!
1	1523978942	2	BNB is a good business to be in.
0	1523979671	2	All This talk about xvg. Free commerce for them :)
0	1523979884	2	How much do you guys think one would need to invest in crypto to be able to retire in 5 years (assuming all solid picks with a successful future)? 
1	1523980031	20	About $20 million so you're guaranteed to at least have 6$ million left after the next bubble pops.
2	1523980516	3	Thx, invested 20 mil.
1	1523980038	13	No one knows. But I'll take a stab at it. $10,000 to $50,000 will equal $1,000,000 in 5 years assuming you hold successful projects. 
2	1523981538	2	Shit man I hope so 
1	1523980129	9	50+ k
1	1523980365	6	150k
1	1523981559	7	1million. So you can have around 100 USD of useless coins left by the time you retire. That's enough to retire in Phillipines
1	1523980062	2	depends where you live, how old you are,  and what kind of standard of living you want
1	1523981359	2	100k
0	1523980492	2	Small hint for those that know SONM and held off investing because they've seen no intristic value (and just for those). SONM will get Masternodes and POS, which was recently put to public in their monthly report (do what you want with that info):https://blog.sonm.io/monthly-report-march-2018-421efa6927a9>Establishing the Masternode would require holding a decent amount of SNM tokens, yet the exact value and conditions are being estimated.>>Running the Masternode will benefit an owner — the more SNM tokens he’s got, the better. We are going to implement Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm to provide proportional sharing of profits between the owners of the master nodes.Almost missed that info myself. :)
0	1523980942	2	Might have already been mentioned, but whatever.......Where did bitcoin get it's start as being used as an actual currency??
1	1523981208	6	silk road
2	1523981226	7	Winner.  A place where you can buy ANYTHING at all.
3	1523981751	2	People actually bought stuff there. Not use a service in exchage for closing spammy fishing ads.
0	1523983306	2	Im only in btc right now, been waiting for a big movement in one direction or another to snatch up some alts I want when they dip because of btc.  [PLEASE MOVE!](https://i.redditmedia.com/W5yPjjgI_pvziav-7mHvh3FShOZ_rpPMPi8AF4Alczg.png?w=704&s=31c2fff7d1e0b0038fecec14c992ab0c)
0	1523984155	2	Any thoughts on BABB (BAX)?
1	1523986448	2	Was very impressed with their website. Added a small stack to my portfolio last week and will now probably keep hold of it for the foreseeable future. 
2	1523986502	2	Same.
0	1523984910	2	do you guys agree with crypto buy signals?: I have the app from the Google store here's what I just received: BTC updateCrypto Buy Signals / moments agoTo make a long an complicated story short...Time for btc to make a decision. Bulls or bears? Who is going to win? We think its 50-50. Sorry guys we have to wait and see if we open a short (against bitcoin) or a long positiòn.
1	1523985458	2	No. They don’t account for the large multimillion dollar international and cross country transactions. Just one of those destroys “investments and forex style TA. Just like today did from yesterday.
1	1523984975	3	Time to LONG. We are near bottom. 
0	1523981897	5	Fundamental analysis is almost useless in crypto.Don't kid yourself -- the smart money in this space is making a fortune off the shittiest of shitcoins.Being a purist is a loser's game.
1	1523983819	3	I wish you were wrong.
0	1523970486	5	That is actually a pretty big partnership
1	1523971527	3	I mean I am assuming they paid for it? Like how much actual value would this add to the coin given they don't actually have a network? Probably very little.
1	1523971210	2	I wouldnt be surprised if its part of the hypeeeeeee.If you are in a leadership position at a major company and approached by a crypto group. You fill your bags, announce something you dont intend to put many resources into, you sell big.Maybe you even milk it for  a bit and  DCA sell. I dont know why anyone trusts a free porn site.
0	1523974909	5	[removed]
0	1523970745	3	Watching Verge rise like a cum soaked pheonix from its spent pile of kleenex is both sad and hilarious. Who are these people?
0	1523979149	3	It’s crazy how people treat Cryptocurrency like a sport. 
1	1523980241	2	Let's go BTC, let's go!
0	1523983216	4	Wow Verge is bouncing back way more than I ever anticipatedMaybe it actually connected with a plausible use case...
0	1523970522	4	I'd rather just buy porn with FIAT than own up to ever owning Verge, is it just me? 
1	1523970617	7	Easier than paying capital gains on your crypto purchase.
0	1523946273	3	Push it boys!! Push!! 
0	1523946818	1	Sideways action today as everyone is waiting for the verge partnership lol maybe once this is done we can start having decent shilling again or start picking on Tron again
0	1523951054	3	so why does verge make 300% within a month?
0	1523953304	4	For the mathematicians among us, I have created a function to calculate XVG price movements:    price_new = price_current + abs(price_movement(good_news - bad_news))
1	1523954019	3	> price_new = price_current + abs(price_movement(fake_news - bad_news))FTFY
2	1523954199	4	infinity - infinity is undefined
2	1523954630	3	> price_new = price_current + abs(price_movement(fake_news + bad_news))FTFY
0	1523957588	3	Bros, please comment on my newest selection of my potential investmentsQASHELASTOSNEBULAS0xELECIn my opinion very stable investments (Top100 coins) except for ELEC! I´ve already put some money in ELEC but I am certain to increase my stack here since I believe in this gem. Reasons for/against the mentioned projects?All long term investments
1	1523958187	2	Wait until NAS token bonus has been released then you'll see a good entry spot most likely. And just so that you know - nothing is stable right now. So unless you're ready to lose it all don't invest right now.
1	1523960933	2	From what I've heard QASH and 0x are pretty good, but I don't hold any
0	1523969038	3	DUMP TIME 
1	1523970431	3	I'm taking one right now. Does that count?
0	1523974402	3	This is gold. I couldn't have picked a better partnership 
0	1523976646	2	Is this the dead cat bounce for the huge Verge dump?  Tune in the next 15 minutes on Dragon Ball V!
0	1523983325	3	How's JesusCoin doing today - with the news of XVG...I figure it might be pumping.
1	1523983647	2	Nahh, too much sodomy today. Maybe tomorrow but not today !
2	1523983798	3	Repent! Buy jesuscoin! Evolution is a lie!
0	1523985100	3	Goddamn, XVG is trolling the entire crypto community lol....we are gonna lose our minds when it really starts pumping back into the 20's, holeee fvck good game Verge.
0	1523970853	5	This community is so sad. I always thought verge is a scam but I atleast can now admit that this partnership is huge. But every "positive" comment about verge gets downvoted? Whats wrong with u guys?I am very sure that the subscription numbers of mindgeeks will increase. Let's be honest, I personally would never have bought with a credit card porns online but now with verge? Annoyom and fast? Without leaving my personal data? Brazzers and reality kings here i come (cum)
1	1523971496	2	Huge you say?   As in 6 inches huge????ahh, good times.
0	1523960764	5	Lol so the real reason cardano pumped is because binance was doing insider trading for ada/USDT pair
1	1523962914	3	From what I understand trading of ADA was introduced on Houbi yesterday.https://twitter.com/ADAcoin_/status/985828315943534592
1	1523961931	6	Yup 100%
0	1523951137	6	stellar lumens about to pump again. this is way better than all the other shitcoins out there. :)
0	1523971061	4	Verge is gonna sky rocket, look at the buy orders 
1	1523971467	4	Look at those dildos.
2	1523971733	3	Pun... Overload...
0	1523977973	5	Now can the volume from Verge go into real products now please
0	1523988657	4	Can we talk about how Roger Ver shows up to random conferences in random motels and tweets pictures about how its actually a bcash conference LMAO
0	1523948418	3	I wish there were more comments/discussions on various technologies individual coins are working upon, rather than comments about a coins' price. As much as we are in the crypto space for the money, it is the technology behind each coin that is going to change the world.
1	1523948642	5	there's a sub just for that, it's cryptotechnology
1	1523950193	2	I've been saying that since Jan and it's fallen on def ears. 
0	1523983919	4	Verge surprised me with the legit partnership. GJ on them.I have paid for porn in the past(maybe... 1% of the time), and I do wish the transactions had been anonymous.
1	1523984224	5	Now you’ll get to justify your porn expense and the capital gains or losses to the IRS.
2	1523984524	8	Now they can even tax you by the wank. Fucking brilliant!
3	1523984995	3	or credit you for that!! ;) 
2	1523984355	6	"privacy"
1	1523984035	2	Damn, if only porn was accessable for free
2	1523984163	2	I think you'd be surprised how many people still pay for porn for various reasons... Hell, you could build a business model around managing the various sites and teams that do porn and make a nice profit!Call it... Hub4Porn or something.
0	1523970054	3	So the partnership  was pornhub makes sense since they are Vergins.
0	1523973476	4	Hahaha, I love how the verge holders were saying it would be announced on world wide news (like cnn), and $1 was a conservative expectation after the announcement, BIGGEST PARTNERSHIP IN CRYPTO HISTORY.Now it turns out pornhub is just accepting verge as payment , wasn't announced on any mainstream news media, and the coin crashed. Yet they're still all going on about how good it is. Yet its literally nothing like they said it would be? Ayyyyy.I am in no way saying it's a bad thing. It's certainly good, but it was so ridiculously overhyped by the team and community. 
1	1523973690	3	Everyone who is in this space since december could have predicted this exact scenario but ppl refuse to learn.
1	1523973692	2	lol really? they thought it would be announced on CNN? oh come on.................... this can't be real 
0	1523987085	3	so did we have an exit scam or exit cum today? can someone please clarify
1	1523987410	2	The future has cum. (stolen from another redditor today).
0	1523971215	4	So after all is said and done ~ i gotta hand it to that ragnorok head dev guy at verge....   I mean the coin name means penis....   but that wasnt enough, and the people kept buyin...And then he takes it up a notch (roughly 6 inches) and "partners" with pornhub...Other cryptos and ico's talk a good scam game....  but when all is said and done their creative juices flow into simply typing penis on a their website....But with verge ~  damn!   They have taken this to a whole other level.....Props!
1	1523971415	8	I guess that 1.whatever million they gave to the "partner" ultimately bought them the very very vip experince at pornhub!Maybe someone needsnto tell the ragomuffin guy at verge that you dont need to pay for porn at pornhub....
0	1523987588	2	The fact that people are still supporting XVG after 1000 red flags & now such a big letdown really shows that we need to remove all warning/hazardous labels from everything. Let natural selection take over again, the world isn't meant to have people this stupid.
0	1523966689	3	ICX can go up 200% and i wont even break even. Feels Batman
0	1523979985	2	Hmm, very tempted by both TRX and ZRX.  Both are looking like they'll hold and are accumulating nicely...
1	1523980247	8	Go for ZRX!  No chance TRX will be added to Coinbase. :)
1	1523980389	4	careful with TRX, people here call it scam
0	1523947938	2	So... For Verge to dodge the bullet, I guess they only need to announce a partnership with some random we've never heard of (or care) in order to uphold their promise. This whole farce has been dragged out long enough. I just hope anyone invested in it manages to lock in their profits and not be screwed over. I don't wanna see anyone get burned.
1	1523948082	5	It's a trading market. If you make gains, somebody got burned.
1	1523948076	3	Someone locks in profits, someone will be burned.
1	1523948459	3	I don't get how them announcing a partnership with a company we've never heard of would be revolutionary though, as they keep claiming.
0	1523954164	3	Can someone confirm if Walton got listed as alibaba IoT partner? 
1	1523955848	2	Confirmed, try not to fomo to hard lol....its definitely about to break 20$+
0	1523970755	4	a weed selling wigger would score a deal with pornhubLMAO im DYING, spit my coffee when i saw it.
1	1523970854	2	You realize its not pornhub though...
1	1523971260	2	Then why haven't you?
0	1523971684	3	Vergin neck beards can now use crypto for their fappenings vs their moms credit cards. Just remember, if this pump lasts longer than 4 hours, please consult a crypto specialist at a sub-reddit of your choosing. 
0	1523986697	3	HODL!!!
1	1523986903	4	k
1	1523986998	4	ok
1	1523987180	4	okay
0	1523953341	4	have you guys seen this waltonchain news?https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8cuvuj/waltonchain_officially_listed_as_alibaba_iot/
0	1523972984	1	so many EXCELLENT news today!!!*Western Union Confirms XRP Integration of Ripple Blockchain Trial*WTC partners with alibaba*pornhub allows payment with verge *NASA interested in EThereUM
1	1523973185	5	One of these things ain't like the other ones. ~
0	1523974874	2	Lmao I’ve said for so long that Verge diehards are the most stupid people on earth, I don’t even know what the announcement was yet but this was completely deserved. Maybe they’ll end up a little smarter from this
