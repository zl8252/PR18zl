0	1525675174	50	I'm surprised at the amount of people that believe the government works this fast. Tomorrow will be nothing but bullshitting between old dudes fueld by old money to cause a ruckus.
1	1525679434	31	Exactly. Government still busy figuring out how fb makes money cuz its "for free" 😂
2	1525684332	1	Haha they cant be making money? Impossible!
1	1525700764	1	[Actually](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8gzc5i/if_you_want_to_know_who_the_enemy_is_watch_this/)Governments only appear to move slowly because they know that moving too quickly may cause them to show their hand too early, which would be devastating. So they FUD, and shill subtly using people you're familiar with (via mind imprinting from tv, ads, social media, memes etc.) Those things didn't just originate naturally, **they were co-opted** and **weaponized** by the govt. So now they control large swathes of people with just a picture and a clever sentence or two.
0	1525680027	35	Loadz the SEC FUD. 
1	1525692865	1	>As SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has stated, tokens and offerings that feature and market the potential for profits based on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others contain the hallmarks of a security under U.S. law.From the [SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/ICO). It's hard to argue against regulation when there are just so many scams out there. Honestly I think this will be good for crypto in the long run, and will shake off a shit ton of sketchy projects over the next few months. 
0	1525676055	30	Google [searches](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-d&q=cryptocurrency) for cryptocurrency almost doubled in last few days.
1	1525677833	17	Bullish.
2	1525684352	7	Time for hodlers to be rewarded.
1	1525709582	4	That could just be me.
1	1525690978	3	The search topics are mostly surrounding the SEC hearing. A lot of fucking poeple are watching this... 
1	1525702113	1	If there’s a broker/exchange with most known coin that’s like coinbase but available worldwide, you’d see a rare, legendary bullrun like never seen before since dot com bubble.
0	1525688706	24	Settle down people. A week ago you could get ETH for $600. 
1	1525690505	12	And a few week before that it cost $345 so we are already double, just go about your lives and look back in a few days like nothing happened
0	1525713695	26	idk why but I think its fucking hilarious the entire Ethereum SEC thing was a rumor. 
1	1525713762	6	hahaha, it's crypto volatality - i hope noone lost big time
1	1525714161	4	Also hilarious how easy and how long we were being lead on by it too
0	1525681253	21	If ETH really tanks it will be hard not to buy some more. People panic way too much
1	1525681365	10	Good for us to buy the dip.I'm eyeing eth and zil 
2	1525683736	5	Zil didn't drop that much on the weekend tho, kinda expect it to continue it's rise to be honest.
2	1525685822	1	Shhhh on the zil talk
1	1525681355	1	[removed]
2	1525681365	1	[removed]
1	1525683303	1	I've been waiting for a good time to buy some more. I got to less than 2% from breaking even, which hurts a little now, but I wouldn't mind having a good dump to buy some more first :)
0	1525673890	18	Gilfoyle is our new crypto mascot.
0	1525711261	18	Whenever one of my alts gets a nice little 20% - 40% pump I never sell because I convince myself "this is the breakout" and it always ends up going back down but I know that one time I do sell will be the time it moons 400%. I hold 5 alts and have never had the pleasure of experiencing a several hundred % pump. I can't imagine how good that must feel seeing it going up and up.
0	1525680278	14	ouch right in my gains
0	1525709238	17	So this whole SEC hearing was total fake news?  great
1	1525709688	12	SEC is clearly manipulating the market, we need to report this P&D group to SEC. oh, wait...
0	1525711893	16	Whoever created the ETH SEC fud probably came to this thread and laughed their ass off. 
1	1525712079	7	They are about to make millions in profit, the beauty of unregulated markets
2	1525712140	2	This.
0	1525690944	15	Just went on a shopping spree on Binance, I'm just not a Bitcoin holder, I need my alts.
0	1525685255	41	Good morning people! Finally cured my depression. Time to check my portfolio.
1	1525685329	4	Depending on when you last checked, you could be up/down by a LOT.
2	1525685417	10	Yesterday. Guess it's xanax time.
3	1525685474	4	It's lube time.
3	1525692823	2	You don't cure depression overnight
0	1525691905	43	So the S-E-C won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
1	1525693366	17	They tried to shut us down with F-U-D
2	1525694431	6	But the gains are plenty, yeey for me!
0	1525699398	14	It’s so funny to think about stocks vs crypto. My portfolio is down 10% since yesterday and I just laughed and kept on with my day. If that happened in stocks I would lose my shit
0	1525708847	14	The green is coming back. Bathe in it, soak it in. For this boys, is gonna change yours and all your loved ones lives for the better 
1	1525709297	2	Much inspire 
1	1525709872	2	Take me Shrek, take me.
0	1525711505	34	Just came back from lunch.Bcash is still a shitcoin 
1	1525711692	5	what was for lunch today? I need ideas
2	1525711982	3	daily unknowns when to buywhen to sell, Whats for lunch
2	1525711882	4	Falafel sandwich 
3	1525712379	3	sounds alright. I'm feeling chicken teriyaki and rice today
1	1525712433	5	Hope you had a good Lunch, speaker of truth!
1	1525711542	3	Never gets old
1	1525712330	3	**FREE ALLTHINGSVAIN**
0	1525674485	10	I already hated Mondays before crypto... Why more hate, why? 
0	1525687916	11	Weak hands will sell!! 
0	1525700328	11	>buy BTC at 8k, BTC drops to 7k>buy BTC at 7k,  BTC drops to 6k>Buy BTC at 10k, BTC drops to 9kIm doing really well since we are at 9k, my lesson is HODL and spend. No tether and sell.
0	1525680718	27	Should have sold everything on Saturday when everyone started talking about the sec hearing. I never learn. This sell off was obviously gonna happen.
1	1525681995	8	Now you should buy though
2	1525684464	4	Not just yet! 
3	1525694006	1	Buy after the dip on the rise? Bold move Cotton!
1	1525682079	3	Damn i am thinking the same, knew it was coming but just too lazy
0	1525686662	23	Y'all are spooked way too easily lmao. Half the people here would not survive China and Mt. gox
1	1525687539	8	The goal isn't to survive, it's to move to cash and buy back at the bottom. 
0	1525702326	11	If I get a dollar every time I say “probably will never see price that low again” ...
1	1525703797	3	Typically, the saying is "every time I hear", because you are not in control of the things other people say. Your saying "every time I say" has no meaning, because it could be anything, you could just keep saying it over and over and get rich.
2	1525704159	1	This is an excellent point
0	1525675144	21	The more 'bullish' tags I see on the main page, the more sceptical I am that things are in fact, bullish
1	1525679084	3	''be fearfull when others are greedy'' is a common known term.
2	1525683705	1	>when others **tell you they**\* are greedy there corrected it for you
3	1525684246	1	This. Haha
0	1525706127	23	My inside man messaged me, the SEC discussed ETH over coffee and donuts. They said everyone had a fun conversation and couldn't wait for the next get together. He said next week it's at Jennifers House. 
1	1525706229	4	>My inside manThat's your brain dummy!
2	1525706818	2	no can confirm, his name is Bill and he's very much real
3	1525708052	2	I know, the voices in my head aren't real - but they have such funny ideas..
0	1525708795	19	things are flipping green..VEN just flipped..looks like NEO is next..
1	1525708861	9	Prepare for the greenening
0	1525685436	8	Where is theslayerofFUD? We need him today.
0	1525702559	11	Great buying opportunities for ETH...
0	1525694815	32	I genuinely do not believe the market going down is because of the a SEC hearing.  This is just a natural pullback, we're already seeing higher lows.  This is going to be a great month of crypto. You will see.Mark my words. You will see.
1	1525694946	5	RemindMe!  Mark his words.

2	1525695018	1	RemindMe! 23 days
1	1525695224	4	I believe this as well. It's 99.99% likely it won't be made a security. CNN is reporting it's not a security. The chairman even stated unofficially before Ethereum isn't a security. If there is any FUD they're just being overly cautious or are simply uninformed.
2	1525699466	3	Sell the news.  Soon as hearing finished ETH will dump.
0	1525689733	7	Really weird reporting from WSJ: https://www.wsj.com/articles/worlds-second-most-valuable-cryptocurrency-under-regulatory-scrutiny-1525167000?ns=prod/accounts-wsjEveryone reporting this news is quoting the WSJ as their source, and the WSJ has no direct references to the SEC meeting. This is [circular reporting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reporting) at its finest, It's why no one trusts MSM anymore to report actual news...
1	1525693205	6	Mitch:	W-we're not sure what exactly is going on inside the town of Beaverton, uh Tom, but we're reporting that there's looting, raping, and yes, even acts of cannibalism.Tom:	My God, you've, you've actually seen people looting, raping and eating each other?Mitch:	No, no, we haven't actually seen it Tom, we're just reporting it.
1	1525695814	2	I recommend everyone tweet both authors of this article and ask them when the meeting is, and why it isn't appearing of the SEC's calendar.Links to their twitter accounts are provided at the end of the article.
1	1525692482	4	" said one person familiar with the inquiry.""one of the people familiar with the matter said.""discuss the matter on May 7, one of the people said."This is so weird to read. My school teacher would have ripped a page like that to shreds.
1	1525689744	2	**Circular reporting**Circular reporting or false confirmation is a situation in source criticism where a piece of information appears to come from multiple independent sources, but in reality comes from only one source. In many cases, the problem happens mistakenly through sloppy intelligence gathering practices. However, at other times the situation can be intentionally caused by the original source.This problem occurs in a variety of fields, including intelligence gathering, journalism, and scholarly research.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

0	1525711838	8	Beautiful hot Bank Holiday here in the UK, I expect plenty of buying back in starting tonight through tomorrow. 
1	1525712687	5	pissed up buying
0	1525689517	13	For all of you that will complain of high prices in 2 weeks and that you wish coin x would dip so you can buy in, now's your chance.Let's rek tether.
1	1525689673	1	Now or end of the week?
2	1525695525	1	DCA in while you see red.
3	1525697464	1	Good point. You do that like everyday at same time?Unfortunately I have no liquidity right now, that’s why I’m thinking of selling something green to reinvest
4	1525697642	3	I guess that depends on your goals. Currently, if I buy, I buy a project I believe in, and since this is really the early days of crypto,price isn't my main concern.With taxes and everything, I'm too lazy to make many trades because I don't want to pay tax.I'll pay tax when I cash out of a coin. Trader, I am not.
5	1525697775	1	Me neither, I just think I about it every now and then to increase my stack. Buy at 0,5 sell at 2, buy at 1. But I guess that would be timing the market, dangerous business
6	1525698285	1	Very...and yes, tempting.
7	1525698357	1	I guess I will just HODL through this “dip” and try to buy some. I’ve historically been only on alts, its time I get on with BTC, kinda dumb of me to have 0 on my portfolio
0	1525696716	8	Well my boy Elixer woke up with A massive green boner God damm
1	1525697040	1	ANy news about it?
2	1525698521	2	Beta release this week.
0	1525709497	7	FUN
1	1525709547	4	Fun? I'm holding. What's going on 
0	1525710391	8	If you folks really want to know where U.S. regulation is headed:1. SEC declares that Ethereum in its current form is a commodity. 2. The justification for that finding is that Ethereum does not have a central body ruling it with unilateral authority. The chain is already functioning. There is no central body with which to impose the legal requirements of a security offering. That time has passed.3. There are many other community driven coins with a functioning network that run by consensus and, thus, have no central body. This will become the line in the sand.4. Regulation will be proposed to keep jurisdiction of ICOs in the hands of the SEC and all chains that have relinquished control (become decentralized) in the hands of the CFTC depending on their function. 5. A discussion about litmus tests will begin. 
1	1525710513	4	ELI5: is all of that good or bad for crypto.
2	1525710589	3	Ultimately, clarity is always good. With clarity, everyone can "see where the road forward is". 
2	1525710671	3	 Good for ETH. Possible upward price action. 
3	1525710821	2	I'm not so sure about this. While ETH not being a security is good for it, ICO's being securities essentially takes a huge chunk of US ICO funding out because regular investors could no longer participate and US ICO funding is what gives value to the platform coins currently. It would be a mixed reaction I think.
0	1525713298	7	Etherum shooting up!
0	1525683439	18	I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed in the community's ability to interpret FUD. Come on guys, we made it through January's FUD... This is a cakewalk
0	1525687046	12	666K subscribers on /r/cryptocurrency, market is tanking and SEC might classify Ethereum a security. Coincidence?Yes, it's a coincidence. 
0	1525702530	12	All this FUD due to one WSJ article, media is powerful
1	1525702631	5	And the media is bought.  The best we can do is follow the manipulation knowing it's all gonna be ok
2	1525703808	1	Best thing is to do your own research and if you believe it's bullshit you buy the dip and wait for the inevitable recovery for easy money.
1	1525703601	2	It's a $400 billion industry and unregulated. A ~~poor or bitter~~ journalist can effortlessly make a shit load of money by publishing FUD and buying the dip.
1	1525702803	5	its only powerful if you all believe in the programming and mind control vs trusting ( or at least wanting to understand ) in real people in this ecosystemthey want us divided, scared, untrusting, etcFUCK these people.  The guy who posted the SCHILL post nailed it

1	1525699282	4	26K volume all on Forkdelta. IDEX seems to be dead forever. Not hard to manipulate a price that heavily with factors like that. 
1	1525700058	3	Don't worry, it's temporary. It's IDEX fault.
0	1525701639	4	At least my buddy ONT still loves green
0	1525705629	6	What are you buying in this dip? I'm already heavy ETH and BTC but grabbed EOS, ZRX, OMG, and VEN at lows. I'm really tempted to grab some XMR since it's so low and I don't think the Japanese news is going to hurt it long term. 
1	1525705691	7	Nothing ‘cause I already bought 2 days ago like a retard without spreading it out over a couple of days
2	1525705995	2	Me too. I did the same mistake in the past. BUT when market cap is 2 Trillion $ this mistake won't matter so much. #realisticOptimism
3	1525706100	1	True.I’m not selling a single Satoshi of my portfolio before 2020 so hopefully it won’t matter much
1	1525705660	2	Well played, good luck :)
1	1525705817	2	I'm currently shorting ETH but I'll buy some more eth when we bottom out
2	1525706237	1	Have any tips on telling when we bottom out? I guess when it starts moving sideways for a bit, that could be an indicator?
1	1525710115	2	WaltonChain
1	1525705841	1	I just got some NEBL, was eyeing it for a while as it was losing value all week and this dip pushed it over the edge. Good deal at 140k satoshi I think considering it bottomed out at 103k early april and went up to 177 since. Still 67% from ATH at this point, worth a small investment.
2	1525706193	1	Dude shh...
0	1525674063	10	gas news?
1	1525681596	4	91 Octane is $3.19 where I live
1	1525675922	8	Its pretty strong, can confirm week old burritos cause gas
2	1525680109	1	Chipotle is the way to go...
0	1525674677	9	How are people preparing for the possible ETH SEC security discussion?1). Hodl/nothing: ride the wave no matter what is decided, or assume nothing of merit will be discussed?2). Sell: move your ETH into bitcoin or tether, then buy back if it drops or before it rebounds? Timing may be hard. Possible risk. 3). Buy ETH: move alts into ETH with the expectation that if the news is good or neutral that ETH rebounds quickly. 4). Buy erc20 tokens: if the news for ETH is good, perhaps these tokens built on the platform will rebound fastest. OMG?I’m wondering what others have done or are considering. I haven’t don’t anything yet so by default, I’m under #1. 
1	1525677059	11	Hodling is the only way to win the video game.
2	1525684531	1	Hodling too. Might earn like 10&#37; more if I sold on Saturday, but what can you do right... Gotta hodl now.
1	1525681294	4	1) HODL/nothing, because:a)  Even if ETH drops a lot because of all this, I believe it'll bounce back just as quick once all the fuss has died downb) Doing nothing is easier than doing something. I choose easy Edit: Actually it turns out I did do something. Couldn't resist the dip so I bought it
1	1525675187	3	Hodling my eth & alts. Whist it is possible it seems more likely that it won’t be deemed a security
1	1525675303	2	Hoping for good news so ETH can pump and hedgers who bought ETC over last 2 days will sell me their coins and I can get a good entry.
0	1525686354	9	You are being tricked to sell shortly before consensus.Coincidence, I think not. See: https://www.sec.gov/news/upcoming-eventsAnd:https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/8hl44l/when_is_the_sec_meeting_is_there_a_streaming_link/dykt73k
0	1525693215	10	When exactly the SEC meeting about ETH will start?

1	1525709423	4	I am greedy, I want $10.7k and $1k by 5/11 or my stupid spreadsheet will be wrong.
0	1525708374	8	ITT, fully functioning adults with the patience and foresight of my 7 year old. 
1	1525708531	11	You are being too harsh on your 7 year old
0	1525692670	10	SEC this SEC that. You do realize this a ploy to drive the prices down before the Consensus Conference that will shoot up the price? Epic tinfoil hat pump and dump!
1	1525693037	3	When is the Consensus Conference
2	1525693665	2	May 14-18
3	1525697396	1	[deleted]
4	1525699472	1	Yes i heard they do and the price pumps in sync. There is more than one fud here and idiots are panic selling.
1	1525698893	2	Yep. Dumbfucks panic sell, smart fucks sell and buy back lower, medium fucks hold, and legendary fucks buy more dip.
0	1525700804	22	SEC meeting started 45 minutes ago but hey...#there is no sec meeting! it was coordinated FUD.
0	1525682729	8	EOS model of ICOs is airdrops. ICOs that use airdrops are protected from SEC’s wrath. That’s why its mooning right now.
1	1525685942	2	Plus they don’t offer their token sale to the US (directly). 
0	1525692891	9	Is that...  it...  It looks like it’s half bear, half man, half whale...  it’s ManBearWhale!
1	1525693034	2	Algore!
0	1525678782	3	Is this sec crap at least out of the way by the end of today (Monday)?
0	1525683600	3	Got some new money to invest. Where would you put it? Think im going to wait for the SEC result first
1	1525688482	1	I’m in the same situation. Just transfered a grand on the exchange and just waiting...Planing on buying ETH but will wait what info comes out.
0	1525686129	4	So quiet here today, cheer up guys we are just not ready for ATH run. We can buy some more coins before next raid:)
0	1525687509	4	Req update newsgonna be this friday?or next one?
1	1525689546	3	The next biweekly update is coming friday!
0	1525705813	4	Discount day everybody!
1	1525706280	2	I'm running down the aisles with my arm out.
0	1525708922	3	I'm happy about big money getting into the Crypto space, but I'm now beginning to clearly see who were dealing with. Greedy whales. Do we really think they wont stoop down to spreading FUD and false rumors so they can get some cheap buys? Definitely not. I've got a good feeling we are going to see some heavy manipulation this year... the big money wants in and theyll do what it takes to get their discounts.
0	1525710142	3	Banks are doing ANYTHING they can to keep the price down. They got the wall street journal to spread FUD. Bullish af on Bitcoin and Ether.
1	1525710459	2	We have learnt out lesson, never trust WSJ again. Or any other singular news article for that matter. 
0	1525712595	4	Everyone having fun trading baby brains?https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-nearly-as-bad-as-trading-harvested-baby-brains-berkshire-vc-munger/What a dumbass.....

1	1525713007	4	Yes definitly, hugeee rally coming 
1	1525713094	4	For sure. I bought in at 750 last night. No regrets.
1	1525715224	2	no doubt
0	1525680122	14	Is it just coincidence with the SEC coming in when Bitcoin almost reached 10k? At least it's sad to see all the gains from past week vanishing in a matter of days. 
1	1525680178	15	Yes, it's coincidence. 
0	1525678902	7	ETH sinking like a stone.
1	1525680433	2	yay I can buy more :)
0	1525683613	7	All in on sec coin.

2	1525703385	1	same here
0	1525710160	6	I bet bitcoin doesn't get below 9k ever fuckin again boys
1	1525710397	2	How much are you willing to bet?
2	1525710739	4	A 2nd Mortgage 
1	1525710968	2	You jinxed it!!
0	1525698708	7	All this bullish news and sentiment and my portfolio is being destroyed.
1	1525699679	5	Great buy day. These are the days you make money on.
1	1525699275	3	I feel your pain.
1	1525699068	1	It'll be good G. In a few days you'll forget all this.
0	1525705270	9	Heavily loaded up more ETH. Thank you weak hands. No way the SEC is going to classify ETH something else than a commodity. 
1	1525705765	2	Is the meeting confirmed? Can't find anything planned on the SEC or CFTC event page. 
1	1525705930	1	The problem is that it would cause chaos for something that is rightfully in a gray area. They applied rules after the fact in this case and the original ICO has plausible deniability because they did consult a lawyer and did make statements saying ETH is not a security, it is for deploying contracts and paying the miners. 
0	1525675299	13	SEC’s Chairman has already stated Ethereum is not a security. However, this is not the final verdict.source: [https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/05/06/big\-day\-eth\-secs\-chairman\-already\-stated\-ethereum\-not\-security](https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/05/06/big-day-eth-secs-chairman-already-stated-ethereum-not-security)
0	1525681414	6	Any idea why EOS is surging?  Not that I am complaining. 
1	1525682100	9	Eos team pumping their own coin from time to time,. Lot of wash trading to increase volume
0	1525697133	7	Mod really needs some damn volume.
1	1525697548	4	>I really need some more moneyFixed that for you
2	1525698156	3	Touché
1	1525699376	2	Why would anyone buy a coin that was years away from delivering any return on investment whatsoever?
1	1525697867	1	Nah it does not. The mod price rally will start at the end of the year when the dividends payout gets closer and closer. But still the payout will be probably in March, April or May and also if they have made enough profit. 
0	1525703886	5	EOS doesn't seem to care about fud or BTC drama it just keeps moving up, consolidating then moving up again.
1	1525704187	0	6 incoming airdrops. you have to be retard not to want free money / dividends.
2	1525704585	1	Stopped buying into coins just for a few dollars airdrop
3	1525704859	2	Sell before the airdrop then and ride the pre drop pump
0	1525712591	6	Fuck the WSJ and all their clickbait bullshit, that is all. 
1	1525712789	4	never trust them again
2	1525714673	3	This is crypto, don't trust anyone
0	1525688118	9	Scooped up some cheap ETH.... yeahhhh.. 
0	1525698226	3	so whats with ETH and SEC?
1	1525698410	9	What token is SEC?
2	1525699039	6	Screwing Every Crypto
3	1525699253	2	> Screwing every ERC20 *shitcoin*FTFY.
1	1525699442	2	Just some weak source-less fud shaking out some new investors that got on that latest bull run. Paid FUD is the only way a source-less article with no confirmation gets this kind of circulation.
2	1525699558	2	so they took a working group meeting and elevated it being a "ruling"
0	1525699842	3	Looking to add another coin to my portfolio. Which coins should I take a look at? looking to hold mid-long term.
1	1525699929	5	Origin Trail and/or Ambrosus
1	1525702885	2	SEC, flavor of the month
1	1525702888	2	Nebulas
1	1525702019	3	ChainLink (LINK).
0	1525701722	3	Buy ETH now? Or wait for more dipping?
1	1525702337	7	I think the weak hands panic sold on the pullback, and their positions were gobbled up by people that believe longterm. I don't think it's going to dip, outside of a major market move, and I honestly think bull sentiment is building. I had neighbours ask me if I was "still into crypto" this weekend, and how they can get in.I'm hearing crypto conversation at work again.All signs are pointing to a second half of 2018 bullrun again.
2	1525702715	5	Feels like October 2017
2	1525702788	1	I agree but let's keep in mind the pretty drastic dip between summer 2017 and Nov/Dec.  That shook a lot of people out.
1	1525701897	3	Hard to say if it will keep dipping. I think the bears are running out of steam right now. Its a great deal, but who's to say it wont go any lower. You definitely have the opportunity to steal someone's cheap ETH on sale right now though.
2	1525701990	2	Ah I see.I’m betting there’s a huge $700 buy wall for it to bounce back, wonder how can I check buy and sell walls though.
3	1525702338	2	I bought some today but only about a quarter of the amount I’m wanting to put in. I’ll tease more in if/when it breaks $700. Just dollar average it in I’d say.
1	1525706200	1	Great buy in point for ETH. Great buy in point for several alts as well. 
0	1525706053	3	I don't know what to do. I have good alts that are rising but the dollar value is lower because ETH is decreasing.I know ETH will rise after announcement. Should I go back to ETH ? Or just hold my alts.edit: I don't have new money
1	1525707637	5	Stop FOMOing. Develop patience. 
1	1525706654	3	hold your beer and your nuts. 
0	1525710125	3	i fucking hate you IDEX. 
1	1525710388	5	Sweet $0 24h volume for some of my coins
2	1525710823	2	for most if I'm not mistaken. Fucked over BABB hard with their recent news. 
3	1525715694	2	Same with EVE - rather salty.
1	1525710281	3	second this
0	1525715772	3	If the whole SEC hearing was fake news, what if this fake news is also fake news and the SEC hearing is back on? Oh God
0	1525715816	3	https://etherscan.io/address/0x2c2fb0313bd5120aa5d5bea20ea07e22e565c6b4Is there a way to be certain that 220k Ether going to Bitfinex is from EOS?  As referenced in this tweet-https://twitter.com/abercrombiezie/status/993524947061370880
1	1525716038	1	All thats certian is EOS about to hit $30.00 soon
0	1525673928	5	This is good for crypto. 😂😭
0	1525679704	6	So What if a coin is label as a security, what does it mean for the coin ?
1	1525679869	11	Have to register with the SEC and follow certain regulations. In the short term exchanges would probably have to delist them if they sell to Americans until they comply with security regulations. Most likely the price would fall, at least in the short term. This is all hypothetical.
2	1525679928	10	Alternatively they just kick out American users like Bitfinex did. 
3	1525680075	6	Yes that’s probably more likely. Either way it would really hurt the market overall.
4	1525680149	3	Though Bittrex won't, since they delisted Triggers as soon as it became a publicly traded company. 
2	1525680342	6	So overal long term its nothing to worry about in my opinion
3	1525680425	9	For big projects, probably. But for smaller projects, the teams may abandon the project if it’s too much red tape.
4	1525687028	1	Would ERC20s like OMG get caught up in it by proxy then? 
5	1525687237	1	They’d be *more likely* I think. But not sure about OMG specifically as I haven’t looked into it too much. But I have a ton of other ERC20 tokens so I hope for the best.
0	1525682114	6	At what time is the sec meeting? 
1	1525682532	6	What if there is no SEC meeting?
1	1525682407	3	Also wondering about this, couldnt find anything on the SEC website. 
1	1525683270	2	It's a closed meeting so no one knows. We won't know the verdict unless a public statement is made. And for all we know this statement could take days to be released. Edit: There might even be no meeting at all and this is all just one big fud rumor. I believe the only source we have is some WSJ article. 
0	1525684173	4	Wtf did I wake up to? 
1	1525684754	11	January 
2	1525691406	2	January Bajillionty-5th
0	1525678808	7	Shit ETH is dropping hard
0	1525682690	5	ELI5: What does it mean if SEC label a crypto (e.g. ETH) as a security?
1	1525683592	1	Regulations.
0	1525692262	5	In how many hours does the SEC hearing start?
1	1525693763	2	bout three fiddy 
2	1525694213	2	you mean tree fiddy
0	1525707678	5	Guys, it's chill. Just sort Delta by biggest gainers and switch to all time. See, we green.
0	1525709107	5	Meanwhile ZRX is on a slow steady growth..
1	1525710198	2	Yeah I grabbed a bag
0	1525712722	4	ETH good fam?
1	1525712758	4	defo my g
2	1525712893	4	I love just checking in with that sayin’ ETH about go nuts now. 
0	1525687282	6	Am I the only one excited about this tiny dip? I'm doubling up on my initial investment before the hearing. I can tell the chance is about 0.1% that SEC considers Ethereum a security. It could be considered a security for those who got in on the ICO, however for people who bought Ethereum on an exchange it is 0.00000% security. I'm not so confident about ICOs though. I think in the future, ICOs will be subject to more regulations and it's going to be difficult for anyone to start an ICO, which I think is definitely a good thing.
1	1525688510	3	I think there is a very good chance it is not judged a security, but everything coming off it will be required to follow some rules. Lets face it, there are a shit ton of projects where the developer have no intention of ever developing a project. A shit ton more where the developer has already abandoned the project. Something has to happen to weed them out. These projects thinking they are legally out of the woods because they have given you something to speculate are in for an awakening.But none of this will happen today.
1	1525687819	2	If ETH is not a security but all tokens are that will still dump the market. Let’s cross our fingers and knock on wood for the best outcome.
2	1525689317	3	Since most ico's don't accept American investors already, why would it change anything 
2	1525688830	1	These measures wont affect exchanges, they will affect ICOs.
3	1525693711	1	They will affect exchanges. It's likely they'll either delist Erc20s if they're too regulation heavy, or they'll remove exchange for US traders. So expect a wave of KYC requirements on all exchanges if Ethereum is listed as a security
4	1525695337	1	I can tell you right now: SEC will not consider Ethereum a security. This is the perfect time to buy more if you are looking for a quick 10-15% profit. If SEC considered ICOs securities, then it will only affect coins that are still in the ICO stage and projects planning to launch an ICO in the near future, they will be subject to tighter regulation and that's probably for the better (this likely means your farmer next door wont be able to launch carrothereum).
1	1525688777	3	> I can tell the chance is about 0.1% that SEC considers Ethereum a security. how did you calculate that?
0	1525691219	6	Please SEC don't screw us 
1	1525691463	7	The creators of blockchain tech are mad at you for begging mercy from the authorities. 
1	1525691501	14	1) The rest of the world doesn't care.2) USA only screws itself if they do3) Therefore they won't 
2	1525693388	3	THIS......C'mon people. Get real. The SEC has no reason to screw over their own economy.
1	1525692514	4	The crypto overlord chtulhu wont allow it. But he demands you buy chtulhu offerings now.

0	1525686947	2	That's a ton of volume on the 4H ETH chart... Likely the close to the bottom. I think it will continue through the day, but won't go much further from where we are

0	1525696983	2	I mostly, like 90%, trade ETH pairs on Binance. Could someone give me a quick pro/con of not trading in BTC pairs? Also, think I should branch out to some other exchanges in order to access coins not listed on Binance?Basically I have a little fomo creeping in and have been thinking about picking up a few small market newer coins in case they moon. Looking to see if you guys see something blatantly wrong with that. 
1	1525697257	8	lower fees, faster transactions with ETH. That's the only reason why I did so.
2	1525699309	1	Enough reasons to ETH.
2	1525700653	1	On Binance the trading fees will be the same regardless, and withdrawal fees for ETH are about double that of BTC.
1	1525697418	5	Only reason I use btc is there is more volume 90 percent of the time and easier to find buyer seller quickly. Otherwise, I use eth 
1	1525697605	4	Yeah go to COSS, more ppl on coss = more money for me :)
1	1525701505	2	 volume
1	1525702277	2	Quick trading I use BTC. To check relative value I compare to ETH.
0	1525699372	2	Which coins that derive value from working hand on hand with other coins?Something like chainlink, but fix different problem within crypto.
1	1525699449	6	TKY, ENG, OMG, ARK are some

1	1525703112	1	9.2
0	1525702194	2	My Altcoin portfolio is -0.025 BTC ~~~ 280$I had everything in ALTs, 1 day before pump to 9.9k i sold ALTs to BTC.... 10hours doing nothing so back to ALTs and went to bed... Next morning BTC pumped....but I thought it won't move till next weekAnd it moved UP, down, UP, down,downAnd Altcoins are in shithole....Yeah I am in profit 300$ since start of this year, but... Pffffff BAD timing for me...I need BTC to stop moving for a week.... So Altcoins start to breath again
1	1525702417	2	If you started with 280 and have 300 in profits, that's pretty good % wise.
2	1525702521	3	No I started with 1150$ December -> 1730$ few days ago now 1560$ but BTC sat lost +- 290$Lost more BTC than $$$, thats what pisses me...I knew what to DO , but BAD timingI know that it was good idea to move to BTC, just not enough luck
3	1525702788	2	But every " lost of chance for profit" is experience...Most important thing is to get experience.So when next end of year arrives I won't be a sheep but a.... ..WASA WASA WASAAA Biiiitconneeeect Hahhahhah
3	1525702757	1	Oh I see what you saying, this was just your alts portfolio.
4	1525703029	2	I don't have BTC/ETHI have strategy if my ALTs make +25% / I see that I get more BTC, then I go for week, 2 weeks to BTC, wait for movement and back to AltcoinsIn December last year, Altcoins mooned exactly 10 days after bitcoins all time highAnd 13 days everything was perfect....4th of Jan everything dropped and bear market started
5	1525705265	1	I would always hold SOME btc. If alts tank vs btc, even if btc also loses in $ value, you'll have some to buy cheaper alts with. Then sell a little back to btc again when they start jumping up.
0	1525702293	2	Sloth Coin up 700%. I’m in the wrong coins.
1	1525703892	1	We only see the pumps, and not the subsequent dumps (or at least we pay less attention to them).When it pumps we think "We should have been in that"When it dumps we think "Obviously it dumped and I'm not in that, because I'm so smart and avoid shitcoins".
0	1525702526	2	this little shit and its no 10k for me gracias policy bullshit.
0	1525705063	2	Not sure what to make of this. These short flashdrops seem an attempt to trigger something but are bought up back to 9.3 again.  I bought a small amount of alts on the last drop, just in case this was about it. The speed with which it bounces back looks good but anyone with a big enough bag can continue to try and cause panicsells at this point.

1	1525708497	4	I think ARK projects edges it, although ENG is superb as well
1	1525708437	3	I personally like ark. 
1	1525708739	3	Enigma all the way. Ark has nothing shiny to attract the average um....joe.
1	1525708969	3	Both quality projects and teams. I hold both -- more excited by ENG currently. Their roadmap is very ambitious: https://blog.enigma.co/enigmas-ambition-our-latest-roadmap-8d50107ad314Huge potential if they can deliver. Especially considering they blockchain agnostic. 
1	1525710005	3	ENIGMA 
1	1525710375	3	ARK pays up to 10% dividends if you keep it in their wallet and vote for a delegate.  That would give it a slight edge in my opinion.

0	1525679201	6	So to me it seems like what I’ve read this weekend from the SEC is that they want to label most cryptocurrencies as securities, especially non-utility tokens that start out as an ICO. They seem to be hinting that if they don’t do something now, in the future when ICOs are even more common and there are even more scams, future regulators will come down HARD on crypto. They want to develop sensible rules now to prevent reactionary bad rules in the future. Whether ethereum ends up as a security, I’m not sure. But it seems like it would. It’s a platform for tokens and started out as an ICO. Can anyone share some links with SEC officials’ quoted?
0	1525688767	3	Trying to learn more about this stuff.What is a security exactly? I more or less understand what happens when ETH is declared a security from reading in the comments, but I don't understand what it actually is. Maybe because English isn't my primary language.What are the so called "futures" and what impact do they have?
1	1525689253	5	You're asking questions that are the basic building block of investing. The best answers you'll find to your questions are either Google or YouTube.

0	1525695851	3	eyes are peeled for good entry points now. Any tips, havn't been in the space too long
1	1525696084	10	This is a good entry point considering we were hovering 10k a day or two ago. Buy some right now. Buy a little bit more at 9100 and more at 8900. Its called ladder buying. I do it all the time when I'm not certain of a price bottom.  You don't wanna miss the boat while you are trying  to find a entry point.

1	1525695965	1	feel the need to clarify, not looking for shills but any advice appreciated on what to look out for based on previous market behaviourEdit: forgot there was an edit button
2	1525696105	5	Most of us are just degenerate gamblers trying to make itBut if you want some “solid” advice the best suggestion would be to start gradually opening long positions now and see how the SEC meeting goes
3	1525696874	1	Haha I'd say i'm not too far off from that description either my friend
1	1525701716	1	If I was to buy here I would set a stop loss at around -2% and rebuy/add on around 9k

0	1525713401	1	Anyone know why Vechain is going up today?  I'm not complaining just curious as I couldn't find any news or info as to why given that most alts are down cause of BTC right now.Edit: Salty ICXers downvoting. Lol.
1	1525713478	5	this will continue to happen all the way til mainnet whic is 2 months away
1	1525714298	2	It dumped more than pretty much any other Alt (at least in the top 30) when btc pumped to 10k so it had to go back up at some point I guess.

1	1525687700	1	When you are despair think of those that bought my ICO INS bags for $12 when it first hit binance. One poster in the daily threads bought some for $25 
0	1525684834	1	So is this SEC meeting about Eth and alts? Not Bitcoin? If not, why not?
1	1525685440	3	If something is a security, it always was. We may have been shown the carrot by Some cryptocurrencies  but SEC will give us the stick in terms of whats what 
1	1525684969	1	Basically nobody knows what its about or when or why or if it will happen. Where did the rumours even start spreading from?

0	1525698440	1	For the day traders here what do you do with the profit? I'm holding and now trading some of my portfolio. Would like some tips. Thanks
1	1525698750	6	Give it to the IRS
2	1525701633	2	What about the other 70 to 80%?
3	1525702172	1	It depends what your goals are.  Some people trade to accumulate more fiat and others trade to accumulate more crypto.
1	1525699910	2	Profit goes into fiat or USDT or bitcoin if you’re endgame is simply to accumulate Satoshis. The idea is you secure/take profit daily, so most will take profit in fiat or USDT. Most people will have trading stacks, fiat reserve, and cold storage. Shouldn’t trade more than you’re willing to lose. Do you plan on margin trading? I ask because it’s decent for day trading if you follow daily TA and set entry / exit points with stop losses to minimize risk. I consider day trading alts to be a whole different animal than day trading bitcoin on sites like bitfinex - margin/leverage trading vs market buying/selling alts hoping to ride a pump. 
1	1525698576	1	Put it in long term stacks or more likely cash out.  Day traders gotta provide for themselves someway.

1	1525701730	2	ETH
2	1525702158	1	why?
0	1525701579	1	I guess Mr. April 12^th has decided to sell his bags. 
0	1525702104	1	Firstly, I am not shilling, just asking for clarification or other information. What are the drawbacks of DGD? It sort of seems like holding a stake in the Digix Global company, and you get quarterly rewards in gold as soon as they launch DGX. How is that.. not good?
1	1525702347	5	The stock market is so overbought right now, gold is actually a very safe hedge.  Since crypto is a hedge against the stock markets and DGD/DGX will serve as a hedge against both, it fits into a unique hedgeception category against both markets.  It is really underhyped right now despite its huge run up in the worst of the bear market -- it should take investors a while to wrap their head around what value this coin holds but its definitely another Maker in the making, if not superior as it actually has a valid asset class backing it.
2	1525702630	2	This is exactly my thought. I was looking for drawbacks and it seems like DGD has incredible potential. I got a  bit confused since price has been going down for a while.
1	1525702311	1	People right now use it as some sort of weird hedge when BTC goes down so that when BTC runs DGD goes in the toilet.
0	1525702973	1	Small lump on an alt now... XLM, BAT, OMG?? Which one?
1	1525703673	6	I'd say OMG. Staking and plasma coming up in the short term (plasma could be longer), and has pulled back a bit in the last week. Criminally undervalued project, and always has been flying under the radar.BAT could be a good buy, but it's definitely higher risk play. Smaller team, but huge project. The question is if they can actually deliver.XLM, I dunno, it's a weird coin. I personally extremely dislike the ratio of circ supply to total supply. I dislike the potential for airdrops devaluing the coin. I dislike a lot of things about it. I do like the team, and the vision... I just have a feeling the project will be successful but the economics of the token just aren't there - as much as with other projects like OMG. Again, totally personal opinion, it's certainly a legit project. But for me, if it's a choice of options, I want my money in OMG.
2	1525708016	2	I agree with XLM. Awesome legit project, but what is the point of holding stellar lumens? They have no $ Value.BAT I can see going huge. It will be actual $ Value.
1	1525703066	4	BAT
1	1525705879	1	Out of that list OMG. 
0	1525703230	1	I have a stop loss question. Example: if you bought something at 860 and the 24hr low is 850, what's a good stop loss 845? 
1	1525703409	3	A good stop loss is below a known level of support.
1	1525703521	2	if you set it there, chances are it will get triggered and when you look back at the books the price will be sitting around $855.  Just the way it always happens.  Experiment with it and you'll see for yourself.
0	1525704831	1	Is Lobstr a scam? The fact that they don’t have a legit app kind of makes me hesitant? I’m very new to this so ELI5. If so my Grandfather is using it, is that a problem?
0	1525705075	1	A friend of a friend has approached me and asked me if I have a favorite/trusted BTC Mixer.Now that ain’t quite my style, but I figured some of you smarty pantses out there might have some opinions on mixers/tumblers.What’s good?
1	1525705163	5	They're useless. The transactions can still be tracked. If your friend wants to buy drugs online they shouldn't use a currency which keeps a immutable record of every transaction.
1	1525705215	3	Why wouldn't you just convert to something like monero and continue from there?
1	1525706430	2	Monero
