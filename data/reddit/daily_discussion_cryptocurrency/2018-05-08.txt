0	1525778664	30	Do you ever feel like everyone is making money in crypto except you? I've got a small amount invested in Bitcoin, LTC, ETH, NEO, NANO, XMR, ADA, which I plan to hodl (not a trader) and it IS growing, but very little and very slowly. Meanwhile I see these other guys getting x10 with ONT and the likes, and I'm happy for them, but at the same time I feel that in 5 years everyone is gonna get rich except me :)
1	1525778992	19	Well you're rocking a portfolio that exists of exclusively (former) top20 coins. The growth potential of those isn't as big as say a rank 300 coin. Then again they're also much less likely to just fizzle out into obscurity.  Compare your gains to having your money on the bank, investing in stocks...you're still doing great.  Compare your risk to that of people who went for reddit favourites like BNTY, Confido or PRL and didn't get out in time, you should feel pretty good.  Dedicate a portion of your portfolio to moonshots if you want that 100x potential.
2	1525785201	5	You're not alone. My portfolio is nearly back to even now but as Goinginfortheshill said, many went for old Reddit shills. Like me for instance! I spent $1500 on Reddit shills PRL PBL SNOV and BNTY. As of today, that part of my investment is worth $190...
1	1525780158	9	Only the winners are posting here. Thats why you will inevitably feel left out if you come here
1	1525779481	5	I feel you brother
1	1525780168	5	I like this slow growing. You are not the only one trust me
1	1525779305	7	Well no one posts about their losses so it certainly feels like everyone is winning chasing these pump coins, but in the long run you will outperform them because someday they make a mistake and all their gains are gone.
2	1525780762	2	or not. its foolish to think people will keep their gains in those coins only. and not cash out or reinvest.
1	1525778842	3	Patience keep doing what you do, when you see others making money from coins while you are gaining slow don't jump on their coins because they already made their money and the gains are already gone you have good coins to hodl imo
1	1525781570	3	If you've got a plan, which it seems you do, stick to your guns and HODL. If you ever need fiat for real life emergencies etc then sell, if not it seem's were very similar in our strategies, just don't FOMO!
1	1525783306	2	Thanks for all your replies. I admit that I prefer to stick with less risky coins, maybe I should allocate a little bit of money to a moonshot or two. I just hope that in 5 years time I have something to show for the time and money invested in this. Otherwise I'm gonna feel like I blew a huge opportunity, probably a once in a lifetime one.
1	1525780694	3	This is the perfect example of investing only in reddit shilled coins. The coins that will give you huge returns are those that have not made it to reddit yet. ;\). look for low market cap coins with solid teams that are undervalued and in the range of 100 to 250 marketcap on coinmarket cap list. If you research well and find gems , you will get huge returns. its like catching WTC or VEN under 30 cents before they made it to reddit shill list.
0	1525787435	29	Taking a step back from crypto has been a great decision. I check my portfolio 2-3 times a week, but that's it. I don't make adjustments or chase pumps and my mental health has been much better than it was in January/Feb/March.  If you're losing your shit about the past 3 days, just step back. 
1	1525788749	7	Exactly. I found that finding a strategy and sticking to it works best. I was in yoru boat before as well. Now I pick my favorite coins and no matter the market does, either HODL or acquire more during a dip to dollar cost average. Then I have a few coins that I like but dont love so I swing trade them with the goal of derisking my initial investment and riding the free coin. If those turn to a love coin for me I acquire more. I try to have coins in several categories from platforms, to projects trying to connect blockchains, decentralized exchanges, ICO's, true exchange of value coins, etc.
1	1525788058	3	it is easy because it is not bull run yet, once it starts you are going to check your portfolio every minute
2	1525788359	2	I won't be complaining then either. 
0	1525792980	17	Just started watching Silicon Valley after hearing they mentioned crypto in a recent episode. I am hooked, one of the funniest shows I've seen
0	1525761238	34	Verge have subways logo on their latest poster. They have a thread about the new partnership on their sub... Meanwhile... It's just a local subway in the Netherlands, not the entire brand. Lol. 
1	1525761433	19	Biggest partnership ever in crypto IMO.
2	1525762364	6	BULLISH!!111
1	1525766798	2	My Verge bags are big and a I need some seafood subs!
1	1525771757	2	misleading advertising. Nothing new.
0	1525767972	16	Wtf happened to bytecoin???? 2.7b mcap sitting on rank 15 on cmc. What the fuck??
1	1525768189	19	Bytecoin is the real Bitcoin.    /s
1	1525768180	6	Got listed on binance
1	1525768057	2	The new (old) MONERO!
2	1525768332	7	Yea, its obivously not a typical scam with them washtrading itself up the ranks /s 
0	1525779548	12	I have a feeling that the people buying bytecoin at 20 cents on binance are soon going to be rekt.
1	1525782390	4	" goes up 700% in 2 hours, should be a solid investment* wannabe traders probably. 
0	1525769597	24	[deleted]
1	1525792096	2	Being an ICON holder is the best. Not even growth wise but there’s always good news and developments coming out from the team it just makes me feel extremely safe that its a large portion of my portfolio 
0	1525782750	21	This market is so fucked up
1	1525783121	16	can I interest you in some bytecoin... 
0	1525766218	11	Did anyone else notice that BCN went up 100x for a minute!? That’s insane but someone also got stuck with a bag that immediately dropped after 
1	1525766593	1	Yup it was glorious. Thank god I work the night shift 
2	1525767474	1	Nice, I can't imagine benefitting from something pumping that much
1	1525768150	1	100x is a dream come true.....someone probably missed a decimal on their buy order.
2	1525768589	1	yeah, I was thinking the same or possibly some large market orders and some extremely optimistic sell orders
0	1525767016	9	so bytecoin is going to pump forever or what?
1	1525767438	7	What's going on? It looks like it's settled at a price 10x everywhere else
0	1525781078	10	Anyone have any spare ramen?
1	1525782402	2	Send me your public key ill send you 1 or 2 RAMEN https://etherscan.io/token/0x6feb3a071a2732378521c53d024b67ad068ec921
0	1525760006	9	What even is Bytecoin?
1	1525760510	25	8 bitcoins = 1 bytecoin
2	1525761071	3	Now try terrabytecoin
1	1525760639	6	Did it just go x20 in binance? Wtf ?
1	1525760539	2	If I understand correctly, Monero forked from Bytecoin.
2	1525761038	2	Oh really? Never heard of it, but that's cool haha
1	1525760624	2	All I know is they donated a large amount to David Hay's project which was a good thing to see. 
1	1525771862	2	Scamcoin
0	1525767289	9	Looking to throw in on a lil fella, elixir or payfair? Thoughts?
1	1525769733	4	PayFair 
1	1525769365	5	PFR
1	1525768324	3	Pfr
1	1525768364	5	Payfair... Been kicking that can around myself
1	1525768498	5	Pfr
1	1525791558	2	Elixir because you can actually buy it!
1	1525774456	2	Elixir \^\^
0	1525784929	8	ETH is back in the game
0	1525801344	10	Buffett claims Bitcoin is "rat poison squared" \- and I agree \- Buffett is one of the rats.
0	1525768201	17	Just want to shine some light on what's happening with Bytecoin; it seems like one of the more sophisticated pump and dumps. Seen the same thing happening with Bitcoin Diamond.Withdrawals from HitBTC and Poloniex are not working and neither is the Bytecoin webwallet, thus most investors are not actually able to sell their Bytecoins on Binance. The Bytecoin supply that's on Binance is very low and therefore it's easy to pump up the price, all the way up to 20x it's original price. This still caused a 100%+ surge on exchanges such as HitBTC and Poloniex, allowing the group to dump there.Not saying that the Bytecoin team is involved, but it seems very shady that  their coin got listed at a time that (nearly) no one is able to move the token towards Binance.
1	1525768442	1	Been wondering how does Binance listing work ? Couldn't they buy a huge chunk of their coin, pay for binance listing, wait for listing, then dump for profit ?
2	1525768632	6	I'm not sure about this, but I doubt Binance would want to get involved in something that shady. Still think it's curious that they still listed a coin that is (nearly) impossible to move around. 
0	1525771451	8	What will happen first?a. BTC passing 10kb. ETH passing 800
1	1525771539	10	b.
1	1525771742	6	b. definitely
1	1525773371	4	Hopefully both at the same time.
1	1525772351	3	y. BTC passing 11k in June...
0	1525772104	7	Neo what are you doing?
1	1525773392	2	Biding it's time.
0	1525772286	8	IOTA is mooning on binance now aswell, hold tight 
0	1525763518	25	For those of you who aren't familiar with Bytecoin:https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/4241/how-does-the-recent-patched-key-image-exploit-work-in-practice/4252#4252https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=740112.0The developers exploited a bug in the Cryptonote protocol to generate billions of Bytecoins. Over 80% of all total Bytecoin has already been emitted as a result of this, most of it being premined.Bytecoin is the OG scamcoin. Stay away from it, especially considering it just had a monster pump. That coin is cancer.
1	1525763810	5	No one is going to hold this coin mate Just good old fashion in out, in out. 
1	1525766031	2	Surprised to see 2.5B market cap though. The faith is strong
0	1525789941	19	Good Morning,My name is Warm Buffet and I'm the owner of Burntsheer Hashbrown; I'm here to talk about this scourge in the financial markets called "BitCoin" or "crypt of currency" which i am strongly opposed to. CryptofCurrency is basically like trading pocket lint! I dont understand it at all; it doesn't produce anything therefore it doesn't have any value just like the internet. How audacious to think that people will buy this because it will change the world; I mean look at the internet, that barely had a long term impact on the world. Think LONG TERM, because here at Berkshire Hashplay we think LONG TERM. Listen to what I say, the key word here is LONG TERM. Plus why would we EVER give the common person access to the financial markets? How silly!Instead of cryptofcurrency I HIGHLY recommend you invest in MY COMPANY. In fact, if you invest in my portfolio companies you'll get a more rewarding investment experience than bitcoin. We ALWAYS guarantee to give you VALUE, which is something that Bitcoin does not have. After careful analysis by Charbie Mongrel and I we are 100% confident our company's investments will SKYROCKET. Remember, ALWAYS invest in Burtshire Heathrow and its related companiesSincerely, Wern Boft
1	1525791159	5	Small typo on your statement. It's spelled crip toe current seas.
2	1525796601	2	Its actually double "p" on the crip... get it right mate.. ;) 
0	1525761529	7	Freaking bytecoin went up 60% today. It's the daddy of monero since monero forked from bytecoin. Reason 80% of coin  was already mined by the developer before anyone could. Anyway congrats hodlers!
1	1525761984	13	just bought in at 11 cents on binance as soon as it hit the exchange and within minutes sold at 24 cents :). risk it for the biscuit
2	1525762668	7	Congrats in that victory, hope u had a heavy ass bag ;)
0	1525770038	7	BCN is trading at over 1700 sats on binance.BCN is trading at around 190 sats on poloniex.WTF?I need to to get to my computer to transfer bcn from polo to binance 
1	1525770152	5	deposits are suspended for now, thats why
2	1525771309	1	Damn damn damn!!!I have had a few thousand bcn sittin on polo for about 6 months....  pretty much forgot about it.Why didnt i transfer that bcn out of polo a long time ago..???Yes:  because i am an idiot.;(
1	1525770243	1	That's really a big difference. All I remember of Poloniex was that toxic chat box.
1	1525770720	1	It was .006 cents before listing. Some people just got so ducking rich.
2	1525771125	1	Does poloniex allow bcn transfers?   Not at my computer so cannot check.   I have a few thousand bcn sitting on polo..
2	1525771367	1	Nevermind ~  got the answer below...  gunna go cry now.
0	1525773282	6	If we use the binance price then BCN is currently ranked 3rd in total market cap pushing ripple to 4th.... lol.Over 40 billion mcap.....This is crazy.

0	1525791186	7	Anyone notice you can pay with bitcoin now on expedia.com? I guess it directs you to coinbase....not sure if this was every really news or not.
1	1525792726	2	Yeah I saw a post about it couple weeks back when someone said they used it to fly somewhere. Then the price went up and they said they probably won't do it again. Since they "lost" like 20% in a couple days.So it's like a paradox. You want adoption but then you don't want to spend because it's worth more in the future.
2	1525792912	2	Yeah I can see the issue but at the same time if you are spending BTC instead of holding it you shouldn't care too much. Maybe just try to spend it when the market is down haha.
1	1525793578	2	> Yeah I saw a post about it couple weeks back when someone said they used it to fly somewhere. Then the price went up and they said they probably won't do it again. Since they "lost" like 20% in a couple days.> > it's been there for at least an year.
1	1525794870	2	where i just went in and made fake flight and didnt see it anywhere under pay options?
0	1525776894	12	lol @ BCN, heavy Bagholders in the making!
1	1525777384	2	Even in a fantasy world where it doesnt go bust overnight ala Bitconnect they'll still have to hodl until about the year 2120 to get their money back.  I've grinded for months (quite poorly tbh) to try and break even and I couldn't imagine losing half my money on a PnD for a shitcoin like Bcn.  I'd neck myself.
0	1525784738	6	Sorry people I shorted  and now I have to manipulate the market in order not to get liquidated. Will pump it up right after futeres expire tomorrow, I promise

2	1525773435	2	Are you sure? lmao we going to the moon, ur right tho im gonna take profits today.
0	1525800417	11	The aura of Binance is slowly eroding with the ultimate scammy shitcoin $BCN being listed today. A coin that had almost 700 million coins created from thin air due to an exploit by the Cryptonote bug. Binance receives a letter from the JFSA and moves to Malta immediately. Posting record profits because of their ridiculous coin listing fees and end user trading/withdrawal fees. Using their "cold" storage on stratis to stake. Strange volume spikes on other exchanges on coins days before they are announced to be listed at Binance, as if employees are accumulating them and dumping them on us. Any insiders made their listing fee back several orders of magnitude over accumulating and dumping.
1	1525800696	5	Tell me about it. I was absolutely flabbergasted to see Binance list Bytecoin. I'm still in shock that it actually happened. Bytecoin is a garbage-tier crypto. At least there are shitcoins out there where 80 fucking percent of the entire supply wasn't premined due to the fatal Cryptonote bug that you mentioned.
1	1525801197	2	Do not trust Binance.They spam here with their marketing team. After the riot against their fees, they had users suggesting that Binance 'needs higher fees'. Speaking of which, their fees are insane. I dont use Binance anymore. 
0	1525776656	14	Lol anyone else see Schneiderman is resigning as NY AG today? In hindsight, that whole crypto investigation seems like a pretty feeble attempt to divert attention from the fact he is a serial woman beater. Get fucking rekt, scumbag 
0	1525760125	4	So what does everyone think will happen if/when the NYSE adopts bitcoin trading?
1	1525760293	5	Probably a bullish sign. Just be aware that it won't be as volatile the more people there are that own bitcoin. So yes, losses won't be as crazy, but gains won't be as crazy either. Which may be good for altcoins.
2	1525760626	5	Alts could definitely use some breathing room lol

1	1525796744	2	BNB, brought value to both western and eastern investors to trade main and altcoins easily and securely.BTC, interesting if to see how long will lindy effect it.NEO, only quality ICO and GAS dividends.LINK, making crypto relevant to our everyday life.IOTA, IoT is a huge value to have in our daily lives.I’d kill ETH due to the fact it overpopulated the sphere with the majority of coins through shitty ICO, %99 of it.
1	1525797105	2	I'd ask DN GL and PwC which one they'd like to see continue
0	1525763419	6	Warren Buffett was right about most of the crypto investors. 
1	1525765411	8	Yes but the average moonboi invest less than 1k. So we don’t care. 
2	1525768365	2	Do you think the average is less than 1k here? Would be fun to know.All I know is that I went in with way too much without having a clue about anything and nearly lost it all like a god damn fool. Would’ve been smart to maybe start with 1k
0	1525769164	4	I know Steam stopped letting people pay with Bitcoin last year but has anyone heard any rumours about crypto returning to Steam? It'd be an absolutely massive market to hit. Especially with all the tradeable items in game too. People have to be trying. 
0	1525769834	3	Hopefully the bytecoin pump is the start of a massive alt  bull run.. Last time Bytecoin went this high was around May 15th 2017.. and we all know what followed next 
1	1525770883	1	I'm sorry, i joined in september 2017. What happened in may 2017?

1	1525788537	4	LINK if you want a unicorn that will blow up. Probably one of the most important projects in crypto right now with the least hype. For me I acquire as much as I can and only buy more on the dips with this one. 
0	1525791283	6	Peoples thoughts of hodling NEO? Or time to sell and buy something else? I'm 50/50 right now...
1	1525791619	12	I bought more.  Heavily invested in NEO 
1	1525791765	10	Projectwise NEO is doing very good - price wise it's lagging behind. I think NEO will do fine in the next weeks and months. BCN would have been your chance for massive quick returns today ;)
1	1525791767	7	It will make a nice return once things start moving again
1	1525792200	5	Usually it rises as soon as you (or me) sell... I know, it's hard to see the other coins make profit while NEO tanks more with every hickup of BTC and dumps after every half-dollar-run. But sell now means loss. No way. NEO did go up again in the past whilst every cycle - it tanks more, it rises more. Wait for the rise.
1	1525792631	5	You can't go wrong with neo but don't expect it to moon like last year...Personally I don't hold any but that's because I rather buy gas if I wanted to join that ecosystem. Also, I don't really buy coins in the top 20 marketcap (besides eth/btc).Depends on your risk. Neo very low risk.

1	1525771211	1	No you are right. There are huge price diferentations Sometimes.... take a look at bitcoin Diamond ... 
2	1525771462	2	Wow.  That is crazy.   If only polo would allow bcn transfers ~ then i could be rich....
3	1525771638	2	It was listed at a time transfers are not possible, it's all very interesting.
1	1525771274	1	I already cancelled my buy order for a nickle, this one is going to dump hard.
2	1525771571	2	But i need to sell my bcn that i stupidly left on poloniex.....   If everyone could please start buying on polo for the same price the binance is trading at then I can sell > thanks!
2	1525771782	2	I'm waiting for it dip so I can buy some. It went quiet for about 20 mins and I thought that was the end of it, but apparently not. Panic sold at a small loss and didn't rebuy, but hindsight is 20/20.
3	1525771987	2	You just never know. There are better privacy options out there, so this is not the smart choice. However when has the smart choice been the profitable choice in this space? You never know, maybe this moons and overtakes BTC by the end of the day, it's 4th MC already.

1	1525778260	3	You mean price prediction or just it's future? I bought some of their coins 2 weeks ago because i think the exchange will get quite big especially if they add ERC20 tokens. Also looking at kucoin shares, Binance coin etc it has lot of room to grow
1	1525778319	3	They get the first mover advantage but NeonEXchange is probably going to be more popular with more developers.

0	1525786871	3	For those of you who are well-read and informed in this space: HELP!Can you reccommend me any books to read? I have seen a few names passed around in this space but i’d love to hear everyones reccommendations.I am looking to learn more about how everything works and more about blockchain and how cryptocurrencies function in general.Thanks!! (Hope this list helps others as well! Knowledge is power!)
1	1525788252	4	unfortunately any books written on crypto would be 3 years out of date the day they get published 
1	1525788388	4	You need to do three thingsNumber one is easy, keep track of the tone of the market. Do this by keeping up with communitys like reddit or bitcoin forum, and keep up with all crypto news.  2, you gotta learn a little TA. Its not the word of god but the only thing you need to do in this market is buy LOW. However, it can be hard to define "low", or high for that matter. Ubderstanding key TA indicators helps with that. TheChartGuys and DataDash helped me learn TA, both youtubers.Thirdsies, if you are trying to invest and hold, you need to do extensive research, aka READ WHITEPAPERS. You dont need to do this when youre trading but if you intend to hodl a project for multiple years, you need to be sure it can survive. Also follow any investes voins telegrans, subreddits, etc.As far as books go, there arent many on crypto, this is wild west we make it up as we go. Many coins we worship as gods havent even been around for a year. Skim basic economics if books are just your thing.But, as i said before, the ONLY thing you need to do is buy low. It sounds so simple but its not. Buy low sell high. Dont ever fomo, not even if it seems foolproof.Good luck!Oh- and if you want to just understand the underlying tech, start with youtube videos explaining bitcoin, and read the bitcoin whitepaper, it all stems from that.

0	1525799821	3	Am in the only one that feels that calling projects coins and tokens is off putting? It just sounds...ehh... like shit. 
0	1525799863	3	When do you guys think crypto will be adopted and regulated in the developed world?
1	1525799947	6	2022
1	1525801706	3	My guess would be when something is presented that saves businesses and corporations money utilizing blockchain tech.  As much as we want to admit,  individuals are a drop in the ocean.  Business enterprise applications and cost saving measures through crypto /blockchain will bring about real (significant)  world adoption 
0	1525800169	3	People, need some help. I made a mistake generating my "paper wallet" at walletgenerator.net. The tab at the top usually gives me option between "single wallet", "paper wallet", "bulk wallet" and etc. I made a single wallet instead of a paper wallet; and have already deposited money. What is the difference between a single wallet and a paper wallet? Only difference I can see is a bip38 encryption
0	1525787179	8	Bitcoin faltering here after banging on the door at 10k but no one was home.I expect bitcoin to make another attempt in the next few days with full succession, making 10k the new support.
1	1525788793	2	Dude after Consensus conference next week we will moon, just be patient.. 15k by the end of this month.
0	1525764906	5	First time i bought a shit coin that from i read is a scam coin... BytecoinIts up by 30% right now. Any suggestion what percentage should i sell? I put $50 btw, so its not like im losing a lot. Is 100% too much?
1	1525765084	3	That pump was crazy but I just took my money out. Way too risky to hold that, my heart was racing but damn did I make some nice gains 
1	1525765009	1	Just sell, 15$ profit :D.If you do that several times a day your portfolio goes exponential haha. Sometimes you need to take profits in order to gain despite you miss out on some gains in the future
2	1525765256	1	Ok thx, its up by 38%.  I put a limit order when its goes 2x. Hehehe. I will go to sleep and decide tomorrow if there still value left hehe
3	1525766298	1	Hmm, you should also put a sell order when it reaches below 30%. That way you'll realize them gainzzzBut it's only 50$ tho. Although i don't know how much value you connect to it. 
1	1525765610	1	just went back up to 19 cents
2	1525765830	2	Ya its crazy. I got it for 10cents. Its almost went up to 80% and playing around 50-80%. I cant sleep now
3	1525765929	1	same lol
2	1525767743	1	It's 1 cent and a half right now, not 19.
3	1525768237	1	CMC isn't updated with the Binance listing yet. This coin is going to be top 3 by the morning if they do....
4	1525769089	1	Oh shit it's actually 15 cents on Binance. There's no way that's correct.
0	1525770016	5	ETH + BTC bleeding/going sideways and Altcoins rising is like Crypto should be. My portfolio is green as fuck.

0	1525782373	3	Why bear
0	1525786884	6	Everyone overreacting to 3 days of red needs to look at where the market was 4 weeks ago. Literally 4 weeks ago. Futures are about to expire let's see what happens in a few days before claiming we're going back to a bear market.

1	1525787087	2	5 steps forward and three steps back. Still not back to original investment but I just keep crawling.
1	1525788209	2	the 1 month charts are honestly beautiful (for most coins) 
0	1525774431	5	IOTA! The patience started paying off! Love it 
1	1525775014	4	I expect more days like this over May and June for IOTA. 
2	1525776761	2	Why do you expect that?
0	1525786591	6	No matter how big crypto is, if Bill Gates, Buffet and some of their friends decide to short it, things gonna get ugly. 
1	1525786764	8	You can say what you want about Bill Gates and him not understanding crypto, but he's not the type to short BTC and manipulate the market, to steal money off average Joe investors just to prove he's right about something (that he's wrong on). You can like him or not, but he's pretty philanthropic, and it's just not in his character.
2	1525787157	5	It's a little ironic to say "he's not the type" given his history as head of Microsoft. Maybe he's past it now that he's made his $100B, but saying he's "not the type" is a bit of a stretch.
1	1525786828	2	They won't. Because they'd have to research it first in depth 
1	1525786784	2	True. I'm invested heavily in crypto so I want it to continue to go up. However, the rational side of me feels that Gates & Buffett are not 100&#37; inaccurate in their assessments. The prices are pure speculation.
0	1525798540	12	[removed]
1	1525799225	2	We need the crypto community to oust bad coins.Everytime someone 1DOGE=1DOGE we need to downvote. An advertisement disguised as an unfunny meme.We need to tell litecoiners that litecoin is literally Bitcoin * 4. We need people to know BCH is one of many bitcoin forks. People need to know XRP has 80% of the coins controlled by XRP and the founders. BCH is the most obvious shilled coin, but the community needs to get newbies up to speed and discuss shitcoins. 
1	1525799561	2	who cares what is a "shitcoin" if it goes up ? lol
0	1525762500	4	Damn that market sell on req 
1	1525764141	7	I think i'm gonna sell my REQ. Holding onto it since december but it was a lot of shills and always lacked gains when others/the market did. When the market dropped it goes down just as hard as the rest. Only the last 1 or 2 weeks it has seen some nice gains
2	1525767926	2	I'v  been burned by REQ twice now, i'm just done with the coin. I sold with a 25% loss, thank god, i made it back long ago. 
3	1525769856	1	Yes that's what i'm considering as well. Just bought too high which is no problem but just not much movement. 
4	1525771098	1	imho, the project it just too big for that small team. the shit they wanna do. best of luck to the holders, but there's plenty of other opportunity's laying around. 
5	1525771265	1	Yes, building a paypal 2.0 with such a small team is possible but will take ages. In terms of profit REQ sucks. But in terms of speculation and real use case it's quite good
2	1525767479	1	Yeah I understand that, I'm still down 10% on REQ so I'll be holding for a while, but it's not a good performer, especially considering the buzz it gets here. 
3	1525769803	1	Yeah right? Those were my thoughts as well. I think i'm still 50% down on REQ while the rest is about 20% from ath. I can just cut my losses or wait. I do like the project but it isn't a good performer and only getting lower rank in CMC. And indeed kinda weird since so many people recommend it
1	1525767491	1	I sold my req long ago with a loss. But what i've done with that money since its been more then worth it. REQ can be huge, but its such a slow mover that i got impatient tbh. their team is really really small so their proces is slow
0	1525769229	3	I’m starting to think coins like ZRX have already pumped past their value on Coinbase and holding them is actually dangerous because if they aren’t listed on Coinbase it will be the dump to end all dumps, and if they are they can’t go up much more and will probably dump quickly like BCH when it was listed there.
1	1525771184	2	ZRX is clearly pumped by some whales. Just look at the low volume on Binance!
0	1525795112	3	Shill me/FUD me some ENG. Reading the white paper now, seems like a big deal if they deliver what they promise on schedule. Should I flip half my BNB into it?
1	1525796146	2	I have only got a few of these but I bought at roughly half of its current price during the dip. It is a solid project mate, no doubt about it. If they deliver, the multiplier gains can be huge.

1	1525803433	2	Thanks for the tip. It looks so. I will put some money in it. Actually wanted to buy WAN, but I think ZRX will move first.

1	1525777840	4	Add bat and ur good 
0	1525797276	6	What are your thoughts on Request Network (REQ)?  Thanks in advance!
1	1525798112	5	It makes sense and would be really useful, which means it performs poorly in price.
1	1525797702	3	It was heavily shilled here back in Dec and Jan. Still a solid team and project. Has not seen any major price action lately. Also has been partnering with other coins (MakerDao and maybe OMG). For me its a 1 year hold and then see to keep or sell!
1	1525797717	2	For some reason all the noobs flock to REQ. I like it, I hold some, it was the first alt I bought lol Solid project, good team updates, really easy to understand what they're trying to achieve. I think it's a very very safe buy right now.
0	1525764727	4	How can people always shill a coin to be undervalued? Afaik, in portfolio theory / stocks / ETF something can't be undervalued, as long as you don't have insider information. All available information is, by theory, already priced in, which is imho logical. 
1	1525765109	3	1) The theory in the stock market is still just a theory. It's not proven, it's just a thought. And the fact is: tons of insider trading occurs.2) The ecosystem of Crypto Assets is so new and so unknown that we, the people investing in them, aren't completely sure how things are going to turn out or what kind of markets there are for these. We are solving problems that have never even been considered problems until now. But we don't know how quick they will catch on or how vast certain markets are. For example: if you think FUN will capture a large amount of the volume going through online gambling today, than you can make your own prediction about what percentage of those dollars will flow through FUN.  If you think it's a large percentage, you might think FUN is currently undervalued at its current price. This holds the same for any other digital asset that is encroaching on current companies and markets with real dollar values to compare to. 
1	1525765082	1	there Are some coins where features or improvements are planned which are not really declared clearly or people think that others underestimate the impact on the economy of that particular coin or they think the coin is not well known and they are trying to shill it, so that more people focus on that coin. I guess you are right, everything is already priced in, the rest is pure speculation 
0	1525784563	6	Just sold 8000 Bcn  :D. Turns out mining all of that shitcoin paid off after all :D

1	1525760867	4	That person is probably scared to lose even more money so he sells and takes his loss.
1	1525761241	3	If you think you'll make more gains by switching to another currency it might be worth it. But nobody can predict the future, so I'll go easy on my nerves and just hodl what I've decided on. 
1	1525761154	2	You can use the losses on cryptocurrency to offset the tax on other types of capital gains (or for your gains on Crypto for countries where Crpto is taxed as CGT)  Also other reason to sell at a loss is if you need the cash urgently.

0	1525760611	3	Why does everyone say atleast 25% eth/btc in your portfolio ?
1	1525761107	6	Because the vast majority of coins eventually fail and also are more prone to mishaps which can cause them to lose value catastrophically overnight.  The big two are much lower risk than other coins.
1	1525761130	3	They're "safe" bets. But there's also less potential gains.Ultimately it's up to you. Investing in low market cap coins/tokens can make you rich, but there's a higher risk of losing it all. 
1	1525761036	1	Because they'll most likely stay around in a few years, unlike a lot of shilled coins on here

1	1525791443	10	Not even the least little bit...EDIT: I won't worry unless it dips below 8k again.  Even then, I know it's only another temporary crash.  
1	1525792650	4	For sure it's definitely not great.  I'm still bullish overall so I have some buy targets at 8890 and lowerEdit: should note on gdax there is like 4 million on the buy at 9000 so that should hold unless they're a lot of fake orders
1	1525791493	6	If you're concerned about TA, look at the weekly chart.  A one week consolidation to set a new higher low at 9-9.5k is not going to hurt the long term trend, it'll actually help it.  But TA is bullshit imo 
1	1525792546	2	I don't know. I'm buying. But still saving some if it does dip more. If not, then I'll still buy a bit lol.
1	1525795316	2	i think bitcoin is very strong to be bother with that even if it falls to 8 k still it can recovers eventually
0	1525774969	4	Just sold my iota on Binance with a nice 20% profit. It will start dropping now. Huobi price also dropping now 
0	1525790198	3	Be a programmer, here is my current plan/situation:>DCA 1kUSD into BTC a week>I have 20 ETH, but I'm about to panic sell. As a developer I worry blockchain is awful for apps and is overhyped.>30k in other top 30 alt coins, waiting for another bull-run, then I'm selling 90% for BTC.I dont see any coin that is competitive with BTC.  I used to believe in ETH, but there are many upcoming problems like POS hard fork, no cap on ETH, and its centralized leadership might cause problems.I thought bitcoin was flawed, but I'm using BTC for merchant payments and petty peer to peer payments with friends. No fees, always instant. (Layer 2)I cannot figure out what (if any) is worth putting serious resources into. I think Bitcoin already solved the currency problem, and I'm skeptical we will need blockchain apps. Is anyone else with more than 20k in any crypto(outside BTC)? Do you believe in it? Or are you going to sell?
1	1525790697	3	At this time, I think there is a lot more money to be made in alts vs BTC.  I agree with you however, that the end game of this should be to accumulate BTC.  In the end, BTC is what you are going to want to be holding. 
1	1525792651	3	Hmmm, so what is your opinion on ICX then? 
1	1525791399	2	I agree with you in that my opinion of BTC has definitely improved as well. The only major hurdles I see in BTCs future is what happens to the block chain when quantum computing becomes more available (and perhaps more miner rebellions).The 5 year projections I see for btc have it at like 50k. The other major coins ETH and XRP have similar predictions (5×-6× range). The biggest personal struggle I have with BTC is simply this: what does is to better than its competitors? And that's really the question that keeps nagging at me when considering the BTC hegemony persisting out past 10 years.Once we have the crypto equivalent of Visa or Mastercard and vendors don't need to individually support various coins, will BTC be able to compete? I don't have answer, but I still think BTC will hold the crown for many many years yet and I'm not really investing on a 20-year plan.
1	1525791436	3	>As a developer I worry blockchain is awful for apps and is overhyped.Dude, look into what problems blockchain solves that can't otherwise be solved without it.If you're a programmer, and you don't understand what solutions an immutable database provides, I feel sorry for you and the people that take your opinion as "expertise."
2	1525791546	2	>If you're a programmer, and you don't understand what solutions blockchain provides, I feel sorry for you.Decentralized public verified ledger is the benefit of blockchain. Its expensive and slow. I have always used centralized verification for my own apps. I dont understand what applications are okay with the enormous cost of implementing blockchain.
3	1525791938	3	Ugh! Blockchain is **not** slow. Just the implementaion of eth and bitcoin's PoW. PoS and other implementations are significantly faster. Eth and Bitcoin haven't switched because their community of miners (have and will) vote AGAINST the switch because it doesn't benefit them. As to your other point, there's literally no reason to use blockchain for your general, everyday apps. If you use blockchain for creating an app that keeps track of your contacts in your phone, you're an idiot. Blockchain DOES offer solutions though that can't otherwise be solved without it and **that** is what apps you should be building on it.
0	1525773400	2	with regards what is happening with IOTA, the fact that people don't understand why there can be different prices on different exchanges, clearly shows that those folks have absolutely no clue whatsoever how trading works, i.e. local markets, buyers vs sellers etc...

0	1525775687	2	What's going on with Bytecoin?Edit: oh I see, it's going for $0.22 on Binance, so everyone is buying it up at other exchanges to sell on Binance.But it looks like [BCN block chain hasn't confirmed a transaction for 100 minutes](https://chainradar.com) so no one has been to successfully arbitrage yet.Btw why does everyone call BCN a scam? Because the founders allegedly hold 90% of the supply or something, but there's no way to know?
1	1525777664	3	It was a pre-mine operation. 82%(151.2bn coins) mined by an unknown entity. This would eventually lead to a CryptoNote fork with a new genesis block. That fork would be known as bitmonero. The community would eventually wrest control of bitmonero and fork it to the Monero we all know today. >As the mask was uncovered and Bytecoin was recognized to be a scam later in 2014, many forks started to pop up, which seemed to be an attempt to rectify and rebrand the fraud so that no one would notice.>BitMonero was the first (later taken back by the community after the authoritarian style of Thankful_for_today), with Fantomcoin, Quazarcoin, HoneyPenny and Boolberry following thereafter. The thing that links Bytecoin to some of these forks is SourceForge, suggesting that there is a likelihood that the forks are from the same, anonymous people who created BCN in the first place.>Now compare that to Monero, a project that has identifiable, well-known personalities working together on the code since 2014. As a consequence, it is rumored that the Bytecoin developer’s (or those connected to the project) led a smear campaign against Monero, in an attempt to destroy the reputation of any CryptoNote coin they did not control.

This is a really beautiful transaction because it allows regular users to get the CryptoComes token airdropped into a downloaded wallet, send it to their friends, start sharing it and creating an economy - even if they don’t know anything about Blockchain or Ether.With Catapult, somebody can make their own app, their own wallet, and have their users or their business using that token without ever having to join an exchange.

4	1525763906	1	Can confirm. Needed to transfer bitcoin a couple days ago because Bittrex didn't have LSK/ETH pairs. Took me about 30 mins to wait and paid 10% fee or something
5	1525764933	1	Was that from an exchange or a wallet?     Bitcoin fees are very cheap now. The only way its expensive if its from an exchange that has set fees. And that applies to pretty much every coin.
6	1525765145	1	From exchange so indeed the high fee was mostly because of the exchange. Still it took really long and fee is higher than other coins haha

1	1525767917	3	10K is a really though resistance because it's psychological. People see it as a nice point to cash some out. Indeed 10k was rejected but the sentiment didn't change a lot. FUD spreading around yesterday because of the ''SEC meeting'' that never happened. I think (Hope im right) this was just a correction that needed to happen because we went up so quickly. I believe if we get another wave we'll go over 10K because most people had their sell orders filled the previous time
1	1525766251	5	Bounced of $9.2k, which is a higher low. Going to go try our luck at $10k again. Likely to go through this time. Run\-up about to start any moment now.
