0	1525847993	43	This minor dip was a result of Vitalik eating salad.
1	1525848325	14	That guy should seriously stop eating salad and focus heavily on carbs, fat and protein üòÖ 20kg later he could replace something from plate for salad.
1	1525849103	9	It looks like thats all he ever eats!

0	1525846633	32	Can we have some bad news? All this good news is obviously not working.
1	1525847036	23	i might have lupus
2	1525857986	11	I just talked to Dr. Gregory House. It's not lupus.
1	1525848901	7	I got some bad news, the bad news is there is no good newsBut the good news is there is no bad news!
2	1525849667	8	*Price trades sideways*
3	1525852665	5	Plotline: Sideways is actually pointing slightly down.
0	1525874382	27	I check this thread more than my portfolio these days.Way more entertaining 
1	1525875221	7	One of the best corners of the internet imho. :)
1	1525875412	6	They should give this a place in the dark web
0	1525846485	21	Another day, another dip.
0	1525849225	14	LOL at the bagholders of BCN. 2 cents haha
0	1525864490	14	BTC moving a bit, still lowish volume though.Hopefully we can reject 9k ~ 9.1k once and for all so we can finally continue the move to 10k
1	1525864662	5	I'll be truly happy if we don't retrace back to 8800 with the way it's been acting recently.
2	1525865031	2	8.8k is our best hope for a big bounce though

1	1525855358	3	Feel this.
2	1525855513	2	I'm a Brit living in China. Get to sit and watch it burn every day. 
1	1525855956	3	Why?
1	1525855355	4	How do you mean? I'm European, had no difficulties so far
2	1525855983	14	Asians selling while we sleep.
3	1525856849	3	Simple solution - get up early.
4	1525857984	14	no
3	1525860309	2	This is too easy... If they would really sell every night, we Europeans could be fine going in Tether daily before sleeping. But there are a few single days, Asia powers up the market. And you never know, when such a night happens... So we HODL and have salty mornings...
1	1525860123	2	Could it possibly be turned into profit? Buy early in the morning and sell at night?
0	1525867737	11	Good Day Fam, lets hope today is an exciting day.
1	1525867797	7	We good. 
1	1525867822	9	We good fam.

0	1525878089	13	I wonder if in 5 years time, people will look back on these archived discussions and laugh at how people are complaining about BTC being 9k and wish that they would've gotten in now...
1	1525878697	5	!RemindMe 5 yearsSomeone posted a daily discussion from few years ago... some ppl (probably TAs?) were saying that it would be hard for BTC to hit $10 again
2	1525879536	2	bitcoin hasnt been below 10 since like 2012
1	1525878663	3	Yes, which is why I don't think people should be too bothered about their entries or "bag-holding" BTC that they bought at an inflated price.That shit will look laughable eventually. Having BTC > not having BTC. 
1	1525878972	2	Remindme! 5 years
1	1525879880	2	RemindMe! 5 years
1	1525883117	2	There was a post referring to the 2014 crash of bitcoin and how people complained they didn't sell at 50$. Epic to see haha. The discussions looked similair to nowadays
0	1525846643	24	I would snort bitcoin if there was an easy way to do it
1	1525846707	53	Lines of code.
0	1525853549	10	Is there a place where you can enter a crypto and a date\+time and get in return the price of the crypto at that moment? 
0	1525863857	15	June is shaping up to be the biggest month in crypto to dateEDIT:  My reasons are VET mainnet, EOS mainnet, Qubic details, Honte prep for OMG, AMB SDK and mainnet, PRL mainnet, FairX beta, ICX DEX, WTC mobile wallet, Genesis Vision Market, TRAC testnet, institutional money coming in
1	1525863935	4	Will that mean January is over?
1	1525864115	3	Isn't that what everyone said about May?
2	1525865333	2	I have been saying June will be the best month this year since January
3	1525866471	2	RemindMe! 2 months
0	1525877496	16	boy i remember having bought bitcoin to buy fake ids when i started college. now its soon to be adopted by wall stamazing growth
1	1525877719	8	and just imagine if you held that 10 or 20 BTC you used to buy that fake ID back then...but no way you could have known where crypto was headed haha
2	1525878142	11	i spent several million on drugs....
3	1525879696	2	Same I just found an old account and was looking at how many BTC I bought to use on the onion sites... just one of my accounts had about 50 total that I bought and traded. If only I had paid attention or even realized that it was an investment I‚Äôd be pretty happy by now. 
4	1525881068	2	I guess we got high AF at least?
2	1525877996	10	If everyone held and didn't buy anything back then, then the value wouldn't have gone up as nobody would actually be using it for transactions.
2	1525878247	5	my friend acquired and spent 5btc on some magic mushrooms on silk road many years back.  Then he bought 0.25btc in december for like $4000.  Poor bastard.
2	1525880263	2	i had around 1.5 left and totally forgot about it. A couple years later a couple friends were talking about bitcoin's price being around 4500 at that time, and i remembered having onei cashed out. oh boy what a mistake
0	1525882530	7	Why does the sub hate TRON so much?
1	1525882714	10	Because it is a joke with a copy pasted whitepaper of nonsense.https://www.ccn.com/vitalik-buterin-continues-to-troll-tron-over-whitepaper-plagiarism-allegations/
1	1525883494	3	Because they don't own it. Who cares mate? If you like it buy it. I always see posts like "All this resistance towards it tells me they are jealous and scared of us".Or "If it's not shilled on reddit then it must be a great buy".Use that logic. Or don't..
0	1525882652	8	BAT a good buy right now?
1	1525882696	11	I think so and I don't own any 
1	1525883424	3	Yes. BAT has a very strong roadmap for 2018 and has already shown some incredibly promising updates so far.
1	1525884509	3	I actually don't have any yet, but am seriously thinking about it.  Feel like where there's smoke, there's fire with regards to the BAT/Coinbase rumors.  Erc20 support, the CEO's infatuation with the project, and the fact there's a working product would seem to bode well for BAT's potential listing on Coinbase.
0	1525885668	8	my opinion isn't worth much but i'm predicting a lot of green today.
1	1525889274	2	I predict it will be another boring day with minimal gains on what we've already made. It they can't shake off the weak hands with these pullback then maybe boredom will do it. 
0	1525890798	8	ONT slowly climbing. will hopefully break out soon again
1	1525892103	2	Yes looks that way üëçüèª
0	1525885668	20	Bull-Run incoming... 
1	1525885733	13	A multi billionaire lurks among us peasants 
1	1525886718	11	Tom Lee says btc could go up 70% in the next week because of the consensus in NY
2	1525888376	6	And he has been 170% accurate in his predictions.
0	1525884598	7	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/09/mike-novogratz-partners-with-bloomberg-to-launch-cryptocurrency-index/Awesome..good things happening
0	1525891961	6	new investors are coming to our exchanges while existing ones are regaining interest after the drop because they‚Äôre getting good value and are making money as the prices of cryptocurrencies move higher. Most of crypto now rises up (EOS, NEO, TRON, CREDITS, CARDANO)
0	1525896552	7	Not a coinbase fan but seeing increasing mentions can only be positive for us! Also the two richest men Gates and Buffet talking about it no matter positive/negative has pushed BTC back to the main stage of the elite. Also, NYSE thinking of listing it is helping crypto gain traction and momentum. It's like the whole last week is the calm before the storm (SEC fake news aside).
0	1525867358	11	BTC volume picking up, pumping a bit, looks great! I hope it's not a bull trap heh
1	1525867421	2	Narrator: it is.
2	1525868019	7	Narrator: As he typed the last sentence, he knew in his heart that price of bitcoin was like an ever changing painting. A painting made of feces, shattered dreams, and FUD.
3	1525868314	6	Record scratch: Yep, that‚Äôs me sitting on the street with the blanket and dog. You‚Äôre probably wondering how I got here...

0	1525875688	12	Is NEO a good buy right now?
1	1525876999	10	Any value less than $80 is a good time to buy more NEO for a long time.
1	1525876147	7	I don't see it going anywhere but up from here 
1	1525875983	5	Yeah, but I've thought it was a good buy ever since it dipped under .01 BTC.  
1	1525875911	2	I'm buying whenever I can
1	1525875917	3	yes
1	1525878431	3	Yes!
0	1525866040	5	People really need to give the market some time to recover, if you can't take it, just take a few weeks off of watching the price every hour
1	1525866248	5	Easier said than done amigo.
0	1525870826	7	Apologies if this is a somewhat dumb question based on incorrect information, but am I right in thinking that Gas is the token used for Neo platforms in the same way that ETH is used for Etherum? And if that's correct, then what is the actual Neo token for? Or have I got that completely wrong?As someone who has been ininvested in crypto for 8 months (NEO being one of my coins) but still doesn't really understand what exactly I've invested in, please enlighten me! 
1	1525871053	10	Not exactly right. While you can buy GAS separately from NEO, you cannot buy ETH's gas separately since ETH gas = ETH but in a smaller denomination. It is like dollars and cents but with the same name being ETH, even though smaller denomination is called gas. Hopefully this is not confusing. 
2	1525871233	3	Ok thanks. I understand that about ETH. But then what is the difference between GAS and NEO? Are they both different tokens that can be used on the NEO platform? Edit: to clarify I mean the NEO gas, not the ETH gas
3	1525871483	5	yes, GAS and NEO are different but interrelated coins (not tokens): if you hold NEO - you get GAS for this.
1	1525872578	9	NEO = Voting rights.GAS = Utility token.
1	1525870932	2	I'm also interested to know. I think you're right about the use of those coins though
0	1525873750	6	Predictions from here till the end of summer?a) Back to all time lows of 2018b) Sideways movement c) 1 tril marketcap
1	1525873805	17	d) All of the above.
1	1525874240	10	I agree with /u/Par0l. Pick whichever option will most screw your trading strategy, and that's what will happen this month. Repeat for the following month, etc.
2	1525874368	3	Very true.
1	1525874408	3	d) 600 b market cap?
0	1525894453	6	Thoughts on ELEC? Thinking of buying this dip 
1	1525894549	2	still waiting on kucoin ETH deposit to buy elec. After 105 confirmations stilll waiting. 
0	1525873546	10	ETH XLM NEO and ICX holding for long term.  25% in each, any flaws to my strategy?  What coin should I drop and for what?
1	1525875455	3	Actually a really sensible, cross-function portfolio - well done! For myself, I would allocate more % to XLM and ICX as they have bigger growth in the short term. 
2	1525878766	2	> cross-functionAren't these all platforms?
1	1525875110	2	Solid portfolio, don't let the haters get you down.  
1	1525879039	2	You only have platforms. Should spread across different markets, here are my recommendations. I think I'll put most of my holdings into Skycoin and IOTA, since they cover the most areas1. Currencies \(IOTA, Nano\)2. Platforms \(IOTA, Elastos, Skycoin, Ontology, ICX\)3. Ecosystem \(Qash, Loopring\)4. Privacy \(Skycoin, Engima\)5. Gaming \(Enj\)6. BaaS \(ICX, Elastos, Ontology\)7. Decentralized Storage \(IOTA, PRL\)8. Decentralized Internet \(Skycoin, SHL\)9. Lending \(elix\)10. Outsourced Cloud Computing \(Golem, PRL, IOTA\)11. Currency Exchange \(IOTA, Req\)12. Oralces \(IOTA, Aeternity, Chainlink\)
0	1525874696	11	I'm going to shill an airdrop group not because I get anything for it (I don't; I've already gotten my rewards), but because I genuinely think it's awesome:Everyone here should sign up for [Parachute](https://www.parachutetoken.com/). It's a hybrid of an airdrop club, a freelancer marketplace (not yet launched), and a social club on Telegram. How it works: You sign up for Parachute and its telegram, and then sign up on the Telegram groups of its partners (currently there are three partners), say hello on all groups, and that's it. No need to shill coins on social media. Everyone who signs up gets substantial rewards in not-yet-traded coins. I got ~$55 of one at the pre-ICO price, and $35 of another. Then there are also super-trooper bonuses for the people who are most engaged with the Telegram groups. These rewards are huge--anywhere from 1.5x-10x the airdrop amounts. Everyone is extremely friendly, too! 
1	1525875824	4	Two questions: 1. How long till you get the airdrops?2. Do you have to stay in the telegram groups?
2	1525876314	6	1. The airdrops depend on how many people sign up to Telegram and a 30-day counter--whichever hits first. 2. Yes, you have to stay in the Telegram groups. The goal is building community. 
1	1525875039	3	thanks, will give it a try
0	1525848456	10	Where is the shit post that we crossed 10k
1	1525849685	1	We crossed 10k, it happened 2 months ago.
0	1525872312	11	Finally, XMR is showing some signs.  
0	1525851109	4	It is a coin that I do not really pay any attention to, but I was looking back at BCH over the the last month; between when we had the major lows of early April until the highs of last week. Was there any news connected to why it performed so well?
1	1525851890	2	Bitcoin Cash will upgrade on May 15th, increasing the maximum block size to 32MB (allowing for 96 transactions per second) and re-enabling old OP codes (which will give BCH more scripting & smart contracting functionality). It's also returning the OP_RETURN data field to a 220-byte limit, which will enable many more complex projects to build on top of it. Just an example, Counterparty was a very promising platform being built on top of BTC back in the day, but the Bitcoin Core developers objected to it using the 220-byte OP_RETURN field, saying that using the blockchain for certain types of data was not appropriate, so Bitcoin Core limited that field to only 80 bytes, effectively killing Counterparty. A new group is rebuilding Counterparty on top of BCH: https://counterparty.cash/https://news.bitcoin.com/op-codes-and-scripting-capabilities-coming-to-bitcoin-cash/
1	1525851401	3	Upgrade to 32 mb cap, wich no one needs since doge has more Transactions then bch. and Probl. Chinese Mining cartell pumping it up beforhand. 
2	1525851934	4	A 32MB size limit doesn't mean that all blocks will be 32MB, it means there is 32MB of room to grow into. Why is that a bad thing?
0	1525867167	5	Nobody talking about ZIL?It's marching up the ranks at the moment. Left nano in it's dust. 
1	1525867553	8	Lmao everything is leaving NANO in the dust. 
0	1525870695	5	[The opposite of FUD](https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/994185982588145671)
0	1525874830	5	Can someone explain me why there's apparently a "rule" or a "trend" that when Bitcoin/Ethereum goes up, alt goes down ? 
1	1525875458	6	Most of it is bots that sell when the ratio falls.  The ratio falls when BTC goes up and the price of your alt doesn't go up.
1	1525875205	3	Think alot of the reasoning for alts going up or down in relation to BTC/ETH comes from the fact that they are the leading pairs options. Most people have to buy BTC/ETH then transfer it to an exchange to buy Alts. Same process for selling, need to sell Alts into BTC/ETH to cashout or take profits. Also you have those who are moving Alts gains into BTC/ETH and the same for BTC/ETH to alts.More pairings and exchanges allowing for direct fiat to coin purchases will reduce this effect. 
0	1525850855	14	Asia been fucking up
0	1525853934	16	Ahhh I am sick of waking up to this shit.
1	1525854768	7	Sell all the coins then? :D
2	1525854833	12	#:D
3	1525854926	5	Haha im holding onto them. But indeed it's annoying waking up every time with this
0	1525873538	15	The real question is:Do I buy even more NEO ?
1	1525874527	5	always + GAS
1	1525875044	4	I have been thinking of things I can sell around my house to buy more NEO at these levels.  Massively undervalued in Sat value right now.  Should be trading near 900k-1m.  
2	1525876408	2	yeah im thnking that it may go down even more then rebound, im doing a 50% buy now, and next days depends how things go will make decision, but  yeah even at this price is a bargain, can easy go 100+ in 2 weeks
1	1525874642	2	I am!!!
0	1525883208	10	Hey guys, looking for your opinions. My portfolio is 50% ETH then its BTC, NEO, LTC, VEN, XRP, XLM, ADA. This is from January and I haven‚Äôt touched it since. But I‚Äôm wondering if it would be wise to re-allocate to different projects OR keep these and add more to them? Some of the projects I have had my eyes on are EOS, IOTA, OMG, ICX, ZIL, NANO, ZRX, & BAT. If you had to narrow it down to 3 of those projects, which 3 would you pick? Obviously im going to do my own research, but want to see what other‚Äôs think
1	1525883485	3	You need to start adding periodic rebalancing.  Look into something like HodlBot.  
1	1525883564	3	My 3 from your list would be BAT, ZRX, ZIL.  Nano too if you are willing to wait longer but short term (<1 month) I don't see it doing much.
1	1525884135	2	I like OMG a lot. Just about every coin you mentioned is solid, though. I'm currently trying to build a hodlbot-style top-20 portfolio in Binance. I'm waiting to actually try hodlbot until it's been around for a few more months. I've messaged the dev, and he seems nice, but I'm still nervous about giving my binance API key to a bot made by someone else. 
2	1525884250	4	Thanks man. I‚Äôve had my eyes on OMG for a while.. After quickly reading about the hodlbot though, the API Keys give me my reservation/fear also
1	1525884285	2	You‚Äôve got so many projects I think you just need to decide what you believe in overall. 
2	1525884634	3	That‚Äôs the thing, I believe in all of them and my strategy from the beginning was to get these and evaluate them after a year. But like someone else mentioned, it‚Äôs important to re balance. And then there is FOMO which drove me to ask this question. Ha don‚Äôt wanna look back at the end of the year and realize I missed out
1	1525885560	2	ZRX is a must. 
1	1525886373	2	ZRX, ICX, EOS and OMG. I know you asked for three, but all four are solid. ICX and OMG particularly because of where they are right now on the ratio. 
1	1525887693	2	ZIL under $0.50 is a huge opportunity. This will be a top10 market capper in the next few months (assuming the market continues to trend upwards) and top5 EOY. 
0	1525884717	9	Couldn't resist getting some more BAT at this price. I'm hopeful for the future. If they deliver, it'll be incredible.I'm already really enjoying their working product which is more than can be said for 90% in the top 100.
1	1525886467	4	GVT is an amazing project and one of a kind, and has a working product rank -180
0	1525847476	12	[deleted]
1	1525847944	4	Shardly surprising ;)
2	1525849341	2	It does have the potential to overtake EOS. 
3	1525851802	3	I mean it does what EOS does without sacrificing decentralisation. Glad to see it finally getting recognised :)
1	1525849845	2	How did it instantly got such a valuation? Was it public before you could buy it or anything?
2	1525857211	2	I think the ICO was really successful, and there was a lot of hype so many buyers as soon as it hit exchanges. Same as WAN 
3	1525858624	2	The big feature is just sharding as far as I've seen. Or is there anything else that would make it worth something?
1	1525852974	3	Well, ZIL is really the real-world equivalent of the EOS hype. Better actually. Their infrastructure runs and you can test it yourself. The first real ETH competitor if you ask me...
0	1525874232	14	New theory-The /r/CryptoCurrency  daily thread isnt full of morons that believe in alt coins.My theory- Daily thread is filled with paid marketing shills from alt coins trying to pump their shitcoin.This would explain why top 10 coins(especially BTC) are downvoted and shitcoins are spammed. 
1	1525874482	9	Wouldn't say this is a New theory or a theory at all, would say this is purely fact and has been for a while.
1	1525875251	3	Some people genuinely want to talk about good coins or new coins. I know I do. 
0	1525896846	8	Idex about to open back up for trading.Edit: Why would this be downvoted? Just trying to share the news.
1	1525897510	3	ignore the downvotes, some people are losing money today and acting out because of it. 
0	1525848397	3	Weird price movement since saturday. A drop overnight (for me) and during the day the price is stable as fuck
0	1525858025	4	Though Huobi is the #4 exchange in terms of volume, I have never seen anyone ever mention the potential of the Huobi token, whereas KCS and COSS are talked about a lot more. I think it proves that the level of marketing makes a lot of difference in how a crypto is perceived.  
1	1525858085	6	COSS is a reddit favourite and Huobi isn't nearly as popular amongst westerners, I think that has a lot to do with it. 
2	1525858323	5	We're definitely in a western hemisphere bubble in here. 
1	1525864467	2	https://medium.com/@cryptweeter/can-huobi-pull-a-binance-i-think-they-can-and-i-think-ht-has-at-least-a-1000-upside-from-here-d11f640e80cd This article echoes your thoughts

0	1525868406	5	In regards to BCN, or any other coin that fomos hard, why do people still chase FOMOs? Sure you may increase profits for a very brief period of time, but its incredibly risky and chances are, you'll be a bagholder. You never wanna invest in something when the price is at ATH / it's skyrocketing, actually you should invest in something when price is bleeding hard (but not gonna die out). Chasing something near ATH is like begging to buy at the top. 
1	1525868602	9	Simple psychological reasons.You rather take the healthy, good looking guy with you instead of the one that just had a fight or got beat up and is bleeding like shit.You know, it could stain your car or something. To bad Mr. Prince Charming will rape you next stop, get rid of you and ride your car to his next stop where he'll do the same again.
2	1525869104	7	Sounds like you have been a few bad dates, hope you are luckier with your trading
2	1525868877	6	What an odd analogy.
2	1525870259	3	This went to a dark place.
1	1525868623	6	They didn't teach us trading 101 in high school.
2	1525869888	2	sure as hell would be more useful than courses like Calculus that I never use in real life.
1	1525868758	5	The very idea that some random dudes are getting filthy rich and we are just watching from sidelines evokes fear in ppl. Hence the term FOMO. While this doesn't invalidate your statement, I think some ppl just ride the train if either they are newbies or greedy traders. 
1	1525873003	2	Cause sometimes it‚Äôs worth the risk. Set tight stops,don‚Äôt be greedy, make sure it‚Äôs pumping lots of volume. BCN increased my portfolio by 27%

0	1525872177	5	Can somebody post a link to a/some article (s) explaining why all coins are so closely tied to Bitcoin? I mean, when Bitcoin goes down/up, all others do too. Its annoying as hell.Or if it's auper simple just explain why.Please and thank you.
1	1525872320	6	1) most coins don't have USD pairing, but they do have BTC pairing.  So to determine their actual USD value they convert it to BTC first, and then use that to determine the USD value2) If BTC dips, and every thing else dips, then basically it just means the entire market dipping, not that BTC is causing everything else to dip
1	1525872716	5	As a simple example think of going on holiday.You fly to the UK and buy a coke, which costs ¬£1, which is the equivilant of $2. The exchange rate deteriorates and now ¬£1=$2.5, so the coke is now worth $2.5 for the exact same thing, just because GBP is more expensive.Because the majority of entry points into crypto are through BTC, fluctuations in the USD value of BTC affects the USD value of everything else just like in the above example Does that make sense?
2	1525873086	4	So that part is pretty straightforward. But can we dig deeper?  Because a lot of times it‚Äôs more magnified than just the exchange rate.    I‚Äôve always believed it was because people buy/sell alts with BTC to get in/out of alts so that effects price of BTC.   But it seems the same effect isn‚Äôt seen with ETH?   Don‚Äôt most people nowadays buy alts with ETH?  
3	1525873965	3	Yes, this ^^Ive bought all my ripple with ETH
0	1525872931	5	Ive been in the crypto space for almost two years now but I've never been fully involved. About to start putting more time and effort into things.

I would love to eventually have a full understanding of the space and increasing my knowledge is step one.
0	1525873978	5	Kucoin have distributed the SHL tokens, finally! 
1	1525874046	3	Currently trading on IDEX lol
2	1525874100	3	Not worth trading it imo, coin has no value right now. Wait til mainnet. 
3	1525874838	2	Yeah, it‚Äôs trading at like $0.0003 per coin lololol
1	1525874161	3	Has there been any clarity on whether SHL is ever going to trade on KuCoin? It doesn't make much sense to support an airdrop, and then say, "Get your filthy airdrop tokens out of here!"
2	1525875048	2	The Oyster team is talking with Kucoin about it.  There's a good chance if you leave them on there you will be ok and Kucoin will trade SHL within a few weeks.  However, under current circumstances if you don't take your SHL off Kucoin by may 20 they will no longer be available for withdrawal on kucoin and you may lose them. 
0	1525880255	5	Buy OMG or NEO?Or 50-50?
1	1525880970	6	Both are amazing products and going to be huge. OMG roadmap was just released and has massive massive milestones coming up, including a fork (called a spoon), plasma, DEX and staking. The initial staking is going to function as a coin burn. The coin burn will be executed by buy orders and then burning those coins. This is going to drive the price up. It's all a matter of time until massive OMG hype starts building. It's an incredible buy right now.NEO is very undervalued and has pulled back a bit recently. I think it's a great buy. It has staking active now, apps coming out, and so far most of it's dapps look like really good projects. Because it's expensive to create a DAPP on NEO, you get less shit ICOs that are just junk coins that anyone can create. The counter to that is you get less "air hype" which unfortunately with this irrational market is what drives price. However, NEO has a lot of "substance" because there aren't a million shit ICOs on it. It's a very very solid longterm play.
1	1525880600	4	NEO is so low right now that if BTC goes on a run it could hit 20% or better in BTC value which could be up to 40% in fiat value. IDK about OMG right now. I'm watching other things I won't mention here. I do hold a decent amount of NEO. 
1	1525880700	4	I think NEO has more short term potential growth 
1	1525881131	4	Thx, bought NEO, when it rises well I can buy OMG
2	1525881402	3	Good choice
1	1525880680	3	NEO/GAS.
1	1525880768	3	75-25 NEO/OMGBased on current prices rather than strength of project (I like both), NEO should go up quicker then you can even out to 50-50. Also you can convert the GAS you get to BNB or sell.
1	1525880494	2	50-50 safe

1	1525876751	5	How much the coin team pays the exchange. The more you pay the better chance you get listed.
2	1525876948	2	That's not true for Coinbase. They've turned down bribes from XRP already.
2	1525877001	2	based on what ?
3	1525877088	2	Probably based on negotiation skills 
3	1525877126	2	Don't ask me I'm not an exchange owner.
1	1525877090	3	I've seen unconfirmed reports that KuCoin charges 100 BTC to list a new coin, and Binance can charge upwards of $10m.

1	1525884906	6	the IRS isn't going to come after your friend because he forgot to report a very small amount of profit. He reported to the best of his knowledge and he so happened to forget.  The IRS is coming after whales who don't pay their taxes.
2	1525885822	5	Yup. As long as he honestly tried and it isn't a ton of money they won't care. He's doing better than a lot of people of this sub who think the IRS is a joke.

0	1525856611	5	Any thoughts on NEXO?
0	1525874830	4	What was the point of Binance listing BCN?  I think it's a bad look personally.  CZ should make it a point to try to list only legit projects if he cares about the future of crypto.
1	1525875690	5	They're a business first & foremost. They aren't the curators of which projects are worthy of investment any more than the Nasdaq or FTSE100 are.
2	1525879565	3	They make bank just by operating legitimately, why threaten their reputation by earning what amounts to pocket change to them?
2	1525876861	2	does not excuse greed and dishonesty 
1	1525876174	5	The truth: Binance made a shit ton of money for listing BCN.  That's the reason
1	1525875061	3	Making money.
1	1525875991	3	money rule the world, my friend
1	1525875521	4	Isn't that kind of censorship though instead of letting the market decide?  If they only listed legit projects, Tron or Verge would have never been listed anywhere.  People have to be allowed to be stupid and buy what they like.

0	1525874267	7	My two picks for Coinbase's next ERC-20:**0x**: the "DEX protocol". Currently being *used* by many crypto-projects and rapidly growing (https://0xproject.com/wiki#List-of-Projects-Using-0x-Protocol). Rumors to be added to Coinbase (3 of 4 0x advisors are all former Coinbase higher-ups, along with other reasons). Has gone up over 200% in just the last 30 days, and held quite well through the dips. Still 30% down from the ATH but that's much better than most coins. If 0x (ZRX) is added to Coinbase, that will certainly bring in new money and likely increase the price (imo). **Basic Attention Token**: Mature project (compared to most), Brian Armstrong literally tweeted "exactly the sort of token we'd like to support on Coinbase and GDAX over the coming year"  (March 2017). Now I know that was said over a year ago, but I still feel it's a strong indicator. They probably wanted to wait a bit for BAT to mature/regulatory clarity.   Yes, this is mostly speculation and rumors, but like they say, "buy the rumor". Don't invest more than you're willing to lose and don't put all your eggs into one basket. Cheers.
1	1525876217	3	Don't forget OMG, it has a chance too
2	1525876646	4	OMG doesn't have a mainnet out yet. It's not being added any time soon imo. Both of the above coins are much more mature.

1	1525861449	9	I don't know, but i didn't sell in februari/march and i think i won't now either. Just too risky
2	1525863751	2	i did sell 35% yesterday because i didnt want to see most of my Profit melting away like in Feb/March and i needed some cash.could very well go the other way, but this way i get a new bike and can still make some Profit if the bull continues.When i was almost down to break even i told myself: "next time your up to a certain mark ill cash some out"  it wasn't easy =P
3	1525864256	2	Hmm yeah smart move. Only think is i don't need the money right away. Could also get some of my savings if i really need it. Otherways if i did need it i would've done the same though. 
1	1525860610	5	Usually when it feels like that for a few days there‚Äôs a surprise pump 
2	1525862614	2	Amen - I'm sure people are sick of everyone going "I'm gunnu HOLDLDODHDHDL" but while it would be nice to see a constant shooting star of green the real hope is that we're sitting on 10 to 1000 "x" coins/tokes that do a bitcoin over 5 years - some weeks you go aww some weeks you go ahhh - I wanna know what expression future me has
1	1525860553	4	Because its already happening. Its just consolidating before a big movement either up or down. Remember consensus is next week. Despite this shitting from Vitalik its actually a good thing for announcements and partnerships.

0	1525871922	2	I board a plane in a few hours. Any crypto podcast suggestions? I see several in the App Store. 
1	1525873461	7	If you want really good content, I advise you to watch any podcasts by the famous "Carlos Matos"

1	1525872522	4	Coin Mastery... Great stuff. It's best to watch it on YouTube, but you can still grasp some of the concepts on Podcast
1	1525873018	3	Crypto 101 has some great interviews. I really enjoyed the one with CZ, CEO of Binance.
1	1525872761	3	unchained is a pretty good one.  I usually listen to that one on the plane.

0	1525874884	2	does anyone know if there are blockchain companies that are (not necessarily exclusive) operating/developing in the insurtech sector?
0	1525875964	2	In a market like this, with the way alts are effected by flutters in the price of ETH/BTC, what‚Äôs your ‚Äúgolden ratio‚Äù of ETH/BTC to alts one should hold in a portfolio?     (This would be a question for medium/long hodl‚Äôrs not short term traders. )  I‚Äôm at 15/85% but starting to think I should up it to maybe 25/75%?
1	1525877043	3	%30 BTC - %20 ETH - %50 high risk alts on the rising.EDIT: I‚Äôd remove %10 ETH for some %10 NEO.
1	1525876584	2	30/30 eth btc, 40% alts
1	1525876941	2	In general, I like 50% BTC 50% alts.  That way, you can always buy when alts are really down, and then sell your profits back to BTC (or ETH) to maintain the 1:1 ratio.  I think people FOMO too much and want to get 100% alts in but you actually gain more from the swings in a volatile system like crypto as opposed to banking on something to keep on going up.  Most likely, the days of things just going up are over and we need to learn to make money from volatility. 
1	1525877771	2	This is interesting!   The way people talk about alts around here I would have thought most would have 25% or less in BTC/ETH.    So... if I'm getting out  of an alt, the best way would be wait until it rises in sats or eth right ? Not necessarily USD?   And if I have access to both BTC/alt and ETH/eth pairs and can choose, pick the one that is up the higher %?   
0	1525876599	2	So what‚Äôs the deal with iDex? Should I discontinue using it or just wait for it to allow trading again? 
1	1525877814	3	try DDEX
1	1525876875	2	Pretty risky to have money on there right now.

0	1525894622	1	So just instantly deposited USD into Coinbase, transfered it to GDAx, and limit bought ETH for no fees. And I'm also Level 3 verified now apparently. I feel like it was never this cheap so I'm kind of waiting for the catch. Is my bank about to wreck me with penalties because I had the audacity to use my own debit card to spend my own money at my discretion? What's going on here?EDIT: I think Coinbase lowering fees must be an extremely bullish sign. Here's the answer to my post btw this is a game changer.See [Feeless purchases I'm precumming ](https://i.imgur.com/3r1xQz5.png)
1	1525894854	2	Most likely no fees. But I have heard from some people on here a couple banks that did charge a fee even with debit cards. Check your statement in a few days. 
1	1525895618	2	I've done bank deposits directly from a Chase checking account to Coinbase and I never got hit by any extra fees from Chase. I think it depends on your bank.

0	1525895950	2	If there's anything I've learned from the crypto market, it's that somehow people are gonna look at bytecoin and think it's a really good deal and it'll skyrocket again for no reason, all because it had an artifical pump in the first place

1	1525895499	6	The fundamental problem you're submitting is the lack of a delineation between the speculative monetary value of crypto and its technological capacity. The technological value of crypto imposes an existential crisis upon banks, especially if it manages to iterate itself in the way that the pioneers want it to develop.The major threat to banks is disintermediation, meaning that the crypto world is trying to facilitate Peer-to-Peer interaction. Right now, banks act as a middleman and use antiquated technology (ACH, SWIFT, FedWire, Checks, etc.) that they can make a killing on by charging obscene fees. The same is true with Credit Card transactions, it costs a shocking amount of money for retailers to accept CC payments, and the CC companies have a vested interest in maintaining the current state of affairs as well. If economic activity no longer exists within this framework, they all stand to lose tremendous amounts of money.If banks no longer possess your money, their capital investment structure is fundamentally destroyed. Within the current finance status-quo, banks/brokers make money hand over fist through fees, lending and institutional trading/investing, while providing virtually no benefit to you. If there is an exodus from banks, it undermines the foundation of this structure.>If banks really wanted to, they have the capital to short btc to 0.There's no way they would risk that much capital when they're already making a killing with it in the current scheme. Instead they're just going to pull regulatory strings and do everything in their power to protect themselves. This is why you see crypto projects like Ripple (that IMO contradict the inherent ethos of blockchain/crypto), that can be integrated into the current banking system. This allows them to benefit from the new technology by having virtually instantaneous transfer of value at extremely low cost. But who do you think is going to benefit from that? It's sure as fuck not the average joe, JP Morgan is still going to nickle-and-dime the fuck out of you.

3	1525894515	7	Its not about the money yet. Its about the idea bitcoin was created with. Full decentralization. That way banks will lose a lot off customers and profits, if people decide to be holder of their own money whatever the currency/valuta is

1	1525870336	7	Out of those 3 ETH is furthest from ATH, has performed the worst the past 30 days and is the most staple coin. It has had a good week, but based on charts alone I'd say ETH. VEN isn't far behind and has main net coming up though, so that'd be a very close second.  Don't buy EOS.
1	1525873932	2	ETH
1	1525871269	4	Pay attention to how people "shill" VEN in these comments. The vast majority have no idea what it does or can tell you why you should invest. 
1	1525870421	2	EOS or ETH of those choices but all of them aren't my picks.
1	1525870093	3	Ven has most potential at the moment
0	1525896477	2	We are approaching night, the ritual of Asians selling. If they sell again, I suggest not buying. There is no fighting millions of people wanting to sell on the slightest gains. If they sell it below 9k, I'm stepping out.

FUN also has a telegram where the CEO is constantly updating members on the progress of development, marketing etc. They're a very trustworthy team.

1	1525867661	4	Get into some coins from top 50 like:Ziliqa , ICX, whatever / and sell not earlier than december 2018 not later than Jan 2019
0	1525881370	2	Sometimes I feel like it might be smartest to play the "what's being shilled this week" game.When you've been here a few months, you see how the community jumps from one shilled coin to the next.A long time ago it was NEO.A while ago it was Raiblocks (nano) and REQ.Then it was VEN and ICX.A month ago it was OMGTwo weeks ago it was EOS.A week ago it was BAT.This week it's ZIL.If you just find the *new* coins being shilled each week, you might do well for yourself. No research required, just riding FOMO waves.
1	1525885277	4	Where does one purchase FOMO?
1	1525881895	4	I think you miss a lot of posts if you haven't noticed OMG until a month ago, BAT until a week ago, and ZIL until this week. People were shilling OMG when the market was dumping Feb. 5. All the others, too, with the exception of ICX which is measured in levels of depression. 
2	1525882025	2	That's my point. You have to catch them at their earliest shill, but which is hard to do. If it's already 2x'd you are probably too late.
1	1525884295	2	Have you seen the Crypto Bandwagon Experiment? It buys the top 2 coins from the previous week and sets a stop-loss order at -25%. So far, it's made good money for the year. 
2	1525885299	2	did they stop? No week 18 as of right now.. 
3	1525885438	2	They sometimes fall a week behind. It usually updates, though. I think it's just one person doing it. 
0	1525895480	0	I saw a remark of somebody who said that VEN‚Äôs code base is closed, in a negative way that remark was placed. Perhaps It‚Äôs not that bad that it is closed. These days you here a lot about big companies starting investigating about Blockchain. Facebook, Oracle and likes. These guys have thousands of developers. The startup Blockchain projects that we are invested in just have a couple of developers who are working their ass off to meet the deadlines. Wouldn‚Äôt it be disgusting if Oracle would take one of these startups code, give it a twist and put it in the market as theirs and blow away all crypto startups. How many times has Oracle already don‚Äôt that in the past! I consider it as a threat to the whole crypto startup community the fact that most projects are open source... what do you think?
1	1525895750	4	Open source code has terms of the license in using it. Anybody using it commercially would be liable for infringement if they violated those terms.
1	1525896080	3	You are looking to much into it,Vechain are going open source in a couple of weeks.
0	1525867307	2	This BTC run is kind of unexpected.  I wonder where this is going. 
1	1525868533	9	Unexpected? We have been going up for 1.5 month now and what justifies this dip? Besides a lot of FUD about Ethereum which was debunked, there was actually a lot of good news recently. I'd say people were panicking and they are slowly buying back in, we should have gone up not down. I think we're heading for 500b.
2	1525868790	5	Agreed, with consensus coming up we will bust 10k wide open
1	1525868052	7	Up 
1	1525867871	10	How was it unexpected honestly? It bounced off the trend-line pretty convincingly
1	1525867374	7	Was oversold, seller exhaustion, impressive pushback from bulls, but possibly a bulltrap
0	1525875240	1	Man.... I'm drooling at grado headphones now but don't know which to choose. Had a m50x but wasn't satisfied with the sound. Hoping for eth to moon so I can get a pair of quality cans.
1	1525875902	16	A part time job would probably get you the headphones faster.
2	1525877000	3	Nah
2	1525876784	2	Haha true broI'm in no rush to buy so I'm putting some income into crypto. If eth moons, I'll get to buy a higher priced one by year end. Probably add in an amplifier and tidal subs.
