1	1526304711	18	After the beginning of this year I'd settle for the great mostly upward trend of 2018.
2	1526305037	8	The great balancing out of 2018
3	1526313325	3	Thanos approves 
0	1526308674	25	They forgot to include the whales' presentation on market manipulation for Consensus.
1	1526309045	4	And presentation on how to orchestrate a PND... 
1	1526308768	1	Lmao,  such organic growth!
2	1526309376	3	That's so over used stop we get it
0	1526305681	20	The consensus literally just started lol. It's 9:46 am in NY. Fuck. You guys are so fucking impatient. If you want faster money, sell crack. I guess 100% in 3 weeks isn't good enough.
1	1526305825	15	Where can I buy this crack token ? Guaranteed 3x ?
2	1526305942	6	CrackChain
3	1526306015	6	Damn. Sound like a promising name.
0	1526307231	20	A lot of shorters are getting REKT! 
1	1526307814	9	Nice....
1	1526310038	6	Whoever shorted before Consensus deserves it.  That's a bonehead risky move given the past two years history.
0	1526278347	19	no whale i aint selling!
0	1526307090	17	No more instant ramen noodles boys. It's time for the real ones at restaurants. 
0	1526278152	18	my bones hurt everyday at midnight
0	1526290204	16	Everyone seems a bit tense in here today haha
1	1526294722	29	NO ONE IS TENSE WE’RE FINE
1	1526302335	4	I'M NOT TENSE YOU'RE TENSE!
1	1526296196	7	If there is no consensus pump, this sub will drown in blood.
0	1526306902	17	The Pumpening is happening
0	1526282301	29	6 months since I lost 80% of my ATH gains. How much longer must I suffer.. I wear HODL shirt to sleep and nothing...
1	1526282579	17	Probably 6 months more till a year. You fell  for the HODL meme huh? It works fine only if you are holding long term. But it sounds like you check your portfolio constantly and have the time to make trades...I would probably do more trades if that's the case. But don't over trade either. 
2	1526290113	2	Such a fine line, that i'm also walking..
1	1526300285	1	Start mining and everything will change!
0	1526278832	14	Shoulda bought doge
1	1526296515	1	why?
2	1526298433	3	Because 1 doge = 1 doge 
3	1526309112	2	Still?
0	1526301851	13	8500+ attendance at consensus this year. 
1	1526303847	3	Nice to see the exponential growth! 2700 attendees at consensus 2017 and 1400 at consensus 2016.
0	1526278779	13	Is there going to be a way to watch consensus online or TV in the US?
1	1526279252	6	I think coindesk is offering a live feed... so you can check out that website.https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/live/
2	1526279908	3	I'll check it out. Thanks! 
0	1526307900	11	Somethin fishy with BTC price, It was $8300 10 minutes back just got my ramen bowl and now its at $8700, 
1	1526307977	26	Eat more ramen, quick!
2	1526309509	3	When ramen?
1	1526307951	7	Do that again, eat more ramen
1	1526307959	5	Eat steak now
0	1526309713	13	Consensus started a bull run 3 years in a row, this is the 4th. Maybe it was predictable, who knows. 
1	1526309891	4	what happens afterwards? Does it crash or stay horizontal?
1	1526310938	3	It probably will start another bull-trend, but whether or not it holds up is another story. Stay vigilant my friends. We may go up, but not as much as some may think... Or we go way way way up and leave everyone in the dust. Who knows. Just be happy you here.
0	1526278967	27	Wow,  another great night for crypto.  Cheers.
1	1526299745	1	Wow, great moves, Crypto! 
1	1526302339	1	Meh, my portfolio went up in sats but stayed around the same USD. 
0	1526290090	9	When June?
1	1526291230	4	So far I like May
2	1526300345	1	We just moved on from Jan to Feb. June's a loooonnnnnggggg way away.
0	1526301654	11	It has started.https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/live/
0	1526279293	9	50% into eth, how many eth are you holding?
1	1526279685	14	45% ETH 45% Ark the rest in some smaller coins.
1	1526294258	2	Meh too low volatility for my liking.Not that I own volatile assest, mostly exchange coins like BNB, KCS and COSS, exchanges are the clear winner in selling people the too good to be true crypto dream, tell me, what are the chances that you hit jackpot and invested in the next big thing since BTC and ETH?
1	1526286501	4	0%
2	1526303910	1	Too bad, ETH sparked the bull run of 2017. It's has shown the true potential of the blockchain and inspired many other projects. 
3	1526305137	1	And it is also not going to be at the event in New York over what is essentially a grudge. 
0	1526306449	11	Nothing like watching a 7-8% pump happen across the whole market in a matter of 30 mins while drinking my morning coffee.
0	1526299588	10	any reason why ARK is up so much? basically the only green in my portfolio, not really been keeping up with the project....
1	1526299931	11	They are getting huge attention from Concencus now and have been on the radar for a long time now.With V2 coming up soon, the future for ARK really looks bright.
2	1526301808	2	Where I live it’s been fucking raining for days and this crazy homeless looking dude name Moses keeps herding animals somewhere down towards the river 
1	1526299879	8	They are a subject of that consensus everybody speaks about. I read somewhere they did a lot of marketing around that event
1	1526304433	2	Because everyone was sleeping on it and now they’re finally kicking their marketing into gear. Think about how many top 20 coins don’t even have a main net, and Ark launched theirs in March 2017…
1	1526299785	3	It’s easy to be up when you spend a lot of time down 😉
0	1526305677	9	I don't know about you guys, but regardless of the price movements, shouldn't we be excited about consensus? Last year was a breakout year for prices, but I think this year can be the breakout for the technology, and consensus is the grand stage for these projects to share their plans and ideas. 
1	1526305929	2	excited about what exactly? does average Joe care about these industry players ego stroking themselves and slapping each other on the back? is average Joe getting in because of this consensus? let me check Google trends...............nope
0	1526306437	8	Bye fiat, nice knowing you
0	1526306559	11	don't tell the tether boys what's going on
0	1526308376	10	Shills shills everywhere 
1	1526308534	9	“Shills”  thats a cool name. Tell me about this project and it’s use case. 
2	1526308976	7	Great team, real world use cases, and tons of partnerships. Get in now bud it’s a sleeping giant
3	1526309133	8	Future top 10?
4	1526309866	6	Only if they hit their goals and roadmaps.
0	1526304829	9	People selling their crypto to buy tickets to consensus. No worries, I've got it figured out
1	1526304976	3	Nah it's NYC new year man
2	1526305474	1	Chinese new year tomoOr is it easter? 
3	1526305901	1	wrong wrong wrong.january ends tomorrow 
0	1526305843	7	I live in upper east side NYC about 10 minutes from Consensus. Should I head over and crash the party?
1	1526306007	3	Get me some t-shirts. Thx!
1	1526306464	1	Yeah you definitely should!
0	1526306184	7	Went up so fast hadn't realized I bought in to my own sell order that was still active. 
0	1526309887	7	Which 11am conference is everyone watching?I'm leaning towards "SCALING, LAYER 2 AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC INNOVATIONS"
0	1526314005	7	Against my better judgment, I FOMOed into SONM, has been working out rather well
0	1526314408	8	gonna get some more iota while its still slept on 
0	1526315135	8	I am going to role-play as an important, socially well-connected whale in the crypto world by eating lunch in 5 minutes
0	1526315603	8	Wow somebody just pumped the fuck out of TRAC in one candle.
1	1526316252	2	I think it was just a idex-glitch, there were no market-buys inbetween 0.00047 and 0.00065 also right after back 47
0	1526285713	23	When TRAC trumps NEO in saving my portfolio. Bless.
1	1526289061	9	These OT gains are surreal! Sitting comfy in this sea of red this time around.
2	1526289457	7	Been in OT for a few months and I support it a lot. However these gains are most certainly not surreal in terms of crypto?
3	1526289839	4	Honestly, these gains are on the low-end in terms of other Cryptos in similar situations. 
3	1526296996	2	I bought in right around ICO price. For me, I’m really content with these gains. I’m sure TRAC will shoot even higher though, so maybe surreal wasn’t the correct word choice.
2	1526289787	3	Actually that happy with the team and gains. Still plenty of good news to come and maybe with BTC recover, it'll push TRAC higher.
0	1526278956	7	What made NULS pump so hard overnight?
1	1526279153	7	Main net releasing soon plus's it's hugely undervalued for a platform enterprise coin. It's above its ATH now
1	1526281658	4	God I’m so glad I got into NULS last month
0	1526306545	7	ZCash on Gemini 👍
0	1526306846	7	Gawd do i wish i had some Zcash right about now
0	1526307192	7	9k pls pls pls
0	1526309185	6	Alright Alright Party People, here we go. Consensus under way and it's like a Who's Who speaking and sharing. What is everyone most looking forward to? 
1	1526309389	21	gains
0	1526311230	6	Going to write a program/crawler to find out the most talked about coins in daily threads.What should I track? thinking:>Username, coin symbol/name/nickname, Karma of post, any other coins named in postAnything else I should track? Looking for suggestions for metrics and comparisons(IE: Posts/market cap).
1	1526311344	2	Maybe keywords - pump, dump, moon, lambo, solid, etc.
1	1526312238	2	Tip: Use the [PushShift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api) to make your life easier. You can search, aggregate, and sort your results based on whatever criteria you want, and get the bonus of getting a ton of historical information as well. Much easier than rolling your own crawler.
2	1526314188	2	Oh dang that might make this project significantly easier than I thought. Might not even need to crawl. 
0	1526311823	9	Who is this old white woman and can I adopt her as my grandma?
0	1526309003	21	Congrats to all weak hands who successfully sold the bottom... 
0	1526281759	12	What do you think about Ark or Time new bank? Maybe some FOMO is coming?
1	1526282221	8	Dunno what time new bank is but if Ark's marketing efforts in consensus works (and so far it has), there may be fomo.
0	1526306555	14	organic growth
0	1526311299	13	So double the market cap this week? 
0	1526278391	30	Tomorrow starts my second crypto-vacation guys ! Vacation paid with crypto gains. Niiice. Direction : Koufonissi Greece. Almost paradise. Eating fish , girl and sea. That's what i'm going to do the next 10 days. 
1	1526279165	17	That's a key comma, between fish and girl!
2	1526280653	4	lol, that was unwanted. But very likely true. eheh
3	1526282133	4	Enjoy the holiday, Greece is lovely!
4	1526283086	3	Thank you, I will !
1	1526283789	9	What is that word, gains, you speak of? Never heard of it.
2	1526284228	2	Ahah. I made gains especially 3-4 months ago. + 280%. Then struggle to lock them for the last months.  
1	1526290273	9	While you're eating the sea, try to take out of a few of them whales, please.
2	1526301453	3	Not so many whales in the Aegean sea. But if i spot one, i will grill him on the barbecue, under an olive tree, spliffing a joint...
1	1526286112	4	please don't eat the sea
1	1526288571	3	Hey, Greek here! Don't know how you found out about Koufonisia because they are not well-known even in Greece, but excellent choice man, one of the most unspoiled and beautiful Greek islands. :)
2	1526301284	2	Hi there. I'm Italian but a big fan of Greece. I used to go when i was little bug with parents in Skyros. My mother's sister married a greek man so we passed lots of vacations on that island. But first time in Koufonissi. I spent a couple of days googling about unspoiled , low tourism, nice waters greek island. I came out with three islands: Simi, Limnos and Koufonissi, Once i saw Koufonissi on google earth and saw the colour of that sea, i made the choice !  Poly Kalo !ómorfi..

0	1526292196	13	Bytecoin, just leaaaave
1	1526298563	1	Someone's got to be left holding the whales' bags.
0	1526311165	13	From 2K people in 2017 to 8.5K people attending consensus in 2018. They will need to rent the whole of Manhattan next year. 
0	1526283281	6	Yesterday I saw a post with the gains during and after consensus but I can't find it anymore. Anyone has a link? Thanks
1	1526284791	4	The Pump was 1 week after the consensus 
1	1526284923	2	No but the link showed that there was a massive pump BEFORE the consensus followed by a an equal dump, but basically all of 2016/2017 was bull so it did nothing
0	1526306490	6	WTF is happening the market jumped 10 bil in like 5 minutes. That...that...what? How?
1	1526306600	3	Not 5 minutes. Under a minute lol.

1	1526315337	2	Same here. I bought none, which is the worst amount to have. 
0	1526315383	6	SUCCESS!!! My ENG is finally at half my investment from when I "rebalanced" my portolio . A good time to be alive boys. 
1	1526316832	2	Enigma is a beast. Slow and organic growth

0	1526290354	21	ARK go you good thing! All aboard the green train 
1	1526299102	3	Ark is up almost 100% from my initial buy. I think I bought at about 1.98 USD. This is great 
0	1526309092	20	So we gonna sit here and act like BTC didn't just go up $400 in 10 minutes?Bull run starts right now boys. You ready?
1	1526309525	13	hard to get excited about a minor climb when we came down from 10k just a few days agowake me up when we cross 11.8 :P

0	1526285716	22	TRAC is on track
1	1526288116	8	Have been holding a huge stack since January, glad to see it finally starting to move. Hopefully it keeps going this time... every other time, we've been met with some kind of a catastrophic market crash every time it looks like it might finally break out. Come on TRAC! You can do it!
2	1526290362	9	well, TRAC gained more than 50 ranks up in a few days so people have definitely started to notice it...
3	1526294710	5	When the FOMO kicks in, TRAC will hopefully pull a NANO/VEN, maybe the trigger would be a top 100 rank?
0	1526313495	15	ay, consensus whale fucks, go logon to Binance mobile while there and fucking pump some shit. Thanks
0	1526313359	10	My relative told me she had to send money overseas today. I suggested bitcoin to her and she had a question mark on her face.  She ended up going to Western Union. I wondered when we will see actually implement the most obvious use case for digital currency.  
1	1526313578	7	when Bitcoin is as easy to use as Western Union and grandma doesn't have to fuck around with wallets and private keys
1	1526313608	6	When it's easier to convert fiat money to crypto. It was literally much easier and faster for her to send money via western union then bitcoin
1	1526313978	5	The truth is that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are still too complex to use and this is hindering mass adoptionTherefore people will still use Western Union and these obsolete alternatives, until crypto becomes more user friendly we won't see real adoption
1	1526315132	4	If I wanted to send 10k to somebody across the country ..how are they going to get their fiat  ?
0	1526279966	5	What time does consensus start. ?

1	1526304670	1	How'd they spell it? Perhaps it was the English spelling 
2	1526304796	5	"Decrentalized"

0	1526306834	6	My favourite thing about watching presentations is watching the speaker and not the actual presentation /s
0	1526307062	5	Should I buy $1,000 worth of ETH now at $730 or wait? It takes about 7 days for it to go in. 
1	1526307325	3	I don't know the future, but personally, if I had to wait to buy in now or wait, I would buy in now. I think we're gonna see some higher prices a week from now, but that's just my gut feeling.
1	1526307481	2	If you buy ETH via coinbase, you will get the ETH at the price you hit submit. If you transfer into your wallet, then you will get ETH after the ach transfer posts.

0	1526302115	11	Fenbushi just partnered with NEO Global Capital to expand their ecosystem!https://ethereumworldnews.com/neo-neo-global-capital-partners-with-fenbushi-capital-to-expand-the-neo-ecosystem/Fenbushi (for those that don't know) is the VC arm of Wanxiang Blockchain Lab and Wanxiang Group. Wanxiang famously pledged 30 billion USD over 7 years in 2016 to invest in China's smart cities. Fenbushi's highest profile investment was probably into Circle's 65 million  Series D round. 
0	1526283951	9	KIN has finally gotten some legs. Not sure if it will last. It went from #86 to # 70 in the last 24 hours or so. 
1	1526285353	4	Isn't the circulating supply wrong? And the market cap is almost double what's shown on CMC? So in reality it's already inside top 50.
1	1526290563	2	Solely based off consensus. I’d sell at a comfortable point and rebuy when it drops. 
1	1526292317	1	It’s due to move up a little bit given that they have panelists at consensus and had yet to recover whatsoever from the major correction in January. 
0	1526317017	8	Looking at the charts, REQ is truly rektAlso someone poke that poor OmiseGO
0	1526299862	4	What else can i invest in if i don’t have loads of money? There are: Stocks, Cryptocurrencies, what else?
1	1526300051	29	Yourself:* join a gym if you haven't and try to go at least every other day  * learn a language   * read   I guess to actually answer your question, investing with small amounts of money is quite hard cos the brokerage fees to buy and sell can really eat away at your capital. You could start pumping savings into a high-interest and then once you have a more sizeable amount, put that into a bunch of ETFs to buy and forget. Honestly all comes down to factors such as your age, goals and risk tolerance. I would not recommend Forex at all if you're an unsophisticated investor (not having a go at you, it's an actual term).

2	1526300427	3	Thank you for this great comment:)
3	1526300559	3	You're welcome mate. Best of luck. Now it's time to return to shilling my portfolio. 
2	1526300568	3	i agree. trying to learn a new language is actually one of the most beneficial things ive done in my spare time besides looking at my portfolio blow up.
3	1526300862	3	100% So thankful I learned some basic Spanish & French. Good luck going to South America or Europe and trying to hit on the pretty girls there without a basic grasp of their languages.

4	1526302436	2	Learn Chinese so you stick up deals with NEO in their native tongue and become the ultra rich.
1	1526301670	10	Frozen concentrated orange juice futures 
1	1526299977	5	Education.
1	1526300452	5	Real estate / Gold / Silver / Own Business
1	1526301533	3	Most people who have built fortunes are in real estate. Buy old apartments in large cities, fix them up and sell
2	1526303061	3	That takes a lot of money.
1	1526302840	3	Over\-leveraged Sugar Futures
1	1526300869	2	Options. These are contracts that give you the right to buy or sell a share at certain price. So if the share price falls and you have a Put option (sell) you could sell the contract to someone for a profit since they'd obviously want to sell at a higher price than the stock is currently worthOptions come in bundles of 100. So an option contract for Facebook might cost $2, the minimum spend would be $200. You can make or lose a lot of money very fast. Since if your Option is the right to sell at say $10, but the share price is $11 - your option is worthless
0	1526305887	4	pump pump pump!
0	1526305944	4	Oh fuck volume is starting to spike........

0	1526306215	4	Consensus Bulls in town!
0	1526307766	4	Is there a calendar for token swaps / mainnet launches so you don't miss it and are stuck with worthless ERC-20 tokens instead of a chain's native coin?
0	1526307801	4	*He thinks he's gonna make it***He is, let him in**
0	1526310156	4	My portfolio is 40% ETH and around 10% each of FUN/Stellar/Icon/Tron/REQ/QSP.. have the feeling eth has biggest potential atm but on the other hand i have no ideaIm thinking of going ETH 100% for now.. what u guys advise!? Keep all current coins or go full ETH
1	1526310474	3	keep it diversified
1	1526310515	2	Is icon a good hold during consensus? Are they going to do anything?
1	1526310291	6	Never go full ETHard.
1	1526311592	2	Stellar has a booth at consensus and consistently performs. I’d hold it. Can’t comment on the others except to say maybe consider selling your tron…
0	1526311978	5	Is there a place to find info and keep up to date about Consensus news?
1	1526312493	3	Twitter
0	1526316163	3	So the advice for people starting out with crypto currencies is to do your own research. What are the best places to look for information? Should I just google what I’m looking for? Are there websites that are generally trustworthy?  How do I start doing my own research?
1	1526316255	10	step 1: be very skeptical of anything you read, anywhere, from anyone.
2	1526316328	5	Step 2: buy my shitcoin.
2	1526316375	1	step 2: read blog posts about coins in particular niches (e.g. privacy coins, supply chain coins, etc.), keeping step #1 in mind. This is a good way to learn about projects beyond just scrolling down coinmarketcap. Then you can read those coins' websites/whitepapers, keeping in mind that even those are highly biased and not necessarily 100% accurate. The motto for crypto is "Don't trust, verify" !
1	1526317525	3	Coinmarketcap.com has the website for all its coins.  A good coin will have a white paper which describes what the coin does and what the plan is for the futures.  Id start researching these first:Low Risk: BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, NEO, EOSMid Risk: IOTA, VEN, XRM, NEM, GASHigh Risk:  NCASH, BAX, ENG, GVT, NEBL, PRL
0	1526300619	19	So ICON, that just partnered with Samsung, and plans to connect South Korea and the world, and has the resources and technical know how and connections to do so, is down.On the other hand, bytecoin, which is a scam by all definitions, is up 50% and has ten times the volume of icon. Ladies and gentlemen, crypto is dead. Long live crypto
1	1526301525	6	Yes, shit like this sucks, but think of it from a positive perspective and continue to accumulate long term projects with strong fundamentals that are severely undervalued because once mainstream adoption arrives...things will NEVER be the same..
1	1526301310	4	where is that samsung partnership? Link? 
1	1526301130	2	it's extremely retarted isn't it? (Triggered)
1	1526300884	2	Thats the nature of this game. Always have been this way lol
1	1526301280	3	if this is new info for you then you have a lot to learn about crypto 
2	1526302102	2	no, i'm not new. just an observation
0	1526300507	7	ENG just broke 33k for the first time since the Jan / Feb crash!  Is it finally on its way back up to 50k+? I hope so.  I filled a bunch of bags at 18k, and am loving this!
1	1526302753	3	Bought 1000 coins at 23k sats :) Hopefully it can break 40k soon
1	1526300780	2	ENG is one of my most stable and trusted coins. I'm definetely for sure filling more bags as soon as my freaking BTC arrives lol
0	1526307121	7	We fueled and ready bois 🚀
0	1526310312	10	LTC is alive
1	1526311011	3	Gemini listing
0	1526306941	5	dumped my omg AT EXACTLY the wrong time
1	1526307028	6	OMG is a coin you buy, store and forget about. This is one of the coins in the top 100 that has the chance to take you to "lambo land". Never sell it again
2	1526307099	3	This. OMG is boring to trade. Buy the dips and accumulate and just forget about it because when it moons it will rain lambos upon us all. 
0	1526308000	6	Enigma :O
1	1526308059	4	This pump is insane! 
0	1526309061	5	Choo choo, motherfuckers.

1	1526302373	4	It is before 9am
0	1526303133	3	Watching consensusNewYork got rid of their bitcoin license yet?Seems a bit rich saying they know how to innovate when they already chased away the crypto companies 
0	1526305704	3	Do all americans pronounce ecosystem like this dude? Edit: Like "Echo-system" 
1	1526305800	4	i say it like 'ecosystem'
1	1526305906	4	Nope, I hear ee-ko more often.
2	1526305968	1	It's tilting me lol
1	1526305904	3	Nope. That's weird.
1	1526314877	2	Hell no. Just seeing you type it out is making me violent.
0	1526306006	3	BTC liftoff
0	1526306223	3	We have liftoff 
0	1526306224	3	well i hope that fucking korean whale wakes up to BTC @ 10k
0	1526306269	3	AHAHAHAHAHAHA!
0	1526306337	3	What is happening?
0	1526306364	3	Fam we good ? Fuck yeah we good 
0	1526306529	3	Can we please see the goddamn slides of the presentation, Coindesk?
0	1526307927	3	The Feds guy sounds reasonable.. feels weird...
0	1526309390	3	What is the dumbest play you could imagine someone making with 1 thousand dollars? Outside of buying ETC, garlicoin, or jesus coin I'm drawing a blank. 
1	1526309487	14	buying anything that's already +40% on the 24h 
1	1526309472	6	hey hey heyy
1	1526309488	10	Putting it in a bank
2	1526309829	5	WINNER
1	1526310727	3	COD, or Savings Acct. You lose money to inflation. I would rather put the money in mutual funds if I was super conservative with my money.
1	1526309563	4	Putting it all in a currency coin that isnt BTC.There is a real possibility that all these 'fast transaction' coins are not needed. As someone that actually spends cryptocurrency(almost all BTC), I only used 3 onchain transactions in 3 years of use. The rest of my dozens of transactions were through coinbase or circlepay or shiftcard. At least diversify. 
2	1526311709	4	Maybe I’m just traumatized after holding tons of BTC through the Gox collapse and tons of NANO through the bitgrail collapse, but I would never hold my coins on Coinbase or any other exchange for long. I dodged all those events unscathed because I controlled my own private keys. 
0	1526311684	3	"you're not an investor" is the new "when moon"
0	1526314720	3	No more punching myself in the balls, moving up to whispering self loathing mutterings for entertainment. 
1	1526316510	3	It's really better if you combine them though.
0	1526278433	12	Woke up with a feeling like I have been raped... Then I checked my portfolio.
1	1526281536	6	You should be more focused on finding the pesky rapist
2	1526281940	13	You know you're addicted to crypto when the first thing you do after being raped is check your portfolio. At least that's how I knew
3	1526282229	4	Maybe we should get someone to write a CA "Crypto Anonymous" 12 step program for some of us..
4	1526286324	2	There is a power greater than yourself, what I tell myself when I need some help
0	1526293261	5	Crab market at his best
0	1526298457	5	I just received this thought I'd share.. BTC update 14th mayCrypto Buy Signals / moments agoBTC now trading at 8400. Is there another bearflag forming? It looks like it! Well you know what that could mean, another drop in price. Consensus is about to start, this could mean we will see extra buyers. The thing is... this is meanly about altcoins not really about bitcoin... Be sure that you don't lose money on bitcoin (stop loss) while alts will be rising. Keep your eyes on your favorite coins, and by favorite we mean the ones you believe in and get a lot of attention at consensus.Support @8200  and then @8000Resistance @8500 
1	1526301151	1	the bearflag is more prominent on ETH. But still bearflags don't always break down.advice is wait for confirmation on either side and then act fast. 
0	1526312619	6	Pretty impressed with Catherine Wood on this panel at Consensus. Tying together automation, blockchain, and energy storage for utilities is where we are headed. 
0	1526303459	6	I’ve decided that during the next bull run I’m going to liquidate my holdings other than REQ and BNTY. Suggestions for what to put that money into?Currently no top 10 coins so considering XRP in the chance that it sees some adoption over the next year. 
1	1526303583	5	Literally my exact same thought's...My plan was XRP also but if anyone else has any better ideas then please share. 
2	1526304561	3	XRP holder here, but wondering why you plan on going with XRP over the other top 10?
3	1526305135	5	I already hold quite a bit of XRP so just planning on consolidating the rest of my bags into it as I feel as it's not as volatile as others ( of course they all are ) but my XRP bags cause me the least stress as I know it's not going to crash massively and when it pumps .. it pumps. Great coin and already adapted into everyday life a lot quicker than others. Good or bad idea?!
4	1526305424	3	good idea you have my vote. i used to have a very diversified portfolio (over-diversified actually) so i consolidated much of it into XRP. its my happiest holding 
4	1526305407	2	I'm with you on that. It's had so much positive news recently and we see a lot of ongoing testing. I'm just hoping and waiting for that official "we are USING xrapid" from one big FI or bank. Hopefully, Ripple are just waiting for the right time to announce this  (maybe a higher crypto market cap). Fingers crossed anyway...
1	1526304958	2	Why would you liquidate everything besides REQ and BNTY? They both have performed terribly even by the standards of the dips
0	1526309422	6	Sports betting online  just got ruled legal in US within the hour. Is this related to BTC spike do you think?
1	1526309555	5	Definitely not
1	1526309572	5	no imo
1	1526309749	4	Wait, so WA residents can now use stuff like Draft Kings now?
1	1526309667	3	Not even a little bit. 
1	1526311550	2	If anything, it would decrease crypto adoption because they can use fiat now that it's legal.
0	1526311648	5	Hey ho let’s go! Really positive about funfair (FUN)Not a shill so DYOR but the sun and I’m in a good mood
1	1526311694	4	Can't wait for the platform to come out so I can actually use my FUN tokens.  
1	1526314912	3	Fun was my first purchases when I jumped into Crypto. At this point, I’m not expecting much, but will never sell due to sentimental value. But I wouldn’t mind if it takes off 
1	1526313149	2	I'll shill FUN! Everybody should get on it as soon as possible, as soon as that platforms out we balling.
0	1526277824	5	What is the dumbest coin/token out there. 
1	1526278176	23	Dentacoin
2	1526279719	5	This, I laugh everytime I hear about this coin and its usage.
1	1526286417	3	I like Fuck Token, because I like to give a Fuck
1	1526278449	9	Bcash
1	1526278763	6	BTC. Somehow people think it's still a currency when fees can skyrocket over night. 
1	1526278267	3	whatever you think is about to take off

0	1526295504	4	So what caused the crash last night?

"now:" is the price at the time of this post. The widget is the price at the time you are reading it. Keep a close eye on these coins the coming days and weeks!

1	1526303309	3	Was it ever a thing that they were competing? I thought it was conveyed from the beginning they complement each other
2	1526303629	3	You just have to visit the Ontology sub.
0	1526307061	3	Happy New Year guyssss
0	1526307864	3	Pls have the TKY consensus deliver good news while BTC pumps everything up at the same time crypto gods, I might have a chance of actually breaking even 
0	1526310212	4	Should’ve bought zcash at 9:30am when I got that email from Gemini. You never hear shit about zcash here. 
1	1526310528	3	It was the last thing I expected to see today.
1	1526311177	2	same here, I checked the charts, it wasn't doing anything and thought wow, no one cares...
0	1526312916	4	Looks like we're about to start running. 
0	1526314763	2	Guys I have about 5 ether. Shall I stay in Ether or buy an ALT ? Shill me an ALT if yes. Already have Engima and VEN
1	1526315001	6	I would just keep ETH
1	1526314813	7	more VEN before mainnet 
2	1526314883	1	Right now a good entry point ? Or wait for it to correct a lil bit ?
3	1526315197	5	It was at 5.50 just last week. This is the dip
4	1526315223	1	Convinced. 
2	1526315080	2	Can you explain just a bit on what mainnet means and what everyone thinks it means for the price before & after? Or point me in the direction I can read up on it?

1	1526316202	2	Aphelion man, it’s been slowly climbing the past 3 days they have the best nep-5 wallet I have ever used with a mobile wallet in the next few weeks then a Dex exchange that works straight from the wallet. it’s a new token only out 3ish weeks. It’s currently 56c with a supply of 38mil it will easily hit the $2-3 in the short term. Then who knows how high it will go. 
1	1526315475	2	Buy ELA if you have an account on huobi. Near price it debuted at. Less than 6mil circulating. Partnered with SAIC motors (Chinas GM)
0	1526315413	3	Is it actually possible to buy piedpipercoin from the show silicon valley? or are the only coins in circulation the ones from the airdrop? 
1	1526316071	4	i'll sell some to you
0	1526310917	6	NEO at 765k Sats is so ridiculously stupid low, I might have to sell my house and downsize so I can double my stack.
1	1526311172	5	get GAS instead for "short" term then switch into NEO
1	1526311053	4	lol sure
0	1526302306	4	OriginTrail is up 53% in the past week. 
1	1526302621	2	Please keep going. I'm so close to being back in the green again!
0	1526306395	3	To all the newcomers in this space that got excited these past 2 weeks and got burned on the weekend dump:Look at the BTC volume to see if we are in an actual breakout or a fakeout. The price steadily rising on such low volume is just a tell tale sign that we were about to dump quick. Until new money comes in and sentiment starts to drift towards euphoria and greed, we will experience lots of red dildos. It just takes one. Keep a good watch on the volume. Without high volume, everyone is just out ponzi’ing one another. Sit tight and don’t FOMO. It’s 50% psychological. It will go up in due time. It always does. ...Until it dumps to a higher support and the cycle starts anew. 
1	1526306897	2	People are going to downvote you for your (appropriate use of) logic.I was saying the same thing last week about volume and price action and people had a negative reaction to it. 
0	1526294725	2	Hey guys, what are some of the best sites to check RSI for trading? I mostly use GDAX and Binance
1	1526294935	5	TradingView
1	1526294875	3	Tradingview.com/chart, or tradingview select the tradingpair and click 'interactive chart'Could be you need to make an account (takes 1minute, and they don't ever send anything to you email) 
0	1526296571	2	Yes, i.exec right there. Don't stop. Go go go. 
1	1526297427	2	i know absolutely nothing about the coin but that is the most shitcoin-y name a coin can have
2	1526298360	2	You're not wrong my friend.That's what happens when you let the PhD nerds name the project instead of hiring a competent marketing team. Thankfully they're targeting the B2B space so the name shouldn't matter too much...
2	1526298281	1	Agreed

0	1526296964	2	Damn, what happened to GVT and NAV. Both almost out of the top 200
1	1526298618	2	Buy more GVT
2	1526298956	2	I'm fine with the amount i invested. But not a bad idea
0	1526302370	2	Watching consensus now but does anyone know how long it will go on for? 
1	1526302746	7	3 days
0	1526302989	2	Eng doing well. Rumour of test net release tomorrow at consensus.
0	1526303178	2	What is the future for Ripple? I've heard some people making fun of it and saying it's not a "real cryptocurrency". Does it have some potential or will it go down or stagnate eventually?
1	1526303270	11	If we could predict the future we'd all be millionares by now
1	1526313901	2	It is actually a finished product and is being tested by big companies.Which puts XRP ahead of 99.99999% of the coins out there.
1	1526303483	2	I'm holding some, but the longer I have it, the less I see any future in it (pricewise). I'm planning to sell it for something else as soon as I break even on it.
2	1526303895	4	if you haven't broken even yet that means you really haven't been holding long at all. not judging...but id suggest holding longer than a year and then make a decision on long-term price 
1	1526303645	2	Long term hold, price won't change all too much over time, but I do believe it has a lot of room to grow. 1\-2$\+?

1	1526311439	2	What are the advantages of zcash listing ?
2	1526311630	5	More liquidity and fiat pairing. Gemini is a major exchange and it will cause short term pump. 
2	1526313010	2	A privacy coin on a regulated exchange. Yes please.
0	1526311737	2	Glad I picked up some SONM yesterday!

0	1526284015	2	Hi, I sent 0.4 of an etherium from kucoin to gateio 12 hours ago. Nothing's come through, on kucoin it says successful but when checking the transaction hash on etherscamner it says it can't be found. I've checked the address and it's 100% correct! What do I do now? Thanks 
1	1526284794	9	Just open chat support. Give them those 4 details given on help page. Will be resolved in 1 hour.
1	1526284588	5	Just wait and dont panic, it sucks but it can take up to a couple of days... thank kucoin for that.
1	1526284166	10	you needed to send ethereum, not etherium
2	1526285073	6	Haha Yeah, I spelt it wrong so many times it auto corrects to the I now!!
0	1526304632	2	How many times does Tom Lee have to be wrong about Consensus? CNBC is full of shit.
1	1526305486	4	Who? 
0	1526312575	2	Should I HODL ZIL or sell it? 
1	1526315814	2	You should skim the profits you made at a minimum and pur the profits elsewhere like Icon for example.
1	1526313025	3	Time to sell it and ZRX imo.  Buy back lower, they've pumped like crazy (ZIL up 30% last 7d) and should correct.
2	1526313452	2	yea I have ZIL correcting around to 1500 SATs...laddered my buys around there..50% Fib
0	1526314865	1	No talk on Enigma except 1 comment? Anyone have any thoughts on current price action? Seems like calm before a run if BTC keeps its act together.

1	1526278542	2	Stability requires trust.
2	1526278597	1	[deleted]
3	1526280293	2	The main advantage is that you can leverage distributed trust networks to ensure the same sort of fidelity that a financial institution can offer. I won’t speak to if blockchain is or isn’t more efficient than a traditional centralized database, but you’d have to make a pretty convincing argument for a centralized company like Visa to throw away their expensive infastructure to build a blockchain solution that they may or may not even need. Why would Visa or any other institution switch to blockchain when it’s not necessary?
3	1526279010	1	Visa is a US company, they would have to jump through a ton of regulatory hoops, and what incentive would they have to do it? 
1	1526278920	2	Tether is centrailzed though. And pretty much anything else that is tied to another asset.

0	1526298039	1	Anyone know of a Portuguese accountant that **understands crypto**? Preferably Lisbon based and English speaking, but not necessarily.I want to hire someone. So contact details will be needed. PM or replies are greatly appreciated. 
1	1526298197	2	Português do Brasil aki mas consigo responder alguma coisa
2	1526298802	2	Eu preciso um comptable aquim porque eu volo vender.Eu moro no Portugal depois una semana. I actually need the contact of someone here to cash out some (hefty) amount of crypto.

2	1526301448	2	Glad my username gets me points, but I dunno, *I just typed `import antigravity.`*
1	1526301867	1	im not accountant but im portuguese, there's no tax for crypto but there are some restrictions to withdraw to bank accounts, anything beyond 10k monthtly your account gets flagged by the portuguese bank and you might have the account frozen until proven where the money came from. But like i said theres no tax for crypto. 
0	1526298209	1	Stream not working for anyone else?
0	1526299028	1	I think BTC needs some help to pump. Yo, Mr.Greenspan where you at. Need some pumping for BTC for a ten year+ bull run.Anyone who doesn't get the reference to Greenspan - Go watch the movie Inside Job. It will really open your eyes.
1	1526299088	1	its altcoin season lol check the consensus listings!
2	1526299557	2	Yeah I agreeBut Mr.Greenspan's a legend in pumping. The way they gamed everyone, we can use some of that here. Game the whales to tighten their bags and PAMP eet
0	1526302164	1	Anyone watching consensus on mobile? When the initial add shows I can turn the video resolution down but once stream goes live the settings button is gone. I want to use as little data as possible, any ideas?
