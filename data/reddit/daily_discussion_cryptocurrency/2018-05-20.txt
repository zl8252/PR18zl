0	1526815815	46	I always check this thread before I check my portfolio in the morning. It's like when you were a kid watching a scary movie and you peak through your fingers to see if the scary part is over yet.. 
1	1526820508	6	Hahahaha I know what you mean - If people are like tether up or why so red, I hesitate before looking. How bad we talking? 
1	1526822290	3	And that face you make during those moments of suspense in a scary movie when you just know something's about to make you jump...that's how I look as I open my portfolio and wait for it to load
1	1526831809	1	Peek
0	1526806037	23	When my portfolio goes green on the 24hr chart it feels a bit like when a football team are 3-0 down and get a goal back. There's a glimmer of hope 
1	1526811729	1	🤣🤣🤣🤣

0	1526832664	11	Sunday.Dip.Oh wait 
1	1526834637	3	Whales knew thats what we expected so they threw us for a loop. Gotta expect the unexpected
0	1526837300	13	Just went on Kucoin and the news section said LALA world (LALA) just got listed. I don’t care if its the decentralized cure for fucking cancer that’s the stupidest fucking name ever and I wouldn’t buy it. Then the next news item was Black Hole Coin is also available. What the fuck is up with these names. Weve reached peak shitcoin. Edit: though since January I’ve felt like all my fiat has gone into black hole coin.....
1	1526837560	4	Go into the 'biggest losers' section of any market list. These names are quite low on the shitometer compared to what you can find there.
2	1526837697	4	LALA world is pretty bad. The decentralized wife (ex?) of Carmelo Anthony? 
3	1526838574	1	Should be called HNC
1	1526837516	3	Saw Black Hole token there today as well. lmAao
0	1526826002	31	Lead singer of the band Avenged Sevenfold performed wearing a VeChain shirt last night hahahttps://instagram.com/p/Bi_wkc3Abo7/
1	1526826208	9	Is that real lol
2	1526826310	10	That’s what I’m trying to figure it out. But it’s legit posted on his current Instagram so I’d have to assume so 🤷🏻‍♂️
3	1526826348	14	Kinda bizarre but fucking awesome at the same time 
1	1526843445	1	The simulation is leaking
0	1526810986	19	Come on rat poison, you can do it!
0	1526837530	9	Moon now? 
0	1526838202	9	Can't wait for STORM to pump so I can get out ! 
0	1526799655	24	This is the calm before the storm 🌪️
1	1526804397	25	Calm before the calm.
1	1526805659	6	You can see from the people replying to you that reddit is getting desperate, must be the bottom
1	1526801481	12	Lets see in which direction this storm takes us.
1	1526802439	3	Before the storm fucks us again. 
2	1526813002	2	whenever there is a storm THERE Is sunshine, after this dip we will have the moon
0	1526817140	6	Just started a minor [website reviewing business](https://twitter.com/NetReports) on twitter and accept crypto donations. Paypal's fees are awful. I'll review websites for free if anyone is interested.
1	1526820030	1	Review what? Design? Code? Content?
2	1526820391	2	Haha, it's supposed to be a system where people send me websites and I review the website design/content. I'm in a tight spot this month :/
3	1526821023	6	Good luck
0	1526799431	18	Just saw a middle-aged Thai woman sitting in McDs with her laptop going through the verification process for the local crypto exchange here (we ain't in Bangkok either; it's a big town/small city close to the border of Laos).Adoption.EDIT: And the funny thing, she was being talked through the verification process by a dude in his 60s (I assume her dad).
1	1526799809	3	Nong khai? Nice... enjoy the food
2	1526800018	3	More south.
3	1526831125	1	Chang Mai obvi
1	1526801609	6	So someone around the age of 40 is middle aged now? Fuck, I'm close :(
2	1526801791	17	Average life expectancy around 80, 40 is middle aged :D
2	1526810166	5	was it not that way before?
2	1526819591	1	A couple months away myself. Over the hill bro
2	1526837652	1	Lol when has 40 not been Middle Aged?
1	1526799590	1	How do you know it's not a ladyboy?
2	1526799929	14	Trust me. Been here long enough.
3	1526800155	2	I was just joking..Although I will say that I find it interesting they a third gender? From what I read. And some of the pictures I really can't tell. But that's good to see some people buying it in Thailand. Although I wouldn't consider it adoption since it's using it at an exchange. My hope is to not have to cash out to fiat and be able to spend anywhere. THat would be ideal version of adoption.
4	1526801506	5	In Chang mai, there is a cafe called catmosphere, they accept crypto as a payment, would like to go there next month and have my first crypto payment
5	1526813128	1	wow this is nice. do they accept altcoins too?
5	1526830689	1	Do you pay in cats? For other cats? Like a cat exchange of sorts? 
4	1526800365	4	True that.
0	1526843551	6	Am i hallucinating or is neo going up?
1	1526843808	6	ONT also goes up. THere is sone NEO airdrop soon it seems that might fuel this 
2	1526844442	3	which one?
3	1526845515	2	https://np.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/8jxn9p/epiphany_airdrop_has_started/ but did not find so much more info...
0	1526819457	11	Can someone explain why the alt coin are not moving that much? I really don't like this silence market. It gives me the feeling that I look to my pizza in the oven and it looks all nice but when I open the door of the oven this pizza is all facking burned on al sides 
1	1526821259	11	We are at critical points for BTC and ETH. People are hesitant to trade since it is unclear what direction we are going in.
0	1526832932	11	Stable and single digit gains and losses, we're the stock market now boys. 
1	1526833594	10	My worst nightmare...
2	1526835134	4	Wait until a new coin is realised to coinbase, you can forget the stable and single digit 
0	1526836093	11	Pied piper coin, easy 100x
1	1526836176	3	Why not x99
2	1526836223	3	Because x100 is more gavin

4	1526848572	1	It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users. I will extend those so they're easier for our sausage fingers to click![Here is link number 1](http://siliconvalleyism.com/characters/gavin-small.jpg) - Previous text "hmm"----^Please ^PM ^/u/eganwall ^with ^issues ^or ^feedback! ^| ^[Delete](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=FatFingerHelperBot&subject=delete&message=delete%20dzarx38)
1	1526847483	1	Easy 100 teslas 
0	1526837199	10	Whales are pumping! Get in while you still can!
1	1526841074	3	Or get in tomorrow when they dump it again.
1	1526837385	6	People don't care.
2	1526837740	4	They are all on a camping trip and will probably FOMO in tomorrow
3	1526839274	2	In Germany we have a day off tomorrow, please buy something for me as well :) 
2	1526841034	3	We just got fake pumped too often in the last time.. :(
0	1526807446	15	I'm trying really hard to not buy anything, so it doesn't drop further. Essentially I'm holding the volume steady at the moment. Thank me later guys.
1	1526809121	6	First time in months i bought in and instantly had gained value. Every time it's lost even a couple % within minutes. This might mean something ;)
2	1526818751	3	yes it is the time we gain in this market
1	1526816565	1	better to buy now than be sorry later/
0	1526833928	16	Top 10 coins pumping the most: tron, EOS, and bcash. The more reddit hates a coin the more it pumps
1	1526834748	16	Hate NEO some more pls
1	1526834580	3	More accurately, this sub hates popular coins that it thinks doesn't deserve its rank due to not having a mainnet or being a concept with a high marketcap.While this is nice and all for those who care about the technology, it's annoying to us who just want to make money.
2	1526838160	3	Or they hate because they missed the boat and it's easier to hate than to admit they missed it.
2	1526834894	3	Pretty sure conservatively 90% of people here are for the money and they are salty because they didn’t invest in these coins cuz everyone says they are bad so they get mad when they pump
2	1526834761	4	Like anyone on this sub actually is in it for the technology.
1	1526834666	1	Meanwhile Decred is silently mooning.
1	1526835097	1	Short-termism 
0	1526832334	14	I'm ready for the next bull run
1	1526832674	1	Its here
2	1526832937	1	I believe the big dip from January has finally curved to a stable point where we start to curve up again - we may even spike quite a bit where investors buy a lot
0	1526826854	5	Has mt gox Civil Rehabilitation yet?
0	1526832456	8	Dicks out 
1	1526833055	6	“This guy fucks”
2	1526834844	1	Am I right? 
1	1526832662	4	For harambe
0	1526801676	12	I'm bored lol
0	1526823879	24	 VEN officially has a white paper 
1	1526824121	8	A white novel... 114 pages!
1	1526824793	8	Buuu buu buttt ..... damn there goes my FUD for Ven 
1	1526828002	-7	Wow, just wow. Where do I sign up for my investment? This is groundbreaking!!!!
2	1526828346	-1	Some weak FUD dude, you can do better 
3	1526830130	-7	So can ven. Sorry, but billions valuation for a project with a white paper as of today. No thanks 
4	1526838478	2	Do some research. You'll come around to see that that's a fair price in this speculative market. Or don't, your loss.
4	1526831219	-2	Lol your helpless
0	1526835007	21	What is the #1 Shitcoin in the top 10?  Id say Tron
1	1526835158	18	though fight between BCH, EOS and TRX
2	1526835706	1	Really interesting fight :)
2	1526835774	-6	Explain EOS is a shitcoin please. I see it thrown around a lot but very few people explain why instead of just parroting
3	1526836621	14	From the faq section of EOS’ website:“The EOS Tokens do not have any rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features, express or implied, including, without limitation, any uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features on the EOS Platform.”Read the faq/whitepaper for further insights as to why people make this claim 
4	1526837152	1	In every token there is this....
5	1526837722	2	Yes the wording sounds like lawyer-talk to avoid liability and whatnot. But again, there are further insights in the faq alone (the question directly above the one that I quoted, for example) as to why people call it a shitcoin. And no, every whitepaper that I have read (and trusted) has explicitly stated the function/utility of the token
5	1526838405	0	For coins which we'd define as shitcoins, yes. Generally that goes for tokens with no utility on the platform they represent. For example, eth has utility on the Ethereum network, wheras the EOS token is merely an ERC20 smart contract powered by eth on the Ethereum network  which is totally separate from and does not have utility on the EOS network. Similar to how people speculate on the value of Ripple's commercial products using their non-essential token, XRP. Correct me if I'm wrong!
4	1526838052	0	They are erc20 tokens being swapped for main net tokens upon release in less than two weeks. Binance has even said they'll swap them for you if you keep it on the exchange. That statement is just legalese to keep them out of trouble.
5	1526838218	4	Do you have any sources for this token swap? Here’s another quote from EOS’ faq:“block.one is building the EOS.IO Software but it will not configure and/or launch any public blockchain platform adopting the open source EOS.IO Software (the “EOS Platform”). “
3	1526836215	0	centralised, huge scammy ico, pedo on the team
1	1526835108	2	Define shitcoin.
0	1526831503	35	So, let me get this straight. When Vechain had no whitepaper: "WHERE'S MUH WHITEPAPER?!?!?!? SCAAAAM!". Same people after Vechain releases their 100+ page whitepaer: "WHO CARES!!! The fact that people are excited about a whitepaper probably means it's a SCAM!!!!".Can't wait to see what FUD is used next. Hopefully they get a bit more creative this time.
1	1526833572	13	Those dipshits will FOMO in around $10 VEN
2	1526838811	4	That will be 10 cent VEN now. 
3	1526841021	2	10 cent VET*  At mainnet launch, 1 VEN --> 100 VET.The reason for this is to eliminate the need to deal with fractions of a VEN. Instead of using 0.45 VEN, it would be 45 VET
0	1526831425	12	It s just me and the  Vechain boys in here. Gotta take a break. 
0	1526835063	11	"ven moon!", "Ven shit!", "Ven lambooo", "ven scaaaam"...I love teenager's fights 😂 
1	1526841310	2	You're not helping.
0	1526815839	4	Has anyone ever spent money on crypto guides, bots, trading signals? Was it worth it? 
1	1526816500	5	from what i find online bots are more of an assistive tool rather than set it up and leave it to make profit kind of thing. There are strategies that earn ~1% daily but it can all go to shit if market is manipulated and irrational
0	1526843627	3	any coin pumping today
0	1526844852	4	Hi everyone, since I speak both Korean and English fluently, I am wondering whether there are developers here who I could be useful to for a small fee. Please hit me up :\)
1	1526845570	2	Can you read and write in Korean? I speak Mandarin fluently but can't read or write :( that's my problem .Make sure to note that if you can. Because reading your post it sounds like you can only speak it. Good luck in your search. Maybe hit up ICON icx subreddit. It's the only Korean coin I know of...Which is weird now that I think of it. No other Korean companies want to jump in on making a coin?
1	1526847358	1	Hey, nice nickname
0	1526807243	7	So I guess the bears are letting us live today with that volume. We'll see what happens at 1pm pst. 
1	1526810310	6	What happens at 1?
2	1526816969	9	Yogi bear strikes the picnic baskets.
2	1526817636	1	Mcafee scheduled to eat his own dick
1	1526816044	1	Picnic basket time
0	1526825190	9	So what about xrb on bitgrail? Will my money be back?
1	1526830257	3	I think the devs answered that when they said they wouldn't fork for a 3^rd party's fuckup. 
0	1526831470	11	Fam we good ?
1	1526832643	11	We good. 
2	1526832650	10	My man
1	1526832497	7	Yeah we good
2	1526832647	6	Always good Fam
0	1526805059	11	June is going to be a big month in crypto:Will EOS and Vechain deliver on their respective mainnet?People spending especially crypto during the summer months should hopefully get the market swinging upward 
1	1526807070	11	And along with that when breaking even a lot will cash out and run for their lives after seeing red for so long (in their eyes).
2	1526807136	2	What projects do u think they’ll run to if things don’t break right?
3	1526807463	4	If they don't break even I'm sure people either stay put out of fear or jump to whoever creates the biggest candle ;)
2	1526813679	1	Some will...but FOMO is hell of a drug.
1	1526806879	2	True, eagerly waiting to see if those two will stand up to their promises.
2	1526806913	2	If they don’t the market will suffer 
2	1526813684	1	I think this june will be the biggest month to be wait and watch because of the event of Eos and how this market perform if it will recover from its former glory
1	1526811360	1	I know and swinging upward should really help nowadays
2	1526811769	2	I say the middle of June the market will shoot up
0	1526835620	10	everything is pumping, not just your fave shitcoin. Stop shilling when tomorrow youll be whining like a school girl over a 2% dip. its embarrassing. 
0	1526799062	5	Quiet is ok. It won't be this way forever. Take advantage of the opportunity to spend more on your favourite projects while they're not doubling every month.
0	1526844771	6	I don’t even get excited for run ups anymore. I expect to just come back down anyway
0	1526832695	9	BTC is going up but it looks like finally this time people are waiting to see if the whales just dump it again before buying into altcoins (not the whales).  Fool me 200 times, shame on you.  Fool me 201, shame on me.
0	1526835446	9	XLM so cheap $ 
1	1526839991	1	Bought in expecting some movement at consensus .. whoops
0	1526823874	5	When volume dries up this dramatically, it's just a reminder of how much of all crypto trading is done by bots rather than humans.
1	1526830448	4	Same with the stock market. HFT has been a thing since before at least half of this sub was born. >Aldridge and Krawciw, 2017 [12] estimate that in 2016 HFT on average initiated 10–40% of trading volume in equities, and 10–15% of volume in foreign exchange and commodities.
0	1526836171	5	Great projects that should take off if/when they get added to a big exchange:EVE TRAC ELEC BPT DATA GETThoughts?
1	1526840637	3	Nice picks, hold some BPT and excited for the open beta to go live soon. Also been looking into EVE, TRAC and ELIX. 
2	1526843315	1	I like ELIX, team is legit and always delivers.  Always seems undervalued considering how high market cap LEND got to once.
3	1526845953	1	yes, elix is pretty solid, i actually took the time to read the entire whitepaper a few days ago and its pretty insane with the possible potential considering its marketcap is tiny.    if we do ever go on a crazy run in the next year i have no doubts this thing 30-50x
1	1526836381	4	I like your first 3, will check out the others.  Look into Holochain (HOT) and Zebi (ZCO), both are winners with huge upside.
2	1526836730	3	Will do, thanks. As a starter for ten, BPT aims to be a more user friendly version of coinbase, supporting more coins and is currently in beta. DATA aims to setup data marketplaces for consumers and recently became partners with Nokia. GET are taking on Ticketmaster to offer a fairer way of getting gig tickets for the consumer using Blockchain, which stops touts buying up 100s at a time. They've already sold gig tickets using this system.
0	1526807057	4	ZZzzzz hey market wake up!
0	1526810416	3	Guys.... low volume... we should be soo worried... Oh wait!
0	1526813486	4	When Maserati???
1	1526813600	3	*When wheelbarrow with new car scent air freshener
1	1526815830	4	When chevette 
1	1526813658	1	First Lancia
1	1526816714	1	Dacia Sandro maybe? 
1	1526817126	1	When Segway?
1	1526818137	1	I've always said that if I had the sort of money to buy any car I wanted, I would go for a Maserati.
0	1526836133	4	Alts season upon us ?
1	1526837156	2	fly alts fly
0	1526809475	5	I want to feel excited again like last year! Can't wait for another bullrun! 
1	1526817365	5	Cocaine or better yet crack. You’ll be amped immediately. 
1	1526809743	2	Another one bites the dust. 
1	1526835115	1	Nah son we're in a 5 year bear market
0	1526813945	11	Ven white paper incoming 
1	1526815701	5	buy the rumour, sell the paper
1	1526817101	-1	You don’t think this is already priced in?  
0	1526816248	12	VeChain white paper pump starting. 
1	1526817299	19	Wait...They never had a white paper? 
2	1526818325	6	They did but then expanded their operation to add smart contacts and decentralized apps. So they started over and created a new one.
2	1526817745	2	Well, DNV GL never asked whitepaper either when they discussed about partnership. 
2	1526820552	2	They had technical document which was better than some other projects whitepaper.
0	1526832321	2	Has anyone learnt technical analysis for crypto and is it worth it?  
1	1526834298	9	Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. As simple as that. 
1	1526834072	6	it's usefull, not like looking in a crystal bowl.It presents cases for downside and upside, and you determine which is more likely with risk management.Or you present both cases and wait for confirmation of either case. This is the more safe one and in the beginning more profitable, because you will have less risk if applied correctly. Now you do leave some gains on the table, but that's a trade-off you'll have to take. 
1	1526833748	6	I’m like 5-6 months into crypto and I recently became familiar with it. There’s no harm in learning TA as long as you don’t take it too seriously. 
1	1526833461	4	To some extent TA is most definitely better to know when trading then looking at the charts completely guessing. Not knowing trends and what trend is more likely to happen.
0	1526837023	2	Is it normal for volume to exceed market cap? Check out KORE on CMC

1	1526841230	1	It's only $50? Might be worth a try.
0	1526840352	2	I love it when shills discuss with skeptics.

2	1526846238	5	nano?
3	1526847517	2	Seems you want to buy something? Are you looking for day or swing trading or long term holding?
4	1526848278	2	long term
3	1526847168	1	Absolutely not. Don't buy high cap coins that already surged like hell. Not enough upside.
0	1526823566	5	Volume dropping like a stone now. Buckle up!
1	1526828403	2	You're right!Weekends have become repetitive like this. Friday things start to pick up -> weekend things slowly climb and optimism grows -> Monday things start to fall -> Tues/Wed/Thurs is all choppity-chop-chop and everyone is mopy + depressed -> Friday things start to pick up...The cycle is amusing at this point.
0	1526830948	10	Is this VEN subreddit?
1	1526831028	8	Considering that this is a slow, bearish Sunday with no news other than the whitepaper, yes.
1	1526831189	6	Nano
1	1526831930	-1	The shilling is strong yes. **As is the downvoting. Seriously get a life.**
2	1526834498	2	Inam a VEN holder and it is indeed ridiculous with the shilling and downvotes
0	1526820824	4	When people think a “big” couple bucks airdrop worth about 0.1% of the coin is gonna magically pump the price 10% because people don’t want to miss out on this crazy awesome deal is just so cringe worthy 
1	1526820929	2	don't quite get what you mean. are you saying airdrop chase is worthless?
2	1526822408	5	There are airdrops and airdrops... look at ONT airdrop from NEO council to all the NEO holders. I was given 26 ONT first and another 26 ONT when mainet is released. I sold them for NEO when ONT was $9. Thats a free $240 first  and another waiting for me when mainet comes.Was Kinda suprise airdrop, in fact I think the only Airdrops that are worth it are the surprise ones.I am not bothering chasing cents or $2 worth of X Airdrop for filling a KYC to some random ICO. Time is worth more than that.
3	1526822697	4	It's all a matter of opinion and how much time you have. You do sacrifice a lot of personal data for airdrops but we have been forfeiting our personal lives to various companies and governments for years now. Some aren't worth much but even $8.00 of AELF can get turned into under half a BNB which for me is more than enough for free fees. Then when you do hit the jackpot with something like HYDRO you are laughing. 
2	1526821194	1	Yes. Because they mostly are worthless. 
3	1526821857	5	i mean there was HYDRO airdrop. check its 30 day graph
3	1526821486	2	Free money is never worthless. 
3	1526827401	1	Then some are worth $1000's.  What is your motivation for hating on airdrops? Just don't do them if you don't like free money.

0	1526823895	6	Get your Buuu Buuu Buut Vechain doesnt even have Whitepaper jokes out, today is probably your last day for that irrelevant FUD on Ven. Edit: well your jokes only had a couple minute window its been dropped. Sorry for all those whose only Ven fud was the whitepaper. 
1	1526824316	-14	Ven is a company worth 2 billions without having a working product and you're celebrating a published whitepaper?This is the reason why we're in a bubble, it's the dotcom bubble on steroidsinb4 downvoted by economic illiterate lambo boys
2	1526829661	8	Vechain as a company has a working product (a private blockchain solution), and isn't valued at 2 billion. We don't know what their valuation is.The VechainThor public decentralized network hasn't been released yet, and the tokens which will power the network have a total combined value of 2 billion
2	1526824413	11	"Without a working product" is the funniest thing I've heard all day long 
3	1526824540	-10	Oh yeah Ven is really changing the business world with the application of it's revolutionary blockchain that hasn't even launched yet lmao
4	1526824907	12	There are dozens of projects already running lol 
4	1526824739	8	Do you know what is even happening when the mainnet goes live? It literally has a working product but its private, at mainnet it will become a public platform 
4	1526825724	8	VECHAIN is responsible for the first successful blockchain project in China, tracking the complete life of D.I.G Wines from the vine to the bottle 
2	1526824475	15	Vechain has a working product, which is why the whole whitepaper comment was a joke. Do you honestly think these companies like DNV GL and PwC would own stakes in a company if it didnt have a working product. Wake up man
2	1526825146	2	Too many benzos taken in your days I assume...
3	1526825295	2	>ad hominem attack because you can’t refute an argumentYeah I’m sure your pathetic 200$ invested in Vechain will make you rich 
4	1526825601	-2	Lol yeah you're spot on target. I invested less than I earned per day and now I'm crying to this benzo head on Reddit about it all. Idiot.
5	1526825931	-2	>I invested less than I earned per dayThrowing your Subway salary into shitcoins isn't "investing" you dense retard. You might as well buy a lottery ticket, it will give you a higher chance to get out of your poverty
6	1526826416	6	You are mean, internet man
6	1526826380	3	Lol Subway salary that's very creative of you. I know it doesn't matter what I say or write to someone like you. You prefer to shout, take benzos and be a complete idiot. You have no idea about who I am, what I earn or how much I own in VEN nor anything else and there's no point continuing a conversation with a loud benzo head.

1	1526841569	5	Incoming Vegeta meme!Although, I honestly wouldn't be surprised to see a it go sideways or dump just because I have no more expectations anymore. 
2	1526844350	5	I'm not gonna celebrate fucking $8500. I bet we need a massive "correction" now because of our insane gains this Sunday. Fuck it.
3	1526844433	1	Small celebrations!I mean, what price of BTC are you going to celebrate at? 10,000? That could be a couple weeks away...who knows?
4	1526845306	2	I'm like 1/4th in BTC now, so a cause for celebration would be it not dumping for a month. I'm not gonna make my money on BTC anyway.
3	1526845623	1	dude, i mean , if you only knew how crazy excited people were when btc hit 100$, then 200 then 300$ . 
4	1526845819	2	If I was only in BTC since November and took a six month break, I'd find myself in the exact same spot. People were excited about hitting 20k as well, I was there, that's $11500 ago. There is no cause for celebration here.
5	1526847418	1	Good to see people are feeling despair. Reality is setting in. 
0	1526838321	3	Ethereum's only use so far aside from launching scammy ICO's, is Cryptokitties, Ether Shrimp Farm, Ether Cartel, and Pepe Farm AMAZING how wasted this network potential is
1	1526838546	8	This Zilliqa coin you bought is ERC20.
2	1526841954	1	80% of tokens are ERC20
3	1526842415	1	When talking tokens, I think the number is actually a lot higher.
2	1526839152	0	Only for as long as it has to beIt wasn't by choice, they were forced to upon threat of butt raping
3	1526839732	3	Sure, but that goes for a fair share of ERC20's (save for the games you mentioned). Isn't PO.ET ERC20 too?  Seems like the network is doing just fine as a springboard for a lot of decent projects.
4	1526847994	1	Yes, but Ethereum should just be more than an ICO platform don't you think? I mean, what's the point otherwise? Why is it worth $718 
5	1526848381	1	For all I care it's an ICO platform. I dont like the goldrush shovel analogy but it's really fitting here. It serves more purposes but I would even be fine with it if it were nothing more than a glorified project incubator to help projects off to their own chains.
1	1526841489	2	Enlighten me, what other things could use the network's potential? Oh yeah, there is almost nothing that could right now. At least the games will stress test the network, which is a good thing. Don't tell me you are mad because you missed the shrimp train. 
2	1526847924	1	>Enlighten me, what other things could use the network's potential?that's kind of my point really....what is the real use case for Ethereum? I don't know. Smart contracts is always being touted, but smart contracts in Solidity that have a tendancy to bork? 
1	1526845184	3	What about ETH being the platform for REQ which you've been shilling a lot lately? 
2	1526847839	1	I don't shill REQ, I made 1 commentICO platform for all ERC20's mentioned, but aside from that and the Cryptokitties shite, what is the use case? Really? Be honest
3	1526848162	1	So you're saying powering a whole generation of Crypto Coins like REQ, VEN, EOS which are all doing their own thing and being able to host whatever dapps mankind can think of ( even cryptokitties ) all while also acting as a value transfer system is not enough ? What else do you want it to do?
4	1526848396	1	I'm talking about the Ethereum platform, nothing else. It should be more than just a launchpad for other projects, don't you think?
1	1526844054	-2	Eth is a dead end project.
0	1526808702	2	That's we need right now, 2-3 years sideway action and then ramp up again :)
1	1526811169	10	What we need are solid pumps ;) I guess it won’t go sideways for a long time, this year crypto will be tradeable at stock markets, in September Btc,eth,ltc and xrp are tradeable at the stock markets in Germany, furthermore those coins + a few more will hit nasdaq. That will be the time when crypto gets big, for the moment we all here, even the stupid lambo fanboys, are still early investors. My guess is btc at 40k-50k EOY and a few altcoins will rise more than 10x the price right now. Hopefully I got the right ones :> 
1	1526808946	8	Actually that could be a high probability scenario after last years' volatility. Big guys made enough money so they can afford to wait until 99% of amateurs sell their coins. 
0	1526832143	4	Lets talk about Tron ! 
1	1526832254	7	Tron sucks
2	1526832272	20	Money doesn't
1	1526833504	-6	No thank you. But we can discuss Elastos if you want.
1	1526832300	-6	Some ppl just ask for downvotes. But atleast we will talk about something other than VEN!
0	1526811103	2	What is up with that tweet from Vitalik about going to Google? False rumor? Why would he say that on twitter
1	1526811689	11	Sarcasm
2	1526816676	3	What did he have to gain by deleting it then? Other than to look shady.
3	1526817327	2	The email address was visible if I recall correctly.
3	1526820961	2	Not having to explain to every retard on the internet what sarcasm is? idk 
3	1526820026	1	It's a bit strange nevertheless
2	1526819931	2	Lol. We should all know that our sarcasm detectors aren't so keen when it comes to reading text
0	1526821142	2	I'm sure this will come off as a do my research request but to explain myself here; I'm happy with my spread and I'm investing within my means so don't want to do any day trading.That being said what projects are people excited about when they've been reading up on their cryptos (not from a moon point of view but interesting in utility)?Power ledger kinda sticks out for me, as does request network  (if it beats the comp) and enjin coin since I'm a big video game nerd.Interested to hear what projects people are into outside of making capital gains 
1	1526832056	2	TheKey has an interesting IDV solution that uses data from multiple sources to do a multi-level verification of identity. It has potential if the accuracy turns out to be excellent. Because they are using government big data, it can become undeniable national identity verification. Big implications.
2	1526832756	1	Omg Wow that's awesome ! I work in finance and I appreciate why aml atf Id and v needs to be done but it's incredibly time consuming. This sounds like a game changerEdit: sense
1	1526821249	3	Chainlink, I think crypto oracle services will change the entire way a lot of smartcontract cryptos can and will be used
2	1526821478	2	Ah cool I must say my starting point months ago was reviewing the most talked about projects (so open to shills haha) and Link was a very respectable sounding project - I went through their website and it looked like they know their onions, although I'd be lying if I said I fully appreciated the usefulness of smart contracts 
3	1526821625	3	https://i.imgur.com/j2GDuBP.jpgHere is the best explanation I’ve seen of it, it really shows the full potential of a proper oracle
2	1526826930	2	Chain link is a meme coin constantly shilled on /Biz/ 
3	1526829077	2	Please explain how it is a meme? And VeCahin is currently shilled here all the time, does that make it a bad coin?
1	1526834292	1	Elastos. New blockchain powered OS that eliminates DDOS attacks, Man in The Middle attacks, and viruses. Will compete with EOS currently criminally undervalued. 7 exchange listings in the near future currently only avail on huobi and BCEX. By the way Jihan Wu and Bitmain are investors and so is Da Hongfei the founder of NEO. They are in talks with the US Representative of Silicon Valley to create a Cryptocurrency Committe in the House of Representatives, along with Coinbase. Bitmain is part owner of Circle who bought Poloniex, possible Poloniex listing in the cards? I think so. Try to not knock over your drink while you FOMO.

3	1526848012	2	Nah! MSR went to $ 2 from 16 cents in a matter of 2 months. It's back at nearly 50 cents now. It was probably ASIC PnD. But now it's been 20 days since ASICs were booted out of the network. I think now we are ready to moon.

2	1526813238	1	why is google / amazon / ebay needed when u have... o wait
3	1526814483	1	What are you implying, that they do not have competitors? Because they do.
1	1526812877	3	TKY is providing the IDV to ONT. Besides that, there's room for more than one project. There isn't going to be one ID project or one supply chain project, there will be many.
1	1526817184	4	Are you serious? Coke and Pepsi, Burger King and McDonalds, CVS and Walgreens etc etc etcYou do realize there are products and companies that will compete/share the same markets.  There isn’t literally one business servicing every niche out there. 
2	1526818417	1	yeah and we can all see how competing with platform giants like amazon, facebook and google works out.
1	1526831075	2	Do we need you? while there are 6.99999999 billion people out there? what is the need for yet another human like you? are you unique in some way? then yes. we need varieties.

1	1526846828	3	Basing your investment decisions on reddit shill posts isn't the brightest idea. My suggestion is to do your own research on the project and only then will you be able to determine if it's worth investing in or not.
1	1526848566	1	VEN doesn't need your 100 dollar investment.

0	1526799395	1	I constantly try to tell my peers buy it now while it's cheap and hardly fluctuating because the last thing you want is waiting for your paycheck during a bull run. Yet nobody understands This! They all say "it just went down" or "I'll invest when it goes up again". But they fail to realize bitcoin was 2 grand a year ago. Yes it went x10 and then -60% but at the end of the day you'd still be up 4x your money if you hodled. I'm going to really hate saying I told them so one day... 
1	1526801816	3	Buy what exactly?
2	1526809320	2	"I'll invest when it goes up again."Condoms probably. 
3	1526811737	3	Better to buy now while the price is low,and wait/hodl until the moon comes
0	1526802438	-2	I think EOS is going to begin to pick up momentum again. June 2nd is mainnet launch followed by 4 Big Airdrops throughout June.
1	1526803002	1	True, and as other coins start getting back into green EOS will start too.

3	1526829609	2	It's arguably one of the top projects in the currency sector. Dont think you can really deny that.
3	1526835335	1	Feeless and instant and it works right now. That's the hype. Have someone send you a penny or two of nano and it'll blow your mind.
1	1526808194	4	Incorrect, it was 6000, recent low was 10% higher.

1	1526812838	4	The LRC ones. https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-upcoming-loopring-airdrops-1ea257ba7c7b
0	1526819642	1	1 month volume low reached... crap... that doesn’t bode good things!
1	1526820277	2	Yep tether up and open a short everyone /s
2	1526821297	0	been short for a week
3	1526822527	7	I'd take the money. Last time things got boring, bitcoin gained 1200$ in a matter of minutes. Also coincided with a record number of shorts cause everyone and his dog thought that low volume = big drop upcoming. I fear the same thing is happening now
4	1526839570	1	32k longs, 20k shorts. I'd say most people think it's going up
0	1526803468	1	What are some alternatives to Polymath?  Anyone sceptical on the recent hype around security tokens taking off in 2018?
1	1526809427	4	I used to be excited about them as well (and I'm still by the very idea of a token actually representing a share of a company and not just people shaking off all responsibilities). Until I got to see the specific terms about polymath.Security tokens within the polymath network will be only available to accredited investors undergoing strict KYC.They will not be able to be used  within Thirdparty-Wallets, noir will they be able to be listed on any of your known exchanges or directly traded without a middleman (most likely).The only way to buy/sell them will be within the official Polymath wallet (probably without a free sending/recieving function) and their own exchange that offers only transfers to the polymath wallet.That means it will also most likely all be closed source.As in their own enclosed ecosystem that is nothing else then the current stock market. Nothing I'd say is feasible or warranted with the technical possibilities this technology brings.TLDR: Companies as well as investors are all under control of one entity. To less money? Uh to bad can't participate. We don't like you? You will get no access. We don't like your political views? Go fuck off.Nothing I'd ever support, despite all that shit this unregulated market brings. At least here small startups and you and me alike can participate and aren't put in golden handcuffs on a playground of the rich.
2	1526811078	2	They keep talking about all the trillions of dollars entering the market for securities but i don't see how that will help crypto. The money will be flowing only into those securities because if anyone actually wants to invest in crypto, he is probably already doing it. Will gladly invest if anyone can change my view
2	1526814972	1	> Security tokens within the polymath network will be only available to accredited investors undergoing strict KYC.> > newbie question, but I'm struggling to square this with the idea of being able to immediately trade their POLY token on CMC?

0	1526822571	1	Could anyone explain how BTC futures (settled in cash) could be used to control volatility in BTC price?  Do you think the volume is large enough to do that?  I'm wondering if futures would suppress 10-20% jumps in price in a day, for example.  I'd think there are just too few BTC around in too few hands to make any attempt at price suppression work.
1	1526823759	4	I think by definition futures trading suppress prices, because it provides an opportunity to bet on negative movement. The amount of negative bets is definitely a signal that market traders act on. I think this is all probably pretty good if you end goal is a reasonable and less volatile price, where it can actually be used for something. If your goal is ridiculous sweeping boom and bust cycles this is not so good for you.
1	1526822945	3	Lol at the last sentence, the price has been suppressed actively imo since futures came into play, i know i dont want to sound paranoid but think about it, it could very well be the case.Make of it what you want, i just think this is not a coincidence.
2	1526823789	2	Not sure why downvoted.  I was looking at the CME futures, I don't get why July futures highs would be at 8850 currently, are there other charts signalling August/Sept contract prices?  I'm bullish, think futures could limit volatility making BTC more appealing to big money.  I just don't understand how low futures cash volume could limit this month's trading spread.

0	1526844693	0	$100,000.00 to invest in Cryptos; which Cryptos would YOU buy..NOW, today ?? It's a hypothetical question of course but I'm interested in what currencies YOU would invest in. Would you buy only in "established" coins like BTC...ETH...LTC or diversify in Altcoins also?
1	1526844847	9	70% of it would go into OMG no question about it. 
1	1526845526	3	Personally, I'd go mainly into alts but regardless of how I would categorise particular projects I would suggest 60% whatever you consider bluechips, 30% medium risk/rewards, and 10% moonshots.
1	1526845703	2	All in on NULS
2	1526847216	2	this guy gambles
1	1526845700	2	ETH/BTC is always safe. Imo I feel more safe with ETH. Outside of those two, I like NEO/VEN. Those will net you GAS/THOR for just owning those two. GAS/THOR will be super valuable in the future.
1	1526847417	2	All in my wallet.
1	1526844921	3	Imo the more money you have the less risk you need to take. if I had 100k, I’d put 75 into BTC, 20 into ETH and 5 into high risk projects(NEO, ICX, ENJ being my picks)
1	1526845441	1	Depends on risk. If you wanted to risk more alt coins are good. If you want to limit risk more can't go wrong with btc
1	1526845207	0	Ven, ETH, btc, tracThat's two blue chips,  a nice well rounded risk with ven, and a semi moonshot with trac
0	1526842016	-3	Whats wrong with Ven?! 
1	1526842261	3	Look at any daily thread or even front page posts about Vechain. Sort comments by controversial if your'e going to look at the front page posts.There, I taught you how to DYOR. The rest is up to you to evaluate and decide for yourself if you want to buy or not. 
2	1526842381	1	Yea dude why is tron mooning on ven whitepaper day, should i sell?!

0	1526811113	-3	Tron might be finally starting its mainnet price surge.  
0	1526804783	0	any good airdrop coming soon?
0	1526826555	-4	I haven't dived into the details of the whitepaper by Vechain yet but initial impressions is that they plan on making Thor very cheap. It makes sense for the ecosystem but it sucks for node holders. I think for a Strength X node you'll be looking at $40-50 of Thor income a month.So all those people who bought enough for a node hoping you'd be able to benefit from a Neo/Gas situation, you gotta look elsewhere. 
1	1526831226	7	Thor price is going to be kept stable and low, that's what they have always said. But my question is how the f are you coming up with that $40-50? Did they ever announce the generation rate? or just pulling numbers off your ass
1	1526826683	-9	And private investors got like 90% discount, and they will get more discounts in the future. There is no need for your thor. rip

0	1526841434	-12	Liberalism- Help find a cure
1	1526844959	2	A cure for what? Not being afraid of your own shadow? Wanting to help people less fortunate than yourself? Understanding there's more to life than a whiny "me me me" battlecry? I get that minorities, foreigners, women and poor people must be frightening to people with such fragile egos and weak spirits, but you can't possibly think that being a liberal is anything aside from having a differing viewpoint. Oh that's right, conservatives by nature dismiss any viewpoint aside from their own without an iota of consideration, because knowing you're right without ever questioning any logic or facts is the mark of the truth-seeker.

0	1526826814	-29	Beware of bots today. Also ppl who are stoked on VENs whitepaper- youre making VEN look shady by reminding us all VEN didn't have a wp until now.
1	1526826909	29	Eh. I'm pretty critical of vechain but given how in depth this white paper is, I can understand why it took them a while to release it. It's not your typical 5 page paper full of the usual crypto platitudes about decentralization. This is more like an indepth financial report. 
0	1526800976	-4	Whats wrong with Ven?!

Oh and by the way all other chains Dapps can be ported to work as a sidechain of Elastos which allows Dapps to run on the device itself rather than on the blockchain.
