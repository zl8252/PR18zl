0	1526913106	36	So glad I don't check on prices as much as I used to. I just have a casual 5k floating around in the cryptosphere being abused, punched and molested. I will get back a dirty, disease ridden 1k whore.Spoken by a happy January investor.
1	1526917212	7	My man! Bought mostly at ATH and the most I've seen recently is 50&#37; of my total investment. At this point I've written it off, so when I get my 10&#37; back, it'll be a nice surprise!Went from checking hundreds of times a day to never to, currently, a couple times a week.
1	1526913193	1	Lololol
1	1526916575	1	I giggled.

1	1526917134	2	We can't time the perfect entrance for alts but we can give them time.
2	1526918021	3	this sub will be empty in 2 months.  teens thought they'd get lambos buying shitcoins
3	1526918253	1	And we might be dead in 2 months. CC not and especially Blockchain not. Who cares about this sub
0	1526900578	25	Are there any actual humans left trading?

1	1526905048	6	My CPU is a neural-net processor. A learning computer. 
2	1526910410	1	The more contact I have with shitcoins, the more I learn.
1	1526904283	3	I'm a cybernetic organism. Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
2	1526913227	1	But do you still have a vagina I can stick my dick into?
1	1526904610	4	What's up my glip glop!?
0	1526928236	23	Smile, look at the 1 year chart. Some good shit is going to happen.
1	1526929470	7	Thank you. Spread the positive energy.
0	1526917782	16	Even low volume in the daily thread. Interesting.

1	1526931242	6	REQKT 
2	1526931297	9	Every single day my man.
1	1526933523	1	yeah, kind of disappointing given they had quite a bit of good news lately
0	1526913217	37	This 2018 bull run is so exciting
1	1526914835	2	Don't worry, we have Consensus upcoming!!!  The market will surely be bullish after that!!!
2	1526923531	1	Chinese Consensus Year just as soon as Wallstreet pays their taxes institutional investors will flood the market with chucky cheese bucks and we will get a glorious day of 5% gains followed by a 20% drop.
0	1526926008	12	Are most people here just very inpatient or are they traders? 
1	1526926988	8	A lot of people were here for December when you could get 50%+ in a couple of days. So what's happening now feels very slow in comparison. 
1	1526926174	8	They're retarded.
1	1526926610	5	not impatient, just bored.
1	1526926354	5	Just impatient, everyone is staring at the charts wondering why they aren’t rich yet. 
1	1526929559	4	We're all just bored of the same patterns. Big highs mean progress, big downs mean a chance to buy in cheap. My portfolio has just barted up and down the same amount for like two weeks now.
1	1526926199	9	Most people here are teenagers who are investing their allowances or extra money from their part-time jobs. 
2	1526926488	12	YOU COULDN'T EVEN PASS LAW SCHOOL

1	1526928701	10	That can only mean that bcash is a shitcoin
2	1526931000	2	And taxation is theft
3	1526932371	1	Not entirely. People should be able to choose where their tax money flows into though.
1	1526928853	4	Yes, yes it is

0	1526894398	12	What are everyone’s thoughts about the up coming DEXs? I like being able to trade and not having to put my coins on an exchange where they could get hacked.
1	1526897456	6	Aph looks interesting. Sub-20m mcap, approx 36m circ supply (max ever is approx 76m) and redistribution of trading fees to holders relative to number of tokens held. Dex coming first week of July and still sub-50c price
2	1526906171	3	Yeah I’m very excited about this. The mobile wallet is under two weeks away. 
3	1526908570	1	And the desktop wallet is already fantastic (with Ledger integration).
1	1526894602	5	DEX is great concept. My fav right now is DDEX.io. I love the fact that I can trade directly from my Ledger Nano.
1	1526933970	1	I like to shill Airswap
0	1526888200	24	I got burned on a scam coin yesterday. Lost 80% in literal seconds. I was thinking of posting PSA post just to give helpful advice to people based on this experienceYou think thats a good idea? I also want to expose scamming devs because they are planning on making a new coin and I don't want any more people to get scammed by them
1	1526888744	10	> You think thats a good idea?yes, someone can learn from your loss. 
2	1526916917	3	~~Dude how could you fall for something like that?~~He fell for REE: it pump +600% after a tweet claimed the project would be pulled out of its grave with new 'developers'. that's it. you use TA to not fomo in in this case. He scammed himself. 1.  Fundamental Analysis:*  Abandoned project, which get picked up again? *  What are they trying to do? *  Why couldn't they just start a new project?2.  Technical Analysis:*  Zero volume*  Sudden spike in volume, price spiking 600%. doesn't last and goes back down, before getting abandoned. *  tweet that says it gets revitalized? price pumps again 600%.~~I mean, how can you fall for this?~~
1	1526889250	5	yes bro. I'll be brave to say that I had my learning experiences, and I am sure a lot of ppl here faced the same thing.
1	1526888431	3	Yes. Sorry to hear you got scammed 
1	1526904521	1	That sucks man, and yes post the details so others can learn and avoid it.
1	1526912752	1	what is the ticker?
2	1526914334	1	REE, mind you I took a risk so there is my fault too but risk didn't account for new Devs to say fuck you to the community
3	1526916724	1	Dude how could you fall for something like that? Fundamental Analysis:*  Abandoned project, which get picked up again? *  What are they trying to do? *  Why couldn't they just start a new project?Technical Analysis:*  Zero volume*  Sudden spike in volume, price spiking 600%. doesn't last and goes back down, before getting abandoned. *  tweet that says it gets revitalized? price pumps again 600%.I mean, how can you fall for this? 
4	1526917357	1	As I said, that project was very high risk, I invested only the money I could lose. I gambled on irrational hype when new Devs announced on revivalWhat I consider scamming though is the lies told by the new team. I am not complaining that coin with red flags you listed fails
5	1526917439	1	Ok that's fair, just wanted to be harsh so maybe it would sink in to your core and never make that mistake again. 
6	1526917511	2	I appreciate that, and yes, lessons learnt
4	1526917371	1	As I said, that project was very high risk, I invested only the money I could lose. I gambled on irrational hype when new Devs announced on revivalWhat I consider scamming though is the lies told by the new team. I am not complaining that coin with red flags you listed fails
0	1526915254	11	Nothing has ever been quite as therapeutic for my ego as crypto has been.
1	1526916143	6	Until we start mooning, that is lol. All my friends thought they were hot shit in December lmao
2	1526924224	1	me_irl
0	1526922121	35	This sub still whiny as fuck 😂 
1	1526923651	6	I don't blame them. They came in thinking they'd be rich in no time! (I too was once like that).  Now I know there's money to be made no matter the market conditions. Obviously, easier in a big bull but w/e...You've come a long way raw midge. From being  banned for whatever reason, to getting a bunch of upvotes. And verbally sparring with those dudes a week or so back.
2	1526924378	2	I was also like that a year or so ago when I got in. Now it’s just fun. I guess I like to shit post a little too much 😬
3	1526925843	3	You actually enjoy the shit posting you do..? Get a life dude..  
1	1526922523	0	And you're still broke af 😂😂
2	1526922883	5	R u magic? How do you know my finances????
3	1526922910	2	You just hang out in Reddit all day. You can't be doing much
4	1526923841	3	Well maybe hes allday on reddit because hes already rich af and doesnt give a shit anymore..
4	1526925687	1	Using emojis so probably shirking work on mobile like me 😎
4	1526931570	1	You are still in the broke mindset of working for money instead of letting money work for you
5	1526931785	1	Yes
0	1526909627	10	here's where the weak/short sighted people sell and then buy back higher on tuesdayLOLpatience HODLERS
0	1526901769	8	Found a crypto-scam subbreddit full of bot posts:r/HomelendWhat to do?
1	1526910625	2	Don’t invest?
2	1526917578	1	Shit thanks man. Was just about to go all in.Btw, here‘s another one: r/thinkcoin
0	1526926483	13	Sitting here waiting for Prince Justin sun to announce delay in mainnet..
0	1526898455	6	Seems like a slow weekend for crypto, not even a Sunday dump this week Lol.
1	1526899492	3	No dump either thank the crypt-eities that be
0	1526912783	7	What’s happening to altcoins rn???? Icx and Nano way down while BTC is trying to come up a little
1	1526913288	0	NANO is just dead, the sooner people realize it the better it is for them
2	1526919208	3	Dead means no volume anymore. It’s still a developing product. 
2	1526913635	6	This seems slightly hyperbolic.
2	1526917169	1	Can you elaborate?
3	1526929849	1	I think XLM as his title says enough
0	1526925617	8	I don't like mondays.
1	1526926643	5	tell me why you don't like mondays?
0	1526935296	6	I thought I'd never see the day when I just didn't care to check on crypto.  I literally looked at prices once today when I normally would be on here 24/7.  I don't know if that's worse than watching all the sad memes during the crash or not.  It's almost more depressing watching this and telegram chats become ghost towns...
1	1526935419	4	we are in the depression phase on the chartgreat time to be BULLISH AF but of course no one who is retail isagree, don't even care to check pricing right now, not worth my time as I know the pricing is low on most of my tokens here
2	1526935576	1	I just putz around on the telegram because the hardcore people are still there and optimistic.  Just a few weeks ago this chat would have 100 new posts after like 10 minutes.  We haven't even hit 1000 today ha.
3	1526936007	2	You call us hardcore but i feel pathetic
4	1526936602	1	:(
3	1526936188	2	yepaccumulate and shhhhh
4	1526936596	1	I would if I had money.
5	1526936670	1	that's why you DCA inremember that the next time someone says go all in and you outperform!!!not!
6	1526936789	1	I have okay stacks, I just don't have more FIAT to accumulate.
0	1526888469	11	"Poking ICX with a stick" do something
1	1526889133	12	will do something tomorrow, or will be postponed.- ICX holder here, tearing up a bit lol
2	1526889513	4	Very good project but not much price action. I will leave it after the next pump. Too many good opportunities wasted on ICX, and if Samsung and Line partnerships could not move it, nothing will. I guess we won't see ICX reaching ATH anywhere in 2018.
3	1526890257	3	I hear ya.I am moving mine to Binance, just in case mainnet launch happens these few months.
4	1526891780	2	Dumping a few dollars in it here and there while it’s in the 3s... can’t hurt. Just can’t heal either. 
4	1526896148	2	Main net happened back in January 
5	1526909104	1	You sure? They said they had to postpone it because exchanges couldn't figure out the swap.. 
1	1526910852	1	Icx I think is gonna be my never look besides once a year coin. Put it out of my mind and hope in 10 years it still exists and profitable. 
2	1526911221	1	You'd be better off with an index fund then. 
0	1526905359	12	I smell a "ATH" coming soon. Get your bottle of ketchup boyz!!!
0	1526915580	16	Man crypto is a lot less stressful when you just invest in BTC/ETH instead of worrying about the shitcoin of the week.
1	1526915848	4	True
1	1526918230	6	Pretty sure that everyone on here not in BTC/ETH is broke as hell.  Thus all the emotion.
2	1526920216	1	I own zero btc and zero eth. Been all in alts since November. Not even close to broke. 
0	1526885908	21	Have a great week, everybody! Don't get stressed too much :)
0	1526899552	21	Boooooorrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggggggggggg...
1	1526920094	1	Are you feeling it now Mr. Krabs? 
0	1526905735	20	Hi my name is KingollieAnd i am an ICX bagholder
1	1526910430	4	Coffee and cookies over there
1	1526908978	3	Hi Kingollie, welcome
1	1526912953	2	Just keep hodling pal!
1	1526916408	1	HI KINGOLLIE
0	1526890257	10	Nothing better than waking up and seeing that the fake piedpipercoin is actually worth money and selling the airdrop for $600 
1	1526890744	3	who received the airdrop? any ETH wallet?
2	1526891195	4	There was a form on twitter and u had to tweet about piedpipercoin airdrop, I almost didnt participate cause I didnt want to tweetApparently 2000 people entered in the airdrop? 
1	1526894430	3	How do you find out about these airdrops? I have participated in a few, but never received any airdrops. I feel like I am doing something wrong. I created a myetherwallet to receive the airdrops on, but it is still empty...
2	1526902227	1	There are a few places that list them, here is one I keep up to date:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16sbLbTNf2vzFOKaLyeo6l1rys3qOTMD6U2j9TZEKSF4/edit#gid=1137395208
3	1526905323	1	Great, thanks! Not totaly up to date, but still fine. Is it really necessary to have some eth on MEW? Becouse i can't miss any atm.Another thing that would be nice for the form is the information on wether KYC is required.
4	1526908506	1	Well some airdrops just won't pay out if you have an empty wallet, it's to try and stop people entering lots of times. I do try to mention if kyc is needed, I must admit I usually don't list ones that need kyc any more as I feel they can be a big risk.
2	1526909789	1	This one was all over Twitter. 
1	1526894101	2	Tip of my hat. 
1	1526908722	1	Where is it selling? 
2	1526908985	2	A few dexes, might actually go up more when it gets on idex. Its just a completely useless coin though, you gonna buy?
3	1526909553	1	> Its just a completely useless coin thoughIndeed, like most. Plays the part well. 
1	1526909751	1	Wait seriously? 
2	1526910182	2	Yes serious. I ended up selling half for 0.4 eth. Volume is low but still like 200k across exchanges 
3	1526910240	1	🤦🏻‍♂️ and I didn’t bother with the drop since I figured it would be a waste of my time…Any reason you kept the other half?
0	1526922039	11	Is it highly possible that BTC may not even touch 20k again by the end of the year?
1	1526922525	8	Of course it's highly possible, no one knows
1	1526922213	4	Anything is possible
1	1526928639	2	I mean it's *possible* that it never reaches that level again. Anything's possible. I happen to think we'll touch 20k again, but I'm not counting on it happening by the end of the year.
1	1526926225	1	LOL. This sub in a nutshell.
0	1526907213	4	Every one of my alts decided to take a shit last night.  This blows.
0	1526915364	4	Finally back over $200 mil BTC volume on Binance for a change... 
0	1526920575	5	Of course i buy into APH last night right before it dumps hardwow
1	1526920726	1	Everything dumped now....but it looks like APH dumped a lot more than others...-25% in last 24 hours (fiat value).
2	1526921847	2	that happened in the last hour....
3	1526923429	2	Wow....in one hour?? That sucks.
3	1526922105	1	any idea why? Nothing but good news but it did pump quite a bit in the last few weeks. Back to sq 1 I guess
3	1526925127	1	looks like it's come back up quite a bit
3	1526930793	1	woah, blockfolio is saying it's up almost 14% from yesterday now.  I wish I bought more during that big dip, but truthfully at the time I wondered if I made a mistake buying it at all
0	1526920716	4	Damn this is bullshittt... I wanna buy ela so bad !! Im from the us...can't even get on huobi. 
0	1526890139	8	The btc chart for the last hour on binance looks like a single heartbeat. We can confirm it still lives
0	1526914533	12	-92% for BNTY, -75% for NANO, -60% on MOD, Solaris -88% as well and LEND with -83%. Fuck my life. Really hope these coins are going to recover. But this hope might be delusional. If Bounty and Solaris would go on an insane bull run, I still would be way in the red. Anyone with me? What are your biggest losses, percentage-wise? 
1	1526915231	18	Poor lad the shills got him 
2	1526915406	5	Very true, I have the 100% reddit-shilled portfolio. Luckily, I had some common sense and kept some BTC, LTC and ETH - which no one here seems to like. This rescued me. I learned the hard way, to do the exact opposite of what is told on here. ;)
3	1526916478	1	Glad you’re taking it in stride. Good luck! 
3	1526916557	1	Lesson#1: don't buy shilled coins because it's just the shillers trying to pump and dump on you. We've all been there.
1	1526918735	5	Not sure abt other coins, but Lend & Nano should get u out of the mess in some time. HODL them till EOY, if u are not in urgency on ur investment. 
2	1526928270	1	Hope you're right on nano...
1	1526924803	2	I know you probably don't want to hear this but I think the only coin out of those that will make it back into the green is NANO.  Might want to think about cutting your losses on some of the others and find a newer, more promising coin.  A couple newer projects that I personally like the potential of are Holochain (HOT) and Zebi (ZCO).  Full disclosure, I am invested in both of these (about 5% in each).  
1	1526916792	2	When you buy shit, you got to sleep with shit. That is one hell of a shill portfolio
1	1526914901	2	You took investment advice from a bunch of teenagers on reddit.  What did you expect?  All of those coins will be dead in two months.  You lost everything.
2	1526917604	2	I took my profits of NANO and am currently not invested in it. But I'm certain it will _still_ be used as a form of currency. It might not gain over +20% in a short time without the massive bullrun of 2018 (copyright) but who expects this from a currency. Why should I pay with BTC or ETH for my cappuccino if there is NANO. (I do not own any spare for such stuff thats why I no longer have NANO)
2	1526915024	2	I couldn't think of a worse portolio of coins.  Almost seems like he deliberately picked some of the worst coins out there.
3	1526915302	5	Explain? Whats wrong about them? Seriously. I never expected bounty to become a big player, but the idea is unique. For Nano I still have big hopes. Solaris, Modum and Lend are bad because of what? You guys posting "your coins are bad" don't help at all. Bullshit somewhere else or explain where the problem is from your point of view. 
1	1526915545	3	Lend and Nano are good though. Hold a year, you'll be good. 
1	1526920448	1	İ bought modum too. It has a real life use, dont worry it will be 10-12 This year. I am not sure about nano . Was holding till i decide developers stop working about it. I am on stratis now promising coin with working developers.
1	1526920564	1	Wow. 
1	1526923667	1	masternodes have saved my portfolio.  fuck these alt coins, sell them for a cheap masternode coin, rake in profits, and rebuy the alt coins if you really believe in the tech.
0	1526890300	10	So, about that SEC meeting. Was there ever meant to be one or did we all just fall for coordinated FUD?
1	1526896955	9	There was a private meeting between a couple of relevant government officials. This is what WSJ reported.Then somehow everyone thought the SEC was gunna have an official hearing and make a judgement that day.People have been screaming fake news and blaming WSJ but they weren't wrong, the crypto-sphere did it to themselves.
2	1526897678	1	Perfect example of the crypto hive mind overreacting to everything then. Thanks for clearing that up!
0	1526920883	4	PPI if you want free teslas
0	1526936097	4	It's so quiet here today.. where is everyone?
1	1526936682	1	Check PPI for action
1	1526936896	1	Everyone had to go back to work since their crypto investments are in the gutter.

1	1526927359	6	What other coins do you hold besides nano?
1	1526927233	2	How many times you going to post this? 
2	1526933893	2	As long as it keeps going down, I suppose?
0	1526903089	8	Man, Nano is struggling.  It is almost near 6000 SATs where that huge surge occurred couple of months ago.  I wouldn't be surprised if we saw something similar once (if) it hits 6000 SATs.  
1	1526904463	7	Every altcoin is just tracking (or magnifying) Bitcoin's movements.  Nano just fell a little as Bitcoin did. Nothing new.   Long term Nano is in an excellent position. Wallets, pruning, Ledge Nano support all expected soon. 
2	1526909598	3	I said this a month ago, but Nano is not a good hold right now unless you’re ok with holding for a few years. It has too many bagholders from January, so it’s going to pump less than other coins and fall farther when it falls. Sell them now and buy back more in a few months. 
3	1526912183	2	Also whoever that guy is dumping 10K+ a day theoretically for the next few months.
3	1526913882	1	Sounds reasonable. Adoption isn't going to skyrocket in the short term, either. 
1	1526912766	2	I thought Nano was my best investment, turned out to be the worst (so far). At this point I'm not even interested in dollar averaging it. I'm starting to think this one goes to 0.
0	1526906856	8	What's happening with WTC?
1	1526907343	1	Token swap this month I believe 
0	1526889793	49	Did someone else feel that Ven whitepaper was underwhelming? No mention of how they will scale, which is very important for a blockchain. No info on their privacy feature that is said to be rivaled by none according to Vechain. No info on the voting mechanism or how many nodes the Vechain foundation will hold. For a whitepaper in the works for so long they should be able to cover these points. Also there was a lot of trowing partner names around, and that is not needed at all in a whitepaper. I do think Vechain can be big with enterprises, just dont see how it will benefit common investors. I said it earlier in a post but if DNV GL have bought stake and authority node from Vechain foundation, will they ever need to buy Ven/Thor from the open marked? For the price of the most expensive node i would assume they should not need more THOR for transactions?
1	1526895560	23	The first post I've seen in a while with legitimate criticisms instead of the typical shitposts we've been seeing recently, i've upvoted so that this won't get drowned out...Scaling wouldn't be an issue for PoA (especially considering the fact that the nodes have to do a KYC check) since Vechain would simply ask every authority node owner to increase their computational capacity for rising tps demands. I do agree that the lack of data privacy information was glaring and I hope that they update that part in the future.The thing people also have to realize is that whitepapers are more of an abstraction of ideas or the project's philosophical groundwork. Some people have got it in their heads that they need to be written like scientific research papers, but don't realize that [different documents serve different roles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper). For instance, Ethereum's whitepaper written by Vitalik is also sparce on scientific details, but this is corroborated by Gavin Wood's ethereum yellow paper.
2	1526895567	5	**White paper**A white paper is an authoritative report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue and presents the issuing body's philosophy on the matter. It is meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision.The initial British term concerning a type of government-issued document has proliferated, taking a somewhat new meaning in business. In business, a white paper is closer to a form of marketing presentation, a tool meant to persuade customers and partners and promote a product or viewpoint.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

1	1526893828	6	I agree, so much unexplained. I'm no more convinced of this project after skimming through it. Parternships and master node formula breakdowns? This is your technical whitepaper? What a joke.

0	1526888082	3	is there any way to check how much i invested money in  binance  and to see which coins made the most profit?
1	1526888475	5	I don't think there is any automatic way to so that. You could look at the order/trade history and calculate yourself. 
1	1526893901	1	I exported binance history and imported it into an app (i wrote some script to parse it correctly) which shows profits per coin easily. You would need all history though, and i don't know how far back binance lets you export.
2	1526899030	1	3 months
1	1526897261	1	I haven't done it myself but I think you can use Delta to import your transaction history from Binance and the app does some stuff like you wanted.
0	1526898635	3	Currently correcting my huge May 1st alt coin spend. Trx and Wtc have both seen nice 10% increases which has allowed me to sell half my bags at break even (or there about). Hopefully they’ll drop down again and I can buy back in at a lower price. Buying at the top just sucks, every bullish moment just brings you back to even. 
1	1526901763	2	TRX will go down again. It's going +-12% for several month now. Shit start to be obvious... Before haters chime in, you can observe the same behaviour across different coins. Ven, icx, Eng and even lowcap projects are affected. Just that they go +-25%

0	1526914249	16	2018 is the year for crypto. They said. Awesome bull run incoming. They said. Wait for the Wall Street bonuses. They said. End of Chinese Year will bring lot of money. They said. Consensus will bring the bull back. They said.Fuck You all. I say.
1	1526914628	11	Yep.  I think we all need to remember that Bitcoin had this 'insane' bull run up to $1000\+ back in December 2013, and then the price dropped shortly after all the way down to the $200s a few months later.  Bitcoin didn't go back to it's all time high until Summer 2017, so, who knows, maybe we will be waiting a few years this time around as well.I know history isn't really much of an indicator, especially in an unknown market such as crypto, but I think we were all a bit too optimistic around Dec/Jan.
1	1526914626	5	I figured out how everyhting works: Do and expect the opposite of what is being told on Reddit. That's mostly what happens.
2	1526919140	1	Wait so buy shitcoins and sell PPI?

0	1526925659	10	Guys, I have further news from my sources.  With Memorial day coming, we are seeing a lot of investors pulling out of the market to pay for food, travel, gas, etc.  Once Memorial weekend is over, prices are more likely to stabilize.  Further proof of this is the fact that May 31 is National Macaroon Day and I think we will see a lot of coins Moon that day.  Guys, get ready, there will be a take off soon.   
1	1526925760	19	Once the firework vendor bonuses come in after 4th of July we can expect a huge bull run

2	1526926004	6	Just inquired about this with my sources and they confirm what is said above.

1	1526915811	7	short it next Sunday and let us know how it turns out
1	1526917253	1	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia
1	1526919624	1	Since the beginning of the year the frequency of the weekly low on a Sunday to Saturday basis is as follows:Sunday: 4, Monday: 4, Tuesday: 2, Wednesday: 1, Thursday: 2, Friday: 4, Saturday: 3. So, the weekend dip is kind of a thing because the weekly low is more likely to fall on Friday to Monday versus mid week.

2	1526918813	1	Pied Piper Coin -- a memecoin.
0	1526919482	2	Something I've been wondering is if I for example want to hide some money I go to Binance to buy a privacy coin, but wouldn't that information still be open for governments to see? That you had an X amount of money on Binance that just "disappeared". 
1	1526919734	2	You send money to exchange like Coinbase and buy BitcoinSend that Bitcoin to Binance and buy MoneroAt this point the transaction trail is lost ... because of MoneroSend the Monero to your walletreverse the transactions when you want to cash outWhat the government sees is:you transferred X amount of fiat to Coinbase where you bough Bitcoin and sent it to an address and that's itthen you receive some Bitcoin from an address which you cash outEdit: the government doesn;t know who sent the Bitcoin to your Coinbase 
2	1526920039	3	so the government can see everything they need to see to bust you for say,  tax evasion?just exactly what was gained by xfer to Monero?
3	1526920208	2	it is just like sending Bitcoin to purchase something (BTC sent from your wallet address to another address)and someone sending your Bitcoin (from another wallet address to your wallet address)
4	1526921026	1	Okay but you gonna have to buy the privacy coin on an exchange without ID identification right? 
5	1526922162	2	yes, easy, at least half a dozen to choose from
2	1526921441	1	but the US government would NOT care WHO sent you an asset,  just that SOMEONE sent you an asset,  and unless you can prove that it's not,  that asset will be taxed as a short term capital gain.  I just don't get privacy coins.  Unless you are a criminal?
3	1526922314	1	> unless you can prove that it's notyou can't prove due to the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin>I just don't get privacy coins. Unless you are a criminal?Cash transactions are private. Is everyone who pays for goods and services with cash a criminal?Edit:One’s right to privacy is viewed as the ability to keep aspects and tangents of life close to one’s self. George Orwell’s novel 1984 and James McTeigue’s film V for Vendetta illustrate the government’s abuse of power in respect to violating citizen’s privacy.
4	1526923193	1	If they went to the effort of making their cash invisible by paying a fee, and enduring a bit of a hassle while they applied the 'invisibility goo', and letting it dry,  I'd be suspicious that they were a criminal, I think.  
5	1526923498	1	Just because people want privacy, doesn't mean they have something to hide. People wanting privacy in their lives is not a crime, and yet people who are privacy advocates are treated like criminals."It's not that I have something to hide....I have nothing I want you to see."
6	1526928016	2	Yeah I recently watched Anon as well, good quote.
6	1526923868	1	I don't want anybody to see my shit either,  it's just that I don't really care if they do.  I mean,  I'm so used to the Internet knowing everything they do about me,  mostly through online purchases,  that it just doesn't seem like a big deal to me. But,  I'm just me,  apparently this privacy thing is really important to some.
7	1526924317	1	> it's just that I don't really care if they dothat's because you probably live in a country that doesn't use your "available data" against you.....yetThis attitude reminds me of a recent article:https://nypost.com/2018/04/07/why-millennials-will-learn-nothing-from-facebooks-privacy-crisis/Go watch the movie ANON and see if this world they're portraying is something you'd feel comfortable living in
4	1526923497	1	so,  a piece of fictional writing is the best thing you can think of to illustrate why we need a privacy coin?   I'm liking privacy coins less and less!never seen V for Vendetta
5	1526923821	1	perhaps growing up in a post-internet world you can't appreciate why there is a need for privacy and maybe you'll never understand
6	1526924717	1	you mean pre-internet?  I  grew up in the 60's and 70'sBut I've been programming computers for almost 40 years,  my first internet connected work computer was in 1991.  I watched double click being pitched as an investment at IdeaLabs in Pasadena,  I've been around.
0	1526920846	2	Classic consolidation of alts into BTC before an eventual BTC dip. It’s almost too predictable. 
0	1526921492	2	Fuck... here we go again 
0	1526920080	5	Man, almost feel like I should jump on Nano right now.  It has gone near the dreaded 6000 SATs mark.  I remember last time what happened when it hit 6000 SATs.  
1	1526921309	3	What happened? 
2	1526923917	1	it doubled. But that doesn't mean it will happen again. EDIT: If anyone wants to invest in NANO longer term (days, weeks, months) now might be the time for it. RSI doesnt lie
3	1526928233	1	I've been holding XRB/nano for 7 months and I'm down $900. When does it get better? :)
4	1526930442	1	It should stop dropping/slow down soon and then pump again 
0	1526923060	6	I've been seeing this theory a lot lately that whales pumping BTC to 12k would trigger a FOMO cascade, possibly past the ATH. If that theory is reasonable, then why might we not have seen that big whale pump yet? It could be that we just haven't seen the lowest support of BTC yet recently (6k anyone?) OR whales are waiting for something else to happen. If I were a whale (I'm decidedly not), I might want my favorite altcoin to be tee'd up for success before pumping a bunch of fiat into BTC. My hypothesis is that the next BTC run will be triggered by some big altcoin announcements - wallet releases, mainnet launches, Coinbase listing(s), which will tee up alts to be profitable in a bull run. 1. Whales give BTC a shot in the arm after some big alt news, 2. FOMO-ers pump BTC 3. Whales' favorite altcoins ride the rising tide for hugenormous gains 4. Profit
1	1526924214	3	I don't agree but I will upvote for your contribution.The reason I don't agree because I believe there are a lot of factors at play. People like to blame the whales for everything but there's so many reasons for things going on.Whales by definition are people with a lot of capital/holding lots of coins. They could be individual miners, privately wealthy individuals, consolidated mining groups, exchanges like bitfinex, developers with their fat wallets..etc..It's hard to coordinate all of them to do a a single thing..Now let's go to your second point. Big altcoin announcements. A wallet release shouldn't be considered impressive. Many coins already have wallets. Developing one and releasing it a year after your token came out seems pretty weak. Mainnet launches, also weak. Should be pumped short term but I don't consider it a success but a bare minimum any coin should have.Coinbase announcmenet would be pretty big for the tokens that are selected. But I doubt it'll affect the overall market much. To see an example, take a look at the "hack" of substratum twitter saying it's being added to coinbase. It only pumped substratum and nothing else.**TL:DR**-There's a lot of reasons that all pushing and tugging at price movements. Too hard to specify one. Most announcements are shit and not really newsworth but pumped to make some quick money.
2	1526924784	2	You make some really good points! To clarify, I didn't mean to portray "whales" as some shadowy puppetmaster cabal. It just seems like if these so-called whales truly have the impact on the market that people attribute to them, you'd think they'd (individually, not in a coordinated way) pump BTC as much as they can to try to trigger FOMO which would in turn cause their low-cap alts to moon. Maybe what we're really saying here is that individual whales don't really have as much influence over BTC trends as people think!
3	1526926213	1	I think you're right on that part. They want to make as much money as possible. So if they think pumping it will trigger FOMO yeah I could see that...But overall sentiment seems too low we need a bunch of whales to help start it and I don't know how to coordinate that. So I guess I should clarify I agree with your pumping part just not sure about how it's going to start. Who's going to light the fire? THe coinbase scenario is the most likely but I'm not sure it'll affect the overall market.. 
1	1526924449	3	"then why might we not have seen that big whale pump yet"No new money to support it.  Remember, in order for a pump to work, there has to be someone to BUY at the top.   Whatever the "event" is that triggers the next bull run, MUST also trigger a landslide of new money entering the market in order to support it.What will it be?  This year? Who knows...   I can pretty much guarantee there will be a run in May of 2020 when the next BTC reward halving happens.  Other than that, your guess is as good as mine.

1	1526924352	6	What are you talking about? The top 20 being down an average of 3.5% is not a dip. You’re probably just a fud bot. 
1	1526925483	3	Last time the hourly rsi was here btc was 8k, this next leg up should retest 8850 btc.
1	1526928090	1	My alts are up.
0	1526928751	4	Did you guys notice how scared longs are to hold anything more than 2 days? Very bullish sign, there's still alot of anger and also underlying loathing/depressionAll good news is ignored.on the bubble chart we are at the depression area at this point
1	1526928914	6	Well....there is a Lot of depression here
2	1526930208	1	no doubt my friend
1	1526930611	2	It is good indication, however I personally believe it takes significantly more time (perhaps a year?) until there is reasonable turn into clear bullish sentiment. I would think crypto market cap over that course will also decrease slowly as people lose hope, perhaps decreases somewhere between 150- 200B, I also hope I am wrong.
2	1526932119	2	Personally I think we're close to a different market entirely.  I think we're going to see major projects with real value blow up and become stable investments.  Also think the privacy coins will be dead in the water.  Anything that can pass the regulation test will have access to major traditional markets soon. 
3	1526932468	1	But I can’t see Monero not go up.
2	1526934882	1	the reason I'm so bullish is I am depressed and I know others areand I'm willing to wait. I see no compelling reason to sell into depression and loathing. in fact I see compelling reasons to be bullish for the price and risk/reward
1	1526930973	1	So many people failed to sell ATH in December and bash the sell button the second anything pumps
2	1526932372	1	You remember "First selloff" on graph ?   That's where majority of previous bag\-holders sell.  
0	1526911327	3	WAN has got way below I expected. Panic sell?
1	1526911615	2	At a loss? No.If you are going to panic sell, at least wait for your investment to break even again. Especially one that has a new wallet coming out in June.
0	1526920830	4	I don't want to FUD but if I were to guess, I think this thing drops more.   Why?  Well, I am very pessimistic that the alts are dropping so much collectivley when BTC is not down too much on the daily.  This suggests to me that the "smart" money knows that right now is not the time to invest in alts and thus it might be indicating that there will be further drops in the short future.  Again, I don't mean to FUD but I am just going by the current prices. Thoughts? 
1	1526922239	1	if you really want to see something interesting regarding this,  you can do it with a little simple programming,  and the crtyptowatch API and an excel spreadsheet.   plot 3 lines,  BTC,  ETH,  and an aggregate of the top 20 ERC tokens,  be able to do this for any date range.  find dates where you feel 'alts were killing it'  ,  or 'BTC was killing it'plot the three lines for these dates ,  BUT add a week at the beginning AND end
0	1526928119	4	My portfolio is BUMMIN' from buying nano at a high price...
1	1526928674	8	Did you buy it when it was $36? That was a high fucking price.
2	1526930046	5	Average price is $17. I did a lot of silly stuff when I started in mid November..
1	1526929843	3	Mine too brother. I even bought more yesterday to dca. Not a good decision from my part. Oh well, lets hope for some good news 
2	1526930073	1	I know I should be buying now.. but I don't want to spend another dollar on crypto :)

1	1526925979	9	That's the wrong direction though.
2	1526926675	1	Or the right one of you're trying to buy like me but can't because im from the us. 
3	1526926725	1	Proxies are a thing.
4	1526926761	1	Im not savvy enough..
5	1526926912	5	There's a browser called Opera that has a buildin VPN, free to use. It's probably the easiest way to use a VPN if you don't want to pay for one.
6	1526927370	1	Has anybody tried buying on huobi with this method?
7	1526928323	1	I use Opera and it didn’t work for me, still says unavailable for US citizens. I might need to tweak my settings but haven’t tried anything yet. 
1	1526926438	2	Since huobi closed registration for US citizens, is there no way to buy ELA?
2	1526926651	3	Not unless you have an older (pre-march) huobi account. 7 exchanges have"signed on" so the train should be making a stop to America soon.
2	1526926646	2	Im so pissed I can't get it. What's that other exchange it's on?
3	1526927000	2	If you’re an American, none 
4	1526927485	2	Damn man. That's fucking annoying. A project as big as that and it's only on 1 exchange. 
5	1526931749	1	Yep.  Im an american and luckily signed up for a Huobi account about 6 months ago so apparently I am good to continue trading on there. Am still paranoid Ill be locked out at any time so I move any assets off there as soon as i buy them...
6	1526931822	1	Right. Well.. I'll send u about 5 eth and buy some ela for me
7	1526933786	2	Sounds good!  I can also hold them for you in my ELA wallet...Ya know just to keep them safe and all....

0	1526884995	2	Looks like the Mainnet Hype Is on
0	1526917711	4	Starting to think we might be stuck around 10k for the entire 2018... :/Not breaking any ATH at this pace lol
1	1526919135	6	I think we move in the sub $10k area until early November and see low $16k in December. New ATH will be April 2019.
1	1526917803	3	large price movements have a habit of occurring when you least expect them (both up and down)
2	1526918878	2	We are soon in month number 6 and have yet to see any big regain moves though. Hard to even anticipate any further development 
1	1526917818	1	Indeed we will...unless there is actual mass adoption, but this certainly doesn't happen within 6 months.The market right now is pure speculation, it doesn't reflect the actual value of the projects. Do people really think a vaporwave shitcoin like TRON is worth 5.2 billion dollars just because it has a working website?

0	1526932563	1	If you already have a US Huobi account can you buy ELA with no problems? 
1	1526933941	1	Yes. Just bought some two days ago. But i think they stopped new registrations for any US people a couple months ago.

1	1526917546	6	RLC
1	1526917800	6	SHL of course 
1	1526917222	2	ENJ
1	1526918230	2	With $25 your best bet is SHL, more risk but much higher possible reward. 
1	1526915835	2	Put it in VEN, thank me later 
1	1526920459	1	Easily Hydro.

0	1526925017	1	With more and more exchanges suddenly implementing KYC and halting withdrawals as a result. I am getting scared the exchange I'm using will do KYC. I'm under 18 so I won't be able to verify... Smh
1	1526925143	7	Get your stuff on a ledger
1	1526925262	7	Take it off the exchange and trade on decentralized exchanges like IDEX
0	1526903561	1	So REQ tokens value goes up as tokens get burned with network usage spurring demand.  - 1 Billion REQ tokens- 9, that's right a whole 9 were burned in Mayhttp://reqtokenburn.com/Unless we're in a crazy bull market where every shitcoin goes 100 x times, it'll take a few million years for this to reach $10.  Noobs literally got scammed into buying REQ.
1	1526904488	18	What fucking retard expects REQ to go to $10?It could quite easily hit $1, as it did in the last stupendous bullrun and that's an easy 5x for most buyers. 
2	1526908210	9	^^^or ^^^breaking ^^^even ^^^for ^^^some...
1	1526904425	10	That's great and all, but let us know how bad the token burn is doing when... REQ has a finished product.Oh wait, just like 95% of the other tokens out there, almost every token doesn't have a working product.
1	1526907530	6	Give it some time, their product just launched on mainnet. Therefore it's ahead of at least 99% of the coins/tokens in this space.
1	1526915478	2	They got REQD
1	1526911984	1	There are only a couple transactions a day right now, why are you surprised?
0	1526898899	1	Market cap up around 7% since Friday apparently but not explosive in rate - early indication of further rises or another few weeks of downtrend? 
1	1526910764	2	Yep. Either one or the other, I’d wager. 
2	1526913718	1	Ah. Okay. So it could go up, but there's a possibility that it might go down (maybe even stay the same). This is food for thought 
2	1526920545	1	Turns out; down
0	1526912349	1	People who invested in a coin that turned out to be a scam, how much money did you lose? Also people who chased a pump, how much did you lose?
1	1526912476	3	You are asking about 95% of people's investments.
1	1526912615	4	Back when I first got in and didn't know what I was doing, I saw Verge pumping and went all in. I realized I didn't know how to properly set a stop loss and tried to get out. Within minutes while I was trying to get out, the price started tanking hard (like 5%-8% within a few minutes) and I panic sold.So my first crypto memory is losing hundreds of dollars.

2	1526921182	1	Dude.. That's so petty...I just want ela in my life.
3	1526923402	1	I just looked it up...you're right. It's only on one exchange wtf...I heard lots of good things about it. (there's one other exchange it's on but I've never even heard of it so it's sketch).

0	1526932041	1	What do you guys think about Insights Network (INSTAR)? 
1	1526933238	3	We have no insight!
0	1526932961	1	I see talk about evaluating a coin based off of fundamentals.  I see no fundamental frame work for coins to be evaluated against.  A whitepaper, team, re-brand and all the other random news?  Those are not fundamentals. Fundamentals would be: P/E Ration, Debt/Equity, Free Cash Flow.  Things that don't exist in a crypto word.    
1	1526933159	1	Maybe the fundamentals are different for the cryptospace. Its a whole new ball game and the fundamentals will take time to develop. This a market but its not the stock market. 
2	1526933360	1	Sure, but the things I mentioned are subjective.  We need something quantitative. Like for instance, network speed.  
3	1526936363	1	Agree but the problem is only handful of coins have networks that are running. I think the number of transactions these coins have per min/hour/day is going to be a huge deal. Another issue is even if a coin has a successful working platform the network speed still is a tough bar of measure bc the more transactions the greater the pressure/need to scale. Basically the subject of fundamentals is what we have to judge a coin on until adoption happens. Then we can get more technical with the Fundamentals.
